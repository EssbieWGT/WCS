(Photo courtesy of Gov. Kim Reynolds' office)A federal bill introduced Wednesday by U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst would strengthen the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s role in a program that restores vegetation and wetland structure, in an effort to mitigate flooding and improve water quality. 
Known as the “Restoring America’s Floodplains Act,” the bill would simplify language pertaining to the Emergency Watershed Protection program and “make clear” the USDA can provide technical and financial assistance to landowners when land is damaged or threatened by flooding. 
The Emergency Watershed Protection program allows landowners to enter into an easement agreement with USDA to help restore portions of land damaged by flooding, or other circumstances. The program was authorized by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1978, and amended in a 1996 law.

The program gives USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, or NRCS, the ability to enter easement agreements with landowners so it has the “full authority” to restore a damaged floodplain area with actions to correct drainage, establish vegetative covers or reinstate the hydraulic capacity of wetland structure. 
According to a 2022 USDA report on the Emergency Watershed Protection program,  NRCS has purchased permanent floodplain easements on 184,254 acres, across 36 states, including Ernst’s home state of Iowa. 
The bill simplifies some of the language pertaining to the program and gives the Secretary of Agriculture the “sole discretion” to enter  compatible-use agreements with landowners and other organizations on easements acquired under the program.
Flooding frequently impacts cropland and communities in Iowa. Ernst, as a former member of the Iowa Army National Guard, recalled serving during the historic 2008 flood that impacted eastern portions of the state. 
“I’ve seen firsthand the devastating impacts flooding can have on our communities in Iowa, and my heart goes out to all those who have been impacted by destructive natural disasters,” Ernst said in a statement. “I’m proud to be working on a bipartisan solution to proactively reduce these impacts, that will use existing tools at no additional cost to taxpayers while also improving water quality and protecting our valuable land.”
The legislation is also sponsored by U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo. and is supported by several Iowa conservation programs in Iowa. 
Amber Markham, the director of external affairs for The Nature Conservancy in Iowa, said nature is the best solution to control flooding. 
“Nature-based solutions like floodplain restorations provide countless benefits to Iowans and we support legislation that advances these goals,” Markham said in a statement. 
Chris Fox, the policy chair for Iowa Ducks Unlimited, said floodplain easements are a “perfect example” of natural, incentive-based tools that “benefit people, our communities, and wildlife.” 
The Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation also supported the bill, with the organization’s public policy director and council, Anna Gray, saying it will provide producers with “critical relief” while facing flooding disasters and have “cascading benefits” for Iowa. 
“The Restoring America’s Floodplains Act is a real opportunity for farmers and landowners working to restore impacted floodplains and enhance stewardship of vulnerable landscapes to provide wildlife habitat, flood mitigation, and cleaner water,” Gray said in a release.

Deanna Gordon, R-Richmond, is running for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by Republican Andy Barr. (LRC Public Information) State Rep. Deanna Gordon, R-Richmond, is running for the U.S. House seat currently occupied by Republican Andy Barr.
On her campaign website, Gordon touts her support of President Donald Trump on a variety of issues, including immigration, guns and energy. 
Gordon is the fourth candidate to enter the closely-watched race in Central Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District. The seat became open when Barr decided to run for U.S. Senate to succeed Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell who is not seeking reelection.
Other candidates for the U.S. House seat are Democrats David Kloiber and former state Rep. Cherlynn Stevenson, both of Lexington, and Republican state Rep. Ryan Dotson, of Winchester.
Dr. Ralph Alvarado, the 2019 running mate of former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, announced in a social media post this week that he is considering a run after Republican state Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, of Lexington, said she will not be seeking the seat. Alvarado served in the Kentucky Senate, representing Clark and parts of Fayette and Montgomery counties.
Gordon has served in the Kentucky House since 2019. 
“Central Kentucky isn’t looking for a puppet or the next in line – they want someone who understands real-world problems and fixes them, not kicks the can down the road while being more concerned about the consequences of the next election,” Gordon’s campaign site says.

(Photo by Oleg Albinsky/Getty images)The fate of short-term rentals on the small, wealthy island of Nantucket is, for now, treading water.
For an island that booms from around 14,000 to over 80,000 residents between the off-season and the so-called “high season,” vacation rentals are an existential issue. Though the rentals are essential to the regional economy, their length and location are also deeply polarizing, setting up clashes between local voters, zoning officials, and the courts that offer a warning to communities grappling with similar debates around the region.
Nantucket, like its Cape and Islands neighbors, sits at the intersection of a few characteristics. It’s an historic region with strict rules around what can be built and where. It’s a summer retreat that attracts beachgoers from around the country. And it’s what’s known in Massachusetts as a “seasonal community,” with about 60% of its units in seasonal, recreational, or part-time use.
This sets up a constant clash between those who benefit and profit from the surging rental and vacation home industry and those who argue that year-round residents are being asked to shoulder a boom they didn’t sign up for.
The town is appealing a June ruling from the Massachusetts Land Court that the Nantucket Zoning Board was incorrect when it determined that a property in downtown Nantucket was allowed as a short-term vacation rental under the town’s zoning code. It is the latest turn in a years-long dispute over the rental property, where one neighbor sued another for operating short-term rentals, during which Town Meeting voters have thrown up their hands at several warrant articles over the past years that would clarify the island’s zoning law on short-term rentals.
This spring, Town Meeting voters on the island rejected four different articles related to vacation rentals. Though a majority of voters signed on to one of the articles – a citizen’s petition article that would allow short-term rentals in all residential zoning districts, it did not reach the two-thirds threshold needed to become local zoning law.
Other articles that would restrict the use of properties as short term rentals, require the owners to occupy the parcels for a certain portion of the year, collect data on and restrict the number of short-term rentals, also missed the threshold.
“Tonight brings us to another showdown between two very different visions of a small island facing a very challenging future,” said island resident Charity Benz at the Town Meeting, in which only registered Nantucket voters may vote. Those who supported the citizen’s petition “are obsessed with monetizing Nantucket,” Benz said. “However, those who have seen the impact of the transaction economy on Nantucket over the years have a very different perspective. Too much more of everything is simply unsustainable for the island itself and for the taxpayers who are being asked to subsidize its further exploitation.”
The transaction economy Benz referenced is a cycle in which lots are purchased, homes enlarged or built, and those houses then sold off or kept for part-time or rental use. Bigger and bigger homes require more and more of a draw on resources, while public employees find it harder to stay on the island where they work.
As voters shrugged off attempts to codify short-term rental policy over the years, the matter has swirled through the state land court.
In the series of lawsuits brought by a resident challenging a neighboring property’s right to operate as a short-term rental and the town’s decision to allow it, judge Michael Vhay has consistently decreed that short-term rentals of “primary dwellings” are not explicitly allowed under Nantucket’s zoning bylaw unless they are “accessory” uses.
In this specific case, he ruled, the use is not allowed even though town government has long behaved as though short-term rentals are acceptable, and he directed the town to enforce the bylaw as he interpreted it.
The town has filed a motion to stay part of Vhay’s June 6 judgment pending appeal, arguing that this would be extremely disruptive and unusual, because the town has never wielded zoning power against a short-tern rental before and officials believe the use is allowed under local law.
As Town Meeting warrant efforts stutter and the court case plods along, the island is set to find a few new housing arrows in its quiver this fall.
State-designated seasonal communities like Nantucket will have access, under last year’s sweeping housing bond bill, to a set of tools including year-round housing occupancy restrictions, artist and public employee housing, and allowing tiny homes to be built by-right and used as year-round housing.
A dedicated Seasonal Communities Advisory Council, made up of representatives and stakeholders from vacation-home-rich communities around the state, announced in May recommendations for the state housing office to refine the toolkit. The next virtual engagement session on the regulations is scheduled for Wednesday, July 9.
Among the recommendations are how best to consider the amount of part-time and vacation units, as well as the income disparities between area income and area home sale price. Other recommendations are aimed at easing a core part of the seasonal communities requirements: allowing construction on smaller lots than typically allowed by current zoning.
These new seasonal communities requirements won’t be washing up on Cape and Islands shores this season – final regulations are expected to be finalized around September – but the task force is recommending a “use it or lose it” approach to the new tools. If communities don’t implement new requirements like adopting bylaws to allow for undersized lot construction within two years, they say, the state should withdraw its toolkit.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Nearly three weeks after Broadacres Market abruptly shut down, it’s unclear how long the closure will last, leaving hundreds of vendors without a source of income and desperate for answers.
Word of mouth brought several vendors to the Centroid Christiana El Shaddai, a church in North Las Vegas, where a private community discussion led by Congressman Steven Horsford Tuesday was scheduled for a select few.
The Tuesday event was promptly moved to another location after increased public interest attracted media and more vendors than anticipated to the church. The move left several vendors who expected to hear from lawmakers without a clear explanation about the change in venue.
“The meeting was always intended to be an intimate conversation to allow participants to speak freely about their concerns,” said a spokesperson from Horsford’s office.
“The event drew significant public interest – more than anticipated. Out of concerns for safety, and to ensure an honest conversation, Rep. Horsford’s office moved the meeting to a setting that allowed for the intimate conversation to proceed as planned,” the spokesperson continued.
Horsford’s office said they are now organizing “a public-facing community-wide event” to address the closure and work towards a solution after Tuesday’s event drew strong interest. 
But the sudden venue change and the ongoing closure have left many vendors without answers or support.
Vendors like Maria Flores, who sells religious items at the open-air market, said she feels abandoned by Broadacres management and lawmakers after a lack of clear communication.
”I feel a little frustrated because I don’t see anyone with answers coming out,” said Flores in her native Spanish. “Today was canceled, and we don’t know why it was canceled.”
Flores said when she heard about Tuesday’s community discussion she was hopeful the event would provide more information on the closure of Broadacres, including when vendors could expect to return. Without a clear return date, she’ll be forced to look for other work in order to cover her expenses.
”There’s a lot of us vendors, and we’re all distressed,” she said. 
Flores, who has been selling goods at Broadacres for about 20 years, said management and local lawmakers could do more to support vendors impacted by the market’s closure. 
Broadacres Marketplace is the largest open-air market in Nevada, attracting more than 15,000 people every weekend. It houses a variety of vendors, particularly those catering to the Latino population. 
The collective number of people working as and for vendors also effectively makes Broadacres one of the largest employers in the City of North Las Vegas, according to data from the Nevada Department of Employment, Training & Rehabilitation.
The open-air market has been closed since June 21, when the market told vendors by managers to close their shops until further notice due to concerns over potential immigration raids. The closure left hundreds of vendors and employees with a significant loss of income, and no set date for a return.
The market said the decision was made “out of an abundance of caution and concern” for its vendors, customers, and staff.
“We don’t want any of our customers, vendors, or employees to be detained at our business or for us to be a beacon of shopping and entertainment while our federal government is raiding businesses and detaining its people,” the Broadacres Marketplace Management team wrote on social media.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/BAM-1-1024x686.png,,,2025-07-09 11:07:18.090855

(Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay










For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
Another federal judge orders AmeriCorps to reinstate workers, restore funds

“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

One less-known, missing part of many of these communities is legal representation, Peters said, which leaves people without recourse to handle problems of that nature or even the knowledge of when a lawyer is needed.
Peters, joined by two ISU students and future lawyers, conducted a study into lawyer shortages across the U.S. to identify where there is most need and go over practiced and possible solutions to ensure even those living in remote areas have access to the legal help they need.
“Not having enough lawyers puts rural people at a disadvantage because the legal system only really works if you have a lawyer that can either assert your rights or (provide) a mechanism to seek redress,” Peters said.
Emma Bartling graduated from ISU in the spring with a degree in agricultural and rural policy studies, and has enrolled in the University of South Dakota for law school with hopes of returning her home turf in Hardin County to practice. Emily Meyer still has one year of school left before graduation, but Bartling said both of them hope to return to rural areas to practice when they’re ready.

With this in mind, Bartling said she and Meyer got involved in the study to further their understanding of what they were getting into and why others weren’t following their path.
“To us, it was just an opportunity to better our learning and to kind of open a door that we would be going into, but just a little bit sooner,” Bartling said.
Peters was researching population decline in small towns when he came across the lack of private-practice attorneys, even in county seats where many residents go for their health care needs and other services they can’t find in their area.
Rather than just looking at the total population of counties and comparing it to the number of lawyers practicing there, Peters said they used 2022 Census data to find out how many private-practice attorneys are located in each county and held it up to estimated demand for their services. These numbers helped determine if a legal desert exists in a given county and how severe it is.
Looking at more than 2,300 counties across the U.S., the study found that 11% of rural counties are critical legal deserts, with the largest gap between lawyer supply and demand for their services.
One example Peters gave was of Lee County — Iowa’s only county listed as a critical legal desert — where he said around 30 lawyers are practicing. Based on the county’s town populations, employers and other factors, the researchers found the county should have closer to 55 lawyers. Lee County is a “micropolitan county,” Peters said, as it has at least one town of between 10,000 and 50,000 people.
The majority of Iowa counties in the study were classified as having average levels of lawyers or higher, according to the study, with 10 counties identified as having emerging legal deserts. Most of these cases are in southern Iowa, Peters said, where farmland is less expensive and areas are more impoverished.

Bartling said that many counties with legal deserts are clustered together, so those looking for a lawyer might need to travel even farther. This could be especially scary and difficult to deal with for those experiencing domestic violence and the like.
“If those micropolitans, even, don’t have enough lawyers, then that just puts rural counties adjacent to that micropolitan (at an) even bigger disadvantage,” Peters said.
It surprised Peters to learn this, he said, and another shock came when the team learned pay for lawyers in rural areas was fairly similar no matter whether they were practicing in a legal desert or not, and the real pay gap is between urban and rural practices. This shows that using financial incentives to move lawyers into rural markets wouldn’t be very effective, he said.
Bartling and Meyer also looked into existing policy to try and solve this problem and identified their own solution.
 Finding solutions to fill the gap

Legal work is not the first thing people think of when they think of industry workforce shortages, Peters said, and in reality it is quite different from what is being experienced in the fields of health care and manufacturing, among others. There are surpluses of lawyers in some urban areas, and there is no federal push to address the issue.
South Dakota has seen success from a rural attorney recruitment program, Bartling said, which lets law students practice in rural counties before they have completed their schooling. The program has seen success, she said, but it won’t fit in every situation, just like other initiatives the team reviewed, like mobile legal clinics and external fellowship programs.
One program they identified as viable is a licensed legal paraprofessional program, Bartling said, where the state would allow those with legal training but not a full degree to practice independently in certain areas, like family law.
It would allow people from rural communities who have some legal training but another profession to fill a need without having to leave for years to get the highest licensure, and still be able to complete their other work when legal help isn’t needed, Peters said.
“I think it’s definitely up to states discretion how they want to implement it, but we saw that that would probably have the most impact, direct impact to the rural community members,” Bartling said.

ChristianaCare and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) announced a new strategic affiliation on Tuesday that aims to expand access to specialized pediatric care across Delaware and neighboring communities.
The collaboration, set to begin in spring 2026, will bring CHOP’s nationally renowned expertise in children’s health to ChristianaCare’s existing network, enhancing access to advanced treatments in Delaware, Maryland, southeastern Pennsylvania, and southern New Jersey. By integrating services, the partnership will improve care delivery and reduce the need for families to travel long distances for complex pediatric treatment.
“This collaboration brings together two amazing organizations that are already nationally recognized for clinical excellence — and we’re going to be even better together,” said Janice E. Nevin, M.D., MPH, president and CEO of ChristianaCare.
“Our affiliation with CHOP marks a bold step forward in our mission to provide the highest quality care to children and families across the communities we serve,” Nevin continued. “These are uncertain times for many parents with young children in need of routine or complex medical care. ChristianaCare and CHOP are joining forces to provide world-class care, close to home, at a time when it’s needed most.”

The wealthy enclave of Nantucket is, like its neighbors on the Cape, trying to chart a path forward as a community torn between the rental economy and a housing crunch. 
The post A stormy season for short-term rentals on Nantucket appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE FATE short-term rentals on the small, wealthy island of Nantucket is, for now, treading water. 
For an island that booms from around 14,000 to over 80,000 residents between the off-season and the so-called “high season,” vacation rentals are an existential issue. Though the rentals are essential to the regional economy, their length and location are also deeply polarizing, setting up clashes between local voters, zoning officials, and the courts that offer a warning to communities grappling with similar debates around the region. 
Nantucket, like its Cape and Islands neighbors, sits at the intersection of a few characteristics. It’s an historic region with strict rules around what can be built and where. It’s a summer retreat that attracts beachgoers from around the country. And it’s what’s known in Massachusetts as a “seasonal community,” with about 60 percent of its units in seasonal, recreational, or part-time use.  
This sets up a constant clash between those who benefit and profit from the surging rental and vacation home industry and those who argue that year-round residents are being asked to shoulder a boom they didn’t sign up for. 
The town is appealing a June ruling from the Massachusetts Land Court that the Nantucket Zoning Board was incorrect when it determined that a property in downtown Nantucket was allowed as a short-term vacation rental under the town’s zoning code. It is the latest turn in a years-long dispute over the rental property, where one neighbor sued another for operating short-term rentals, during which Town Meeting voters have thrown up their hands at several warrant articles over the past years that would clarify the island’s zoning law on short-term rentals.
This spring, Town Meeting voters on the island rejected four different articles related to vacation rentals. Though a majority of voters signed on to one of the articles – a citizen’s petition article that would allow short-term rentals in all residential zoning districts, it did not reach the two-thirds threshold needed to become local zoning law. 
Other articles that would restrict the use of properties as short term rentals, require the owners to occupy the parcels for a certain portion of the year, collect data on and restrict the number of short-term rentals, also missed the threshold. 
“Tonight brings us to another showdown between two very different visions of a small island facing a very challenging future,” said island resident Charity Benz at the Town Meeting, in which only registered Nantucket voters may vote. Those who supported the citizen’s petition “are obsessed with monetizing Nantucket,” Benz said. “However, those who have seen the impact of the transaction economy on Nantucket over the years have a very different perspective. Too much more of everything is simply unsustainable for the island itself and for the taxpayers who are being asked to subsidize its further exploitation.” 
The transaction economy Benz referenced is a cycle in which lots are purchased, homes enlarged or built, and those houses then sold off or kept for part-time or rental use. Bigger and bigger homes require more and more of a draw on resources, while public employees find it harder to stay on the island where they work. 
As voters shrugged off attempts to codify short-term rental policy over the years, the matter has swirled through the state land court.  
In the series of lawsuits brought by a resident challenging a neighboring property’s right to operate as a short-term rental and the town’s decision to allow it, judge Michael Vhay has consistently decreed that short-term rentals of “primary dwellings” are not explicitly allowed under Nantucket’s zoning bylaw unless they are “accessory” uses.  
In this specific case, he ruled, the use is not allowed even though town government has long behaved as though short-term rentals are acceptable, and he directed the town to enforce the bylaw as he interpreted it. 
The town has filed a motion to stay part of Vhay’s June 6 judgment pending appeal, arguing that this would be extremely disruptive and unusual, because the town has never wielded zoning power against a short-tern rental before and officials believe the use is allowed under local law. 
As Town Meeting warrant efforts stutter and the court case plods along, the island is set to find a few new housing arrows in its quiver this fall.  
State-designated seasonal communities like Nantucket will have access, under last year’s sweeping housing bond bill, to a set of tools including year-round housing occupancy restrictions, artist and public employee housing, and allowing tiny homes to be built by-right and used as year-round housing.  
A dedicated Seasonal Communities Advisory Council, made up of representatives and stakeholders from vacation-home-rich communities around the state, announced in May recommendations for the state housing office to refine the toolkit. The next virtual engagement session on the regulations is scheduled for Wednesday, July 9. 
Among the recommendations are how best to consider the amount of part-time and vacation units, as well as the income disparities between area income and area home sale price. Other recommendations are aimed at easing a core part of the seasonal communities requirements: allowing construction on smaller lots than typically allowed by current zoning. 
These new seasonal communities requirements won’t be washing up on Cape and Islands shores this season – final regulations are expected to be finalized around September – but the task force is recommending a “use it or lose it” approach to the new tools. If communities don’t implement new requirements like adopting bylaws to allow for undersized lot construction within two years, they say, the state should withdraw its toolkit.

The third largest school district in Delaware has a new board president.
Monica Moriak was selected to replace Don Patton after a 4-3 vote secured her victory at the Christina School District board meeting Tuesday night.
This follows almost two years of controversy in the board, which included the removal of former Delaware Superintendent of the Year Don Shelton – who then filed a lawsuit against board members and the district, votes of no confidence for then-President Patton, meetings that lasted five+ hours into the hours of the following morning, accusations that Board Member Naveed Baqir lives outside the country and a subsequent removal request, and too many “point of orders” to count.\

The board also unanimously voted for Y. F. Lou be Moriak’s vice president.
The voting majority in the past couple years had been Moriak, Doug Manley, and Amy Trauth.
Pattton and Baqir voted for new board member Shannon Troncoso, who was in her first meeting since being elected in May.
Baqir is stepping down from the board July 15.
Moriak made it clear she’s trying to restore order to the board, vowing to do her best to follow Robert’s Rules – a longstanding practice of speaking orders and procedures – board policies, and putting student outcomes first.

MU Health Care confirmed Tuesday that it is reviewing a new offer from Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield that could restore insurance coverage to an estimated 90,000 Missourians.


The news comes a week after a state Senate hearing failed to result in any sort of agreement between the two actors. The initial deadline for negotiations was April 1, and three months later, efforts to finalize a deal are ongoing.


The newest confirmed offer, made by Anthem on Monday afternoon, follows two failed proposals made at the hearing last week. Neither side released details of the latest offer.
In an email, Anthem said, “During the recent public hearing, Anthem presented two distinct proposals to MU Health Care in an effort to resolve our contractual differences. In a private session following the hearing and again as recently as yesterday, we extended an additional offer aimed at moving toward a resolution.”

MU Health Care spokesperson Rochita Ghosh reiterated the desire for negotiations in a separate email: “Our goal remains to reach an agreement and return in-network access for Anthem members to MU Health Care clinicians and facilities.”


Confirmation of the new offer came as Sen. Cindy O’Laughlin, R-Shelbina, posted a call for action on Facebook, requesting a contract renewal by Thursday. While O’Laughlin, who leads the state Senate, acknowledged in the post that she has little say in the matter, she called Anthem’s proposed offer “reasonable.”


Without providing details, O’Laughlin said, “Anthem doubled their rate increase offer. They also will allow policy exceptions to remain in place (those exceptions allow MU to receive extra insurance coverage on services.) The Anthem proposal increase includes paying doctors more.”

As previously reported, patients with certain complex medical conditions such as pregnancy, cancer treatments or those who have recently undergone surgeries, may still temporarily receive in-network rates and are encouraged to call 573-771-CARE.


Patients who are ineligible to receive the in-network rates may have to pay more money out of pocket to see their current MU Health Care doctors and care team. Alternatively, these patients may need to find new in-network providers through other health systems.

At last week’s hearing, MU Health Care CEO Ric Ransom said the hospital system is seeing operating costs rising approximately 7% year after year.


He said that if the hospital system can acquire an increase in reimbursement from a contract made with Anthem, the money would mainly go toward maintaining clinical operations, including urgent care facilities, new clinics and pharmacies.


In response, Rich Novack, president of commercial markets at Elevance Health, Anthem’s parent company, said MU Health Care twice turned down Anthem offers to create a broader continuity-of-care plan.


Novack also accused MU Health Care of “patient abandonment,” which he said is when a provider refuses to see a patient that they used to see simply because of a change in coverage.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.
 

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”



For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland,  wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
 

“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

(Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Most members of the Kansas State Board of Education voted to increase their pay to equal state legislators, which was commonplace until legislators doubled their pay this year, leaving board members behind.
In a 9-1 vote on Tuesday, the board approved a request for around $126,000 beginning July 1, 2026, to fund the salaries of the 10 board members and make them commensurate with legislator pay.
The last time the board received a raise was nearly two decades ago.
A handful of board members viewed the raises as the right thing to do for future generations. Others were emboldened by the principle of the matter, emphasizing the equivalence of their public service to that of state legislators.
Beryl New, a former Topeka public school administrator and educator, said it was important to look beyond the current board members, many of whom said they didn’t need the pay.
“There are other people who may come on and take my seat who need to know that whatever they’re putting out is honored, appreciated and respected, just as a legislator is,” she said.
The Legislature created a commission that approved raises for lawmakers in 2024. Those raises went into effect in January. The current average annual legislator salary is $43,000, and lawmakers budgeted for an additional 4.4% increase next year. Before legislators raised their pay independently of the board, their salary rates were intertwined. They passed a law in April that permits the state board to set their compensation. It was attached to legislation requiring school districts to show videos in classes on human growth, development and sexuality that depict fetal development.  
Board members currently make $88.66 per day in addition to a subsistence allowance of $166 daily. The $126,000 members approved would bring them up to par with legislative pay, including the future 4.4% raise.
The Legislature’s rationale for pay increases was rooted in its standing as a citizen legislature, said Frank Harwood, deputy education commissioner. Lawmakers argued in 2024 that higher pay would attract more people to the job.
“The question is, does that same logic apply to the state board?” he asked the board.
It appeared it did.
Board members represent the equivalent of four state Senate districts, or around 270,000 people each, Harwood said.
Jim Porter, a longtime educator and administrator from Fredonia, said the board will soon need younger people who can occupy seats long term and offer different perspectives.
“I’m ambivalent when it comes to me, but I’m not ambivalent for the future,” he said.
Betty Arnold, a former state auditor from Wichita, agreed. Education often gets passed over, she said.
“It’s looking to the future. It’s increasing the field of people that could care about education but can’t afford to sit in these seats,” Arnold said.
The vote came at a time when the Kansas State Department of Education is reckoning with a smaller budget and higher costs. The budget crafted by the Legislature didn’t leave the department any wiggle room, so board members approved a slate of requests for budget enhancements. One was so the department could continue to pay rent in the state building it leases for employees.
The U.S. Department of Education is also holding $42.9 million of Kansas funds in limbo.
Debby Potter, a conservative board member from Great Plains, was the only member who voted against the raises. Earlier in the day’s meeting, she also voted to cut funds for teacher professional development.
“If I’m willing to cut professional development, I am willing to cut this,” she said.
Cathy Hopkins, board chair, said: “I am not.”
Hopkins said she lobbied the Legislature this year for board raises to no avail. Her decision was based on principle, she said.
Melanie Haas, an executive from Overland Park, mentioned an old comment from Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican who in 2022 called the board “monolithic” as the Legislature was approving a redrawn state education district map that favored more conservative candidates, according to reporting from the Kansas City Star.
To Porter, it boils down to a matter of respect.
He said Masterson’s 2022 comment was a direct insult to the board because it “didn’t do what the Senate president wanted them to do.”
The pay inequity is akin to disrespect toward the board and public education, Porter said.
“We need to be respected,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7080357-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-09 10:13:15.990994

Mike Dunleavy issued last month included millions of dollars proposed by the Legislature to bolster child care and early intervention services for children with disabilities or developmental delays.
Dunleavy vetoed a proposed $1.86 million in additional funding for child care grant programs and place-based and home-based child care centers, citing declining state revenues. The budget retains $5.87 million for those programs for next year. 
For early education and infant learning, the Legislature proposed a significant boost — $5.7 million more — for the state’s 17 programs that provide intervention services for families with children from infancy to 3 years old experiencing disabilities or developmental delays. Dunleavy rejected the increase, and allocated $10 million for the statewide programs. 
“Governor Dunleavy’s goal is for Alaska to be the best place in the country to raise a family,” said Grant Robinson, a deputy press secretary for the governor in an email on Monday responding to a request for comment. “The budgeting process requires the Governor to consider all line items in view of the State’s fiscal situation. The budget the Governor signed still provides more than $5.8 million of funding for childcare benefits. Given the State’s revenue outlook, the Governor made the difficult yet fiscally responsible decision to veto increasing and expanding infant learning programs.”
The governor vetoed more than $127 million from the Legislature’s proposed budget, including $50 million for public schools. In a prerecorded video released with the veto announcement in June, Dunleavy cited lower state revenues due to falling oil prices.
“Basically, we don’t have enough money to pay for all of our obligations. So as a result of that, you’re going to see some reductions in this year’s budget. It’s not an easy thing to do. It’s certainly not a fun thing to do, but it’s necessary,” he said.
Anchorage Republican Sen. Cathy Giessel, who also serves as the Senate majority leader, agreed that the state is facing fiscal challenges, but said child care and early education programs should be prioritized, as the Legislature had proposed.

“We had a balanced budget. It is true, it was very difficult to arrive at that balanced budget,” she said in a phone interview. “We searched all the couch cushions for one-time funding to fund this balanced budget, but we achieved it. The governor’s vetoes of these two critical services are just going to mean future costs, because these services were not provided for kids in their earliest development stages. So I was very disappointed.”
An estimated 1,800 Alaskan families are currently served each year by the state’s infant learning programs, funded by the state and federal Medicaid, at no cost to families. Children and families work with developmental specialists, and can receive speech, physical and occupational therapies. In addition, parents receive training and education on child development.
For example, in the Northwest Arctic region, an early learning and family program is administered by the Northwest Arctic Borough School District. It is based in Kotzebue and serves all the Northwest Arctic villages, as well as Point Hope in the North Slope Borough.
“We’re spread very thin,” said Tracey Schaeffer, one of the program’s three staff members. “And we definitely could use another staff person to help with traveling and seeing families and spending time in the villages.”
There is only one air carrier, Bering Air, serving the region, down from four companies operating a few years ago, she said, so with weather events and disruptions, it’s increasingly challenging. 
“We have to change reservations a lot because of the weather,” she said, estimating the total cost for travel and flights at up to $25,000 per year, plus significant time. “As it gets warmer, we have a lot more days that are not very safe to fly here.” 
Schaeffer said they work as much as possible by phone, but intervention services are very personal. “And all the while, you’re trying to kind of build a relationship with this family, because it’s a really intimate, sensitive situation when you’re working with a family who has a child that experienced, you know, something that wasn’t expected, a disability, or something, a medical issue, that has put their development at risk,” she said. 
The proposed state funding increase would have been welcome, she said. “That would have been a huge relief, because there’s a lot of pressure. I mean, (with) early intervention, three years is a short period of time, you know, and we lose so much time because of weather, flight cancellations or something,” she said. “So there’s a lot of pressure there. We’ve done this job for a long time, and we know the time goes fast, and we want to provide as much intervention as we can. And it’s just hard to do that.”
Schaeffer also runs a small child care center in Kotzebue, serving eight children, the first licensed provider to open in the community in over a decade. She said more local and state support is needed to address the lack of child care and rippling impacts for the community. “We lose people all the time because of a lack of child care. You know, we have educators or providers that come and they start a family, and then they realize, like, ‘Wow, I can’t find a child care provider,’ and we lose them because of that.”
Shaeffer and her daughter opened the child care center in 2023, a challenging process documented in a short film by Laura Norton-Cruz, a social worker, public health advocate and film producer. She and filmmaker Joshua Albeza Branstetter created a documentary film series focused on the challenges of child care and early education programs called the “Early Childhood in Alaska” series.

“Child care is just not a profitable business model. It’s an investment in child brain development and family well-being, and the economy,” Norton-Cruz said, emphasizing the need for increasing state and federal funding support. “Staffing is the majority of the costs. But also, if you run a home-based child care center, you have to pay your mortgage or you have to pay rent, you have to pay utilities: Those things cost money. And we need support from the government to be able to offer this essential service, to have a workforce, and to have children who are kindergarten ready.” 
In April, Anchorage’s largest child care provider, Bright Beginnings Early Learning Center, closed, displacing 125 children. Norton-Cruz said while some progress has been made, like raising awareness around Alaska’s child care crisis, families and providers are still struggling. 
“Others have cut back on hours or cut back on the number of rooms, or the number of kids they can take, in order to have this essential service for parents to be able to go to work, which we need them to do,” she said. “Because we have major workforce shortages, and parents need income to pay for, you know, rent and everything else, we have to do a better job of funding and supporting the sector.”
In 2023, Dunleavy launched a child care task force with the stated goal to develop a plan to improve availability and affordability of quality child care throughout Alaska. Norton-Cruz said the work of the task force was positive, and would like to see the governor put more state funding toward its recommendations.
“When we don’t have policy that supports child care and early childhood, we basically just rely on the unpaid labor of women,” Norton-Cruz said. “Whether that’s moms, or whether that’s grandmothers, or aunties, you can’t just say, ‘Oh, but grandmas and aunties can step in.’ That’s not policy. That relies on something that may not always be there for everyone, and isn’t fair. … People need to be able to make that choice, rather than have that choice made for them.”
Giessel also said there is a need for state funding for the governor’s own task force recommendations. She pointed to new state revenue measures that Dunleavy has opposed —like oil taxes — that leaders in the Alaska House multipartisan and Senate bipartisan majority caucuses want to pursue to bring in more state dollars. 
“First of all, we have a huge gap in our tax structure on our oil resources,” Giessel said, referring to the difference between taxes paid by traditional corporations and by those corporations that report their income through their owners, known as “S corporations.”
“The S corporations pay no corporate tax to the state,” Giessel said. “There is legislation that would institute a requirement for S corporations to pay a corporate tax to the state, conservatively estimated, that would be $100 million per year.”
A bill to tax these corporations is in the Senate Rules Committee.
“That would pay for a huge amount of these child care and early education funding requirements,” Giessel said.
“For him to say that these cuts are because of declining revenue and ignoring his responsibility in this, is just amazing to me,” Giessel added. 
The Legislature will meet for a special session on Aug. 2, when they will consider whether to override the budget vetoes.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-09 13:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Does a Confederate monument represent Brandon? Locals weigh in at town hall,Leonardo Bevilacqua and Lili Euzet,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/09/does-a-confederate-monument-represent-brandon-locals-weigh-in-at-town-hall/,Brandon residents voiced their opinions on whether to relocate a Confederate stutue from the city's center.,"BRANDON — Rankin County residents packed Brandon City Hall to discuss whether a Confederate statue belongs in the town center where a bulk of local traffic flows. But most took stances on whether it represents heritage or hate.
“It’s hatred,” Janie Mclaurin-Wheaton said at the meeting Monday. “You want to leave ‘that’ history, but you want to take mine out of the school? What about my history? I was born here, too.”
Mclaurin-Wheaton, who is Black, was a member of the first graduating class to integrate Brandon High School and was referring to a new law that seeks to restrict teachers from discussing “divisive”concepts like slavery and the causes of the Civil War. Her grandfather was the first Black man in Rankin County to own land and a car. She was one of the first Black women hired in the Rankin County Tax Assessor’s office, where she worked for 27 years.

She joined some 80 neighbors — Black and white–  with deep roots in the city and county to speak before the Brandon Board of Aldermen. Dozens crowded into chairs before the first speaker approached the podium at 6 p.m. City hall employees were forced to unfold extra chairs in the hallway when space ran out.
This discussion follows a June 16 meeting, during which Brandon city leaders approved a first step to assess the cost and logistics of relocating the 37-foot-tall statue of an unknown soldier built in 1907. Mayor Butch Lee cast the tie-breaking vote.
In an interview with WAPT, Lee said the statue is “in harm’s way.” He cited three cars that have recently struck it as well as a recent incident in which it was shot at.
Few locals cited the traffic concern as a top priority. Lee and the board drew condemnation from audience members who questioned why the decision wasn’t left to the voters. 
A favored candidate for the relocation is the Confederate part of the Brandon cemetery – a location some feel could hold and preserve the historical monument without glorifying a difficult part of American history.

“There could not be a more serene, more dignified place to address this history than Brandon’s cemetery,” said Lance Stevens, an attorney and 30-year Brandon resident.
Bettye Ward Fletcher, a Black Rankin County native, called for the city to move the statue she sees as a harmful symbol.
“It continues to be painful,” she said. “Your hometown continues to honor the men that fought to maintain you and your people in slavery.”
“I want something different for my grandkids,” said Will Sims, a Black U.S. Air Force veteran who expressed disappointment with seeing the monument still standing when he returned from years in the service.
However, for some residents, the monument and its history are nothing to be ashamed of.
Former longtime Rankin County Assistant District Attorney Dan Duggan pulled out a portrait of his great-great grandfather, a Confederate soldier, for the board to see. The fifth-generation Southerner said removing the monument would be a betrayal to the memory of his ancestors and other soldiers.
“This is a memorial to soldiers who left their homes to defend their country, the Confederate States of America, against an invading force,” said Mark Allen, a longtime resident of Rankin County and descendant of a Confederate soldier.
Brandon’s Confederate monument was erected across from the courthouse where Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman ordered his Union troops to stack their arms as a sign of military occupation of the town, according to the National Register of Historic Places.
In February 1864, Sherman largely burned Brandon as part of what modern historians call a practice run for his famous March to the Sea, in which he employed “total war” that burned and pillaged everything in his army’s path. 
“It’s a place that people could go to that’s maybe the only representation that they had of their relative who had never come home,” said Allen. 
However, some argued that the statue is a symbol of white power rather than a memorial to fallen ancestors. It was erected 42 years after the end of the Civil War, at a time when white Mississippians worked to ensure the marginalization of Black residents. In 1890, the Mississippi constitution enshrined the disenfranchisement of Black residents into law. By 1900, virtually no Black residents could vote despite constituting 59% of the population. 
John Toney, a local attorney, brought up that Brandon spent $3,000 – what would amount to $105,000  today – on the statue.
“They used these monuments to start a political and cultural dialogue,” Toney said. “On the north side of the statue is carved into the marble: state’s rights and home rule will rise again. That’s not a dog whistle, that’s a training whistle.”
“I doubt any Blacks voted in 1907 to spend taxpayer money on the statue,” said Toney.
Despite its complicated past, some claimed the historical monument should be preserved.
“It’s our history. Whether it’s bad or good, let’s not try to second guess it,” said Sharon Neely Egan, a white resident who opposes the removal of the statue. “I don’t think we need to erase Brandon’s history.”
Still, many feel that leaving a monument built as a homage to the Confederacy in one of Brandon’s busiest streets is siding with a skewed version of history, and disregarding the pain it evokes to Black residents.
“Our past is important, but there’s a difference between remembering and honoring,” said Brandon Middle School principal Trey Rein. “We have an opportunity here to make a statement that we are focused on our town’s future more than its past.”
The rain let up just after 7 p.m. as speakers and spectators exited city hall for their cars and homes. Mclaurin-Wheaton departed with some of her classmates from Brandon High School. They are still good friends today.
“I just see some people stuck in the past and don’t know how to move forward,” Mclaurin-Wheaton said. “That’s because mama told you, daddy told you, sister told you, but when you become of age, you got to learn to do the right thing for yourself.”
The next public discussion over this topic will be July 21 at Brandon City Hall.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08160604/IMG_2102-1.jpg,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

By 2029, eyeshadows, nail polishes and other cosmetics that shimmer and shine from plastic glitter could be banned in California.
In the latest push to curb the prevalence of microplastics in the environment, the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a first-in-the-nation bill that would ban the sale of personal care products that contain plastic glitter or plastic microbeads.
The proposal by Assemblymember Tasha Boerner would expand a 2015 state law that already bans microplastic beads in products that are intended to be immediately rinsed off, such as face washes and toothpastes. 
But the latest bill would apply to products that are left on — including lotions and makeup — as well as household products such as cleaners, detergents and paint. Companies add microbeads to these items to give them abrasive or exfoliating properties.
Research has found that microplastics — extremely small particles of plastic that do not break down easily in the environment — detected in the human body could be linked to cardiovascular disease and stroke, cancer, and neurological problems. 
Potentially harmful levels of so-called “forever chemicals” associated with plastics are found in California’s coastal waters and drinking water. State lawmakers recently banned sturdier single-use plastic bags, and attempted to ban the use of forever chemicals in synthetic turf.
This wouldn’t spell the end of California stores stocking glittering makeup, though. Some major cosmetic brands sell products that contain mica, a mineral that can lend makeup its shimmer. Though concerns have been raised about mica sourcing, some research has found that mica could serve as a naturally-occuring alternative to plastic glitter.

Boerner, a Solana Beach Democrat: “I’m all for glitter and glamor. But let it be safe and let it not harm our health. ”

The bill is now before the Senate’s appropriations committee. If passed, California manufacturers and retailers that make, distribute or sell these products would be fined up to $2,500 per day for each violation.

Newsom backtracks on return-to-office policy

As part of new labor agreements with some of California’s state workers unions, Gov. Gavin Newsom agreed to delay his return-to-office policy. But the move has raised certain doubts about the governor’s original intentions among some labor leaders and proponents of in-person work alike, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
In March the governor ordered state workers back to the office at least four days a week, starting July 1, saying that “in-person work makes us all stronger.” 
A few weeks before that policy was to take effect, however, the union representing state engineers struck a labor deal to pause that mandate for one year. Two other unions, including SEIU Local 1000, reached a deal to delay the order.
Anica Walls, SEIU Local 1000’s president, said the pause is “a direct result of our members fighting back.” But also that members considered Newsom’s about-face as having “more to do with politics and pressure than performance.”

CalFire chatbot not up to snuff?

A CalFire chatbot to help Californians access important fire prevention information and “near-real-time emergency information,” is stumbling at answering basic questions, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
When it debuted in May, the artificial intelligence-powered chatbot was intended to provide, among other things, resources on wildfire incidents and home hardening, according to Newsom’s office.
But two months after its launch, Malena found that the chatbot sometimes spits out different answers to questions that mean the same thing. It also doesn’t generate the most up-to-date wildfire information and is unable to provide information about evacuation orders.
CalFire says it’s working on improving the tool, but some experts say that not only should the kinks have been ironed out before the rollout, but that the public should have had more input too.
The chatbot is part of Newsom’s 2023 executive order to develop more AI tools to improve government efficiency. Other AI-powered tools in development for the state include ones related to highway congestion and tax preparation.

The move comes three years after CalMatters reported that only 3% of highway patrol officers had body-worn cameras. Learn more from CalMatters’ Byrhonda Lyons. 






California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: Newsom’s visit to South Carolina this week — an important state in the early stages of the presidential primaries — lends more evidence that he is eyeing a bid for the nation’s highest office.
California should keep investigating OpenAI, since the company has still yet to clarify how it will maintain its nonprofit oversight amid its various business deals, write Orson Aguilar and Catherine Bracy, CEOs of LatinoProsperity and TechEquity, respectively.

,California,2025-07-09 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Cal Fire rolled out an AI chatbot. Don’t ask it about evacuation orders,Malena Carollo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/07/cal-fire-chatbot/,The bot fails at some basic questions about fires. Cal Fire says it is working on fixes.,"In summary
The bot fails at some basic questions about fires. Cal Fire says it is working on fixes.


California government agencies are going all-in on generative artificial intelligence tools under  Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2023 executive order to improve government efficiency with AI. One of the first to roll out is a chatbot from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, the primary agency tasked with coordinating the state’s wildfire response.
The chatbot is meant to give Californians better access to “critical fire prevention resources and near-real-time emergency information,” according to a May release from Newsom’s office. But CalMatters found that it fails to accurately describe the containment of a given wildfire, doesn’t reliably provide information such as a list for evacuation supplies and can’t tell users about evacuation orders.
Newsom has announced AI applications for traffic, housing and customer service to be implemented in the coming months and years. But Cal Fire’s chatbot issues raise questions about whether agencies are following best practices.
“Evaluation is not an afterthought,” said Daniel Ho, law professor at Stanford University whose research focuses on government use of AI. “It should be part of the standard expectation when we pilot and roll out a system like this.”
The chatbot uses the Cal Fire website and the agency’s ReadyForWildfire.org to generate answers. It can tell users about topics such as active wildfires, the agency, fire preparedness tips and Cal Fire’s programs. It was built by Citibot, a South Carolina-based company that sells AI-powered chatbots for local government agencies across the country. Cal Fire plans to host the tool until at least 2027, according to procurement records.
“It really was started with the intent and the goal of having a better-informed public about Cal Fire,” said Issac Sanchez, deputy chief of communications for the agency.
When CalMatters asked Cal Fire’s bot questions about what fires were currently active and basic information about the agency, it returned accurate answers. But for other information, CalMatters found that the chatbot can give different answers when the wording of the query changes slightly, even if the meaning of the question remains the same. 
For example, an important way Californians can prepare for fire season is assembling a bag of emergency supplies should they need to evacuate. Only “What should I have in my evacuation kit?” returned a specific list of items from Cal Fire’s chatbot. Variations of the question that included “go bag,” “wildfire ready kit” and “fire preparedness kit” instead returned either a prompt to visit Cal Fire’s “Ready for Wildfire” site, which has that information, or a message saying “I’m not sure about the specific items you should have” and the wildfire site link. Two of those terms are present on the site the chatbot referenced.
And while the chatbot didn’t generate incorrect answers in any of the queries CalMatters made, it doesn’t always pull the most up-to-date information. 
When asked if the Ranch Fire, a 4,293-acre fire in San Bernardino County, was contained, the chatbot said that the “latest” update as of June 10 showed the fire was 50% contained. At the time CalMatters queried the chatbot, the information was six days out of date – the fire was 85% contained by then. 
Similarly, when asked about current job openings at the agency, the chatbot said there weren’t any. A search on the state’s job site showed two positions at Cal Fire accepting applications at the time. 
Mila Gascó-Hernandez is research director for the University at Albany’s Center for Technology in government and has studied how public agencies use AI-powered chatbots. Two key factors she uses to evaluate such chatbots are the accuracy of information they provide and how consistently they answer the same questions even if the question is asked in different ways.
“If a fire is coming and you need to know how to react to it, you do need both accuracy and consistency in the answer,” she said. “You’re not going to think about ‘what’s the nice way to ask the chatbot?’”
Currently, the chatbot is unable to provide information about evacuation orders associated with fires. When asked who issues evacuation orders, it sometimes correctly said law enforcement, while other times said it didn’t know. Cal Fire’s Sanchez said it’s reasonable to expect the chatbot to be able to answer questions about evacuations. 
If there are no evacuation orders for a particular fire, he said, “the answer should be ‘there doesn’t appear to be any evacuations associated with this incident.’” 
Sanchez said he and his team of about four people tested the chatbot before it went out by submitting questions they expected the public to ask. Cal Fire is currently making improvements to the bot’s answers by combing through the queries people make and ensuring that the chatbot correctly surfaces the needed answer. 
When CalMatters asked the bot “What can you help me with?” in early May, it responded, “Sorry I don’t have the answer to that question right now” and asked if CalMatters had questions about information on the Cal Fire site. By mid-June, that answer was updated to being able to “provide answers to questions related to information located on this page such as details about current fires, CAL FIRE job classifications, examination requirements and CAL FIRE’s various programs.” 
“The big message we want to get across,” Sanchez said, “is be patient.”
But experts said the process of kicking the tires on a chatbot should happen long before procurement begins. 
The preferred process, Stanford’s Ho said, is to establish criteria for how the chatbot should perform before a vendor is selected so there are clear benchmarks to evaluate the tool. Ideally, those benchmarks are created by an independent third party. There should also be an evaluation of the benefits and risks before the chatbot is released.
And in a best-case scenario, the public would be involved before launch, Albany’s Gascó-Hernandez said. Agencies interested in using chatbots should identify the questions the public is likely to ask the AI tool ahead of time, ensure those are representative of the expected population the agency serves and refine the chatbot by having members of the public pilot the system to ensure it provides the kind of information they seek.
“These user engagement and user experiences are very important so the citizen ends up using the chabot,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/012225-Castaic-Fire-CalFire-GETTY-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

Just days after abandoning its planned conversion to a for-profit entity and proclaiming it would remain a nonprofit, OpenAI puzzled us with another announcement: a nearly $6.5 billion deal to buy io, a start-up created by former Apple executive and iPhone designer Jony Ive. 
This isn’t the only business deal OpenAI has in the works. The company also announced plans to build a massive new data center in the United Arab Emirates and has reportedly purchased AI startup Windsurf.
If anyone was under the impression that OpenAI’s decision to remain a nonprofit is a win for the public, its profit-driven business moves should put that to rest. Deals like these, which require OpenAI to sell stakes in the company, erode the nonprofit’s control of the business. 
Meanwhile, OpenAI has still not answered fundamental questions about how their conversion to a public benefit corporation will maintain the nonprofit’s independent oversight. Which of OpenAI’s entities owns the technologies it develops? How will OpenAI avoid conflicts of interest and self-dealing among executives and investors? Who will reap the funds that the for-profit sows? Most of all, what happens when shareholder interests conflict with the public interest that the nonprofit is legally bound to serve?
Without answers to these critical questions, the investigations into OpenAI’s structure by the California and Delaware attorneys general must continue.  
OpenAI was originally founded as a nonprofit to ensure artificial intelligence would benefit all of humanity. Today, it is operating under a structure that allows profit and commercial gain to take priority over its mission to serve the public good. 
Since 2019, OpenAI has methodically shifted power away from its nonprofit parent organization into a tangled web of business deals and investor relationships. Meanwhile, the nonprofit increasingly plays the role of a weak and passive bystander rather than a steward of the public interest — its assets are largely unaccounted for and its ability to steer AI toward meaningful public benefits is deeply compromised.
OpenAI’s latest pivot is a clever rebranding of its problematic business-as-usual approach. It’s a way to deflect lawsuits, avoid further scrutiny and put the interests of investors ahead of the everyday people OpenAI is legally required to serve.
The public deserves answers and transparency. While disputes over governance structures and the legalities of nonprofit ownership may seem tedious and disconnected from the lives of everyday people, OpenAI’s future has huge implications for the well-being of society. 
On the one hand, artificial intelligence is leading to breakthroughs that are helping us adapt to climate change, detect deadly diseases and simply give us more time back in our busy lives. On the opposite end, the technology is also accelerating greenhouse gas emissions, while leading to wrongful incarceration, unemployment and worldwide misinformation. 
In OpenAI’s own founding words: “It’s hard to fathom how much human-level AI could benefit society, and it’s equally hard to imagine how much it could damage society if built or used incorrectly.” If OpenAI’s charitable assets were separated from its commercial interests and put into the hands of a fully independent nonprofit that can carry out its original mission, there is a much better chance of ensuring the positive future vision for AI than the negative.
That’s why the attorneys general of California and Delaware need to take decisive action in their ongoing investigations into OpenAI’s restructuring. There must be robust investigation and oversight of OpenAI’s governance structure, including a review of past compliance with California charitable law. All nonprofit assets unrelated to governance should be fairly valued and required to transfer to a new, fully independent charitable entity dedicated to maximizing public benefit. Lastly, the nonprofit board’s needs true independence and ongoing oversight power to hold OpenAI accountable.

In 2015, now-retired Assemblymember Reginald Jones-Sawyer pitched a $10 million plan to give all CHP officers body cameras. Lawmakers landed on a one-year, $1 million pilot program. Officers recorded nearly 93,000 videos within that year, but the program was never expanded.
In 2022, CalMatters’ story noted that the pilot project had only led to 237 body cameras agency-wide, putting the CHP far behind local law enforcement agencies. At the time, the agency said it was focused on upgrading its dash cam system. Five months later, CHP sought funding for body cameras for all its officers, and state lawmakers approved the budget request.
So far about 2,400 body-worn cameras have been handed out to officers in the Bay Area, Los Angeles, and the Sacramento area,  according to CHP spokesperson Jaime Coffee. In total, all 7,600 officers are expected to receive their cameras by March 2026, she said.
“This is the perfect example of it moving too slow,” Jones-Sawyer said. “I always knew this needed to happen. I was just 10 years ahead of my time.”
Highway patrol officers make around 2 million stops a year, according to data from the state Racial and Identity Profiling Advisory Board. Officers have also been used for work outside of state highways. They’ve been deployed during the federal government’s immigration raids in LA, used to fight crime in Oakland and police drag races, among other things.
There’s little research on whether body-worn cameras reduce police violence. However, a 2022 study found some evidence that, after three years, agencies with body cameras saw a decrease in police killings compared with agencies that did not. 
Since 2023, state lawmakers have given CHP nearly $20 million for the new cameras and have planned $5 million in ongoing funding to support the new system.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/091324_CHP-Graduation_FM_10.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

Despite felony convictions in fatal crashes, several local drivers have regained licenses under a system that operates with no public tracking, few safeguards and rising calls for reform.


This story is the result of a monthslong investigation by The Press Democrat in partnership with CalMatters.
Before dawn broke on a quiet Monday in October 2019, Kellie Nora Michelle was asleep in her van on Hoen Avenue in Santa Rosa — her dog curled beside her, the van their only shared refuge.
She never saw the car coming.
Traveling 90 mph in a 35 mph zone, Angel Ivan Martinez flew around a bend in the two-lane street, drunk behind the wheel of a Dodge Charger. He slammed into Michelle’s parked van with such force that it launched the vehicle into a power pole, then a tree, then another car. The wreckage sprawled across the block like shrapnel.
“I remember it being a horrific scene,” recalled Santa Rosa police Sgt. Patricia Seffens, who arrived that morning as a patrol officer. “The debris field was so expansive.”
Michelle and her dog died instantly. She was 50 — a mother, a Sonoma County native and a Rancho Cotate High School graduate. Friends and family described her as smart and free-spirited, someone who struggled with mental health issues, addiction and bouts of homelessness. At the time, she was renting a room nearby but chose to sleep in her van so she could stay with her dog, who didn’t get along with another pet inside.
Martinez’s license was revoked. He pleaded no contest in August 2020 to felony vehicular manslaughter and DUI.
And then — four years later — the state gave his license back.
Despite killing someone, and later being arrested for driving unlicensed and giving police a false name, Martinez was issued a new California driver’s license in 2023. It’s valid through 2027.
He is not an outlier.

A system designed to restart
A monthslong investigation by The Press Democrat, in partnership with CalMatters, found that California routinely restores driver’s licenses to people convicted of killing someone behind the wheel — often while drunk, speeding or fleeing the scene.
In Sonoma County alone, at least 47 people have been charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019, according to data compiled by The Press Democrat and CalMatters. At least three, including Martinez, were convicted of felonies, lost their licenses and are already back on the road. Others could follow soon.

Similar cases have emerged in neighboring Napa, Mendocino and Lake counties.
It’s all legal. It’s happening quietly. And the state doesn’t track it.
California allows most drivers convicted in fatal collisions — particularly in cases involving alcohol, drugs or extreme recklessness — to reapply for a license after a revocation period that typically lasts three years. In some cases, they continue driving even before their criminal cases are resolved.
Drivers facing revocation can challenge the Department of Motor Vehicles’ decision, but they must act within days of being notified. Otherwise, they must wait out the revocation period, then reapply — passing tests, paying fees and, in some cases, completing rehabilitation courses.

By the numbers
A CalMatters analysis this spring found nearly 40% of Californians charged with vehicular manslaughter since 2019 still held valid licenses, including drivers with vehicular manslaughter convictions.
The Press Democrat took the next step — identifying drivers in the North Bay who regained driving privileges even after felony convictions.
Among them, according to DMV records:

A Granite Bay man who killed an 8-month-old child in a multi-car crash on Lakeville Highway near Petaluma in 2018, at the age of 18.
A Santa Rosa man convicted in 2020 for a fatal hit-and-run on Highway 12.
A Mendocino County man convicted in a fiery crash that killed his passenger in August 2020 on Highway 101 in Ukiah.

There was no consistent pattern in convictions or license reinstatements by race, income or gender, according to an analysis of the available data.
Because the state does not track how often driver’s licenses are reinstated after fatal crashes, The Press Democrat reviewed dozens of vehicular manslaughter cases from late 2018 through early 2025 in Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino and Lake counties. Sonoma County had by far the highest number of cases — around 50 — while the others each had about 20.
For this story, cases were narrowed to older felony collisions that resulted in convictions, had accessible court and DMV records, and were old enough that revocation periods could have ended. A full accounting was not possible.
Out of 106 cases compiled by The Press Democrat and CalMatters, DMV records show that at least eight drivers involved in fatal crashes before 2020 have had their licenses reissued, including four in Sonoma County and two each in Napa and Mendocino counties. Some regained their licenses as early as April 2023.
What the DMV doesn’t disclose is how often it denies reinstatement or imposes permanent revocation — a step more common in vehicular murder cases. The agency did not respond to requests for that data.
Chris Orrock, a DMV spokesperson, previously told CalMatters that drivers must be given a path to regain their licenses and that the agency has no process for revoking them permanently.
‘No way to justify it’
Matthew Swoyer remembers the 2018 Lakeville Highway crash vividly.
He was driving home to Fairfield when a Volkswagen Jetta crossed into oncoming traffic outside Petaluma and struck a Ford Explorer carrying a mother, her baby and several other children. The Jetta then spun out and hit Swoyer’s car.
“I remember getting out and a bunch of people stopping. Pure chaos,” said Swoyer, now 32 and living in Dixon.
He had to crawl out through the passenger door. The baby girl was killed. Six others, including Swoyer, were hurt. Other motorists pulled over to help.
The Jetta’s driver, Ryan Deloye, faced multiple charges — vehicular manslaughter, reckless driving, cellphone use, and alcohol and cannabis violations. He pleaded no contest in 2020. His license was restored in April 2023. A month later, a red-light camera caught him failing to stop in Sacramento County. DMV records did not show any other violations.
Swoyer had followed Deloye’s court case but didn’t know he’d gotten his license back.
“One hundred percent he should never be allowed to drive again,” Swoyer said. “What he was doing was absolutely outrageous. There’s no way to justify that he was just being a kid.”

Lawmakers respond
State lawmakers are now weighing changes.
Assembly Transportation Committee Chair Lori Wilson told The Press Democrat she plans to introduce legislation requiring license revocations to be consecutive — not concurrent — with jail or prison sentences. That would mean a convicted driver serves time before the clock starts on losing driving privileges.
“Part of that learning your lesson, so to speak, and being held accountable and experiencing consequences is that you should be able to drive,” Wilson said. “Every day that you want to go somewhere, you have the burden of using public transit or relying on someone willing to give you a ride.”
Wilson said she expects to introduce the bill next year. CalMatters’ reporting, she added, helped expose gaps in a policy that hasn’t been updated in years.
“It’s ineffective because it’s not being followed,” she said.
Wilson noted that manslaughter, unlike murder, is considered less malicious under the law. She said she believes some people should be allowed to earn back their licenses after meaningful rehabilitation.
“Should they pay forever for that mistake?” she said. “If they’re properly rehabilitated, they now understand the weight of that brief decision.”
The DMV does not track how often it reinstates licenses after fatal crashes. In a written statement to The Press Democrat, the department said its action are “controlled by statute,” citing state laws that require revocation for certain convictions but allow reinstatement later.
The agency also has discretion to suspend or revoke licenses after fatal collisions, but it does not report how often it uses that power.
In practice, the DMV and courts operate on separate tracks. A judge might impose jail time or probation, but the DMV’s countdown to reinstatement hinges on when it’s notified of a conviction. CalMatters recently found courts across California have often failed to report convictions to the DMV in a timely manner.
The result: a system that routinely returns licenses to drivers whose decisions once proved deadly.

The next wave
Dozens of vehicular manslaughter cases remain pending in North Bay courts. DMV records for recent convictions aren’t always updated. And defense attorneys often argue the charges don’t reflect their clients’ typical driving behavior.
In Petaluma, 79-year-old Beverly Klevin was killed Feb. 1, 2024, when another car struck her on Lakeville Highway. Her family later reached a $650,000 settlement with the city, alleging the road was unsafe.
The other driver, Samir Bhumbla, has pleaded not guilty to gross vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence. His attorney says Bhumbla has maintained safe driving habits and still holds a valid license.
In another pending case, 75-year-old Linda Cathleen Johnson, of Sebastopol, is accused of killing Novato resident Lemuel Rodas Diaz, 53, in a suspected DUI crash in December 2023 near Roblar and Stony Point roads. Johnson suffered serious injuries. Her attorney says she voluntarily surrendered her license and hasn’t driven since.
And in Napa, 31-year-old resident Yesica Barajas is charged with gross vehicular manslaughter in the March 16 crash that killed her children, 10-year-old Damian and 9-year-old Aaliyah. Her attorney sought her release pending trial, but a judge denied it.
More drivers in these cases could someday reapply for licenses under current state rules.
A flashpoint for reform?
Advocates remain divided.
Mothers Against Drunk Driving told The Press Democrat that drivers who kill while impaired should face far steeper penalties, including lifetime revocation.
“If a person adjudicated for a fatal impaired driving crash is found guilty, that offender should face a significant, if not lifetime, license revocation after they are released from incarceration,” the group said.
Others argue license restoration offers a path back to society, especially when a fatal crash results a moment of negligence rather than a pattern of reckless behavior.
Still, even after convictions, some drivers continue breaking the rules of the road — in ways both brazen, like driving without a license, and mundane, like rolling through a stop.
In Mendocino County, for example, Kyle Pinckney pleaded no contest in April 2023 to charges from a 2021 Fort Bragg crash that killed his passenger. Months later, he was cited for driving without a valid license. DMV records show he was issued a new license in April 2024, valid through 2029.
Back on Hoen Avenue in Santa Rosa, traffic still hums past the curve just before Cypress Way — the same stretch where Kellie Michelle’s life ended before the sun came up.
The speed limit sign still reads 35 mph.
And Angel Ivan Martinez is driving again.

How The Press Democrat reported this story
This story is the result of a monthslong investigation by The Press Democrat in partnership with CalMatters. Reporter Colin Atagi reviewed more than 100 fatal crash cases across Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino and Lake counties dating back to late 2018.
Atagi reviewed court records, DMV data and Press Democrat archives to identify drivers who faced criminal charges — and in many cases, regained their licenses.
The dataset was narrowed to cases with accessible documentation, completed convictions and enough time passed to assess whether license reinstatement had occurred.
The Press Democrat also sought comment from crash survivors, victims’ families, defense attorneys, prosecutors, state officials and advocates. Some declined to comment or did not respond.

The Trump administration may look to reverse the monument designation for the  Chuckwalla Monument after the Department of Justice cleared the way changes to 625,000 acres in Riverside County.


One of former President Joe Biden’s last official acts was declaring the Chuckwalla National Monument on almost 625,000 acres of “canyon-carved mountain ranges” in Riverside County.
This spring President Donald Trump asked the Department of the Interior to consider removing those protections. In May the Department of Justice concluded that Trump “can and should” reverse the monument designations.
But this week, the White House Press Office told CalMatters that nothing is set in stone: “We would not get ahead of the President on any policy changes that may or may not be planned,” White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote in an email.
Janessa Goldbeck, CEO of Vet Voice Foundation, which lobbied for the Chuckwalla National Monument designation, said the administration might be thinking twice about reversing that status after blowback from a recent proposal in the House Budget Bill to sell off public lands.
“Veterans, hunters, anglers, a lot of people who are not traditionally invested in politics who came out to say hands off our public lands,” she said. 
Speculation that the Trump administration could revoke monument status for more than half a million acres of protected land in California has environmentalists fretting, but some outdoor recreation and mining advocates hope to undo what they call a “lame duck land grab.”
The Chuckwalla National Monument hugs the southern edge of Joshua Tree National Park and extends eastward across the Mojave and Colorado Deserts. 
Tribal trails thread through the monument and the region is considered culturally and spiritually important to numerous tribes, Biden’s proclamation stated. It’s also home to endangered desert tortoise and desert pupfish, and rare species of aster, sage and cholla, that “grow nowhere else on Earth,” according to Sierra magazine.
“This is not just a bare landscape out in the desert,” tribal engagement strategist Donald Medart, a member of the Fort Yuma Quechan Indian Tribe, told CalMatters. “This is a living, breathing, thriving place, where people have lived since time immemorial. We intend to protect it by any means possible.”
Biden dedicated the monument in the final days of his term, but it got off to an inauspicious start. The White House had planned to celebrate with a ceremony at Chuckwalla on Jan. 7, then cancelled it amid powerful winds that fanned catastrophic fires in Los Angeles that day. Biden issued a proclamation establishing the monument a week later.
On his inauguration day Jan. 20, Trump declared an “energy emergency” to fast-track power projects, and ordered the Interior Department to look at the new monuments. Officials pored over geological maps to identify their oil and mining potential, the Washington Post reported.
In May, a Michigan gold miner, an Idaho-based off-road vehicle organization and a conservative Texas think tank sued the federal government to overturn the Chuckwalla monument designation, alleging that it restricts access to public lands for recreation and amateur mining. However, Biden’s proclamation preserves existing rights to use of the land.
Chance Weldon, director of litigation of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, said that’s true, but future mine claims and trails could be off limits. He said the foundation believes that vast national monuments declared by presidential proclamation are a misuse of the Antiquities Act, which authorizes their creation.
“When you have thousands of acres being taken off line, that’s something that should be decided by Congress, not by the president at the stroke of a pen,” Weldon said.
Goldbeck questioned the plaintiffs’ basis for challenging the monument: “This is an out of state entity being represented by another out of state entity, trying to undo something that Californians love and fought for.”
Environmental and tribal groups have argued that once a president dedicates a monument it can’t be undone. But in June the Department of Justice told Trump he could eliminate monuments if he thinks the space or structures they contain “either never were or no longer are deserving of the (Antiquities) Act’s protections.”
Some local officials have also balked at what they consider restrictions of Chuckwalla National Monument. The city of Blythe weighed in against the designation, arguing that it would hurt tourism, solar development and the local economy.
It’s unclear whether those objections are part of the administration’s calculations. Trump has put the brakes on alternative energy development, and on Monday directed the treasury to end tax credits for wind and solar programs.
In a recent Senate hearing, Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum suggested that the monument is just too big.
“The question is not whether the monuments serve the purpose, I think the real question is the size,” Burgum said, responding to questions from California Sen. Alex Padilla.
Burgum said he has heard concerns from residents of other states that local communities weren’t consulted on recent monuments, but he noted that wasn’t the case in California. Padilla thanked him for acknowledging California’s public review efforts and said the Trump administration should follow the same process for any changes to Chuckwalla National Monument.
“If it’s going to be revisited or undone, we expect that same level of engagement on the back end before any action is taken or before any decisions are made,” Padilla said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010625-Chuckwalla-Mountains-National-Monument-Getty-DM-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/07/state-workers-return-to-office/,Gov. Gavin Newsom delayed his mandate that most state employees return to the office four days a week in a deal with unions.

Gov. Gavin Newsom delayed his mandate that most state employees return to the office four days a week in a deal with unions. Labor leaders say his claim of “operational necessity” now rings hollow.


Tens of thousands of California state employees were bracing to return to the office on July 1 after Gov. Gavin Newsom declared there was an “operational necessity” for all California state employees to work in person a minimum of four days per week. 
That changed just before the deadline when CalHR, which represents the governor in collective bargaining, negotiated a set of deals with public employee unions that delayed the mandate for a year. Relieved workers welcomed the news. 
Yet labor leaders – and even some in-office evangelists – said the governor’s willingness to suddenly drop his demand proved the order was a clever political move and undermined his insistence that in-person work is superior, necessary for productivity and builds public trust.  
“Many of our members feel the sudden shift toward rigid (return to office) policies had more to do with politics and pressure than performance,” wrote Anica Walls, president of Service Employees International Union Local 1000, in an email. The union, the largest in California state government, represents almost 96,000 state employees. “This pause is a direct result of our members fighting back.”
Walls declined multiple requests for an interview and insisted that CalMatters send questions in writing.
Many state workers had been on edge since March when Newsom penned the executive order that would have required an estimated 108,000 employees who still worked a hybrid schedule to return to the office nearly full time. The new order doubled the number of required in-office days from two to four, building on Newsom’s first crackdown on work-from-home in April 2023.
Several state employee unions filed grievances, and two groups sued Newsom and CalHR, the state’s human resources agency, alleging that the administration’s order wrongfully sidestepped the collective bargaining process by unilaterally changing working conditions.
Aggrieved state employees also fundraised more than $30,000 to erect billboards around Sacramento that accused Newsom of creating traffic jams. Many workers argued the state had downsized some locations so there would not even be enough room for them to work in person.
Lawmakers, whom the public employee unions view as allies, questioned whether the state was ready to suddenly bring so many workers back to the office. They didn’t get clear answers. 
‘You don’t have numbers for us’
During budget hearings in April and May, members of the Assembly subcommittee that oversees government administration grilled officials from CalHR and the Department of Government Services about how much it would cost to have tens of thousands of workers come in four days a week instead of two. 
The lawmakers didn’t hide their exasperation when administration officials admitted they did not  even have a rough estimate. 
“I’m still really astonished that you don’t have numbers for us,” said Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Democrat who represents Hayward, during a May 22 committee hearing. 
“This is pretty bewildering,” echoed Democratic Assemblymember Matt Haney of San Francisco.
But Newsom maintained that the benefits of in-person work, such as increased collaboration, communication and mentorship for newer employees, were undermined by the two-day in-office policy since teams weren’t required to come in on the same days. Four days in office would mitigate that issue.  
The tension escalated in May after Newsom announced the state faced a $12 billion budget problem and suggested delaying state worker pay raises for a year, as well as pausing contributions to their retiree health care funds, to cut costs.
Ultimately, CalHR reached new labor agreements with three unions, including the state’s largest, to delay the in-office order until July 2026. Those new deals also included some of the cost savings the governor wanted.
SEIU Local 1000 recently agreed to offset a 3% pay raise this year with five extra hours of “unpaid” leave time each month. The agreement, which affects about a third of the union’s 96,000 represented workers, could ultimately cost the state more since an employee’s accrued hours gain value as their pay rises over time. Many state workers wait to cash out unused leave when they retire, typically at their highest pay rate.

Proponents of in-office work were also dismayed by Newsom’s about-face. Michael Genest, who served as Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s finance director, said telework shouldn’t be used as a privilege to sweeten contract negotiations.
“Why is this a bargaining chip?” Genest said. “What it shows is a complete lack of respect for the idea that the taxpayer is paying for something that’s of value.”
Only a fraction have returned to the office
Of the estimated 108,000 employees who continue to work hybrid schedules, only a fraction of them have been required to return to office because their unions did not make agreements to delay the order. Many are state scientists, whose union spent four years fighting for a contract and eventually staged California’s first state worker strike before closing a deal in August 2024. 
The scientists’ union, the California Association of Professional Scientists, has so far refused the state’s requests to reopen its contract and negotiate the salary concessions the other unions traded for the extra year of remote work privileges. 
“The governor’s RTO mandate is not grounded in any logic, data, or operational need. It’s political,” said Jacqueline Tkac, the scientists’ union president, in a written statement. “We are open to collaboration with the state on this issue, but refuse to compromise our contract to participate in Gov. Newsom’s political games.”
When asked to explain his sudden willingness to delay the return-to-office order, the governor’s office did not respond. In an emailed statement, CalHR spokesperson Camille Travis praised the “collaborative approach” with unions that led to the agreement.
“Departments were preparing to implement the return to office order, and this one-year delay gives us the opportunity to refine those plans and work with our teams to ensure a smooth transition,” Travis wrote. 
Genest said Newsom’s sudden reversal on the in-office order, just a week before it was set to take effect, created unnecessary whiplash for departments that were scrambling to prepare enough office space to accommodate returning employees. 
“If he’s telling the departments, ‘Gear up,’ and then he’s later going to say, ‘Oh, never mind, we’re going to be able to pay them less so you don’t have to gear up,’” Genest said, “that’s a very cynical thing.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/060823_SEIU_State_Workers_March_JH_CM_05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

The vote was 4-2.
The resolution sponsored by Mayor Danise Henriquez authorizes Key West City Manager Brian Barroso to enter into the agreement to allow the Police Department to receive training and participate in federal immigration operations. The resolution also says that the city “should not adopt or maintain any sanctuary policies” as defined by Florida law. It took effect immediately.
Approval of the resolution came less than a week after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier warned that the commission had violated Florida law when it voided an earlier agreement between ICE and the police department on June 30. It came after nearly three hours of public comment, with the vast majority of the public calling on the commission to stand by its vote to void an earlier agreement between the police chief and ICE.
The commission approved a second resolution expressing support for Haitians with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS protects immigrants from certain countries from deportation and allows them to work legally in the United States. However, Haitians in the United States will lose that protection as of Sept. 2, according to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. A spokesperson for DHS has said that the situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is “now safe for Haitian citizens to return home.” That measure passed, 5-1.
A third resolution calling on the city attorney to join in the legal action by the city of South Miami testing the legality of the requirement to enter into a 287(g) agreement was voted down, 4-2.
The vote rescinds earlier vote to void agreement
The immigration vote came eight days after Key West commissioners voted, 6-1, to void its police department’s previous 287(g) agreement with ICE that had been put into place by the city’s chief of police, Sean Brandenburg on March 4, with City Manager Brian Barroso’s knowledge but not with the approval of city commissioners.
In his July 2 letter, Uthmeier warned commissioners to “immediately” reverse last week’s vote.
“Failure to take corrective action will result in the enforcement of all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal from office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution,” he wrote.
Members of the public spoke out against the proposed agreement, with many saying that it was worth taking a stand that could result in the loss of their jobs on the commission.
“I believe your stance against this evil spreading across our nation is exactly what you were called to do,” said resident Kirby Myers.
“Because 30 years from now, most of us will not be here. But our children will. And our grandchildren will. And when they look back at this night, it could be a defining moment in our history. They will either look back at our local leaders here tonight who had an opportunity to spread a light across this nation and create a model for others to follow, and fight. And stand. And look the bullies in the eye with unity and unwavering conviction. Or they’ll look back and recall a moment that faded, as we cowered in fear, and allowed those who rule by intimidation and violence to, once again, walk all over those without a voice.
“I know you are scared — scared to lose your positions. Scared of the retributions. Scared of the rhetoric and the hate being spread on social media and the vile attacks against our communities. But if you don’t take this stance tonight, who will?”
Commissioner Monica Haskell was not in town during the meeting, but participated via Zoom. Before public comment began, she blasted the mayor’s decision to hold the meeting without all members present.
“The city’s expert legal counsel has confirmed that we are in a strong position by doing nothing. We haven’t entered or supported an agreement. There’s no legal liability, so why panic? The mayor scheduled this meeting prior to discussing the legal options with the attorneys. Why not wait for the courts to decide whether the 287(g) agreement is mandatory or voluntary?
“Florida law does not require cities to sign 287(g). It only applies to sheriffs. Our police chief signed that agreement without public input or commission approval. That’s a problem. And we were right to recognize it as void. If the mayor’s resolution is approved, which I do not support to enter into the 287(g) agreement, then at least let’s fight in court alongside South Miami.
“But make no mistake, that entering into the 287(g) is the worst option for our community. Key West depends on tourism. We depend on trust. Turning our police into ICE agents erodes both. This isn’t about politics, it’s about public safety and economic survival.”
Commissioner Haskell proposed to postpone the decision until the city of South Miami’s legal challenge is adjudicated, but that amendment was rejected by the majority of the commission.
Commissioner Samuel Kaufman, who supported ending the agreement on June 30, was out of town and didn’t attend the meeting.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)Nevadans can expect to see energy bills rise, gasoline costs creep upward, an increase in health risks, job losses, a plunge in the state’s gross domestic product, and the potential for a resurgence in nuclear energy as a result of President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, industry experts are predicting. 
The OBBBA eliminates or phases out a number of clean energy tax credits enacted by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and is expected to reduce investment in renewables.
“One of the bitter ironies of this bill is it’s been billed as something to lower costs for working Americans,” says Harrison Godfrey of Advanced Energy United, a trade group for clean energy interests. “It will absolutely raise costs on consumers, at the same time stripping away their ability to actually manage their own costs through distributed energy resources, energy efficiency and electric vehicles.”
As a result of Trump’s policy, Nevada’s annual gross domestic product (GDP) is projected to “shrink by $1 billion in 2030 and $1.5 billion in 2035. Between 2025 and 2034 – the Reconciliation budget window – cumulative GDP would shrink by $8 billion in Nevada,” according to a state-by-state analysis from Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan think tank. 
Nationally, Energy Innovation reports, the Act is expected to “cut GDP by $1.1 trillion, add $170 billion to household energy bills, and cut hundreds of thousands of jobs.” The OBBBA “claws back unobligated funding, expands new oil and gas leasing, changes or eliminates energy and manufacturing tax credits, and repeals some Clean Air Act programs.”
Electricity costs 
In Nevada, the OBBBA is expected to hike household energy spending by an average of more than $270 a year in 2030 and more than $500 a year in 2035, according to Energy Innovation’s report. “Statewide, households will foot nearly $4 billion in increased energy bills through 2035.” 
A separate analysis, Princeton’s REPEAT Project, estimates  energy costs for the average U.S. household will increase by about $165 dollars per household a year in 2030 and more than $280 dollars per household a year in 2035—an increase of about 7.5% in 2030 and more than 13% in 2035.
Tech, tariffs, and Trump cloud NV Energy effort to reduce carbon footprint 

The cost of a kilowatt hour for Nevada’s residential and commercial electric customers is expected to increase by 6.1% by next year, and by 6.6% by 2029, according to an analysis by the National Economic Research Associates (NERA), commissioned by the Clean Energy Buyers of America. 
Nationally, electricity costs for commercial and residential users combined are projected to rise by 8.4%, with Wyoming residents and businesses expected to see the biggest increase of 29.2% by 2029, the NERA analysis estimates. 
Although the measure calls for ramped up domestic fuel production, increased energy demand “would raise prices more than increased domestic supply could lower them.” 
Under the OBBBA, recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program who receive energy assistance will be required to count the subsidy as income, unless the household includes an elderly or disabled person. 
Renewable projects and jobs
The bill Trump demanded that Congressional Republicans pass “drastically changes and terminates existing clean energy tax credits passed by Congress in 2022, which to date have generated $11.34 billion in new private-led investment across 45 domestic energy and manufacturing facilities in Nevada,” according to Energy Innovation. The measure threatens an additional $16.96 billion in private investment in 94 facilities planned throughout the state.
The OBBBA is expected to cut 6,200 jobs from Nevada’s workforce by 2030, and more than 8,300 jobs by 2035, “as new investment in domestic energy and manufacturing falters,” says Energy Innovation.
“This bill will kill projects and depress the addition of new energy supply at a time of rising demand, “ says Godfrey of Advanced Energy United.
Under the OBBBA, wind and solar projects placed in service after 2027 will not be eligible for the clean electricity investment tax credit (ITC) and clean electricity production tax credit (PTC), unless they begin construction within a year of the OBBBA’s enactment on July 4. 
Climate activists warn that Trump’s energy policies have cost thousands of clean energy jobs

Of 63 new and proposed solar array projects listed on the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada’s website, 22 are scheduled to go into service after Trump’s Dec. 31, 2027 deadline, while another 41 projects have no in-service date scheduled. 
Projects in the early stages with no scheduled date to begin service are at risk of losing financial backing, says Godfrey, because of uncertainty about whether they’ll meet Trump’s deadline.
“And if they can’t say that they will with absolute certainty, the financial backing for those projects goes ‘poof,” Godfrey says, adding financiers “aren’t going to wait around to find out whether you can make it. They’re going to take their money elsewhere. That’s why the ‘place in service’ (provision) in this law will kill projects.” 
Endeavors that have begun construction and made a tangible investment “should have a four year runway to be placed into service and still be eligible for the tax credit,” Godfrey says. But he cautions the landscape under Trump is still shifting. 
In a signal that Trump is dissatisfied with Senate provisions that softened the OBBBA’s blow to solar and wind projects, the president on Monday issued an executive order which calls for the U.S. to “build upon and strengthen the repeal of, and modifications to, wind, solar, and other ‘green’ energy tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; and end taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.”
The provision could be at odds with Trump’s goal of keeping companies in the U.S., Godfrey says, as manufacturers encounter a shrinking market made more difficult to access under Trump’s policies, while a global market awaits. 
Trump, he says, “is undercutting his own policy on American global leadership and energy dominance and sparking debate among manufacturers. ‘Why stay here when I can go and serve the rest of the market abroad? I don’t know if the next factory I build will be in the U.S.’”
Other clean energy technologies, such as hydropower and geothermal, must begin construction by 2033 to qualify for the full tax credit, which begins to phase out in 2034.
“Making new clean electricity less economic will decrease new investment by utilities and independent power producers, threatening the ability to bring new capacity online in time to meet demand forecasts and significantly raising the costs to do so,” says Energy Innovation, which noted clean energy accounted for more than 90 percent of new capacity added to the U.S. grid in 2024. By contrast, gas turbine deliveries are backlogged until at least 2029. 
The OBBBA is projected to decrease cumulative new electricity capacity in Nevada by 0.7 gigawatts by 2030 and by 3.8 gigawatts by 2035. Nevada’s electric generating capacity was 16.72 gigawatts as of March, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Rooftop Solar: Not dead yet? 
Trump’s agenda “takes a sledgehammer to rooftop solar, and distributed energy broadly,” Godfrey says. The credit that has helped finance almost a third of the cost of rooftop solar systems expires at the end of the year under the OBBBA. 
According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Nevadans claimed more than $137 million in credits for investments in residential electricity generation on their 2024 tax returns.
But rooftop solar isn’t dead, Godfrey says. Instead, it will find new ways to survive, such as leasing agreements “that can endure a little longer, despite some of the efforts of policymakers to gut those, too.” 
Electric vehicles and fuel prices 
The first apparent casualty of the OBBBA could be the electric vehicle market, as federal tax credits of $7,500 for buyers of new EVs and $4,000 for those who purchase used electric vehicles, expire on Sept. 30 of this year. Their termination could slow EV sales, especially among middle-income households, experts say. 
Trump’s bill also reduces the incentive for automakers to purchase electric vehicle credits from companies that produce a surplus of EVs, rendering the credits worthless, according to some.  
The OBBBA enacts a new tax credit that allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 in loan interest from 2025 to 2028 on all vehicles assembled in the U.S., but the cost of powering combustion engines is expected to rise as the cost of gasoline is projected to increase by $.32 cents per gallon by 2035. 
“We find the average Nevada household will spend $170 more on annual vehicle fuel alone in 2030 and $350 annually in 2035,” says Energy Innovation’s analysis. 
While the Trump agenda bill preserves incentives for manufacturing EV batteries, “it destroys demand for them,” says Godfrey. 
In 2014, Nevada lawmakers approved a smorgasboard of incentives totalling some $1.3 billion for Tesla’s Gigafactory in Northern Nevada, which makes battery cells, and turns out semi-trucks. In 2023, the state forked over another $330 million in incentives for the plant’s expansion. 
Dirty air 
The bill’s provisions, combined with Trump’s executive actions, could lead to more than 7 billion tons of additional greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, an about-face from clean energy momentum spurred by Biden-era policies. 
Air pollution, particularly from power plants and vehicles, is expected to worsen in  
Nevada. Annual emissions are expected to increase by more than 200,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide – the equivalent of adding 430,000 cars to the road, according to Energy Innovation. That’s not including the impacts of other Trump policies, such as the repeal of Environmental Protection Agency rules regarding carbon emissions from power plants. 
Nuclear resurgence 
According to Stateline, in the last two years, around two dozen states have taken legislative action to promote nuclear power, including integrating it into long-term energy plans. 
“Certainly nuclear wound up with better treatment than wind and solar under this tax package. I would remain hopeful that we see continued innovation there, and ultimately deployment in the medium to long term,” said Godfrey of Advanced Energy United. 
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Two companies hold federal permits to build a modular reactor in the U.S.
Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation in April redefining nuclear energy as a “clean energy resource.” Future nuclear plants will be eligible to receive state grants previously reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
What’s next? 
As provisions of the OBBBA thwart investment and proliferation of clean energy products, state leaders “need to be committed to make sure these technologies are able to expand,” says Emilie Olson of Advanced Energy United. 
Toward that end, she says, leaders can embrace policies that enable residents to take advantage of virtual power plants and energy management systems that allow them to generate power from EV batteries, smart meters, and other technologies, and sell it back to the grid.  
“Those are things that state policymakers can stand up for and make happen, regardless of the whims of what’s happening on the Hill,” she said.
Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, the only member of the Nevada delegation to vote in favor of Trump’s bill, did not respond to requests for comment on the measure’s expected impacts in Nevada. 
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who has embraced clean energy projects, including many made possible during the Biden era, also did not respond.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2222867900-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Even though home prices in Utah have grown less than 1% since 2022, Utah in 2024 ranked as the ninth most expensive housing market in the nation. 
Statewide, the median sales price of a single-family home hit $547,700 in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
That’s according to a new report published Tuesday, marking another yearly iteration of the “State of the State’s Housing Market” published by the University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
The report, written by Jim Wood, senior research fellow and one of the state’s leading housing market experts, paints the latest picture of Utah’s housing market for 2024. 
“High but stable housing prices” underscored Utah’s housing market that year, he wrote. “Stable prices, however, offered little relief to potential homebuyers as high interest rates and housing prices excluded many households from homeownership.” 
His big takeaway from last year? Utah’s housing marketplace — for both homebuyers and renters — is seeing a “correction” from the COVID-19 era, when low interest rates and new remote work opportunities sparked a homebuying spree, especially in the West. 
“We’re living in the shadow of that,” Wood told Utah News Dispatch in an interview Tuesday, adding that when prices skyrocket more than 40% in two years like they did from 2020 to 2022, some level of correction is “inevitable.”

But the housing market isn’t imploding like it after the 2008 bubble popped. What’s happening now isn’t as dramatic of a correction. Price increases have slowed — but they’re still every so slightly up. Home building and apartment construction has declined after a record home building boom in 2021. It’s all leveling off as interest rates remain high, squeezing affordability for homebuyers, renters and developers. 
“We haven’t seen housing prices go down substantially like some thought would occur,” Wood said. Yes, prices dipped slightly in 2023, he said, by less than 3%, but they came back up slightly in 2024. 
That 1% increase since 2022 reflects a “very stable” market, Wood said. 
“But we’re still (seeing), unfortunately, very high housing prices,” he said. Today’s high interest rates, hovering around 6.6%, combined with high prices, “introduces into this market a more extreme level of (lack of) affordability. … It’s still a huge issue.” 
In Utah’s five largest counties — Salt Lake, Weber, Davis, Utah and Washington — housing prices “are seriously to severely unaffordable,” when comparing median sales prices to median household income, Wood wrote in the report. 
Utah’s housing affordability level has only slightly improved from 2022, but not much. In 2022, the state’s “median multiple ratio” — which measures the severity of housing affordability by dividing the median sales price of a home by median household income — was a record 5.7, or “severely unaffordable,” according to the report. Last year, that dipped slightly to 5.1 after housing price growth leveled off, but a ratio of 5.1 is still considered “severely unaffordable.”

Consider that Utah’s median multiple ratio was 3.5 just over 10 years ago, in 2014. That ratio was considered “moderately unaffordable.” 
And while rental rates showed little to no change in 2024 (and even dipped in some areas), the average rental rate of all unit types in Salt Lake County increased from $1,582 a month in 2023 to $1,593 in 2024. That’s a less than 1% decrease — but came after rent prices jumped 20.7% in 2021. 
As for Utah’s housing shortage? It’s expected to persist since construction has contracted. About 22,000 residential units were permitted in 2024, the lowest number since 2016, according to the report. 
“A drop in apartment development accounted for 90% of this decline,” Wood wrote, noting that apartment unit permits fell from 7,622 in 2023 to 4,801 in 2024 — which he described as “the lowest level since the Great Recession.”  
However, that’s after the “apartment development boom peaked in 2021, at 14,143 units, leading to an overbuilt market with higher vacancy rates and, in some cases, lower rents,” he wrote. 
Today, Salt Lake County has a rental inventory of 160,000 units. Only 1,283 apartment units were permitted in 2024 in that county, making up less than 1% of its inventory. That’s not on pace with 3% growth, so inventory continues to pace behind demand. 
“We probably need at least 4,000 or 5,000 (units) if we have consistent growth in our net immigration and kids going from living with their parents and form households,” Wood said. 
Housing affordability could be impacting Utah’s growth
With supply continuing to pace behind projected demand, Wood predicted Utah will continue to face high prices and a limited inventory. 
“To get an equilibrium, good balance is really tough,” he said. “We’re in a period right now where we had a ton of supply, so the builders cut it off, we got no supply, demand continues to grow, and then by the time the supply is induced, you know it’s a year or two too late so we have a tight market.” 
However, Wood noted Utah is feeling the impacts of its housing affordability issues. 
“Utah’s growth is slowing down. Employment growth and demographic growth are both just drifting lower and lower,” he said. Last month, Utah’s job growth increased an estimated 2.5% year over year, down from more than 3% job growth in 2019, according to state estimates.

Combined with other factors including slowing population growth, Wood said that and demand for lower-priced homes like apartments, townhomes and condominiums show that the state’s housing affordability issues could be having a real impact on its growth. 
“Now the question is, why? Why is employment growth slowing down in Utah? A couple of us here at the institute, we’ve discussed that, and we think it has a lot to do with housing prices,” he said. 
Anecdotally, Wood said he personally knows of people who have quit their jobs and moved out of the state in search of lower-priced homes. 
“We’ve got more people leaving than we’ve had years past because they couldn’t get into the housing market, or they wanted a bigger home and it was too expensive here,” he said. “So we’re probably losing people that we didn’t years ago, and we’re not getting as many coming because of high housing prices.” 
Where do we go from here?
Wood said that economic uncertainty and slower rates of population and economic growth will likely put a damper on housing demand in 2025. He also expects residential construction, existing home sales, housing prices and mortgage rates will continue to linger around the same levels as last year.

Wood forecasted the median sales price of a single-family home to grow only slightly, by 2%, to $558,000, and the median price of a condo, townhome and twin home will go up 3% to $422,000. 
He also expects affordability to remain a stark issue, with interest rates projected to stay between 6% and 7%. 
Though President Donald Trump has been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates drastically, it remains to be seen what will actually happen later this year and in coming years. But if interest rates do come down, say below 6%, “then you’d have a different landscape,” Wood said. 
Home prices would likely increase, along with home building and real estate sales, he said. But low rates could also lead to inflation issues, like what happened after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
But based on the current landscape, Wood expects Utah to remain in a real estate holding pattern over the next year or so. Expect to continue to see high prices and high rates.

(Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by  President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.
“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”



For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, especially given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

A mass shooting in Birmingham last September helped lead to a statewide ban on glock switches, which turn semi-automatic firearms into effectively automatic ones. Crime is looming as an issue in the coming mayoral elections in Birmingham.

The hustle and bustle of the Five Points South neighborhood belies its recent history, including a mass shooting in which four people were killed in September.
But businesses in Birmingham have felt the ripple effects of gun violence. Following the mass shooting at Hush Hookah/Cigar Lounge, several businesses, including Hush and Sleek Sports Bar, have closed their doors and new businesses have moved in to the Five Points South area.
Lindsay Garrett, a Birmingham native and marketing director for Opulence Drag Lounge & Taqueria in Five Points South, which moved into Hush’s old location, said they aim to distance themselves from the tragic event that took place last year.
“People who are here are creating something (that has) nothing to do with what occurred here previously,” she said. “Violence happens all over the city, all over the state, no matter what community you’re in, whether it be Black, white, LGBTQ or otherwise, there is violence happening in all aspects of the city. So we’re trying not to focus on that,” she said.
The shooting helped lead to the passage of the first state law restricting firearms in about 15 years. In March, Gov. Kay Ivey signed SB 116, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road. The law imposes a state ban on “Glock switches,” or devices that turn semi-automatic handguns like pistols into fully automatic weapons, which were used in September’s shooting.
Gun violence is a problem throughout the nation. Last year, the John Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions reported firearms remain the leading cause of death in children and teens with Black youth being some of the most affected by gun violence.
“In 2022, in the 1 to 17 age group, Black children and teens had a gun death rate 18 times higher than that of white children in the same age group. The gun homicide rate among Black children and teens rose 5.6 percent from 2021 to 2022,” The report said.
Glock switches have been used throughout Alabama, which has the fourth-highest rate of death from firearms in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But Birmingham has suffered significantly from gun violence, and crime is a major issue in elections this year. The Birmingham Police Department reported 151 homicides in 2024, a rate of about 76.9 homicides per 100,000 people in the city.

By comparison, Huntsville, a city with about 35,000 more residents, reported 18 homicides in 2024, a rate of 7.8 per 100,000. Mobile reported 37 homicides, a rate of 18.3 per 100,000, and Montgomery reported 61, or 31.2 per 100,000.
This year through the end of June, Birmingham has reported 37 homicides, which is a reduction from this time last year of more than 51%.
Mayor Randall Woodfin, who is seeking reelection this year, has been advocating against reducing gun violence in Birmingham.
“I care about decreasing gun violence in our city. I care about decreasing crime, I care about saving lives,” he said in a 30-minute video in November.
A commission appointed by the mayor also issued a 66-page report in January detailing plans to reduce gun violence and homicides. The plan included immediate actions to take including:

Focused deterrence, a strategy targeting high-risk individuals and groups through a combination of enforcement, accountability and social support.
Community violence intervention, which would expand street outreach and hospital-based violence intervention programs to disrupt cycles of violence and retaliation.
Shooting reviews to provide ongoing analysis of violent incidents to identify patterns, prevent retaliation, and guide future interventions.
Focus on hotspots, designed to address concentrated areas of violence in the community through strategies ranging from additional policing to blight reduction and neighborhood revitalization.

Woodfin has said the city has made substantial progress on several of those fronts.
Crime remains one of the focal issues in the mayor’s race. U.S. Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, kicked off the political season on New Year’s Day with her announcement for the office and pledge to focus on community safety.
Mayoral candidate Brian K. Rice said in a statement in response to questions that he favors crime prevention as the first step to keep Iron City residents out of incarceration.
“My primary focus is on crime prevention, enabling us to enhance both the mind and the built environment,” the statement said. “Every day we fail to improve the built environment and improve the minds of our most challenged, where hurt and trauma rule, then we are preparing for more convictions. We must alter the destructive path before the next law is broken. I am committed to routing resources as the budget allows to protect the public safety of all under my watch. I am concerned about the human before they breach any gun law.”
Kamau Afrika, another mayoral candidate, said the new law has come later than it should have and said now almost anyone can get a gun. Afrika said that to limit gun violence, he would expand Birmingham’s city jail into the Southside area, and he would place those incarcerated into mentorship programs. An advocate for crime reduction, he said he would place youths in mentorship programs, implement a patrol force with a focus on community policing and construct athletic complexes for youth to engage.
Lashunda Scales has taken a tough on crime stance and pledged to enable police, including getting the police force up to full staffing.
Frank Woodson has said his focus would be on community building to ensure safe neighborhoods. And Jerimy Littlepage has said he wants to fight crime by helping lift up youth before they turn to crime.
Garrett said the city and the residents have different opinions on how to handle gun violence.
“I don’t see the measures that are being taken being as effective as the city would like them to be. And I do believe that there is a bit of a mismatch between what the city thinks should be done and what the community needs. And if the city itself would really speak and go into the communities and talk to the people, they would probably find more efficient and effective solutions.”
Action after a shooting
There’s no rush to ban guns in Alabama. The Glock switch ban was spurred on in part by the Five Points and other mass shootings in the Birmingham area where people died under automatic fire.
Glock switches can be easily obtained and installed on firearms, said Matthew Valasik, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Alabama.
“People can or end up manufacturing these things and selling them online relatively easily. So it’s not super complicated to procure one of these items,” he said.
Glock switches are already outlawed at the federal level. But Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, who has sought a state ban on Glock switches for years, said this ban will help save lives by making it easier for local law enforcement to confiscate the devices.
“A ban will allow law enforcement to confiscate a device before it could be used, and that is a matter of saving people’s lives and preventing a horrible shooting, and particularly a mass shooting, so to have it go into effect immediately, can save lives and prevent some of the deadliest and most horrific shootings that have occurred and can occur,” Ensler said.
Ensler, who had been pushing for a similar law, said his experience as a teacher who has lost students to gun violence and an encounter with a mother made him determined to have something comparable passed.
“Legislatively, what really got me even more involved in it was, a mother in my district came up to me after a neighborhood meeting and shared the story of her son dying from a gun that had a Glock switch,” he said. “And she said that she knows that no law can bring her son back, but that if a law can help save lives moving forward, she asked that I would fight for that.”
Representatives for Slide Cafe, which is directly above Opulence, said in a statement that they support the new law and all efforts to make Alabama safer.
“At this time we are happy to express our support in efforts to make all of Alabama a safer place through the Glock switch ban,” the statement said.
Just because there is now a ban on Glock switches doesn’t mean crime in Alabama will stop.
“If you’re going to be involved in a crime, I don’t know how much it’s going to actually impact you. It might prevent people that are thinking about ordering it, obviously that may deter you if there’s some type of investigation into a person that’s selling these things and tracking who they’re selling them to, or where they’re going to, and then you’re arresting people for possessing it,” Valasik said.
Garrett also said Opulence hopes the Birmingham community will get what it needs out of the new law.
“We hope that the community gets what it needs out of the Glock switch ban. We hope that there is less violence than, specifically less gun violence, obviously. And if this is going to initiate less gun violence, I hope that’s what happens. And that the effect of that lessening of gun violence isn’t further oppression of minority communities,” she said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Birmingham-Alabama-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

(Courtesy of South Dakota State Historical Society)The following excerpt is from the new book “Wilder Weather,” which is available from the South Dakota Historical Society Press.
As railroads extended into Dakota Territory from the late 1870s to mid-1880s and the Homestead Act provided land, the settler population surged in a period dubbed the “Great Dakota Boom.” The population increased across Dakota Territory from just over 98,000 in 1880 to 348,600 in 1890. Economic fortunes were tied closely to the success of agriculture and ranching, from the growing stages using the Homestead Act plots of land to the shipment of goods via the railroad network. Little did the settlers know how good they had it, how flush with rain they were. Homesteaders had unknowingly arrived on the Plains during a relatively wet (or “pluvial”) period. Rain had not followed the plow; the plow had followed the rain. Homesteaders plowed up the prairie and planted crops with the mistaken impression that enough rain would continue to fall to support the acreage they tilled.
Then the pendulum swung, passing right through the “normal” middle-of-the-road rainfall and far into the dry side. To the homesteaders, the lack of rain must have felt as jarring as shifting from fifth gear to first in an old pickup truck. They were new to the Dakota climate still, not yet aware of how wide the swings could be between wet periods and dry. The skies and soils dried out just as the newly married Wilders began their farming years in the mid- to late 1880s, adding layers of difficulty from the very beginning of their years together. Laura had promised Almanzo just three years to give farming a try, and the drought sunk in its teeth by the end of their third year of marriage in 1888.


About the book
  The cover of Barbara Boustead’s book, “Wilder Weather,” published by the South Dakota Historical Society Press.
This excerpt is reprinted with permission from the new book “Wilder Weather: What Laura Ingalls Wilder Teaches Us About the Weather, Climate, and Protecting What We Cherish,” by meteorologist, climatologist and Wilder scholar Barbara Boustead, Ph.D. The book is available from the South Dakota Historical Society Press.


As in the 1870s during Wilder’s Plum Creek days, a La Niña pattern established itself in the distant equatorial Pacific Ocean in the late 1880s through the late 1890s, dominating global weather patterns for nearly a decade. Recall that in the United States, La Niña patterns favor dry conditions in the southern Great Plains, often spreading northward into the central Great Plains when La Niña continues for multiple years. La Niña conditions occurred in 1886-1887, 1889-1890, and 1892-1895. The La Niñas of the 1890s were stronger and more consecutive than those of the 1870s, which can strengthen the downstream impacts. While not the only contributing factor, the persistent La Niña-like pattern was a significant driver of the dry weather patterns affecting wide swaths of the central United States.
In Huron, South Dakota, the driest summer on record (stretching back to 1881) remains the summer of 1894. The summer of 1893 ranks as eleventh driest and 1889 as seventeenth driest. In Huron, the dryness of the late 1880s through the mid-1890s was just about as profound as the 1930s “Dust Bowl” years. The temperatures for all three of those years (1889, 1893, and 1894) were above average, too, compared to an 1881-1910 average. In fact, the summertime average temperature in 1894 was the warmest on record until 1921, on level with the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s, and still ranks well above normal even including the warmer recent decades in the full record. Put a different way, the heat of the late 1880s to mid-1890s was roughly a once-in-a-generation event at the time, though it has become more of an every-other-year occasion in our modern climate.
The dry summers of the late 1880s into the 1890s were too much to take for many would-be farmers, and the settlers who were still so new to the land abandoned it in droves. The bust years peaked in the early to mid-1890s as relentless drought conditions caused crop failures year after year. Combined with factors such as lack of federal and state support for government relief for the farmers and a broader economic depression in the United States, drought was key to ending the boom of population expansion in the Dakotas. Emigration from the Dakotas in the early 1890s caused a net loss in population from 348,600 in 1890 to 331,000 by 1895.
The Wilders and their young daughter, Rose, were one of the families driven from their homestead by drought. Leaving De Smet in 1890, they moved in with Almanzo Wilder’s parents in Spring Valley, Minnesota, for a year to find respite, and then to Westville, Florida, in search of opportunity. Disappointed there, the family returned to De Smet in 1892. They lived in town as Laura worked as a seamstress and Almanzo worked varying jobs, saving money so the family could resettle for good. The Wilders made no attempt to farm when they returned to De Smet, paralleling the Ingalls family experience of Wilder’s childhood, in which they lived in town and did not farm when they returned to Walnut Grove after their unsuccessful year in Burr Oak, Iowa.
Charmed by a pamphlet advertising life in the Ozarks, the Wilder family made the decision to move to Missouri in 1894, at the climax of the drought. In an introduction to her mother’s published travel journal, On the Way Home, Rose Wilder Lane later penned the conditions she had observed when they departed De Smet for good: “For seven years there had been too little rain. The prairies were dust. Day after day, summer after summer, the scorching winds blew the dust and the sun was brassy in a yellow sky. Crop after crop failed. Again and again the barren land had to be mortgaged, for taxes and food and next year’s seed. The agony of hope ended when there was no harvest and no more credit, no money to pay interest and taxes; the banker took the land. Then the bank failed.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)As if to prove the difficulty of preparing for the unforeseen, the organizer of a recent prepper convention wasn’t ready for a heat wave that socked his gathering. 
Troy McKinley, the organizer of the 3rd Annual Minnesota Prepper Expo, wore a t-shirt that read, “Noah was a conspiracy theorist … then it rained” — in reference to the famous boat builder. 
He acknowledged the heat probably kept people away from the Morrison County Fairgrounds on a recent blistering 90 degree Saturday that had driven most Minnesotans indoors. 
McKinley hoped for 1,000 attendees at the prepper fair, but there were less than 100 in attendance on the convention’s second day. 
Still, a handful had pitched tents for the three-day event, and all signs point to a continued robust obsession with preparing for the American end: People shell out money to share in stories about the apocalypse. The causes are as diverse as their creators: cordiceps (“The Last of Us”); artificial intelligence (“The Terminator”); nuclear holocaust; solar storms; or, a global pandemic.
The end’s hold on humanity — and, it seems, Americans in particular — comprises art and entertainment, as well as the theological and political, with some Christians reading events in modern Israel as precursors to the “rapture,” while others once strained to see the anti-Christ in Barack Obama. 
McKinley might have given the impression of a religious man, but as the self-described agnostic reflected on his upbringing as a Jehovah’s Witness, he said, “I had questions that they couldn’t answer.”
These days, McKinley, who once watched panicked oil workers loot a grocery store during a North Dakota snowstorm, has found community among preppers — like-minded people who make preparations for disaster scenarios.  
Preppers, sometimes called “doomsday preppers,” tend to conjure images of underground bunkers and zombie apocalypses. The expo leaned into this idea, its logo featuring silhouettes of zombies and bullet holes.

But most people gathered at the event — many hesitant to label themselves as preppers — were most concerned with technological or electric grid interruption or collapse, civil unrest or another pandemic, with memories of COVID-19’s run on toilet paper and cleaning supplies. 
Jake Sparrow, who was selling his up-cycled clothing at the event, said he loved “The Walking Dead” but didn’t find it realistic.  
Sparrow said his primary concern is EMPs, or electromagnetic pulses, that can result from natural events like solar storms or manmade nuclear detonation. EMPs cause voltage surges that can damage electronic equipment. Though widespread technological collapse due to nuclear detonation is unlikely, solar storms, though rare, do pose a concern for communications infrastructure. It was a common subject of conversation at the convention, with frequent references to the so-called Carrington Event, when a solar storm in 1859 caused telegraph systems to go haywire. 
Sparrow suspects the government might produce an EMP while blaming it on a solar flare. 
Rather than stockpiling resources, Sparrow said his focus is on refining skills like gardening, carpentry and bushcraft. He almost never carries a cell phone but does have a collection of weapons. 
“I guess I’m not concerned, but I’m almost expecting it,” Sparrow said of an electric grid collapse. 
Sparrow’s wife, Amanda joked, “When’s it gonna happen? Let’s just get on with this already.”

Many of the people at the convention, however, were less concerned with the end than with their atrophied survival skills, seeking sustainability in an increasingly technology-dependent world. Most of the presentations given by speakers — ranging from seed-saving to preserving food with salt — would’ve been equally relevant to homesteaders as those preparing for a life-altering catastrophe. 
In a seminar about child-rearing in the wilderness, Elli King-Gallager said that the way she is raising her children – in the wilderness, with very limited technology – feels radical at first. “But it’s not radical at all,” she said. “All we’re really doing is living the way people were living 200 years ago. It’s not that big of a deal. It’s not that amazing.”

A dozen people sat in a semicircle of folded chairs to hear Mike Bollinger, the executive director of Seed Savers Exchange, speak about preserving seeds. 
Bollinger leads the largest nongovernmental seed bank in the U.S. The federal government’s much larger equivalent, known as the National Plant Germplasm System, was in flux earlier this year when the Department of Government Efficiency fired some of its employees (they were later reinstated). 
Though Bollinger was unfamiliar with the prepper oeuvre, he drove from Iowa to give a talk at the event after the expo reached out to him. 
He said demand for seeds went up 70% during COVID-19, the world-rattling event that caused many to think perhaps preppers were right to be concerned about the fragility of society’s systems. 
“I think there’s a lot of enthusiasm around gardening and food production, but there’s a huge gap, I think, when it comes to just functional seed-saving skill,” Bollinger said.  
A growing industry with long-term roots 
Prepping isn’t a new phenomenon. The modern incarnation originated in the 1950s, in part due to Cold War-era anxieties over nuclear warfare. The early manifestation of preppers — known as “retreaters” — stressed individualism and fleeing off-grid for survival purposes. 
Global catastrophes like COVID-19 and climate change-related natural disasters are fueling a growing number of modern preppers, including left-leaning survivalists. “Bug out” bags — backpacks filled with emergency survival supplies — are sold by online survival retailers for hundreds of dollars.

By some estimates, there are more than 20 million preppers in the U.S., defined as people who would be able to survive for at least 31 days at home without utilities or outside support. This is compared to a total of 7 million in 2018. 
Estimating the number of preppers can be difficult, especially because there’s no universal definition of what it means to be a prepper. Not everyone who makes small-scale disaster preparations — like storing blankets in the car in case of a snowstorm — would consider themselves preppers. 
The term tends to raise eyebrows. 
Margaret Engstrom, a first-time attendee of the convention, spoke about the stigma associated with the label. Engstrom said she had been interested in prepping for decades but wouldn’t describe herself as “hardcore.”
“I don’t think of myself as a nut job. I think of myself as alternative and prepared,” Engstrom said. 
As the number of preppers has grown, so has the survival tools market. A 2023 report from Zion Market Research projected that the industry would grow to $2.46 billion by 2030. Prepper conventions and expos like McKinley’s have been popping up around the country. PrepperShowsUSA, a website dedicated to advertising these events, lists several events per month across the country. 
McKinley is in the process of organizing his first prepper expo in Colorado, to take place in October.

What will save us? Community.  
In one of the fairground’s large, open air buildings, a colorful “Poultry and Rabbits” sign hung over the entrance. Vendors stood among tables lined with damascus steel knives, 3D printed gun holsters, apocalypse books and herbal remedies. 
Francis Majeski sat making cordage, a string made of natural fibers as a large fan next to him hummed. On his table, with bone needles and lyre lucets used for braiding, was a copy of “Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West,” which is about the western explorer who was the first white man to cross the Sierra Nevada, and is said to have drawn the map of the American West on a beaver skin.

Majeski didn’t identify strongly with the term “prepper.”  
“[I’m] not so much a survivalist as I practice the second-greatest commandment, love your neighbor as yourself,” Majeski said. 
In contrast to the typical image of the hyper-individualist, solitary prepper — consider the Nick Offerman character in “The Last of Us” — Majeski said community, not individualism, would be the ultimate key to survival in a disaster scenario. That’s why he makes an effort to reach out to others. 
“I get to know my neighbor across the street, even though his son ran their car into my garage,” Majeski joked. 
Majeski described himself as a Christian who voted for President Donald Trump but disagrees with many of his policies. He also rejected some of the ideas that seem to permeate prepper culture. 
Though Majeski plans to be more independent should anything happen — he now makes his own boot laces — he said there are limits. 
“We like to, in our arrogance, believe that we are going to be ready for everything. You’re not,” Majeski said.  
Still, mainstream prepper culture often emphasizes rugged individualism, touting guns and masculine portrayals harkening back to the ideals of westward expansion. In her book “American Apocalyptic,” Georgia College & State University professor and “liberal prepper” Juli Gittinger writes about the role that the American frontier myth still plays among many preppers. 
“Echoes of the frontier motif have been used repeatedly throughout the American political landscape, from Kennedy’s ‘New Frontier’ to Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ — an imagined reality where rugged individualism and self-reliance can overcome any obstacle (notably, non-white people who interfere with the divine providence of American destiny)…The frontier myth cultivates a particular brand of masculinity that intersects with the discourse on firearm ownership, survivalist/prepper cultures, ‘traditional’ (read: heteronormative) models of the family, and white superiority,” Gittinger writes in “American Apocalyptic.”

While these sentiments were not entirely absent from those at the convention, they also weren’t dominating the conversation. 
McKinley said that his goal with the expo is to foster community between preppers: “I hope that they’re connecting with each other, meeting other like-minded people, and learning to work together on things instead of going after each other,” he said. 
He reached out to many of the speakers and vendors personally. Amanda and Jake Sparrow got an invite after running into McKinley at a farmers market in Little Falls. 
The schedule of speakers included a note about inclusivity at the event: “Hate speech, bullying, or degrading comments referring to topics such as political affiliation, race, religion, culture, sexual orientation, gender or identity will NOT be tolerated.”
McKinley’s experience with disaster response is almost pedestrian: He was in North Dakota when high winds during a winter storm knocked down the power lines. The oil wildcatters who had recently moved to the area to open an oil field were not ready for it. 
“These young guys, they’ve never seen anything like that before, and they panicked. They broke the windows out of the two main grocery stores. They cleared the shelves off of bottled water and canned goods and stuff like that,” McKinley said.  
Since then, McKinley has been ensuring he has extra groceries and generators. His primary concerns when it comes to disasters are solar flares, electromagnetic eruptions from the sun, and pole reversals, which is when Earth’s magnetic north and south poles flip, which happens an average of every 300,000 years. 
McKinley was clear to say that he’s “not a gun collector,” though he does own guns.  
“My weapons all have a purpose, you know, and so I don’t have a lot of them,” McKinley said.

Vance Boelter, suspected assassin, described as a prepper   
Prepping caught national headlines at the end of June, when a court filing described suspected assassin Vance Boelter and his wife as preppers. Boelter is accused of killing Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, as well as shooting Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette. 
Boelter owned dozens of guns and had made a “bailout plan” for his family that included going to Jenny Boelter’s mother’s house in Wisconsin. The morning of the assassination, Boelter texted his family, writing that he “went to war last night” and that “there’s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don’t want you guys around.” 
The affidavit didn’t include many details about Boelter’s prepping, and Boelter didn’t feature in conversations at the convention. 
Boelter’s roommate, David Carlson, told the Star Tribune that the prepper label fit Boelter but he was uncertain how involved in prepping Boelter actually was. 
“He always thought there would be civil war or the government would fall,” Carlson said. “I knew he had some firearms or food, maybe. I only thought he had like five or 10 guns. I was shocked to find out he had so many.”

As the second day of the expo wound down, attendance thinned and vendors began packing up. A few speakers and attendees gathered around a campfire as the sun set over rows of trailers. The expo would go on for one more day. 
The following Wednesday, the Morrison County Fair was starting.

Satchel Paige became the first Black pitcher in American League history. 
His debut had been long anticipated, because he was already making headlines as a Negro Leagues pitcher, and sportswriters loved to quote him. Major League Baseball wrote of him, “Paige was baseball’s Mark Twain, but with a much better fastball.” Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio and Dizzy Dean all called him the best pitcher they had ever seen. 
Paige was born in 1906 in Mobile, Alabama. At age 13, he was caught trying to shoplift, and he spent the next five years at reform school. While there, his coach Edward Byrd taught him to pitch. He went on to pitch for the Negro Leagues as well as leagues in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and Mexico. By 1948, most people thought Paige was too old to pitch in Major League Baseball. He was already 42. 
“Age is a case of mind over matter,” he told reporters. “If you don’t mind, it don’t matter.” 
Then the Cleveland Indians signed him. He started out as a relief pitcher and made his first start on Aug. 13, 1948, where he threw a five-hit shutout in front of more than 50,000 fans, putting Cleveland back in first place. He helped Cleveland win the pennant and the World Series, ending the year with a 6-1 record with a 2.48 ERA and two shutouts. The Sporting News named him Rookie of the Year. 
Paige continued to pitch well into his 50s, retiring in 1953 — only to return in 1965 to pitch three innings for the Kansas City A’s. He faced 10 batters, “relaxing” in a rocking chair between innings. After allowing a first-inning double, he retired the Red Sox in the second and third innings. He was 59 at the time, making him the oldest player in Major League history. 
In 1971, he became the first Negro League veteran to be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, The Sporting News ranked him No. 19 among the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was depicted in the 1996 movie, “Soul of the Game,” about the Negro Leagues.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/08094520/July9-FeatImage-AP500528075.jpg,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193
,California,2025-07-09 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Newsom’s South Carolina visit should remove any doubts about his political goals,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/newsom-south-carolina-presidential-run/,South Carolina could host the first presidential primary again in 2028. Democratic politicians who see themselves as potential candidates are finding reasons to visit. Gavin Newsom went there this week.,"If anyone still harbors doubts that Gavin Newsom is contemplating a run for the White House in 2028, this week’s sojourn into South Carolina for some schmoozing with local politicians and photo ops with common folk should dispel them.
Although South Carolina is strongly Republican state, in 2024 the Democratic Party, at the behest of then-President Joe Biden, designated it as the first state to have a presidential primary. It could play that role again in 2028.
Thus, Democratic politicians who see themselves as potential candidates are — to no one’s surprise — finding reasons to visit the state. Newsom’s rationale is that he wants to know how cuts in federal health care programs are affecting South Carolinians.
Ever since winning a second and final term as governor three years ago, Newsom has obviously been building a national profile, all the while insisting that he had no presidential ambitions.
However, after spending half of his 57 years climbing the political ladder one rung at a time, it seemed unlikely that he would simply retire from politics after his governorship ended and return to running his wine and hospitality business.
Last month, Newsom acknowledged the possibility of a 2028 run in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, saying “I’m not thinking about running, but it’s a path that I could see unfold.” This week’s visit to South Carolina proves that he’s headed down that path.
Could Newsom pull it off?
When Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump last year, it opened the door for all Democratic hopefuls. The party is undergoing a post-election upheaval after losing not only the presidency but control of both houses of Congress.
There’s a sense that the nation’s voters are not buying what the party has been selling, but there’s no consensus on how it should change to win back disaffected voter blocs, nor is there a commanding figure to lead its transformation.
Newsom has been a vocal critic of the party’s failure to connect with blue-collar voters, particularly young men, but has yet to articulate an alternative approach. He’s also been slowly edging away from his previous image as a California progressive — much to the dismay of environmentalists, gay and transgender rights advocates and other left-leaning groups.
The lack of an obvious leader in what could be a crowded field of Democratic hopefuls creates an opening for Newsom to offer himself as someone who could put together a coalition of voter blocs capable of defeating the 2028 Republican candidate — most likely, at this early stage, Vice President JD Vance.
Early polling does place Newsom among the upper tier of potential Democratic candidates, although with barely double-digit support. Nevertheless, Newsom’s path to the White House — or at least to the Democratic nomination — is also filled with potholes, beginning with the inescapable fact that he’s from California.
The state’s image these days is a far cry from the land of sunshine and opportunity that it once enjoyed. Its chronic housing shortage, its squalid encampments of homeless people in the state’s major cities and its self-designation as a sanctuary for undocumented immigrants are potent campaign fodder for Newsom’s rivals — and his Republican opponent, should he win the nomination.
To many, Newsom also comes across as slick and glib rather than sincere, someone who bends reality to portray California and himself as leaders to be emulated. If Newsom is to become acceptable to South Carolinians and other voters across the nation, he will have to persuade them that his eight years as governor of California has earned him a promotion to the top rung on the ladder. 
That won’t be easy.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/070825-Newsom-South-Carolina-MK-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

All but two areas improved over last year.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The number of Alabama elementary and middle school students scoring below proficient dropped in most subjects on the Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) test, according to data released Tuesday by the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE).
The test results for the 2024-25 school year are split between four levels where level three and four are considered proficient. State Superintendent Eric Mackey said the number of students scoring below those levels dropped for every subject area except eighth-grade math. 
“Across the board in English language arts … we saw a reduction in level one and level two. Those are students below proficiency in pretty much every grade across the board,” Mackey told reporters after the State Board of Education meeting. “What it means is all those students are moving to proficiency levels. I was very excited to see that in level one, our lowest performance level, in every grade we saw fewer students than 2024.”
Public school students from second to eighth grade took the test last year. The scores released Tuesday reflect overall statewide performance. District and school-level data will be available in August. 
The English language arts test includes reading, in which second and third graders improved, but also reading comprehension and grammar, Mackey said.
The only stagnant data in proficiency was in seventh grade math and fourth grade science. In 2024, 38% of seventh graders scored in level one, which improved to 32% this year. However, Mackey said that not enough students were moving from level two to level three. The same percentage of seventh graders scored in level two in 2024 as there were in level one, but only 44% of students were in level two this year. Levels three and four were the same over the two years. For the fourth grade science scores, there were increases and decreases in each level, which evened out to 43% of fourth graders being proficient in science.
“We saw essentially the same thing in math with one little glitch in seventh grade that we’re still kind of worried about,” he said. “We’re still looking at that. It appears to be an alignment in curriculum issue because we see a rebound a little bit in eighth grade and high school.”
About 24% of seventh graders were proficient in math this year, largely unchanged from the 2023-24 school year. Eighth graders were 25% proficient in math, a 3% improvement over 2023-24, according to the data. 
Where 60% of second graders are proficient in ELA, 46% are proficient in math. Across all three subject areas, proficiency starts to drop in the sixth grade. 
Seventh and eighth grade students’ scores in math are lower than the other grades, which Mackey said is due in part to these students opting out of the required curriculum to take a higher level math. 
“Seventh and eighth grade math has always been an anomaly,” he said. “I’m worried about this, but it’s not my greatest worry because middle school math is complex for the whole country right now. There’s a serious drop for a lot of reasons, and part of it is screen time.”
But Mackey said he believes students are in a good spot. 
“This means we are pushing students to higher achievement across the state in every grade,” Mackey said.

ELL students proficient in English

According to data from the department, Alabama schools had over 50,000 students whose first language is not English. Of those, 2,670 (5.29%) tested in 2025 as proficient in the English language, an increase of about 0.7% over the 2023-24 school year. Mackey predicted that there would be 55,000 ELL students by next years’ data release.
“We have to remember that not all are coming to us at first grade, they’re coming to us all from all grades,” Alabama State Board of Education President Pro Tempore Kelly Mooney said.
If a student scores well enough on the test, they no longer require support service, but Mackey said the support is still available to them
“It takes most students way more than one or two years to read and write English proficiently to exit,” he said. “A lot of them are coming to us and they have had no or almost no formal schooling where they came from.”
High school testing
Mackey also said the state average on the ACT, the standardized test for college admissions, was 17.3 in 2024-25, down slightly from the 17.4 in 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years. The highest possible score on the ACT is a 36.
Currently the state administers the ACT test with the writing section to 11th graders, but it is an optional test. Mackey said making it optional, and having more options for a student to demonstrate college and career readiness, discourages students from performing well on the ACT test. 
“If a student is not going to college and their ACT scores aren’t going to count on their A through F report card, they may not go in there and try very hard,” Mackey said. “ And this, this number may continue to decline no matter what we do, because it’s not an accurate description of our college bound students.” 
Mackey suggested that the board revisit how high schoolers are tested, because the current model does not accurately reflect high schoolers, especially those intending to go to college.
“For accountability, we might move to a different kind of test,” Mackey said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9624-e1752006841809-1024x621.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

Criminal justice reform groups have asked the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to put more weight into a parole applicant's rehabilitative efforts than the severity of their crime in considering parole guidelines. (Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)Several criminal justice reform organizations want new parole guidelines under consideration by the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles to use a scoring system that puts more weight into an applicant’s rehabilitation efforts than the original crime.
The proposed guidelines, made available to the public in the latter part of May after years of delays, would guide the board’s decision in determining an applicant’s fitness for parole.
“The modifications that we suggest are more in line with a parole board that is trying to accomplish the mission of reintegrating people who are ready to get back into society and rebuild their lives,” said Dev Wakeley, a policy advocate with Alabama Arise who provided input regarding the comments. “We all know that the parole board has had major issues over the last several years particularly, and we want to make sure the updated guidelines become a way to make positive changes instead of paper over the real problems that we have seen.”
The guidelines — which are not binding on the board’s parole decisions — operate on a point system in which more points mean less likelihood of a parole applicant getting parole. Those who receive at least 9 points based on the proposed updated guidelines are recommended to be denied parole.
Some sections of the parole guidelines remained the same, while others were changed in a manner that further limits the potential for applicants to be granted parole.
The proposed guidelines recommend issuing points based on the severity of the offense, with one point for less-severe ones and four points for those that are “very high.” The current point system has three categories, with offenses that are low severity given zero points while those that are considered the most severe are assigned two points.
The proposed guidelines do not issue any points for people without any discipline issues within the past year, but impose a five-point penalty if the applicant had two or more disciplinaries that included violence in the past 12 months.
The Southern Poverty Law Center, Alabama Arise, and the ACLU of Alabama collaborated on a single review while staff from Alabama Appleseed submitted their comments separately. Both groups proposed reducing points for specific sections, including the severity of the original offense.
SPLC and ACLU of Alabama recommended that offenses with low severity not be given any weight while the most severe crimes are designated two points.
“The parole hearing application process is not a forum to relitigate the underlying offense — the sentence the applicant is currently serving,” the groups wrote in their submission. “The process is meant to assess and determine the individual’s ‘status’ of rehabilitation. That said, ‘low’ offense severity has been shown to be a statistically significant positive indicator of fitness for release and accordingly should not result in a negative consequence for petitioners.”
Alabama Appleseed recommended that the parole board return to the previous scoring system that considers the severity of the offense.
“Our experience in Alabama backs up what the research shows: conviction of a more serious offense does not equate with increased risk of reoffense on parole and risk to public safety,” Alabama Appleseed said in its statement.
Behavior behind bars
SPLC, Alabama Arise and the ACLU of Alabama also want to give point reductions to parole applicants without infractions in the prior year and max out points for those offenses at four, while providing mitigation for incidents that applicant did not instigate.
“Given the undisputedly violent conditions inside Alabama’s correctional facilities, it would be unreasonable and cruel to house individuals in these settings and then punish them for defending themselves by assessing points for the mere act of survival,” they said in their proposed changes.
Alabama Appleseed proposed subtracting a point for applicants without any disciplinary infractions for at least the past three years and giving additional credit for longer periods without violations.  It also suggested imposing three points for those with at least one disciplinary infraction that involved violence for the past 12 months and four points for applicants with multiple violent offenses. In both cases, the applicants should have instigated the violent incident.
“The ability to follow strict institutional rules and avoid conflict with other individuals in overcrowded, unairconditioned, dilapidated, understaffed prisons and avoid disciplinaries year after year is a strong indicator that someone has developed the skills and character to do extremely well outside of prison,” Appleseed staff wrote.
Additionally, Alabama Appleseed wants to expand the number of programs that give people who have been incarcerated credit if they participate, and impose not more than one point for those who have not secured housing or a job as part of their reentry plan, while allowing a one-point credit for those who have included housing or job arrangement.
The proposed parole guideline allows the parole board to issue two points for applicants who have not made any effort to put forward a reentry plan.
“It seems blatantly unfair to penalize incarcerated individuals for their inability to secure housing while in prison when a statewide commission has cited gaps in the state’s own provision of services as a reason for the struggles accessing housing,” Alabama Appleseed said in the comments.
Community input
Advocates also weighed in on the influence of community input.
The group that included Alabama Arise, SPLC and the ACLU of Alabama want the parole guidelines to remove a point if no one in the community opposes applicants getting parole, but points would be imposed if the public opposed parole.
Alabama Appleseed wants a point system that is based on input from those who are more familiar with the applicant. Applicants would get a one-point reduction if representatives from the Alabama Department of Corrections or a parole officer supported individuals getting granted parole, for example. Points would be imposed if there was opposition from law enforcement or advocacy groups, with more assessed if the victim or victims opposed parole.
The public comment period will last for the next few weeks at which point a legislator can request that the Legislative Council review the proposed guidelines and can either accept, amend or reject them.
The parole board published the updated guidelines several weeks after the Alabama Legislature approved an amendment offered by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, that made funding for the parole board contingent on the members updating the guidelines.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_017-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 08:06:53.618186

Joe Lombardo this year. (Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)When North Dakota state Sen. Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that are sealing or expunging eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”
The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
 Compromises

Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
 Elsewhere

Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.
Lombardo’s vetoes once again thwart tenant-friendly housing reforms

This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed several tenant protection bills, including one that would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another that sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EvictionCourt_RC_103123_001-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-07-09 09:10:30.589193

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)On the morning that Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband were assassinated, I was speaking to a civic group on the dangers of political polarization. 
I opened by reflecting on our increasingly violent political climate as indicated by these shootings and last year’s attempted assassination of Donald Trump.
At a lunch table afterward, someone challenged me. “That Trump thing,” she said, “was staged. It was set up to make him look brave.” 
Startled, I asked about the blood. “Faked by the Secret Service when they tackled him.” 
The man killed?  “A mistake.” 
This was from a woman who 30 minutes before had argued that religious fanatics are causing today’s polarization.
Later that day, voices on the other side of the political spectrum insinuated that Gov. Tim Walz was somehow responsible for Hortman’s death because he had appointed the alleged killer to a volunteer advisory board. Or crazy Marxists were behind it. 
I was feeling whiplash.
Two tragedies. Two shocking theories. One disturbing pattern: If a terrible event can help the other side, they must have orchestrated it.
This partisan reflex is connected to what social scientists refer to as zero-sum bias — the tendency to assume that a gain for an out-group creates a loss for the in-group. It also stems from motivated reasoning about politics: We don’t just take in public facts neutrally — we filter them through our political identities. If an event seems to bolster our opponents, we instinctively look for a way to discredit it or blame them for it. Think 9/11 (Bush set it up to justify war) or the Sandy Hook kindergarten massacre (a hoax by gun control fanatics).
Of course, tragic events often do have political consequences. A shooting can lead to pressure for gun control. An assassination attempt can rally support. 
Consequences, however, are not the same as causes. Correlation does not prove conspiracy.
But in our era of conflict entrepreneurs, viral social media, and deep mistrust of institutions, the leap from “this helps them” to “they set it up” is becoming more common — and more reflexive.

While it’s summer and classrooms are quiet, school board work across Vermont is anything but. With the passage of H.454 and major education transformation on the horizon, school boards from Arlington to Canaan are deep in discussion, preparing for what comes next. Decisions made now will shape the future of public education in rural Vermont and communities are stepping up to make sure their voices are heard.
The Rural School Community Alliance is a grassroots group representing over 100 of these communities across Vermont. We stand for the values, expectations and hopes rural Vermonters have for their children’s educations, their communities’ well-being and the future of rural life in our state. We advocate for strong, community-based public schools and for rural Vermonters to have a democratic voice in decisions about their future.
Vermont is a rural state with the highest percentage of rural students in the nation (54%). Over 70% of Vermont’s schools are considered rural.

RSCA was formed in January to bring Vermont-specific data, national research and firsthand rural experience into the Statehouse debate over H.454. We worked in a bipartisan manner to ensure the voices of rural communities were heard. We advocated transparently for small but meaningful changes to the legislation. These changes were adopted in the Senate and for the most part preserved in the final version of the bill. 
While H.454 isn’t perfect, we believe it includes enough safeguards to allow for our continued engagement in the legislative process. We now turn our attention to the next phase: the appointment of a redistricting task force. This group will shape Vermont’s future education system, and its work carries both opportunity and risk. 
We are moving forward with good will, knowing that Supervisory Unions are to be included as part of the charge of the redistricting task force.
Supervisory unions are made up of multiple school districts working collaboratively to reduce costs, increase efficiency and improve educational opportunities. Each SU shares a superintendent, central office and board with representation from each district in the Union.
SUs are vital to the success of rural public education in Vermont. They offer a practical balance: schools keep local decision-making while gaining the financial and operational benefits of shared services. Among governance models, SUs are the most transparent, cost-effective and educationally sound option Vermont has.
We believe Vermont can thoughtfully create larger SUs to meet the goals of H.454, especially with adjustments for the unique needs of low-population regions and areas with geographic barriers.
RSCA sees potential for cost savings and improved quality, but only if SUs remain the core governance model for rural Vermont. Already, school districts and SU boards involved with RSCA are debating and considering information for the task force that reflects the needs of their regions and will support the task at hand. 
Over the last six months, aspects of our work have become clear. In rural Vermont:
Equity matters. Rural families are saying clearly that equity does not mean “newer and fewer.” It means strong and local. Young children should be educated close to home in excellent elementary schools of all sizes. Accessible schools are essential to rural families.
Research shows that even high-quality educational offerings are of little benefit if children must spend hours on a bus to reach them. Strong, local public schools grounded in their communities are a cornerstone of educational equity for rural children.
Place matters. Young families want to live in close-knit communities with strong local schools: places with childcare, preschool and elementary education at their heart. For rural Vermont communities to thrive, they need young families to stay, return or choose to move there.
Educational opportunities centered in place will bring them. Closed schools, depopulation, diminished economic opportunities and declining home values will turn them away. 
Democracy matters. People are losing faith in democracy. That’s why any new system must strengthen, not weaken, their connection to democratic decision-making.
Rural Vermont is skilled in democratic decision-making; it is rooted in our history and practiced regularly as we grapple to solve problems locally. It is a strength, not a flaw, and we must protect it. In rural Vermont we protect democracy by practicing it.
As Vermonters work to build a sustainable, high-quality and cost-effective education system for the future, it must reflect and respect these rural values. That means equity, and it means community-centered and strong local voices in governance.
Thriving rural community schools, working together in supervisory unions, are at the heart of this vision.

When the new U.S. Citizenship Office in Colchester opened in 2022, it was dedicated to Capt. John Lonergan as a Medal of Honor recipient and a naturalized citizen.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  William L. McKone: Immigrants, loyalty and Gettysburg.","This commentary is by William L. McKone of South Burlington. He is president of the Fenian Historical Society, and author of “Vermont’s Irish Rebel: Captain John Lonergan.” He is a former Cold War intelligence analyst who resigned from the National Security Agency in 1983 in protest against President Reagan’s security policies.


In St. Joseph’s Cemetery on Archibald Street in Burlington, the graves in a family plot in the Irish section, set off from the French and Syrian-Lebanese groupings, have only humble markers, except for an impressive monument to Capt. John Lonergan. Born in County Tipperary, he raised a company of Irishmen, Vermont’s only ethnic unit, that served in the Union forces for nine months in the Civil War.
Their only battle was at Gettysburg, where Lonergan’s gallantry was recognized with a Medal of Honor. He led his company as the spearhead of the two Vermont regiments ordered to attack the Confederate flank on July 3, 1863, at the crucial moment that helped turn back the final rebel assault on Cemetery Ridge.
Many of Lonergan’s men were Irish-born immigrants who, like his own family, fled as refugees when the disastrous failure of the potato crop called the Great Hunger drove them from Ireland. Out of a population of 8 million, a million died of hunger and disease while another million escaped into exile. Large numbers of Irish came to America, often by way of British North America (later called Canada) since travel there was less costly from British ports.
Reacting to this influx of immigrants — often illiterate and speaking little English, Catholic, and many ill and impoverished — Burlington in 1849 prohibited all steamships from dropping any Irish off in the port without medical inspection. Concern for disease was the only check on immigration at this time and the Lonergan family settled in the town that year. Lonergan’s father was a skilled craftsman, a cooper who opened his own shop making barrels; each of his sons learned this trade, much in demand at the port.
John Lonergan joined the Vermont militia in Brandon as a private in 1860, but the next year he organized his own militia company of Irishmen, the Emmet Guards, in Burlington. When war broke out in April of 1861, he was ready to muster for the initial 90-day federalization by Lincoln. 
Not chosen at the time, his Irish company was selected for duty in the 3-year call-up in May when the 2nd  Vermont Regiment assembled in Burlington. However, Gov. Fairbanks found fault with his company and disbanded it, partly because of his prejudice against the Irish. Lonergan persisted, raising another company the next year under a new governor, and served to preserve the Union that had sheltered so many immigrants in their time of need.
Even if born in the country, some of the soldiers might not have been considered citizens because the 14th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing birthright citizenship was not ratified until 1868 and many of those foreign born had not undergone naturalization. At this time, the British did not recognize the right of persons born in the United Kingdom to renounce their citizenship. 
After the war, Lonergan did become a naturalized citizen, taking the oath of allegiance in 1867. Possibly he was encouraged to do so by his employment as a seasonal U.S. Customs inspector under his former brigade commander at Gettysburg, Gen. Stannard. Lonergan was at this time also the head of the Vermont branch of the Fenian Brotherhood, the militant Irish nationalists fighting the British empire to restore the independence of Ireland.
He explained later that his loyalty was strong for both the United States and his birthplace, “When an Irishman takes a wife, as he is sometimes liable to, is he likely to forget his mother? American is the Irishman’s wife, but he does not forget his mother Ireland.”
When the new U.S. Citizenship Office in Colchester opened under President Biden in June of 2022, it was dedicated to Capt. John Lonergan as a Medal of Honor recipient and a naturalized citizen. Since I had published his biography, “Vermont’s Irish Rebel,” in 2014, I was honored to speak at the impressive dedication ceremony.
This included the naturalization of 14 new citizens (a nod to Vermont’s role as the 14th  state), who solemnly swore to “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic.” They qualified to be naturalized only after passing an examination that many of our native-born citizens might find challenging; the oath is similar to that sworn by the military and other government officials.
On April 14, 2025, Mohsen Mahdawi, a student holding a green card for 10 years, was summoned to this Colchester facility as a final step in his naturalization process. But this was a change in the schedule that made him suspicious, so he notified our three Vermont congressional representatives.
As he feared, he was detained at the facility by masked agents who transported him away in an unmarked vehicle. Sens. Sanders and Welch, along with Rep. Balint, objected to this action calling it “immoral, inhumane, and illegal,” and Mahdawi was released by a federal judge on May 30. 
After his life of fighting against injustice and oppression, Lonergan might well have turned over in his grave on Archibald Street had he known that his name was associated with such a violation.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana officials are assessing the financial impact on the state budget of the nearly 1,000-page priority megabill President Donald Trump signed into law Friday.
Formerly known as the “big, beautiful bill,” it will reform the nation’s welfare programs, extend 2017 tax cuts and invest billions of dollars to ramp up deportation efforts for noncitizens. 
The contentious measure narrowly advanced through both chambers of Congress, largely along party-line votes with a handful of Republican defectors that didn’t include any of Indiana’s delegation. 
Any impact to the federal budget largely depends on one’s political lens — with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculating a $3.25 trillion deficit while Republicans, using a so-called “budget trick,” say it will save $507 billion.

Impacts for the average Hoosier include a tax deduction for federal taxes on tips and overtime alongside phased out clean energy incentives, as detailed by the IndyStar. And according to U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, of Fort Wayne, the tax increase without the bill would have been $1,936 for the average Hoosier family.
But how the megabill will effect Indiana’s finances and the state budget is far less certain. Some provisions may indirectly have a long-term impact that’s more difficult to measure, such as the slightly higher take-home pay or fewer farm and construction workers following immigration raids. 
Additionally, some of the biggest reductions — like Medicaid reform — will be phased in, meaning it won’t immediately hit Indiana’s coffers. Still, according to early estimates, Indiana could lose out on hundreds of millions in health care provider taxes and pay millions more to administer food programming. This comes on the heels of a $2 billion projected revenue shortfall that disrupted the 2025 legislative session and prompted cuts across the board for state agencies.
Gov. Mike Braun’s communications team didn’t respond to questions about the megabill and its fiscal impact on Indiana, instead touting his support for Trump’s priorities. 
“Here in Indiana, we’ve shown what conservative, responsible leadership looks like. Thanks to strong Republican management, we’ve protected our AAA credit rating, maintained healthy reserves, and kept Indiana one of the best-managed states in the nation. The Big Beautiful Bill takes important steps to safeguard Medicaid for the Hoosiers who truly need it by finally cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. We’ll continue working closely with our federal partners and agency leaders to implement the changes thoughtfully, protecting essential services while living within our means,” he said in a statement.
 What about Medicaid?

The new law seeks to cut more than $1.1 trillion nationwide, with most of those dollars coming from Medicaid. Experts estimate that 11.8 million people could lose their insurance coverage — whether Medicaid or on the federal marketplace — by 2034. 
Greater numbers of uninsured people could hit rural hospitals especially hard because they operate on thin profit margins and serve greater numbers of Medicaid enrollees.
Four congressional Democrats wrote that 338 hospitals would be impacted by Medicaid reductions, naming a dozen Indiana hospitals deemed to be at risk. To mitigate those concerns, the U.S. Senate created a $50 billion fund for rural hospitals — but it’s unclear how much of that could be dedicated to Indiana. 
A KFF analysis estimates the state will lose out on $23 billion over the next ten years for Medicaid, with the biggest portion of those losses attributed to work requirements for able-bodied adults. Hoosiers could fall off the rolls for several reasons: paperwork errors, not working or making too much money to meet eligibility levels.
‘Indiana needs a HIP replacement’, social services secretary says about insurance program

Newly passed work requirements largely seem to align with what Indiana lawmakers imposed earlier this year with one exception: Indiana’s exception applies to all parents, while the federal exception to work requirements is limited to parents with children under the age of 14. 
The work requirements apply to those in the Healthy Indiana Plan, which covers low- to moderate-income adults. Last month, the Family and Social Services secretary, who oversees the state’s Medicaid program, warned that the megabill could fundamentally change HIP because of a proposed cap on provider taxes. 
“That’s how we pay for the Healthy Indiana Plan,” Secretary Mitch Roob told lawmakers. “If (the proposal is) signed into law, this would require the state of Indiana to significantly roll back eligibility in the Healthy Indiana Plan.
“Not because we want to — because we have no match.”
Indiana currently taxes Medicaid providers at the maximum rate of 6%, netting $1.6 billion from hospitals in the 2024 fiscal year which, in turn, was used to leverage $5.5 billion in reimbursements from the federal government. 
That $1.6 billion, along with revenue from the state’s cigarette tax, paid for Indiana’s 10% stake in HIP, while the federal government picked up 90% of the tab.
Congress set a new limit of 3.5% for provider taxes in the megabill, slashing the amount Indiana can collect. FSSA didn’t have an estimate for how much it would collect under the 3.5% threshold, noting that it currently has a waiver under consideration to restructure the provider tax. That pending application would also impose a provider tax on Managed Care Entities for the first time following legislation from earlier this year.
 And what about SNAP?

Congress also approved work requirements for food benefits, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, for those up to the age of 64. The federal government funds all of the costs associated with SNAP and states pick up part of the tab for administrative costs. Now, more costs will be the responsibility of states. 
Indiana has 588,184 SNAP beneficiaries across 281,112 households, as of April 2025. The average household gets $409.37 per month to assist with food purchasing. 
FSSA’s Marcus Barlow, the deputy chief of staff and communications director, said the state currently has a $97 million obligation for SNAP’s administrative costs. That number is expected to go up by $49 million to $146 million.
The state will bear an additional cost of $147 million due to its 9.52% error rate for 2024. States with error rates below 6% saw far smaller increases. Together, the state is expected to spend $196 million more on SNAP once these cuts take effect.
The Hill reported that states will be required to partially fund SNAP beginning in 2028 — two years after the midterms.
As noted by the Food Research & Action Center, error rates aren’t the same as fraud, which is rare. Standard error reporting was paused during the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to a spike in error rates when reporting resumed.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 3.2 million people may lose access to SNAP under the megabill, which advocates say will increase food insecurity.

However, the current plan has some residents crying foul, arguing the proposal will create more development, but not more affordable housing. 
The city first began crafting the new plan in the Summer of 2023. Under state law, Michigan communities must have a master plan on file to serve as a guide for development and ensure any developments meet certain criteria. 
While the plan is still in draft form – with another draft on the way – some Ann Arborites are calling on the commission and the city council to “pause the plan” arguing the draft is misguided, raising concerns with several of the projections included in the document and calling for more public outreach in shaping the project plan. 
Residents argue public should be more involved in planning process
Tom Stulberg, a member of the steering team for the Ann Arbor Neighborhood Network, told the Michigan Advance that the group would like city officials to pause their efforts on the plan to engage with residents at a neighborhood level, so each neighborhood could be evaluated for what might work in each area. From that engagement the city could assemble a community vision on what the citizens of Ann Arbor want the future of the city to look like. 
John Godfrey, another member of the group’s steering team said the Neighborhood Network was launched out of concerns that the comprehensive plan process was moving forward without residents knowing about it, pointing to a goal of reconnecting residents with civic life. 
According to the group’s website, it has gathered more than 3,600 signatures on a petition calling on the city council to suspend the planning process and take steps to unite the community by ensuring all residents are fully informed about the comprehensive plan. 
“I think we’re moving toward a new level of just civic engagement. If we can sustain this after the comprehensive plan, and find ways to bring the residents together into more regular conversations with one another, not directed by the city, but directed by the residents themselves. That would be a good and healthy thing to do,” Godfrey said. 
He pointed to Boulder, Colorado and Madison, Wisconsin as examples of how Ann Arbor should be approaching their comprehensive plan, noting that those plans were driven by input from neighborhoods.

Lisa Disch, councilmember for Ann Arbor’s Ward 1 and the council’s representative on the city planning commission, said there have been a number of opportunities for the public to engage and offer input on the plan, noting that the consultants working with the city on the plan held several meetings at the city’s downtown and branch libraries as well as events at summer festivals and fairs. 
However, she said the Ann Arbor Neighborhood Network’s opposition to aspects of the planning process has drawn a lot of attention to the plan, bringing on an unforeseen round of public engagement through May. 
According to the project’s website, the council began stakeholder interviews and data collection in Fall 2023, and distributed an online survey in Winter 2024, holding public engagement sessions in April and May of this year following the release of the draft plan. 
As of April of this year, the planning commission and the city council have held eight open houses, had more than 30 participants in seven small group discussions and targeted outreach efforts, held more than 20 interviews with individuals, while the city has received more than 3,100 survey responses.
However, members of the Ann Arbor Neighborhood Network have emphasized the survey’s non-scientific nature, pointing to a disclaimer noting that the survey was not intended to statistically represent the entire community. 
In a May 5 memo sent to the city council, the network argued the city council’s outreach efforts were insufficient, with the city failing to mail residents a notice about the effort and how to engage. 
In retrospect, Disch said she might have thought about sending out a postcard earlier in the process. 
“It seems like a pretty simple thing, and it might have caught more people’s attention, but it might not have. They might have just thrown them out, and we get a bunch of those bounced back,” she said. 
Following the release of the next draft of the plan, Disch said there will be a 63-day comment period on the revised draft, which she expects will begin in late summer and early fall and will likely be accompanied by a community-wide mailing with information on how to participate. 
Questions on goals and debates on housing needs
Alongside concerns around engagement, the Neighborhood Network also raised concerns about several pieces of data within the plan, arguing that the current draft fails to meet both best practices for city planning and the state’s requirements that a master plan include guidelines and strategies for providing “a range of housing types, costs, affordability, attainability, ages, and other characteristics, including single- and multiple-family dwellings, to serve the housing demands of a diverse population.”
In a May 5 memo to the city council and the planning commission, the network slammed the initial draft of the proposal, arguing the plan puts forth goals, without citing proper evidence or offering any methodology, while failing to consider the impacts new housing development would have on infrastructure, demographics, the tax burden on local communities and its effects on the city’s long-term financial stability.
The group has also split with the city council on the best way to address Ann Arbor’s steep housing costs.

Looking toward 2050, one of the draft comprehensive plan’s goals is to increase the supply and diversify the types of housing available for households of different sizes, abilities and income levels. 
Disch compared the severity of Ann Arbor’s housing affordability issues to those in San Francisco, identifying zoning constraints as part of that problem.
In hopes of addressing these issues, the council is looking to bring more homes into single-family zoned areas, with Disch explaining that it should be possible to build at least two homes per parcel in the city’s lowest density residential areas under this plan.
While the city’s current housing stock mostly consists of single family homes and multifamily apartments and condos, the new comprehensive plan would look to add more medium-density housing – like duplexes, triplexes, quadraplexes, townhomes and court housing – into existing neighborhoods. 
However, Stulberg, a former subdivision developer, noted that simply building these missing middle housing types does not equal missing middle prices.

Godfrey argued the planning commission and city council had taken too straightforward an approach to the issue, contending the city’s issue stems from affordability rather than supply. 
While the plan calls for sustainability and to reduce the number of commuters to reduce carbon emissions, an increased supply of expensive housing within the city could result in population growth without reducing the number of commuters, Stulberg said, as developers build more affordable housing in the greater Ann Arbor area. 
Godfrey also noted that developers within the city are responding to the influx of college students – with enrollment at the University of Michigan reaching a record high in 2024 – by building up expensive high rises close to campus. 
Developers are also targeting retirees and alums who are looking to relive their college days, meaning that the market is not responsive to the individuals who cannot afford to live in the city, he said. 
Instead of relying on the market to provide affordable housing, Godfrey pointed to other community based solutions like cooperative housing and the Ann Arbor Community Land Trust, which aims to offer affordable housing options to critical workers who are otherwise unable to afford a home in the city. 
Throughout most of the country, affordability is tied to income, as people who earn less than the average income are unable to afford housing in their area, Godfrey said. However, Ann Arbor has become a major job center. With hubs like the university and its hospital, and high amenities within the city, the issue lies with supply, Disch argued. 
She also emphasized that it will take time to catch up with the excess demand and stabilize rental costs. 
Greg Matthews, one of the lead organizers of Neighbors for More Neighbors Ann Arbor, a coalition of residents in support of the draft plan, said the lack of building for years has led the city to its crisis of affordability. While increasing supply is necessary, it’s not a silver bullet, Matthews said. 
While loosening zoning regulations that prevent the buildup of different types of housing options in order will help meet demand for housing, new developments also support funding for the Ann Arbor Housing Commission, which provides housing to low-income residents. 
However, tax rates for current Ann Arbor homeowners are capped, meaning that new developments, whose property values are not capped, will bring in additional revenue for subsidized housing. 
“I think all of Ann Arbor can approach these issues with open minds and open hearts and understand that the status quo isn’t working and that change is badly needed,” Matthews said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9475-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 07:11:43.232713

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)While the U.S. military was damaging Iran’s nuclear capability with “bunker busting” bombs and cruise missiles, members of Congress sat idly by, watching CNN or FOX, to get their talking points. Then they launched their own bombardment of news releases, and rushed for the television cameras for talking-head interviews.
What they failed to do was exercise their constitutional duty (Article 1, Section 8) to oversee the use of America’s brave fighting men and women in one of the most dangerous (and daring) military operations in history.
Not a single vote was taken. No “ayes” or “nays” were heard. No buttons pushed. No stealthy hand signals to a clerk, indicating their position.
You won’t find a roll call of how Indiana’s delegation (Republican and Democrat) stood on the issue.
How did Congress become so wimpy? Why has it abdicated its most powerful constitutional duty while increasingly autocratic presidents wield unlimited power over the lives of our warfighters, and the future of our nation, and the world?
Not long ago, Congress had guts. And fortitude. Members understood their role in protecting our nation.
Trump: Iran nuclear facilities ‘completely and totally obliterated’ in U.S. strike on 3 sites

In November, 1973, they overwhelmingly passed what has become known as the “War Powers Act,” which requires the president to notify Congress (prior to the bombs dropping, if possible) of any insertion of American troops into hostilities. It further imposes a “60-day deadline for withdrawal” of those troops. The purpose was to rein in the autocratic use of American fighting power in Cambodia.
For history nerds, the Indiana House delegation voted 6-5 against the override of Nixon’s veto, along party lines (John Myers, David Dennis, Elwood Hillis, Earl Landgrebe, Roger Zion and William Bray all voted no; John Brademas, Lee Hamilton, Andy Jacobs, Floyd Fithian, and Phil Hayes all voted yes). Both U.S. Senators (Birch Bayh and Vance Hartke, voted for the override).
Those names should bring back memories. Each put their political future on the line. As it should have been.
Congress used to take its constitutional obligations seriously. Polls did not determine its level of engagement. Congress has declared War 11 times. As early as the War of 1812, it established a “special committee” to oversee the conduct of the War. Again, for the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War, and World War II, special committees were established for the same purpose. The Truman Committee (chaired by future president Harry Truman) intervened in all aspects of World War II, from holding contractors accountable, to pressuring the president and the Pentagon to adjust war strategy.
Why not the Civil War? Well, that is not on the list, because it was a rebellion, not a declared war. But in fact, the most powerful war committee in American history (the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, chaired by Benjamin Wade, R-Ohio) oversaw virtually every aspect of the Civil War, uprooting sutler corruption, calling generals before the committee to answer for battle failures, even helping to force out wimpy generals (there’s that word again), like George McClellan, for a failure to lead.
The War Powers Act worked, briefly. It was invoked under President Gerald Ford during the U.S.S. Mayaguez capture (he notified Congress, but only after it was virtually over). During President Ronald Reagan’s tenure, it was invoked both for Lebanon (1982) and Grenada (1983). Reagan agreed to the 60-day withdrawal of Marines in Lebanon. In Grenada, he did not notify Congress until the shooting match was over. In 1991, President George H.W. Bush did get congressional support for the first Gulf War, but claimed it was not constitutionally required. President Bill Clinton launched unauthorized airstrikes in Yugoslavia in 1999, but refused to comply with the 60-day withdrawal. And Congress refused to stand up to him. When President Barack Obama attacked Libya in 2011, he did not notify Congress. He claimed the airstrikes didn’t constitute “hostilities.”
I guess they were friendly bombs?
Congress abandoned the War Powers Act in 2001, when it passed a “track them down and kill them” resolution, post 9/11. And in 2002, it passed an Authorized Use of Military Force (AUMF) to support the misguided invasion of Iraq, relying on faulty intelligence. Since then, all insertions of U.S. military might have been predicated upon this AUMF, even though it was precisely limited to the Iraq invasion.

A healthy democracy doesn’t suppress those disagreements or turn them into weapons — it channels them.

Melissa Hortman carried that burden splendidly. Everything I’ve read, and the little I was able to personally witness, demonstrates that she stepped into public life not to erase disagreement, but to organize it and to make it productive.

Hortman’s killing is a personal loss for her friends and family and a civic one for those of us who love Minnesota. The implicit promise that we provide our neighbors in elected office is that we will resolve our differences through their arguments, not our violence. If our politics becomes a place where disagreement puts lives at risk, public life enters a disastrously vicious cycle: fewer capable people will step forward. Fewer disagreements will be constructively resolved. Persuasive disagreement will be replaced by performative violence — rhetorical at first, then literal.
I pray we have not already entered that cycle. But if we have, then this moment demands a deeper commitment to what Hortman practiced. Those of us in and around public life must name what was lost and defend what it represented. The answer to political violence is not less politics, but clearer arguments and deeper civic trust.
In the days and hours after Hortman’s death, the familiar noise of social media followed, as it so often does in moments like this. Some denounced the tributes offered by Republican officials as hollow. If they truly mourned her, they would abandon their principles and adopt Democratic-Farmer-Labor policy preferences. From the other end, the same tributes were dismissed as RINO Republican pandering to the respectability politics of a party that would never return the favor.
But if we are to learn anything from Melissa Hortman’s example, it must be the belief that disagreement, even sharp, principled, partisan disagreement, is not a danger to democracy, but its design.

As we celebrate this milestone, it is important to remind ourselves that everyone’s vote defines a democracy. However, more than 50,000 Missourians are barred from voting because they are on probation or parole.
Missouri is one of 15 states that do not restore voting rights until the end of a person’s supervision post-incarceration, including the completion of probation or parole. People who have served their time and have been released back into society may have to wait years before being eligible to vote. The current law disenfranchises tax-paying citizens who want to engage with their civic duty.
We need to demand that Missouri legislators restore people’s right to vote who are on probation or parole. In recent years, the state legislature has created bipartisan legislation to support its constituents who otherwise cannot cast a ballot.
State Rep. Melanie Stinnett, a Republican from Springfield, and State Sen. Kurtis Gregory, a Republican from Marshall, filed bills to restore voting rights while on probation or parole but they did not pass. All Missourians should support future bills like H.B. 617 and S.B. 714 that have the potential to protect public safety, increase civic engagement, and extend freedom to all citizens.
Granting people on probation or parole the right to vote would not only increase election turnout but would also be beneficial for all Missourians. Expanding the right to vote reduces recidivism, creating safer communities. People who are formerly incarcerated are less likely to reoffend when they are contributing members of society. Voting is a simple and effective way to prevent crime. 
In addition, people on probation or parole have an increased trust in government when they can vote. Justice-involved individuals are often wary of the government because of their own experiences within the system. Missouri can promote a stronger sense of civic responsibility among all its residents by allowing returning citizens to vote.
Formerly incarcerated people have served their time and should not be further punished by an unjust law. Individuals cannot fully reintegrate into society without voter restoration. They deserve the same right to vote as everyone else. 
Lawmakers should expand voting rights because it is in line with what the United States stands for: Democracy for all. Whole communities will flourish, and state legislators can be a part of positive change. We, the people, need to demand Missouri legislators pass a law that restores a person’s right to vote if they are on probation or parole.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Three unions that represent New Jersey State Police have sued New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin in a bid to block his investigation into whether troopers deliberately slowed down traffic enforcement in response to claims of racial profiling in stops.
Union officials want a state judge to toss five subpoenas Platkin’s office issued in April demanding documents and ordering them to appear before a state grand jury probing the alleged slowdown. They also want the judge to bar the outside attorneys Platkin appointed from investigating further.
In three lawsuits filed late last month, union leaders refute claims of racial profiling, insist the 3,000-member agency is already subject to robust oversight, and accuse Platkin of unconstitutional, retaliatory interference with their rights to advocate for union members.
“In serving the subject subpoenas upon Plaintiffs, the NCOA and its President and three Vice Presidents, Defendants have, by threats, intimidation, coercion or force, engaged in a bald-faced, outrageous attempt at union busting,” states a complaint filed by the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association of New Jersey. The group represents 1,000 state police sergeants.
The State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey, a 1,900-member union that represents troopers and detectives, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association, which represents lieutenants and captains, also filed complaints in state Superior Court in Mercer County, naming the state as well as Platkin as defendants.
The first complaint was filed June 19 — the same day several state legislators introduced a bill that would remove the state police from Platkin’s control. The agency now is part of the state department of law and public safety, which Platkin helms; the seven legislators who sponsored the bill want to make the state police its own department answerable directly to the governor.
Platkin’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the new lawsuits.
Tensions have grown between the state police and Platkin almost since Gov. Phil Murphy nominated him for the post in February 2022. The state police’s union leaders accused Platkin in their June complaints of “continuous and systematic attacks.”
Those lawsuits stem from a report Platkin released in July 2023, in which an academic researcher reviewed more than 6 million traffic stops from 2009 to 2021 and found state troopers stopped, searched, and used force against Black and Hispanic motorists far more than they did against white motorists. Platkin paired the report’s release with an announcement that he would launch a pilot program aimed at reducing racial and ethnic disparities in traffic enforcement statewide.
 Several New Jersey police unions issued notices in 2023 alerting state troopers to “the perils of motor vehicle stops.” The notices now figure prominently in a legal battle between the unions and New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin.
Union leaders acted quickly. Within a week, they issued notices to be posted on stations’ union bulletin boards, warning troopers that traffic stops posed perils and “internal and external entities who seemingly wish to see us fail” would be scrutinizing every stop and enforcement action.
“It appears increasingly likely you may be considered guilty until proven innocent by entities with questionable agendas,” one notice read. “Please be safe and protect yourself and your fellow Troopers.”
Last December, the New York Times found that traffic stops plummeted in the eight months after the unions’ warnings. Platkin responded by announcing an investigation into the alleged slowdown and appointing Preet Bharara, a former U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the probe.
But union officials disputed criticisms and asked Merrick Garland, U.S. attorney general at the time, to step in and review New Jersey state police stop data. They also complained about a backlog of cases affecting about 100 troopers under investigation by Platkin’s public integrity and accountability office, asking Gov. Phil Murphy and state legislators to intervene.
In their June lawsuits, union officials say Platkin’s concerns are about troopers’ work conduct, so his probe should have been administrative and not criminal. They noted that no troopers had been disciplined for any traffic enforcement deficiencies and that Platkin never launched the pilot program he promised. Their notices of the perils of traffic stops constituted protected union advice to members, they added.
They denied any racial profiling and noted they had their own academic researchers review traffic stops. They came to different conclusions, the union leaders said, citing as an example one trooper whose numbers were skewed because he was assigned to patrol a stretch of the turnpike in Hudson County that’s home to a large Hispanic population. That trooper also used a laser speed detector to target motorists for stops, they added.
They also pointed to oversight ordered in recent decades intended to thwart traffic enforcement abuses, including a federal consent decree in place from 1999 to 2009, the state’s subsequent enactment of a law enforcement professional standards office, and annual performance reviews by the state comptroller’s office. Troopers also must report the demographics of every motorist they stop, use body and dashboard cameras, and undergo regular supervisory reviews of searches, requests, pursuits, and more, they said.
“The New Jersey State Police has for decades been the subject of rigorous and comprehensive internal and external oversight regarding motor vehicle enforcement. As a result, the New Jersey State Police is one of the most professional, well-trained, and competent law enforcement agencies in the country,” attorneys wrote.

Critics say it would raise costs for New Jerseyans. (Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)A controversial land management rules proposal meant to guard against floods in an expanding portion of New Jersey may see changes ahead of an August deadline for the Department of Environmental Protection to adopt or kill the package.
The scope of any possible changes to the Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rules — more succinctly, Pact Real — remains unclear.
Gov. Phil Murphy’s office confirmed the administration would hold public meetings about the rules proposal next week, but declined to confirm or detail potential changes to the 1,044-page plan.
The voluminous filing seeks to address an array of coastal and inland flood risks over the next 75 years by expanding the state’s flood maps, raising elevation requirements for new construction in areas affected by rising sea levels, and tightening drainage requirements, among numerous other things.
Environmental groups and some local officials have hailed the rules as a necessary step to protect residents and property in a state where severe storms are becoming more and more frequent.
“We’re not really asking for anything radical. We’re not asking for something completely outside of the box. This is just adapting to what we are already experiencing,” Anjuli Ramos, director of Sierra Club’s New Jersey chapter. “Just last week, there was a rain event, and multiple streets in Monmouth County and in Ocean County flooded.”
New Jersey saw 17 storms that caused at least $1 billion in damage between 2020 and 2024, according to data maintained by the National Centers for Environmental Information. There were 15 such storms over the preceding 40 years after adjustments for inflation.
Severe storms have assaulted other parts of the nation, and flooding from a Texas storm last week killed at least 109, including at least 28 children.
“The only thing that causes more damage than fire is water,” said Barbara Rogers, a township committeewoman in Cranbury, which saw severe flooding from Hurricane Henri in 2021.
Business groups, some Jersey Shore mayors, and the New Jersey Builders Association have opposed the proposed changes, arguing they would further raise New Jersey’s already high cost of living.
The heightened elevation requirement — which would mandate that newly constructed, reconstructed, or enlarged buildings be elevated to 5 feet above the high-water line — has been a frequent focal point of the proposal’s detractors.
“We don’t think it’s supported by the science, and it would be very costly and disruptive to people living at the shore and for businesses at the shore,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which opposes the proposal.
By adopting flood maps of its own that are more expansive than those maintained by federal environmental and emergency response agencies, the state risks mortgage lenders requiring more homebuyers to obtain flood insurance coverage, he said.
Proponents of the proposed rules have argued a larger subscriber pool could lower flood insurance rates — a claim Cantor doubts — as less precarious homes dilute the risk of frequent flooders.
The National Flood Insurance Program, which holds a majority of the country’s flood insurance policies, faces risk of a death spiral driven by claims to a tiny slice of its covered properties that repeatedly flood.
Cantor said a provision in the rules that would require deed notices to include a warning that a property “is likely to be subject to periodic inundation and associated flood damage” could impact property values.
“There are a thousand pages of bad proposals here. Cumulatively, it’s going to be a real negative drag on the state’s economy,” he said.

(Getty Images)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita wants to block courts from authorizing gender identity changes on birth certificates, saying Tuesday he is intervening in cases where Hoosiers have asked trial courts to order the Indiana Department of Health to change the sex on an individual’s birth certificate to reflect their preferred gender identity. 
In a press release, he deemed such changes to be “falsifying records.”
“We’re taking a stand not only for the rule of law but also for common sense,” Rokita said. “Indiana law requires birth certificates to reflect the historical, immutable fact of a child’s sex. One should have no more ability to change the listed sex on a birth certificate years after the fact than to change the newborn’s listed length or weight.”

Rokita also said the state has a clear interest in preserving its own method of issuing the certificates, adding that trial courts have ordered IDOH to change a newborn’s sex in dozens of instances.
The move comes after a March executive order from Gov. Mike Braun, which ended the state’s process from updating gender markers on state documents, specifically birth certificates and driver’s licenses.
The order also instructed state agencies to interpret and apply “sex” to mean “an individual human being’s immutable biological classification as either male or female” as determined at conception. It doesn’t acknowledge intersex Hoosiers.
Previously, individuals seeking to change their gender on a birth certificate were required to obtain a court order. The IDOH would then issue an amended birth certificate. Since the executive order, the Vital Records Division has stopped processing these changes. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana filed a class action lawsuit in March challenging Braun’s order but didn’t have a new comment following Rokita’s release.
Indiana Legal Services said they help hundreds of Hoosiers a year change their name and/or gender markers but said also they do not have a statement at this time. The ILS  provides free legal advice, information, representation and referrals on legal issues including gender marker changes.

This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th.  Meet Jessica and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
TUCSON, ARIZ. — On a Saturday afternoon, Deja Foxx is staging a TikTok Live in her living room. A phone tripod is set up in front of her kitchen table. The frame is centered on a slouchy sofa against an adobe wall, where a chile ristra hangs on one side.
“All right, everybody, take your seats,” she tells the mix of young volunteers, family members and campaign staff who are gathered to help her. “You have some really great mail to open, and I’m so excited because usually it’s just me and my mom that do this.”
She goes live and takes a seat next to her mom on the couch.
One volunteer reads a letter from a 19-year-old named Henry from California: “Even though I can’t vote for you, I adore your campaign,” he wrote. “We need more young leaders and new, fresh ideas from us, Gen Z. As someone who grew up on MediCal, and free public school lunch, who currently is uninsured, I enjoy your background and fighting for us.”
Another volunteer read a note from 20-year-old Julie, who wrote that while she’s been frustrated and overwhelmed by the state of politics, following Foxx’s campaign gave her hope. “I’ve been writing to my officials, but wanted to write something positive for a change. Keep doing what you’re doing.”
Other letter writers included a 22-year-old activist who started organizing after the Parkland shooting, a college student in Phoenix who offered to work for Foxx’s political office in the future, a 23-year-old from Chicago who started following her social media years ago, a North Carolina dad of a daughter moving to Arizona, and a Kentucky woman worried about Medicaid coverage. Volunteers spent 30 minutes reading that day’s mail. During the weekly segment, the audience is usually in the thousands.

Most of the notes included a donation, with the amounts ranging from $20 to $2,000. By the end of the read out Foxx had raised $4,000, mostly from people located outside Arizona. Just two days before, she announced she hit $500,000 in campaign donations, raised through 18,000 individual donors.
Just two months ago, Foxx wrote on Substack about the difficulties of running her campaign for Congress as a Gen Z candidate. She made a plea directly to her online followers: “Our biggest challenge and the only one that really matters: You haven’t invested in us yet.”
At the time, a slow trickle of donations was keeping afloat her campaign to fill the seat left by U.S. Rep Raúl Grijalva, who represented the southern Arizona district for over 20 years.
Shortly after the lawmaker’s death in March, his daughter Adelita Grijalva — who has served for decades in local politics on Tucson’s school board and more recently on the Pima County Board of Supervisors — tossed her hat in the ring for the Democratic primary. Then came the endorsements: Arizona U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, and progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The winner of that primary, which takes place July 15 and includes former state Rep. Daniel Hernandez, will almost certainly go on to win the September special election in this solidly Democratic district.
Foxx announced that she would take on Grijalva in early April. Most of her short political life — at 25, she would be the youngest woman elected to Congress — has focused on reproductive rights. She served on the board of Planned Parenthood in Arizona at age 17, worked in Tucson health clinics as a sex educator in high school, and more recently worked on the Prop 139 Ballot Initiative campaign in 2024, which enshrined the right to abortion in the state’s constitution.










If we want to win in 2028, I promise you that it is going to require electing leaders in this party who can be effective messengers.


– Deja Foxx


  Deja Foxx reaches for mail she received from her campaign post office box on Saturday, June 21, 2025, at her home in Tucson, Arizona (Courtney Pedroza for The 19th)
But while Foxx doesn’t have the backing of “the establishment,” as she refers to it, or the name recognition of Grijalva, she’s created her own buzz by using her social media platforms to speak directly to her generation. Over the past month, her stories have been viewed almost 30 million times on TikTok, Facebook and Instagram. She also has thousands of followers on Substack. That support and the donations that followed afforded her television advertisements, something that was out of reach when she started.
Her social media savvy has allowed her to bypass the need for big donors, build her own following, and capitalize on national support that’s percolated from the ground up. Along the way she’s making the argument that her social media skills aren’t just part of a campaign strategy, but necessary to communicate the politics of the party as the electorate grows younger and more disillusioned.
“We saw people in the party, in the traditional media, wringing their hands, ‘How did we lose young people in this last election? Why did they move toward apathy and the other side? … And it’s because we’re failing to compete in social media and new media spaces,” Foxx said. “If we want to win in 2028, I promise you that it is going to require electing leaders in this party who can be effective messengers.”

Foxx learned the power of a viral moment when she was a 16-year-old activist for Planned Parenthood. At a town hall in 2017, she asked former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake (R) why he would deny her the American dream by voting against funding that made birth control accessible to people who grew up in poverty. Foxx, who was insured through Medicaid at the time, got her birth control from Planned Parenthood.
A clip of the exchange went viral. “I woke up the next day and millions had seen the video,” she said. It’s a moment that changed how she thought about activism. The fact that millions of people watched her on their phones and computers put her on equal footing in public discourse with the United States senator, she said. “As a 16-year-old girl working at a gas station … that is remarkable.”
In the nine years since, the political world has grown to recognize the necessity of social media in campaigns, and politicians have turned to Foxx for her expertise. At the same time she was becoming a prominent reproductive rights activist, she used Instagram to build community among her peers through her organization Gen Z Girl Gang. She worked as an influencer and digital strategist for the Kamala Harris campaign in 2019 and later as a social media director at a political action committee. In 2024, she was invited to speak at the Democratic National Convention in support of Harris as an activist and content creator.
But it’s in her own run for Congress where she has been able to test these communication strategies herself. On her TikTok and Instagram accounts, soundbites from her debates have racked up millions of views. More personal reels, like when she surprised her mom with her first batch of campaign literature, have gone viral. She’s embraced being interviewed by independent journalists with followings on places like Substack and YouTube.










She’s using communication styles and platforms that are meeting people where they’re at.


– Jessica Maddox


“She’s using communication styles and platforms that are meeting people where they’re at. That style may turn off some older voters, but it’s going to excite younger voters who are particularly disaffected or disenfranchised or disheartened by American politics and even the Democratic party,” said Jessica Maddox, an associate professor of digital media at the University of Alabama. “I’ve been particularly impressed with her TikTok presence, because it feels very authentic.”
That authenticity is the main ingredient in connecting with young voters online, experts say. Maddox and others pointed to the success of Zohran Mamdani’s mayoral campaign in New York as an example of how young politicians are tapping into social media to drum up real support at the polls. Both candidates utilized platforms to engage with people, like Gen Z, who are likely to sit out primaries where voters tend to be older.
The strategy puts lesser known candidates on a more equal playing field, allowing them to subvert the traditional hierarchies that fuel campaigns. “There’s always been a tight relationship between legacy media and politics, and social media kind of upends that,” Maddox said. “[Foxx] can kind of bypass more traditional outlets and get the message out herself.”
Social media has also turned a local race into a national fundraiser, which has helped her stay competitive. Candidates like Grijalva and Hernandez have benefited from deeper donor pockets, and outside support from political action committees. By early May, both candidates had already raised hundreds of thousands of dollars, according to the Arizona Republic. Their latest campaign finance numbers are expected to be released soon. Foxx announced she had hit $600,000 in donations at the end of June.
“It’s an interesting social media element that someone these days could have supporters kind of all over the country, even though they’re running for a very specific seat,” said Kathryn Coduto, a professor of media science at Boston University.
While there is a scarcity of polls in the race, a recent one commissioned by Foxx’s campaign shows her name recognition has risen significantly since May, when half of likely voters hadn’t heard of her. And, on Wednesday, David Hogg’s political action committee announced it would be endorsing her in the race. Hogg, who became famous for his activism after the Parkland mass shooting, now runs a political organization called Leaders We Deserve, aimed at building generational change for Democrats.
“If we replace one of the oldest members of Congress with the youngest — Deja is just 25 years old — we could send an incredibly strong message about which direction the Democratic Party is heading in, and show people how we are dramatically changing to meet this moment,” Hogg said in an Instagram Reel.
While Foxx has worked as an influencer in the past, now that she’s running for office that label has been used to undercut her years of political work and activism. At her first debate, Foxx also pointed out that some of her opponents have belittled her influencer experience. In recent news articles, people associated with Grijalva’s campaign have questioned whether Foxx’s national reach is the same as in-district community support.
The label “influencer” carries a lot of baggage, experts say. It’s still seen as superficial or trivial despite its power in activism and politics. It’s also another way of writing off young people, particularly women, as unserious.
“It’s seen as like little girls playing instead of actually utilizing this tool to accomplish something and talk to constituents,” Coduto said.

Jade Larson, who wrote her doctoral dissertation on political fandom and social media, said it’s also not surprising that there is such a stigma around being a politician-influencer.
“Every time media is used in a new way in politics, it’s this scandalous thing,” she said. “You can track it all the way back to Bill Clinton going on the ‘Late Night Show’ and playing saxophone, to Obama starting POTUS on Twitter, to Trump making his own social media [network]. It’s always something that’s scandalous, and people push back against it until it kind of becomes the mainstream and the norm.”
Arguably it is the mainstream now. The power of social media that Foxx tapped into nearly a decade ago has only grown more influential in politics and the media — two industries that are closely intertwined. A report from Pew Research Center found that over half of U.S. adults get some of their news from social media, with women and Democrats making up greater regular news consumers on apps like TikTok and Instagram. These users also skew younger, with those between the ages of 18 to 40 making up the bulk of social media news consumers. In a separate poll by Pew Research, 48 percent of TikTok users ages 18 to 29 say keeping up with politics is one of the reasons they are on the platform.
“A whole lot of congresspeople can give a very solid MSNBC interview,” Foxx said. But as someone who interviewed them as a content creator at the State of the Union, “I’m telling you that when they are put in front of an iPhone, there are so many members that fail to communicate. They don’t think the way that our generation thinks. They fail to understand sound bites and algorithms, and youth or even meme culture.”
At the same time that these social media strategies are taking off, voting power is also starting to shift to the very people that use them. Soon, Gen Z and Millennials will have just as much political sway as Gen X and the Baby Boomers — if they go out and vote, Coduto said.
“If you can cultivate enough excitement and you can find a way to really break through and get people to the polls by using social media, then I think it’s going to be an unstoppable strategy.”

Lawmakers have appropriated funds to move the submarine to another location. (Photo by Jim Argo/Provided by the Oklahoma Historical Society)OKLAHOMA CITY— Republican lawmakers are facing criticism from both sides of the aisle for spending over $10 million in taxpayer money on three special interest projects that appear to have limited benefit to the entire state.
Critics said the late-session vote to allocate $5 million to build a sculpture park in Edmond, $4 million to relocate a World War II submarine in Muskogee and $1.8 million to make infrastructure improvements at an industrial park in Frederick amount to pork-barrel spending that benefits constituents living in Republican districts. 
Supporters though are defending the investments, saying they will have far-reaching impacts beyond the local communities. They say they are not pork-barrel spending, a type of allocation in which lawmakers award taxpayer money to specific local projects that have questionable benefit to the entire state.
In the final days of session, the measure barely secured passage in the Senate, mustering the minimum 25 needed votes.
“I thought it was a pork bill,” said Sen. Mark Mann, D-Oklahoma City, who voted against House Bill 2794.
He said it sent money to three projects without an application process or avenue for any other entities that needed funding.
“If you are going to fund a monument park or something like that, there are a lot of communities across Oklahoma that would like to apply to receive something similar,” Mann said. “That didn’t happen. I thought it was just a pork bill. Nothing competitive about it.”
Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, said he opposed the bill because it spends “taxpayer money on isolated projects in three localized areas,” which doesn’t benefit every Oklahoman and clearly amounted to pork.
Jett said his constituents are now paying for an Edmond park that they may not be able to afford the gas money to visit, and that’s being built in a suburban community that already has an ample number of city parks and other luxuries.
“If I remember right, it seemed like a lot of money to be spent on not moving Oklahoma forward,” said Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, who also opposed the spending.
Supporters of the projects though said that they will be beneficial to the entire state and are a worthwhile expenditure for the Progressing Rural Economic Prosperity, or PREP, Fund. The legislative fund is designed to support economic development in rural communities. Lawmakers have said the expenditures are designed to make those communities more economically competitive.
“The projects funded through House Bill 2794 represent strategic investments in economic development, which is exactly what the PREP Fund was created to support,” said Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, in a statement. “While these projects are located in specific communities, their benefits extend well beyond local borders. The money is going toward economic development and infrastructure to support local communities, including a hospital in Frederick.”
He did not directly answer specific questions asking why state money should be allocated to support these three projects, including funding for The Uncommon Ground Sculpture Park in his home city of Edmond, an Oklahoma City suburb of over 99,000 residents.
The $50 million sculpture park, set to open fall 2026, is under construction along Route 66. The 62-acre park will feature over 40 sculptures, a dog park, playground, ponds for fishing, a hiking trail, a walking trail, a stage and event lawn. So far, supporters have raised $37.4 million.
“While the park lives in Edmond, its impact is much more far reaching,” said Melissa Pepper, The Uncommon Ground Sculpture Park executive director. 
The USS Batfish, a World War II naval submarine, is currently at Muskogee War Memorial Park. During the war, it sank three Japanese Imperial Navy submarines. In 2019, the submarine was damaged due to flooding. 
Supporters plan to use the state funding to move it to Three Forks Harbor, which is located near where the Arkansas, Grand and Verdigris rivers converge. 
“This is history, not pork,” said James Erb, curator of the Muskogee War Memorial Park Museum. 
He also said that it was important to remember and preserve history because “otherwise, we are doomed to repeat it.”
“If it was in California, where there’s submarines for a dime a dozen, it wouldn’t be a big deal, but this is Oklahoma’s final submarine,” Erb said.
Rep. Neil Hays, R-Checotah, who defended spending money on the submarine during questioning on the House floor, did not return a message left seeking comment.
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, and Sen. Chuck Hall, R-Perry, who authored the bill, did not respond to a request for comment.
Rep. John Waldron, D-Tulsa, said while he supports preserving history, he doubted the submarine drew very many visitors. He also said The Uncommon Ground Sculpture Park was categorized as “rural development,” despite Edmond being a suburban community.
While nothing in state law prohibits lawmakers from spending money on special projects, Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, said the three expenditures seemed inconsistent at a time when Republicans also cut the state income tax by 0.25%. That’s expected to cost the state about $350 million.
“When you decide to cut income tax, then you have to say no to some really worthwhile projects,” she said.

It was the summer of 2023 and the two of us – Idaho Capital Sun senior reporter Clark Corbin and Extremely American podcast host Heath Druzin – had just finished a game of pub trivia in Boise.
Although we are both journalists, we became friends because of our shared love of backpacking, skiing, climbing and causing trouble. 
A year earlier, Corbin wrote Into the Zone of Death, a first-person account of a remote backpacking trip with Druzin into Yellowstone National Park.
Reporting the story took us deep in the Yellowstone backcountry. And even though the Bechler Meadows mosquitoes are highly evolved killing machines that bit us both thousands of times (even through our clothing!) Into the Zone of Death became Corbin’s favorite story.
Since then, we wanted to combine our love of outdoor adventure with a major longform reporting project.
That’s when Druzin leaned forward that night at the brewery.
“The 30th anniversary of wolf reintroduction is coming up in 2025, and I think a lot of people are going to be sleeping on the anniversary,” Duzin said. 
Wolves are a native species that the American government and settlers essentially eradicated from the Western U.S. by the 1940s, thanks to bounties and poison. 
Reintroducing wolves in 1995 was one of the most controversial and successful wildlife recovery stories in American history, and Idaho was on the front lines.
Over the summer of 2023 Druzin developed an outline, and we fine-tuned the most ambitious story pitch that Corbin had ever heard.
The pitch for Howl involved calling up some of the country’s most prominent wolf experts and convincing them to hike deep into some of the most remote places in the Lower 48 with two strangers as they shared their story and the wolves’ story in granular detail.
We wanted to give Howl a wild edge and help our audience understand a little bit about where wolves live.

Sign up for our free email newsletter at IdahoCapitalSun.com/Subscribe.


We developed Howl as both a podcast season and written longform series, hoping the two could both complement each other and also be able to stand on their own.
Reporting the story would require pulling Corbin out of the Idaho Capital Sun’s small nonprofit newsroom for weeks of field reporting, undertaking a 1,000-mile road trip across the West and all the time, travel and expense that came with that.
After the reporting and research, writing would take several additional weeks.
Obviously Howl would never get off the ground and was doomed to fail under its own weight.
But then Corbin brought the pitch to Idaho Capital Sun Editor-in-Chief Christina Lords.
She said “yes.”
And Howl got the green light.
 Reconstructing the story of wolf capture and reintroduction

The first major source to agree to participate in Howl was Carter Niemeyer, a wildlife biologist and former government trapper who darted the first wolf captured in Canada for reintroduction to the U.S. 30 years ago.
Niemeyer is a larger-than-life character who stands 6 feet, 6 inches tall and is as wild as the wolves that he captured and carried out of the 20-foot-deep Canadian snow.

Over the course of more than 10 interviews spread across almost a year and a half, Niemeyer told us in great detail how a small team traveled to Canada to capture wolves to bring back to Idaho and Yellowstone in 1995 and 1996.
The plan involved tranquilizer guns and helicopters.
Along the way, Niemeyer was challenged to an impromptu, drunken wolf-skinning competition (which he won). 
On the same project, while capturing wolves in temperatures of 50 below zero, Niemeyer developed frostbite in his toe and was told to pack up and head home (he stayed, because the job wasn’t finished).
Due to his career working on controversial projects for various government agencies, Niemeyer kept detailed notes, records, journals, photographs and even homemade movies of his work with wolves over the decades, which proved extremely valuable in the reporting of Howl.
Niemeyer has also written three books of his own about wolves and wolf reintroduction. 
During one Howl interview session, Corbin spent six hours at Niemeyer’s house watching movies Niemeyer made with a handheld video camera of wolf capture operations in Canada.
As they watched the movies, Corbin asked questions and Niemeyer narrated what they were seeing.
There was footage of helicopters, tranquilized wolves being given exams, kennels being loaded and unloaded into cargo planes and even clips from wolf reintroduction team briefings.
Corbin used the footage and interviews to write the narrative in the first episode of the Howl written series, Carter’s Hope, which opens with Niemeyer riding in the helicopter with a wolf in his sights.

Last summer, Niemeyer met us in Central Idaho. He led us into the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, which was one of the sites of wolf reintroduction in Idaho.
He demonstrated how he tracked wolves and pointed out wolf tracks and scat that we would have hiked right past.
Niemeyer taught us how to howl for wolves.
How wildlife cameras work.
How traps work.
About bait.
Niemeyer also told us that he has been tracking and capturing wolves since before they were reintroduced, and that he isn’t seeing wolves in Idaho like he used to.
He told us about the packs that no longer exist. And he told us about how he no longer sees wolves in many of the areas outside of Idaho City that used to be relative wolf hot spots.
We used that information in Ghost Wolves, the final episode of the Howl podcast and written series. 
 Reporting on wolves from Yellowstone National Park 

The next major source to participate in Howl was Doug Smith, a biologist who headed up Yellowstone National Park’s wolf project for almost 30 years until he retired in 2022.
Druzin had interviewed Smith a couple of times over the years for other stories and somehow convinced Smith to backpack with us into wolf country in the northeast section of Yellowstone, along Cache Creek.
By his own count, Smith has participated in more than 1,000 news interviews in his career, but had never done a backpacking trip with any journalists. 
  Doug Smith talks about the efforts it took to reintroduce wolves into Yellowstone on July 10, 2024, at Yellowstone National Park. The sign before him includes pictures both he and his team captured while reintroducing the wolves. (Photo by Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Many news interviews with government officials in leadership positions or prominent roles are coordinated or overseen by a government public affairs or public information officer.
But because Smith is now retired, he was able to bring his son, Sawyer, and some fly rods on the trip – not a public affairs officer who might get squeamish about sensitive questions and controversial topics. 
As journalists, we knew the amount of time and access the backpacking trip afforded us to Smith was priceless.
We carried everything we needed in heavy backpacks – camp stoves, tents, sleeping bags, water filters, bear spray, first aid, bags of dehydrated food, layers of clothing, whiskey. On top of the normal backcountry essentials, we carried one set each of recording equipment like microphones, cables, headphones, recorders, wind screens and a seemingly endless supply of batteries, so that we could record our interviews and field notes. 
We packed two of every piece of equipment we needed in case something broke, got wet or got lost. 
Over the course of two days on (and off) the trail, Smith told us about wolves being brought back to Yellowstone.
He told us the return of wolves, as well as other predators like cougars and bears, have had a big overall ecological impact on Yellowstone.
Smith talked about how when apex predators at the top of the food chain eat their prey, that can have an effect down the line on the food the prey eats, as well.
Smith told us that without wolves and other predators, the Yellowstone elk population boomed and elk would destroy stands of Aspen trees and other vegetation by grazing. 
With wolves and other predators back on the landscape, elk needed to keep moving and couldn’t risk staying in one place, grazing until the local vegetation was depleted. 
As we hiked, Smith stopped to point out small young Aspen trees that were starting to grow back after wolves were reintroduced.
Smith told us about the history of wolves in Yellowstone, and about capturing wolves to place radio collars on them to make them easier to track and study. 
He also told us about the controversy that surrounds wolves and some of the poaching and torture of wolves that he has seen.
We included information Smith shared with us in the first, third and fifth installments of both the Howl podcast and written series.

 How the Nez Perce Tribe stepped up to lead wolf management in Idaho 

One of the most appealing aspects of Howl was also one of the aspects we knew the least about going into the project. 
Both of us have lived in Idaho for about 20 years, but were kids living in other parts of the country when wolves were reintroduced in the 1990s.
As journalists we knew that the Idaho Legislature didn’t want anything to do with wolf reintroduction.
But we didn’t really know much about how the Nez Perce Tribe stepped up to lead wolf management in Idaho for more than decade. 
We also realized that if we didn’t know that story after years of reporting news that many people in Idaho outside of the Tribe might not know the story either.

We decided to learn as much of the history as we could, which led us to Lapwai, Idaho, and the Nez Perce Reservation in July 2024.
We met with Nez Perce Tribal Executive Committee Chairman Shannon Wheeler, who told us about some of the Tribe’s traditions, stories and connections to wolves.

During that trip, we met with Aaron Miles Sr., who has worked as the natural resources manager for the Nez Perce Tribe since 1999.
Separately, Druzin interviewed biologist Marcie Carter, who served on the Nez Perce Tribe’s wolf project beginning in 1997 and now serves as the watershed coordinator for the Tribe.
Druzin also interviewed Allen Pinkham, a Nez Perce elder who was born in 1938.
“To us, we are given the opportunity by the Creator to occupy this land that we’re at right now, and then we’re supposed to take care of the land and all the species that we utilize because it’s a life source,” Pinkham told Druzin. “It’s an opportunity to believe and have faith in your Creator. That’s what we do, and we’re supposed to take care of everything else, because it provides and sustains life for ourselves.”
We used the second episode of the Howl podcast and written series to share what we learned from members of the Nez Perce Tribe. 
Another extremely valuable source for Howl was Suzanne Asha Stone, the co-founder of the International Wildlife Coexistence Network and the Wood River Wolf Project. After originally starting as an intern, Stone was a member of the wolf reintroduction team that brought wolves back 30 years ago.
Stone shared a first hand account of the day wolves were reintroduced to Idaho, described the controversy and politics surrounding wolves and shared her research into nonlethal tools to help ranchers and herders protect their livestock from wolves.
We cited information Stone shared in four episodes of Howl.
  Spotting wolves in the wild in Yellowstone 

We did see wild wolves in the course of reporting Howl.

One morning last summer we woke up at a campground just outside of Yellowstone before 4 a.m. to meet Rick McIntyre, the man who has seen more wolves in the wild than anyone in the world.
McIntyre is a veteran wolf watcher, author and former Yellowstone National Park ranger who agreed for us to meet him near Slough Creek in the northern section of Yellowstone National Park.
Each morning before dawn, McIntyre and dozens of wolf watchers gather in and around Yellowstone’s Lamar Valley for a chance to see wolves in the wild. With decades worth of near daily wolf sightings under his belt, McIntyre knows the location of the park’s wolf packs and many of the details of the lives of individual wolves.
Because wolves are afraid of people, McIntyre and other wolf watchers use high powered wildlife spotting scopes that look like telescopes to watch wolves safely from a distance.
(Yellowstone National Park requires visitors to stay at least 100 yards away from predators like wolves and bears).
That July morning, McIntyre extended his arm and offered us a peek through his spotting scope, just as he has to thousands of Yellowstone visitors over the past 30 years.
Through McIntyre’s lens we saw wolf 907F, the long reigning alpha female leader of the Junction Butte Pack, playing with her 10th and final litter of pups. 
Last summer, 907 was the oldest known wolf in Yellowstone, and had given birth to more litters of pups than any wolf ever studied in Yellowstone.
McIntyre and veteran wolf watcher Laurie Lyman shared 907’s story with us, which resonated particularly with Corbin. 
The day we left Yellowstone after interviewing McIntyre and Lyman, Corbin knew he wanted to write 907’s story.
It took five drafts that were completed between December and April, but 907s life story became part three of the written series of Howl, Fixing Yellowstone. 
  On four separate occasions, Wolf 907F seized power as the alpha female leader of the Junction Butte Pack in Yellowstone National Park. (National Park Service file photo courtesy of Jeremy SundeRaj/Yellowstone National Park)
 Through ups and downs, reporting Howl was a great assignment 

The morning we met McIntyre we got up so early that we beat him and all the other wolf watchers to Slough Creek, which inadvertently led to one of the most bizarre things we witnessed during the entire course of reporting and writing Howl.
As we were leaving our campground at 4 a.m., there was only one other camper up and moving around.

He appeared to be still up, as opposed to just waking up like we were, and he was standing next to his car a short distance away from our vehicle. 
As we sat in our vehicle Druzin turned on his recorder and began narrating. 
“OK, It’s one minute until 4 in the morning,” Druzin said.  
Just then the man turned around, bent over and began fidgeting with something in his car. 
Corbin instantly burst into uncontrollable laughter, ruining Druzin’s audio and breaking one of the major rules of audio journalism – shut up when you’re recording.
We couldn’t help it though. 
The man’s entire, extremely large backside was entirely exposed as he bent over.
A complete and total stranger appeared to be mooning us.
Luckily, the audio recording of our reaction survives, beginning with sustained giggling.
“Well the guy’s ass is hanging out as he’s loading up his car at the campground,” Corbin said.
“We saw a full moon,” Druzin interrupted. 
“And it’s not just like a little bit,” Corbin said.
“No,” Druzin agreed. 
“It’s like he did it on purpose,” Corbin said. “…. It was all visible.”
“I would say that there was very little that wasn’t visible,” Druzin said. “Left nothing to the imagination.”
The, ahem, full moon at the crack of dawn story sums up reporting Howl as well as any other moment.
Even when getting mooned, we kept a sunny disposition every minute of working on Howl.

Prism Logistics has asked a judge to review the state's recent decision to deny several lease renewals.
The post Gravel operator digs in with another lawsuit to open Casper Mountain appeared first on WyoFile .","The developer of a controversial gravel pit at the base of Casper Mountain wants a judge to review the state’s recent decision to deny several lease renewals.
Casper-based Prism Logistics filed a petition for judicial review Monday in the 7th District Court in Natrona County, claiming the state’s denial was “contrary to law” because the company had met conditions qualifying for an extension, according to the filing.
Pointing to statute regarding leases and lease extensions on state-owned lands — 36-6-101 sections (b), (m) and (n) — Prism contends the state “shall” grant an extension if any one of four criteria are met. “We believe that we clearly complied with two of the four,” Prism Manager Kyle True told WyoFile on Tuesday. “So we’re asking a judge if we’re reading the law correctly.”
How we got here

The Wyoming State Board of Land Commissioners in 2023 granted eight exploration leases to Prism to potentially mine gravel on several state-owned “school trust sections” at the base of Casper Mountain on the town’s west side. Neither the county nor nearby residents in the Coates Road area were notified, and neighbors were aghast to learn about the leases after inquiring about test-digging in the area early last year.
The board, composed of Gov. Mark Gordon, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder, Secretary of State Chuck Gray, Treasurer Curt Meier and Auditor Kristi Racines, unanimously approved the lease applications via a consent agenda (without direct review or discussion).
It set off a firestorm of opposition, prompting county officials to install heavy truck limitations and rezone the area to forbid commercial mining, as well as a political storm on the state lands board.
Six of Prism’s eight leases came up for renewal in June. Only Meier opposed a motion to deny renewing the six leases, and Gordon declined to vote. Racines, who brought the motion, said Prism did not move forward in adequate time with state licensing and permits.
The other two leases come up for renewal in October.
Meantime, a judge has allowed Prism to continue to pursue its case against the Natrona County Board of Commissioners challenging whether the county can impose zoning regulations that prohibit state-sanctioned uses on school trust lands.
Asked whether Prism sees a path forward to eventually mine gravel in the area, True said “yes.” Although True initiated several public and private conversations with opponents and nearby residents, those overtures have not been returned lately, he said.

Thursday will mark the unveiling of a multi-year collaboration meant to welcome and engage statehouse visitors. 
The post Celebrate Statehood Day with new Wyoming Capitol exhibits appeared first on WyoFile .","When the Wyoming Capitol restoration was completed in 2019 and the building reopened to the public, an interior phase of the project intended to welcome and engage visitors was just getting started. 
Thursday marks the unveiling of that project, known as the Capitol Square exhibits. 
Designed to blend in with the building’s architecture and style, the exhibit showcases stories of the Capitol and the history of Wyoming’s government. It’s also meant to shepherd visitors who enter the People’s House without a trusty guide. 
“Unless someone is walking you through the building and telling you the stories, you don’t necessarily know all the magic that is here,” Legislative Service Office Special Projects Manager Wendy Madsen told reporters during a preview tour last week.

The exhibits cater to different learning styles — visual, auditory and hands-on — as well as different visitor types — skimmers, browsers and gorgers. They also feature lesser-known Equality State figures that even history buffs may not be familiar with. 
Take Lizabeth Wiley, for example, a bookseller who ran for Greybull mayor in 1924 to chase the Ku Klux Klan out of town. Wiley won and largely fulfilled her campaign promise. Her portrait now overlooks the Nellie Tayloe Ross Executive Conference Room in the west wing of the Capitol’s first level, now named Suffrage Hall. 
Another intention of the project is to make clear that the People’s House belongs to everyone. 
“These exhibits are more than beautiful displays—they are a powerful invitation for every Wyomingite to feel at home in their Capitol,” Sen. Bill Landen, R-Casper, said in a statement. “Through vivid storytelling, hands-on engagement, and a celebration of our proud firsts, we’re ensuring that every visitor walks away with a deeper sense of belonging and a renewed pride in our state’s rich legacy and leadership.”
Landen co-chaired the Capitol Square Interpretive Exhibits and Wayfinding Subcommittee with State Auditor Kristi Racines, alongside State Treasurer Curt Meier, Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder and Reps. Bob Nicholas, R-Cheyenne, and Trey Sherwood, D-Laramie, as members.

Having an equal split between the executive and legislative branches on the committee, Racines told reporters, required consensus building since nobody could overrule anyone else. 
Thursday’s opening, which falls on Wyoming Statehood Day, features a variety of free activities, including guided tours, history talks, a theatrical performance and activities for children. 
From noon to 8 p.m., visitors are also encouraged to bring a picnic blanket or lawn chair to enjoy food trucks, music and military vehicle displays on the north side of the Capitol grounds. 
Guided tours will need to be reserved in advance online. A full schedule of events can be found here.

Columnist Rod Miller recounts this memory to ridicule the goofiness of right-wing bathroom laws.
The post My night as a ‘woman’ appeared first on WyoFile .","I see that some transgender dudette used the ladies’ room in the Capitol building. Apparently, this was a protest against Wyoming’s recent anti-transgender law. Man (and I use that term advisedly), protests are waaay different today than when I was a rabble-rouser. Micturation as a form of political protest was never on my Bingo card.

Opinion

When I saw this news, I was reminded of two things. First is Edward Abbey’s quote about bladder relief, “If a man can’t piss in his own front yard, he’s livin’ too close to town.” I’m not sure why this adage jumped to mind when I saw this blatant violation of answering nature’s call. Maybe just because I’ve always respected Abbey.
The second memory this event prompted was the night that I dressed up as a woman and went out on the town. Deuteronomy 22:5 notwithstanding, I had a great time!
You must be asking yourself why a macho jock-cowboy like yours truly would cross-dress and risk the fires of hell where the flames are not quenched and the worm dieth not. I did it for fun and charity, and here’s how it happened.
I was living in Laradise a decade or so ago, and the annual Drag Queen Bingo extravaganza was approaching. Jasmine, a young artist who had done a couple portraits of my hirsute self, invited me to be her date.
Jasmine dressed like a Cuban pimp — pencil mustache painted on with eyeliner, slicked back pomaded hair and a sharkskin suit. I knew that, given my physical reality, I could never pass for a high-dollar hooker, so I dressed up as a barefoot and pregnant American housewife.
I duct-taped enough pillows to my belly to make me look like I was carrying triplets. I donned a ratty house dress, put curlers in my hair and beard, slapped on some lipstick, took off my Tony Lamas and I was ready for a night away from the kitchen.
Hell, Wyoming is 62 million acres of outdoor, uni-sex pissoir. Does the Freedom Caucus want to confine male urination to the Red Desert, and reserve the Bighorn Basin for the gals?Rod Miller
Along with the other gender-bent attendees, Jasmine and I played Bingo and drank beer into the wee hours. We raised a lot of dough for the Laramie women’s shelter, the downtown free clinic and other worthy causes. Old Testament laws were broken routinely, with no apparent consequences.
That is, until I had to take a leak. I waddled into the men’s room, out of habit more than anything. Stepping up to the urinal, I couldn’t see over the triplets and ended up peeing on my bare feet. That’ll teach you, I heard an ethereal voice say, to violate the natural order of things. The lesson was amplified when it took me a couple days to extract the curlers from my beard.
I recount this memory to ridicule the goofiness of right-wing bathroom laws. With all the critical issues facing us in the Big Empty — chemtrails, LDS steeples and road-killed grizzlies — legislators waste their time on who can pee where.
Hell, Wyoming is 62 million acres of outdoor, uni-sex pissoir. Does the Freedom Caucus want to confine male urination to the Red Desert, and reserve the Bighorn Basin for the gals?
Our “conservative” politicians need to loosen their bustles. If there’s anything that trumps their cherished Wyoming Values, it’s the fact that “when ya gotta go, ya gotta go,” and that pesky truism in our Constitution that says, “all members of the human race are equal.”
I might suggest that our Freedom Caucus folks get out on the town more, live a little and have some fun. I had a blast during my one cross-dressing experiment, and they may enjoy it as well.
If Rep. John Bear applied some J.D. Vance mascara and wore a slinky black cocktail dress and stiletto heels, he’d turn heads at a dry cleaners convention, and maybe make some spendin’ money.
Chuck Gray could pull off a cute pinafore and pink bows. If he tapdanced and hummed a few bars of “Good Ship Lollipop,” the crowd would go nuts.
Even Congresswoman Harriet Hageman could slip into a male persona and have a good time. If she lost the turquoise, then put on a bushy white dread-locked beard and an old Stetson, she could go as Rod Miller at Drag Queen Bingo.
The only thing cramping their style would be some jerkwater politician telling them which bathroom they had to use.

But Montana’s 1972 Constitution is also “traditional” in that […],"The main stairway to the third floor of the Montana Capitol building is seen on Wednesday, February 12, 2025. (Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)Montana’s 1972 Constitution has been described by some as “progressive” and it was indeed written to move our state forward for “this and future generations.”  It provides Montana citizens with an expansive and inclusive bill of rights far surpassing any other state or the U.S. Constitution. But Montana’s 1972 Constitution is also “traditional” in that it enshrines “three separate but equal” branches of government – the legislature, executive and judicial – same as our 1889 Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. 
But prior to 1972, the Montana Legislature was not an “equal” branch of government. It was crippled – meeting only every other year for 60 calendar days with no power to do committee work or have staff beyond the days in session. 
Not surprisingly, most candidates running to be ConCon –Constitutional Convention– delegates, including me, campaigned on a platform of enhancing the power and role of the Legislature.
And those delegates constituting the Legislative Committee were united in the purpose of making the “peoples’ branch of government” first among equals. Former legislators serving in the convention knew all too well the limitations of the “pressure cooker,” as the legislature was commonly described. The 1972 ConCon provided for annual legislative sessions, interim committee work with staff and the ability to call itself into special session, which previously only the governor could do. 
The 1972 Constitution did not try to increase powers or aggrandize the role of Montana’s judicial branch because the role of the courts in reviewing and striking down legislation that violates the constitution has been a well-established judicial responsibility since the 1803 federal Marbury vs. Madison decision. The primary focus of the ConCon’s debates on the judicial article was how members of the judiciary were to be selected – through popular election or by merit-based appointment, the financing of Supreme Court elections, and the number of justices.  Supporters of judicial reform supported a “Montana Plan” for merit-based selection but the full convention stayed with the Montana tradition – elected judges – while increasing the number of justices from five to seven.
The legislature was granted all legislative power of the state except that reserved to the people – initiative and referendum. And the Constitution authorizes and directs the Legislature to implement many provisions of the Constitution. But the Constitution not only grants the legislature power, it also imposes limitations on it, in particular in the Declaration of Rights. 
The 1972 delegates had very high regard for the legislature and the legislative process. Nowhere is this more evident than in Article IX, Environment and Natural Resources. There the Constitution provides that the state and each person shall “maintain and improve a clean and healthful environment for present and future generations,” which is also recognized as an inalienable or fundamental right. The Constitution charges the Legislature with implementing those fundamental protections. The Supreme Court can only determine the constitutionality and enforceability of legislation and must stop it from going into effect if unconstitutional. Deference is given to duly enacted legislation, except when legislation is challenged on the basis that it infringes on a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Then the court is required to exercise a different standard of review and scrutiny. When the Montana Supreme Court consistently rules that the legislature cannot ignore the Constitution, it is only fulfilling its primary responsibility.
The Supreme Court cannot legislate as the legislature can. The justices’ oath is to protect, uphold and defend the Constitution. If Montanans are really serious about protecting their right to a clean and healthful environment, they need to elect legislators, a governor and attorney general who will embrace, implement and enforce those rights in order to insure they are more than just words on paper.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 07:11:43.232713

Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
Idaho legislative committee studying housing hears about hardships in permitting, approval process

By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
 More U.S. states seal, expunge eviction records through laws, policy

Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”












I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible.


– North Dakota Democratic state Sen. Ryan Braunberger




The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
 Compromises on expungement v. sealing eviction records

Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.

“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
 Idaho joins other states enacting eviction records laws

Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.












I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible.


– North Dakota Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta




This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.

Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Photo: Somervilletn.org)The NAACP Legal Defense Fund on Monday dismissed its lawsuit challenging Fayette County’s 2021 electoral map as discriminatory after county lawmakers passed a new map that complies with the Voting Rights Act and U.S. Constitution, the group stated.
The lawsuit, filed in the Western District of Tennessee in late February, claimed that the map adopted by the Fayette County Commission in 2021 was chosen “at least in part with the intent to racially discriminate against Black voters.” 
The Tennessee Comptroller’s local redistricting guide requires county legislative bodies to consider minority representation when redistricting. Black voters make up more than 25% of Fayette County’s population, but the 19-member county commission is entirely white. The lawsuit stated that the commission chose an electoral map in 2021 that diluted the power of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice.
The commission approved a redistricting plan that had no majority-minority districts — rejecting other plans that included districts with majority Black voting age populations — against the advice of outside legal counsel and the commission’s own redistricting committee. 
NAACP Legal Defense Fund sues Fayette County over ‘discriminatory’ 2021 electoral map

The U.S. Justice Department sued the Fayette County Board of Commissioners in January, also alleging that the board’s adoption of the 2021 map violated the Voting Rights Act. 
Fayette County rejected the allegations in the federal lawsuit and stated its characterizations were “unfounded,” but the county opted to review and revise the map, according to court documents.
Fayette County commissioners voted to reconvene the Redistricting Committee in April, instructing the committee to create a plan with “no less than two majority minority districts.” The committee held a public hearing for the new plan in May before recommending it to the commission for passage.
Fayette County asked the court to stay the federal lawsuit proceedings in April in light of those pending redistricting plans, the “singular purpose” of which was “to reconsider and replace the map at issue in this litigation,” court filings state.
The commission unanimously approved the new electoral map with three majority-Black, single-member districts on June 24. The new map will be used in the 2026 election cycle.
The federal lawsuit’s status is unclear, as the last court-ordered status update was submitted on June 23, one day before the Fayette County Commission adopted the new map.
“Our lawsuit sent a clear message that Fayette County has to treat everyone fairly in the map drawing process,” John Cusick, LDF Assistant Counsel, stated in a news release. “The new map is a huge victory for Black voters that only happened because of our clients’ courage and unshakeable determination to fight for full citizenship and equal rights. We look forward to the 2026 election cycle where Black voters will finally have a chance to participate equally in the democratic process.”
The Legal Defense Fund’s lawsuit represented the claims of the NAACP Fayette-Somerville Branch and five Black Fayette County voters: Christine Woods, Thomas Gilmore, Veils Fitzpatrick, Willie Luellen and Marandy Wilkerson. 
“This passage of the new map is not just a victory for Black voters, but also a victory for Fayette County,” Woods, one of the plaintiffs, stated in the release. “I’m excited about the new map and look forward to the upcoming elections that will take place under a fair map. This is a great opportunity for Black voters to get out and make our voices heard so that we have equal representation on the County Commission.”

(Courtesy of Jeri Fry)Republicans’ tax break and spending cut bill signed by President Donald Trump last week includes a provision that could compensate some people exposed to radiation in Colorado. 
The bill extends and expands the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA, which provides compensation for medical bills to people in certain states who were exposed to radiation because of nuclear testing and weapons development. 
The original RECA expired last year, and the version approved as part of the “big, beautiful bill” includes coverage for uranium miners and workers in Colorado and other Western states.

RECA was established in 1990 and pays one-time sums to those who developed certain diseases after working on U.S. nuclear tests and to those who lived in counties downwind from test explosion sites in Arizona, Nevada and Utah. More than 100 atmospheric weapons tests were conducted in the U.S. and its territories between 1945 and 1962, resulting in widespread radioactive fallout across much of the U.S.
Colorado residents have filed 3,709 claims for compensation under RECA, 2,688 of which were awarded, according to U.S. Department of Justice data. That has led to over $245 million in compensation for Colorado residents from the federal government. Data is based on the state where an applicant currently resides, not necessarily the location where they were exposed to radiation.  

The Western Governors’ Association wrote to Congressional leadership at the end of June encouraging them to reauthorize RECA. 
“Western Governors support maintaining and funding RECA and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, expanding them to more accurately include the affected populations of downwind states and defense production workers, and extending them to ensure that individuals receive compensation for the effects of these national security radiation exposures,” the letter said. 
U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, a Colorado Democrat, has championed the extension of RECA.
The program’s new expiration date is Dec. 31, 2028.

We rank 37th in the nation in doctor-to-patient ratio, and the situation is especially dire in rural areas. Of our 53 counties, 46 are federally designated as Health Professional Shortage Areas. These aren’t just statistics. Pregnant women are traveling hours for prenatal care. Mental health services are scarce, contributing to one of the highest suicide rates in the country. And half of our critical access hospitals are losing money, threatening to leave entire communities without lifesaving care.
This is a looming crisis, but we are not the only rural state facing these challenges. Other states have acted; we can learn from their experiences to see what works.
One place to start is residency training. North Dakota has the lowest number of residency training slots per medical student in the country. This forces most of our medical school graduates to leave to complete their training, and only 22% come back to practice. States like South Dakota and Pennsylvania have shown that doctors who train in rural areas are more likely to stay there to practice. By expanding the University of North Dakota rural residency programs, we can train more doctors in rural medicine and create a new pipeline in critically needed specialties like OB/GYN and psychiatry.
We should also take a fresh look at our medical licensing laws. International medical graduates, doctors who have trained abroad and often specialize in high-demand fields, are currently required to repeat their multi-year residency training in a U.S. program. Tennessee and Utah have replaced this requirement with a path for international medical graduates to practice under supervision, which leads to a full medical license. North Dakota could do the same, and quickly boost the number of providers in areas with the greatest need.
At the same time, we can do more to empower the health care professionals who are already here. North Dakota has been a leader in providing full practice authority to nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We can build on that success by extending it to other classes of health care providers. Idaho shows that granting prescribing authority to pharmacists to treat low-risk conditions allows patients in rural areas with no doctor to receive care for minor or chronic conditions that otherwise may go untreated.  Allowing trained psychologists to prescribe medications for mental health conditions has been successfully implemented in New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa and Idaho, and shown to improve patient outcomes and reduce the rate of suicide.
Finally, we can increase access to telehealth. Roughly one-third of North Dakota hospitals still lack basic telehealth technology. Even when technology is in place, current law requires doctors who see patients by video to have full North Dakota medical licenses, restricting access to out-of-state specialists. When Vermont started issuing simple telehealth licenses to out-of-state providers, wait times for specialist care dropped by 200 days. North Dakota could follow suit, making it easier for rural patients to connect with the care they need.
The physician and specialist shortage is already straining our health care system and threatening our public health and economic stability. But proven, practical solutions would improve access to medical care for everyone in the state, especially for rural North Dakotans. If we want to protect our way of life, we need to make changes that bring medical care closer to the people who need it.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Doctor-stock-photo-1024x767.jpg,,,2025-07-09 06:07:12.708486

Byrd High School and also runs GameChanger, the school’s prevention education club. (Sam Nichols | West Virginia University)On a Tuesday afternoon, Michelle Allen is in her office in an empty Robert C. Byrd High School. Allen is the career and technical instructor at RCB and also runs GameChanger, the school’s prevention education club.
In an empty classroom, Allen walks over to a desk where a three-ring binder sits. It contains about 25 pages of materials that GameChanger has provided, including a theme for each month and suggested activities, many of which come from other national prevention education programs, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
“This year, we were given a framework of each month to focus on a different topic,” Allen explains of the materials in front of her. “I just kind of use Google and research and find things that go along with that message.”

GameChanger is a statewide prevention education program founded in 2018, with the goal of having a chapter in every school in the state by the 2026-2027 academic year. The nonprofit’s founder, Joe Boczek, started the program after his then-college-aged daughter experienced an opioid addiction. 
“I know firsthand what families go through when you’re fighting addiction. That was what it was, the impetus behind GameChanger with me,” he said.
According to tax documents, GameChanger is a million-dollar-a-year organization. Their funding comes from the business community, the government and private companies, according to Boczek. But they are also being funded by a new source of money: global opioid settlement funds. 
Youth prevention education is one of the seven approved areas of spending of these settlement funds, defined in a 2022 Memorandum of Understanding from the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. 
An analysis of Freedom of Information Act responses from 50 of the state’s 55 counties shows six county commissions have put money towards youth prevention: Harrison, Jackson, Marion, Marshall, Mason and Mingo. 
So far, GameChanger has received $310,000 from three counties — more than any other existing prevention program — and Boczak says they intend to ask other counties to fund their work from this source as well. 
But prevention experts say the program lacks a research-backed curriculum, has no measurable outcomes to show — despite being around for eight years — and may ultimately fail to deliver on its promises to protect young people from addiction. Boczek says he’s willing to listen.
How GameChanger landed opioid settlement money in two West Virginia counties
Marion County was the first to award GameChanger opioid settlement funds. The money comes from a global settlement agreed to in 2021 by states, counties and cities across the country who sued opioid distributors, manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies over the nation’s overdose crisis. The settlement distributions will continue over the next 17 years, but as of April 15, Marion County reported via email it has received $960,890.78.
GameChanger’s application for financial support in Marion County came in the form of a special funding request and video presentation given in person to the county commission in May of 2024, according to meeting minutes. Presenters included GameChanger Executive Director Bozcek and Lance Puccio, who was representing program Chairman Larry Puccio, a well-known lobbyist and political operative in the state.
After the presentation, the three-member board of elected officials voted to award GameChanger $270,000 to implement their prevention education program in six schools in Marion County over the next three to four years. 
Marion County Administrator Kris Cinalli said the county commission asks for proposed activities tied to specific funding amounts in its opioid settlement request form, detailing how GameChanger would spend the allotment. However, in the GameChanger request, the only activity listed is the program itself, with no additional cost breakdown. 
According to Bozcek, the funding will cover implementation costs.
“We’re right in the midst of figuring out how we’re going to appropriate it. It’s all through the programming, and it cannot be used for anything else other than Marion County Schools,” Bozcek said.

Boczek says his program isn’t free, but the cost isn’t consistent across counties or even schools. Some schools receive subsidies from their county board, state or federal dollars, and even support from outside organizations or businesses that help pay for the programming. Just how much it costs each school, Boczek said, is information he is not ready to make public.
Mason County also awarded global settlement funds to GameChanger, but the effort to fund the program was led by teachers. 
Tracie Price and Scarlett Enos — Point Pleasant Junior/Senior High School’s GameChanger coaches — along with several students approached the Mason County Commission to request financial support for the program at their school. According to Price, one of the county commissioners is a teacher at the vocational center and talked to Price and Enos about coming and doing a presentation. 
Instead of filling out an application for review, like some counties require, Price says the students gave a presentation to the county commission during a regular meeting. The three-person elected commission then awarded their program $10,000. 
“They presented a PowerPoint of the things we’d done so far, some of the future goals that they had planned for the following year, some items that we would maybe need to purchase as we went to elementary schools for presentations,” Price said.
According to meeting minutes, Price and Enos have been present with students to give updates on the program to the commission. Price said they have used money to buy swag, a commercial to air during football games, guest speakers’ travel expenses and supplies for events, like posters. They have also attended events such as the West Virginia Prevention Day at the Capitol and the Mason County Youth Expo. 
From marketing pitch to school program

Before he founded the organization, Boczek worked in marketing. His clients included MVB Bank, which was a corporate sponsor of the West Virginia Secondary Schools Activity Commission. This led to a relationship between Boczek, MVB CFO Don Robinson and Bernie Dolan, the former executive director of the WVSSAC. The three of them came up with the idea for GameChanger together as a way to “get more bang for our buck,” Boczek said.
After its inception and in its first few years, the program garnered key endorsements from several West Virginia politicians, including former governor and current U.S. Sen. Jim Justice, former Sen. Joe Manchin and now GameChanger chair Larry Puccio. Several celebrities have also participated in promotional events and videos later shown to schools, including Jennifer Garner, Brad Paisley, Nick Saban and Tim Tebow. 
Most of these celebrities make appearances at GameChanger’s annual Golf Classic hosted at The Greenbrier resort, owned by Justice’s family. The $500 individual ticket to the prevention education dinner and golf tournament helps raise awareness and money for the program. GameChanger does celebrate an educator at the event each year; however, no students or other teachers involved in the program attend, according to Boczek. The 2022 Golf Classic cost roughly $470,000, according to tax documents. 
GameChanger is described as a K-12 peer leadership program, where older students form relationships with younger kids and help them learn healthy habits. In the fall of 2022, it was piloted in 12 schools in the state.
The teachers and guidance counselors who oversee GameChanger at a given school are called coaches. Coaches work directly with the students to help run events or hold meetings, where many say they show videos about drug misuse and prevention. Coaches are paid an additional $5,000 per year for the position, which is covered by the school district. Each school is also given $500 to use on programming materials and events, which is provided by GameChanger. 
Boczek, whose wife is a teacher, said that paying the coaches an extra stipend was important to him because he believes many are overworked and underpaid. 
Katie Yeager, a guidance counselor at Lincoln High School in Harrison County, was among the pilot group of GameChanger coaches. Yeager says, even with the additional pay, no one applied for the job at her school. 
“They posted it, and no one at our school applied,” Yeager said. “So the principal approached [the guidance counselors] and said, ‘Would you please be willing to be the GameChanger coaches?’”
Yeager took on the role and began sharing videos and PowerPoints created by GameChanger with students, once in the fall and once in the spring during her first year. However, Yeager says she soon realized there is no set curriculum, and it is up to each coach at each school to plan lessons for their students. This leaves most of the work to the coaches and inconsistencies in programming across schools based on the time and effort each coach commits.
“There’s no real curriculum. We’re kind of allowed to do whatever we feel would be most beneficial for our school,” Yeager said. “The prevention specialist came in and talked with us. They trained our peer leaders, and then we were kind of just left to do whatever we feel is right.”

RCB’s coach Michelle Allen, also located in Harrison County where the county commission awarded GameChanger $30,000 in October 2024 according to Freedom of Information Act documents, noted the binder with the monthly themes came in her second year of leading her school’s club. 
North Marion High School in Marion County started its GameChanger organization in 2022.
“Our group is a student-powered substance misuse prevention group… and our job is really just to educate other students and let them know that not all students are using drugs,” Kaitlyn Knight, GameChanger coach at NMHS, said. “Not all students are vaping. Not all students are drinking. So it’s a peer leadership group that just leads by example.” 
But not every student in the 700+ person school receives the lessons because, much like Lincoln and RCB, they’ve set it up as a club.
“They just sign up. If they think that this would be something that they’re good at and that they like to do, sign up for it,” Knight said.
Superintendent of Marion County schools Donna Heston confirmed GameChanger is already in three schools — an elementary, middle and high school — in her county. Their implementation came before GameChanger was awarded $270,000 in opioid funds from the county commission in 2024.
“When we first started, we started with a high school because of the design of the GameChanger program, where you have students who are mentoring younger students about avoiding habits or giving them a space where we can get out of some of those generational problems that we have in society,” Heston said. 
Ellijah Armour, a 2024 graduate of NMHS, joined GameChanger in his junior year because he wanted to be a mentor for younger kids, especially his niece. 
“I wanted to show her a good example of why not to use [substances],” Armour said. “I want [mentor] students to know that their words are powerful to the kids and understand that anything you say could impact them.”
Part of GameChanger’s mission, according to its website, is to help schools comply with Laken’s Law, also known as the Fentanyl Prevention and Awareness Education Act. Passed by the West Virginia Legislature in 2024, the law requires students to be taught about “fentanyl, heroin, and opioids awareness, prevention and abuse” and Narcan, the name brand for naloxone — a drug that can reverse an opioid overdose. 
According to the GameChanger, 229 middle and high schools and nearly 180,000 students are receiving instruction through the program, but in a spreadsheet made available on their website, multiple schools are listed more than once. Calhoun Middle/High School, with its 400 students, is listed twice, for example. Point Pleasant High School, with its 1,000 students, is listed three times. 
When asked for a list of the schools and counties that the program is currently being taught in, Boczek was unable to give a definite answer, saying, “We are currently assembling that for the new school year because more schools are being added, so I am not sure when that will be available.” 
Critics question GameChanger’s impact, scientific rigor
Although the research is 20 years old, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration reports 80% of American kids participated in some form of prevention education program in their school, but only 20% were exposed to effective prevention programs.
Alfgeir Kristjansson, a professor of social and behavioral sciences at West Virginia University and co-director of the West Virginia Prevention Research Center, says that’s because many of the drug prevention programs that are implemented in schools are there to check a box. 
“Schools, of course, are notoriously busy places… and their mission is to educate our kids,” Kristjansson said. “So what tends to happen in these kinds of scenarios is that they will incorporate what is the easiest thing for them to do. And those are usually structured programs.”
Schools have traditionally paid for short-term programs that come with pre-packaged material. D.A.R.E. — Drug Abuse Resistance Education — is perhaps the most well-known of these. Research published in the early 2000s found more than $750 million had been spent on the school-based program nationally, but the program was ineffective — students were no less likely to use drugs after completing D.A.R.E. than if left to chance. 
“And then we can check the box. Prevention done this year. Let’s move on to the next thing,” Kristjansson said.

But effective evidence-based prevention education Kristjansson says can have “enormous” economic impacts. SAMHSA found every $1 spent on effective school-based programs can save $18 on health care and other services later. Kristjansson says it can also delay substance use for young people and reduce their participation in other risky behaviors.
“Kids that start smoking and drinking and vaping and things of that nature later, let’s say at the age of 16 as opposed to the age of 14 or 13, they are also much less likely to drop out of school, engage in teen parenting and get into trouble with the legal system,” Kristjansson explained. “So in other words, there’s all kinds of related benefits from delaying substance use onset.” 
Effective prevention education, according to Kristjansson and his experience with international prevention research, is not solely left to schools and educators to handle, but is something that is structurally embedded into a community. He is an advocate of the Icelandic model, which partners with local leaders to identify community-based risk factors and, instead of just teaching kids not to do drugs, works to build healthier communities that support them through the difficulties of growing up and provides them with positive adult role models and alternative, healthy activities.  
“The best way to facilitate the initiation of drug use among kids is to give them almost nothing to do and bring very little social support to them,” Kristjansson explained. “There are two major problems that we have in West Virginia. One is what we call lack of parenting. There are just so many kids that grow up in challenging homes and challenging circumstances or with absent parents. And the second is what I broadly refer to as lack of opportunity. There are so many kids in our state that go home after school into nothingness.” 
“And in the meantime, while this is happening, they are going through the challenges of puberty,” Kristjansson continued. “We are telling them, go out and take risks, find your own way, do whatever you want. So it shouldn’t be surprising that society is sort of like a grinder. If I don’t provide almost anything to you, surely you’re going to be more likely to engage in risky behavior.”
Kristjansson said he had a few meetings with Boczek as GameChanger was being developed and advised him that the program needed real, research-based prevention. 
“I have the utmost respect for him with regards to his ability to market things and to acquire funding and to be visible and out there. He clearly is a very good marketer,” Kristjansson said. “But I told him — I told him very clearly, exactly what I am telling you now — big time bling and rock stars and events are not prevention.” 
“To bring in Hollywood stars to do some bling events in town halls, let me tell you what the kids find about these is that this is fun. You’re bringing fun to them,” Kristjansson said. “You bring something like GameChanger through the schools with the logos and the bling, again, it’s fun. It’s a breakup in the day. They will have the ability to move out of a class for a reason. But it has no effect on prevention.” 
Kristjansson said there are too many people without expertise getting into prevention.
“Let me just put this straightforward: There is absolutely nothing that indicates that GameChanger is making an impact. Absolutely nothing,” Kristjansson said. 
Michael Hecht, a professor emeritus of communications at Pennsylvania State University and president of Real Prevention LLC, said it is uncommon for an individual under 15 to overdose or interact with opioids, but they are not a new topic for youth prevention education programs. There have been questions, though, about what information about specific substances is appropriate for different age groups.
“Opioids are tough because if you’re talking about like a middle school or even a high school, the usage levels are fairly low,” Hecht said. 
Hecht created keepin’ it REAL, a drug prevention program that began as a small research project in the 1990s and now reaches more than a million youth annually in all 50 states and 20 countries. The program’s growth led to the creation of Real Prevention, which Hecht said uses federal grants and contracts to create health promotion programs for schools, communities and other organizations working in health care spaces, like the American Cancer Society. 
Hecht’s programs use digital tools like apps and video games to address public health issues ranging from substance use to HPV vaccination. His research and resulting programs were used to overhaul and relaunch the D.A.R.E. program.
“It’s very narrative. It’s about stories, it’s about risk and decision making and social emotional learning,” Hecht said of the new D.A.R.E. programming.
Hecht says research shows programs for young people that focus on social-emotional learning and “develop core basic competencies in kids that tend to make them resilient and healthy” are the most effective.
“They use a prevention theory that’s based on modeling and narratives, and they avoid information fear,” he explained.
Hecht reviewed GameChanger materials and information to provide an analysis of its programming. 
“I would never choose a program like that because, I’m not saying that there isn’t a kid somewhere that it won’t help, but if you’re looking to increase your odds about having an effect, this program has got very low chances, in my opinion, of succeeding,” Hecht said.

Hecht says the program relies on pledges and fear-based messages that research has proven don’t improve outcomes for students. GameChanger also has not made public or included in its opioid settlement funding requests details for how it will measure its impact or success. 
“It’s not going to move the dial on changing social norms, teaching them social skills, you know, any of the kinds of things that we know are needed for substance use prevention,” he said. “Too many people are marketers or advertisers that get into the field and you recognize their programs as messages immediately because they’re glitzy but have no prevention theory behind them, really, other than fear.”
However, Hecht acknowledged that GameChanger is still a new program. 
“I think they’ve come to realize that they need a stronger prevention focus in the messages they’re sending out, that they tend to be kind of glitzy, they tend to fall into that marketing and advertising domain,” Hecht said. “And so they’re likely to maybe capture the kids’ attention, but I don’t know if they’ll go much beyond that now.”
“The reality is, if you don’t have engagement, you don’t have anything anyway. So it’s a step in the right direction. It’s the beginning. But as far as having a prevention theory or something like that, I don’t think it’s really there.”
Beyond the checkmark: Building sustainable prevention programs in West Virginia
Boczek acknowledges the critiques of his program’s scientific rigor and says that becoming an evidence-based program takes time — admitting that the process is taking longer than he initially thought. However, he said GameChanger is working to improve.
“If there’s ever been a kryptonite to GameChanger, it’s been an evidence-based question. It’s a working process that you have to cross every ‘T’ and dot every ‘I,’” he said. 
Boczek also acknowledged the lack of outcome tracking in the current iteration of the program. GameChanger intends to measure its success by tracking students, he explained. They want to track younger classes until their high school graduation and measure if they use any substances during that time. 
Hartley Health Solutions — a health consulting firm whose mission is to “improve community health outcomes through tailored, innovative consulting that addresses the specific needs of underserved-populations” — began working with GameChanger in January to develop more evidence-based programming and potentially help track outcomes. It is staffed by Ph.D.s in nursing, behavioral and social science, and epidemiology. 
“When I got to look closer at their materials, I said, if you really want to kind of level up with your programming, you need to develop the science. You need to use behavioral change theories and conduct intervention mapping,” Summer Hartley, the firm’s president, said. “You can work towards encouraging students to have a behavior change, not just education and awareness.” 
Hartley said the new programming her team has been developing will be implemented in the fall of 2025 in elementary, middle and high schools. It will be a standard model, she said, that every coach will use no matter the grade level they’re teaching. 
“Every coach will be handed an implementation guide, and students will get programming guides,” Hartley said.  
“We’re going to be evidence-informed, which is a step in the right direction,” Boczek said of the coming changes. 
Boczek said he has also begun conversations with Hecht to help GameChanger move from “evidence-informed” to evidence-based. Those conversations began after both were contacted to speak for this story, according to Boczek and Hecht.
“Dr. Hecht is hugely interested in helping GameChanger because he loves our concept,” Boczek said. “We’ve had two calls with him, and are sending him all our information. He’s pointed out where we need to change a few things.”
“See, we don’t say right now we’ve got all the answers, and we know exactly 100,000% this is what we’re doing. We know what we’ve been able to accomplish, learn it on the fly, and we know what we will accomplish when we continue to associate people with people like Michael Hecht,” he said.
Boczek says GameChanger has been one of the hardest things he has done in his life. His own life experiences around the opioid crisis and the negative effect it has had on the state he calls home are his driving force. He is hopeful his work will leave West Virginia better than he found it. 
“I hope that in the next three years, I can step away and see it be evidence-based, see it moving into other states, seeing a very big time staff that’s highly educated Ph.D.s and prevention scientists working every day on the problem and addressing all the new findings, and making sure we keep up with all the new things that may come out that can do it better than we’re doing it now,” Boczek said. 
“I hope we’re better tomorrow than we are today. I hope we’re better next year than we are this year, and I certainly hope we’re better in five years than we are now.”

“Instead of making this change through the legislative process, the state instilled its anti-trans agenda through obscure, extralegal bureaucratic maneuvers,” the advocacy organization Trans Income Project wrote in a statement to the Illuminator. “Now, thousands of Louisianans are losing coverage for trans medicine and incurring unexpected out-of-pocket costs when attempting to pick up their regular prescriptions.” 
Gender-affirming care is a catch-all term for medical treatments given to people to align their physical bodies with their identified gender. Such care is administered to transgender people, who identify as a gender different from their sex assigned at birth, as well as cisgender people, who identify as their assigned sex.
The Louisiana Department of Health did not respond to emailed questions asking why the policy has been put in place. 
The Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA School of Law that researches sexual orientation and gender identity law, estimates LGBTQ+ adults are twice as likely as non-LGBTQ+ adults to take part in the Medicaid program. 
Louisiana banned gender-affirming health care for transgender youth in 2023, but the treatments remain legal for transgender adults. 
The Williams Institute estimates about 15,700 transgender adults live in Louisiana. 
The Trans Income Project encourages individuals worried about paying for their prescriptions to reach out to the organization for assistance.

(Courtesy Indiana National Guard)After years on the decline, enlistment at the Indiana National Guard is on its way back up, and officials hope recent award and benefit changes will lead to further improvement.
Recruitment is up 14% over last year, according to Guard spokeswoman Lauren Houck. Air and Army members total of 12,173 members as of June 30.
At a closed ceremony Tuesday afternoon, Gov. Mike Braun ceremonially signed legislation, in effect July 1, that Adjutant General Larry Muennich previously said “will help address our challenges.”
Muennich also presented two Guard members with matching Indiana Distinguished Service Crosses for lifesaving actions — made possible by House Enrolled Act 1111.
Sgts. Justin Garrett and Taylor Watkins were at the Lawrence armory in September for a Junior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps event with Lawrence Central High School when a 17-year-old girl’s asthma attack crossed into cardiac arrest. The duo performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived.

The award previously was exclusive to those who perform a dangerous “act of heroism” or “act over and beyond the call of duty.” A new provision — for those who “contribut(e) directly” to saving others’ lives through an “act of courage” — put Garrett and Watkins’ names to paper and pins on their jackets.
“We just wanted a nice way to award soldiers and airmen who do outstanding, life-saving work,” Houck said.
Another award’s criteria was also expanded and a new one, the Indiana Outstanding Airman or Soldier of the Year, was created.
The legislation also offers big benefits that the pair of recruiters said could sweeten the deal for prospective recruits.
Soldiers and airmen who are 21st Century Scholars can now use Guard grants to pay up to $5,000 for higher education room and board, plus other approved expenses, for two years. The Scholars program covers tuition to Indiana colleges for foster children and low-income Hoosiers who meet academic requirements.
Members who apply for Guard tuition supplement scholarships can also use those awards to pay for credentialing programs and apprenticeships for “in demand occupations” determined by the adjutant general and Department of Workforce Development.
“The tuition assistance is great,” Garrett said. “Obviously, that’s one of our biggest selling points. It just encourages the citizen-soldier aspect, which is, all in all, going to make our job easier to help bridge the gap between the military and the civilian side.”
Other changes go beyond education.
House Enrolled Act 1111 adds soldiers on state active duty to the definition of a state employee for death benefit and worker’s compensation laws.
It also increases the payout cap on reasonable funeral expenses to $20,000 from $8,800 and deletes detailed, guard-specific processes for injury claims.
Additionally, the legislation allows the adjutant general to provide health insurance for members ordered to state active duty. Current law only lets the officeholder provide allowances to cover insurance premiums.
“All these changes seem to be heading into the right direction for recruiting aspects,” Garrett said. “… We are here to take care of our soldiers. We’re not just here for one week of the month.”

Sign up for Chalkbeat Tennessee’s free newsletter to keep up with statewide education policy and Memphis-Shelby County Schools.
More than $118 million for Tennessee schools and educational programs is in limbo after the Trump administration froze federal funding last week that had been approved by Congress. 
Withheld funds or potential cuts could heavily impact Tennessee education programs, where it’s primarily been used to pay for teacher development, after-school programs, and other child care initiatives.
In a statement, Memphis-Shelby County Schools district officials say 100 teacher and staff positions could be impacted if some $17 million is withheld.
The district planned to use more than $14 million of the impacted funds for teacher development and recruitment efforts across 38 positions, according to district budget proposal documents. Another $1.6 million was earmarked for English language learner support to supplement 46 school-based translators.
“While this situation presents significant challenges, MSCS is actively developing thoughtful contingency plans to minimize disruption and ensure students, families, and staff continue to receive the support they need,” the district said. “In the event the funding is not reinstated, the district may be required to make difficult decisions, which could include program adjustments or use of reserve funds intended to protect long-term financial stability.”
The Tennessee Department of Education hasn’t commented on the funding freeze or how it’s communicating developments to school districts in the weeks before Tennessee students return to the classroom, though other states have provided breakdowns of projected impacts on local schools. 
Congress approved the funding in March, and school districts expected the money to be released at the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1. The federal funding included $890 million for English language learners, $2.2 billion for teacher training, $1.4 billion for before- and after-school programs, and $1.3 billion for enrichment programs like college counseling nationwide.
A smaller pot of money — $375 million — was supposed to pay for academic support for the children of migrant farmworkers.
Several Democrat-led states have called for the funding to be released and have threatened legal action. The Trump administration has said the freeze is part of an ongoing review of federally funded programs.
An Office of Management and Budget spokesperson said its initial findings showed that grant funds have “been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” including issues around immigration, though the office did not provide Chalkbeat with any documentation of the allegations. 
In Tennessee, less than 2% of this federal funding allocation went to “migrant education,” according to a review by the Learning Policy Institute. The institute estimated Tennessee stands to lose more than $106 million under the freeze, slightly less than the $118.9 million total provided by U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic vice chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee who also sits on the Senate Education Committee.
Nashville Metro Schools did not receive any money last year from Title I-C, which funds migrant education, while MSCS was projected to receive less than $60,000 for the upcoming year, a tiny portion of the district’s $1.9 billion budget.
In Nashville, the district said it does not anticipate any immediate impacts on programming but is following the issue closely.
“These congressionally mandated programs support essential services for our students—including those who are learning English, need additional academic support, or benefit from extended learning opportunities—and help ensure we have effective educators in every classroom,” district spokesperson Sean Braisted said in an email. “We support efforts to fully fund these programs at or above previous levels.”
Child care advocates are raising alarms about the funding freeze’s effect on before- and after-school programs, which are vital in states like Tennessee with skyrocketing child care costs. Last week, Boys & Girls Club CEO Jim Clark warned the loss of 21st Century Community Learning Center funding, which supports extracurricular programs, could decimate hundreds of clubs across the country.
Tennessee received more than $23 million to support these programs last year, according to the AfterSchool Alliance, with about $3.2 million going to local Boys & Girls Clubs. Those clubs are not likely to close their doors but could be forced to pull back on programs such as additional tutoring and enrichment experiences.
Bart McFadden, the interim executive director for the Boys & Girls Clubs in Tennessee, said no clubs in the state are exclusively federally funded, and they will be able to withstand the freeze.
“This is a pause, and we don’t know what it’s ultimately going to mean as we get into the school year. We’re hopeful these funds are released,” McFadden said. “If they’re not, plans are in place to mitigate the impact so that our blue doors, as we call them, are open for kids.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A federal magistrate judge Tuesday denied a motion from former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who asked to appear at an upcoming court hearing remotely from prison in Pueblo. 
Peters, a prominent far-right election denier, is serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a 2021 security breach in the elections office she oversaw. Peters has appealed the conviction. While the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews her appeal, Peters has filed a federal habeas corpus petition in U.S. District Court of Colorado, arguing that she should be released on bond pending the appeal decision.
The hearing, scheduled for July 22, is set to focus on the habeas corpus petition, in which Peters’ attorneys say that “since she has been incarcerated, her health has deteriorated.”
Peters’ attorneys said in the motion that she wanted to attend the July 22 hearing because the issues being discussed “affect her liberty interests.” Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak’s decision Tuesday precludes her from doing so.

During Peters’ sentencing in October, 21st Judicial District Judge Matthew Barrett said Peters had done “immeasurable damage” to local elections and trust in the electoral process. Peters was convicted by a jury in August on three felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position.
Peters’ case has garnered national attention and President Donald Trump has called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
“Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on May 5.
On May 12, the Department of Justice asked for records from Colorado related to the 2024 and 2020 federal elections, as NPR first reported. Some election officials, including Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, believe the request is tied to the Peters case.

Sharpe, Jr. Hospital in Weston, W.Va. (Kristian Thacker | West Virginia Watch)As West Virginia continues to struggle with a lack of community-based homes for people with disabilities, the operating cost of a state psychiatric hospital is rising.
William R.Sharpe Hospital, located in Weston, is estimated to cost $128.7 million this fiscal year – up more than $9 in operating costs from last year. The price includes the hospital’s Transitional Living Facility.
“Sharpe Hospital, like most state psychiatric hospitals, has minimal reimbursement,” said Gailyn M. Markham, director of communications for the state Department of Health Facilities, which operates seven facilities, including two psychiatric facilities.
The department is continuing to develop additional community placements for people with disabilities, she added.
Community placements are much cheaper for the state. And, not every patient needs the level of restrictive care in a psychiatric hospital.
Mike Folio, legal director for Disability Rights West Virginia, said that over the last eight years, Sharpe had operational financial losses of $671 million in taxpayer money.
“The daily institutional cost per patient is roughly $900 per patient [per day],” Folio said. By contrast, he said, care for a patient in a community setting, like a home with appropriate staff, would be around $300 per day.
Taxpayers are covering the loss, he said, while “fear of this population” keeps state leaders from prioritizing putting people with disabilities in community-based settings. 
The state has the nation’s highest rate of people with disabilities, and the number of patients with intellectual and developmental disabilities being held at state psychiatric hospitals has nearly tripled over the last decade. 
West Virginia Watch has reported on numerous problems at Sharpe Hospital, including patients saying they were wrongfully held in the acute care facility without treatment plans. There was a string of arrests in 2023 involving contract nurses who worked there. 
While Gov. Patrick Morrisey named his own secretaries of the state health department and Department of Human Services; he opted to keep Sec. Mike Caruso over DHF. Caruso was appointed by former Gov. Jim Justice. 
Folio says transparency has improved at DoHS, but it’s still difficult to get information about how patients are treated at Sharpe. 
“Many of the same problems at Sharpe that existed before continue,” Folio said. “There’s still an undercurrent of concealment and retaliation.”
Lawmakers recently toured the Sharpe during June interim meetings in the area, however, the tour was closed to the media – a decision made by DHF. Markham said the hospital is closed to the public in an effort to uphold patient safety and minimize disruptions.
“The purpose of the recent tour was to educate legislators and allow them the opportunity to understand operating procedures and ask questions while subjecting patients to the least amount of disruption. However, the department remains committed to transparency and offers any media outlet the opportunity to reach out with questions,” she said. 
Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Weston, said he was thankful to have legislators and staff visit the hospital in his district.
“The reality is, operating a psych hospital can be both challenging and expensive, and the legislature wants to be sure we understand the complexity of the operations at Sharpe,” he said. “We are ready to assist the hospital’s efforts in providing the highest quality of care for its patients.”

Expensive contract workers account for 68% of Sharpe’s staffing 
Contract workers account for nearly 70% of the hospital staff at Sharpe. Earlier this year, DRWV filed a lawsuit against the state officials, saying contract workers had been permitted to harass and abuse patients and employees despite reports of their actions.
Markham said that in the past, contract and state-employed staff at the hospital have been terminated for a number of reasons, including substantiated internal investigations into patient treatment.
“The Department of Health Facilities takes patient safety and treatment very seriously,” she said. 
Folio said the state spent $100 million last year on contract workers at Sharpe.
An audit released in 2024 by the Legislature’s Post Audit Division showed the state spent $284 million since 2015 on contract nursing positions at its hospitals.
West Virginia, which has one of the nation’s lowest workforce participation rates, is struggling to fill full-time nursing jobs, which typically pay less than contract health care jobs.
From fiscal year 2015 to 2023, the total annual expenditure for contract clinical staff increased 955%, the audit found. 
A Justice-backed Medicaid reimbursement rate increase was meant to help hire more in-home staff who could help people with disabilities and others, but Folio said the change didn’t always translate into a pay raise for front-line workers. This has contributed to the shortage of community placements. 
DHF continues “to roll out initiatives to improve vacancy and turnover rates” to attract full-time staff, according to Markham. This year, the department has hired 152 state employees, and 88 of those were at Sharpe. The overall direct care vacancy rate at facilities has dropped 12% since January of last year. 
Morrisey’s administration continues to consider selling some state-run facilities. Cost is a driver in those conversations. 
“The Department of Health Facilities has continued to evaluate strategic options for the health care facilities, including Sharpe Hospital,” Markham said.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Sharpe_KST_20231027_2853-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 06:07:12.708486

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.

Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Some advisory members raised questions about a recently published study regarding the current complaint system. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After years of inconsistencies and complaints, Virginia has moved closer to revising its process for reporting issues with special education services, aiming to improve the structure and ensure that families receive the necessary services for their students with disabilities.
The issues with the state’s dispute resolution system — an impartial procedure for parents and schools to resolve disagreements over issues with special education services — have created a divide among parents and public school leaders for at least the past five years.
As federal law states, Virginia is required to provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program. Last year, Virginia recorded over 185,000 students receiving special education services during the 2024-25 school year.
Wendy Little, a parent advocating for her son who is autistic, spoke on Monday to the state’s dispute resolution system advisory group as it reviewed a study with findings about the existing system and recommendations for bettering it. Her son’s story was a key inspiration for the formation of the advisory committee through successful legislation to address the system. She called for an overhaul of the current system to resolve problems special needs families face concerning their children’s education. 
“There is no resolution,”  Little said. “It’s a dispute to the parents and you get nowhere. It’s not only broken, it is completely corrupt.”
 A history of noncompliance

The system, which has been studied for the past five years, has been criticized by parents and advocacy groups for failing to monitor and respond to complaints raised by families. The situation reached a critical point when the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) was investigated by the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights, which looked into why the agency had failed to resolve complaints. 
“The time for continued study should end, and focus should turn to implementing the many reforms that have been offered throughout the years, and in this study,” said Deusdedi Merced, managing member for Special Education Solutions, LLC, which conducted the July 1 study. “The time to address the concerns of many is now. Only then will the full breadth of the protections afforded to students with disabilities on the (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) will be realized.”
The report’s findings highlighted that dispute hearing officers did not meet standard legal practices. It also noted a public perception that VDOE has not effectively enforced the outcomes of investigations related to state complaint orders.
  During a meeting in Richmond on July 7, 2025, Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, shared key takeaways identified by her subgroup from the recently published study of Virginia’s Special Education Resolution Dispute System. (Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)
The findings align with a 2020 study conducted by the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission (JLARC), which analyzes and provides oversight of state agencies on behalf of the General Assembly, regarding K-12 Special Education. 
In that report, researchers identified significant shortcomings in the state’s provision of special education services, including low-quality Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) — customized learning plans for student’s disabilities — a lack of knowledge among educators about how to effectively support students with disabilities, and shortfalls in VDOE’s oversight of local divisions.
JLARC’s study also found that the VDOE does not require school divisions to carry out corrective actions that fully and appropriately remedy instances of noncompliance.
The state education agency began turning things around starting with the Board of Education updating Virginia’s regulations on due process on March 28, 2024. Last December, the Office for Civil Rights wrote a letter closing its findings and requirements against VDOE.
 Next steps

Some of the draft recommendations the advisory group will be voting on to improve the system include training for all stakeholders compared to a select few, expanding data collection and improving special education mediation.
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, chair of the Virginia Commission on Youth, said she hopes the draft recommendations will provide more standardization of the IEP process, better training across the system for the mediators and the hearing officers, and increased clarity and support for parents. Favola, along with Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, carried legislation to overhaul special education in 2024.
“We’re trying to bolster the system in a way that makes it more responsive to the parents and ensures a certain amount of quality across the state and I think that’s going to be the message in the report that we go forward with,” Favola said.

But some committee members, including Favola, expressed concern about whether the recommendations could be met, considering the threat to resources and programs posed by federal funding cuts. VDOE Superintendent of Public Instruction Emily Anne Gullickson said the agency will provide details about some of the cost impacts to special education at a future meeting.
The advisory group invited comments from the public, some of whom urged the committee to consider recommending a $10,000 cap on awards for parents, schools and hearing officers to reduce litigation costs. They also recommended better enforcement of federal laws, which includes the potential loss of licenses for non-compliance, and consistency across all divisions.
Kandise Lucas, an academic civil rights advocate, and parents also raised concerns about the mistrust the public has in Virginia’s public schools due to inconsistent eligibility determinations for students with disabilities and inadequate training across divisions.
“IDEA is a civil rights law that was created to make sure that children with disabilities are not marginalized; are not thrown away,” Lucas said. 
The advisory committee’s draft recommendations will be presented to the Virginia Commission on Youth on Sept. 3, and will be open for public comment until October 15. The commission will vote on these recommendations during its meeting on Oct. 21.

(Aristide Economopoulos /NJ Monitor)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars nationwide, especially in urban areas including Virginia Beach, Virginia, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”

(Getty Images)New Hampshire’s newly signed state budget will transfer nearly all money from the state’s Renewable Energy Fund to the general fund over the next two years, slashing investment in clean energy projects by roughly 50% from recent spending levels and forcing municipalities, school districts, and small businesses to compete for drastically reduced grant money. 
The budget, signed by Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte last month, redirects approximately $15 million in surplus funds and all incoming revenue — typically $3 million to $7 million annually — to the general fund through June 2027. Only $1 million per year will remain available for renewable energy projects, according to the bill’s language.
“You’re basically only spending a quarter of what you normally fund,” said Nick Krakoff, a senior attorney with the Conservation Law Foundation. “There’s going to be a lot less money for these programs.” 
The cuts are a heavy pull in state support for renewable energy development at a time when New Hampshire already lags other New England states in clean energy deployment, according to Krakoff. While the fund was designed to distribute $4 million to $5 million annually, the Department of Energy had been spending only about $2 million in recent years while allowing a surplus to accumulate.
Advocates say the funding clawback was predictable, warning for years that chronic underspending was creating a tempting target for lawmakers facing budget pressures.
Shortfall victims
The Renewable Energy Fund accumulated a large surplus because the Department of Energy was spending only about $2 million annually despite more revenue flowing into the account each year through compliance payments that utilities make when they cannot meet renewable energy requirements.
That surplus grew to approximately $20 million, with about $15 million unawarded, before lawmakers moved to transfer the funds. 
The slashing will particularly affect municipalities and school districts that have relied on the renewable energy fund for heating projects and other clean energy upgrades, according to Krakoff. Many of these entities have tight budgets and would be unable to move forward with planned projects without state funding due to “very limited money as it is,” he said. 
The fund’s annual revenue, generated through the state’s Renewable Portfolio Standard, has fluctuated over the years. According to the state Department of Energy’s most recent annual report from November 2024, the fund received $1.3 million in 2009, $2.5 million in 2018-2019, and peaked at $7.3 million in 2022. 
Recent distribution patterns show the scope of the programs now at risk. In 2023, the fund doled out approximately $1.6 million for competitive grants to commercial and municipal projects, plus $1.3 million for residential rebates. The low-moderate income solar program alone received $1.6 million in 2024 — exceeding the entire $1 million annual allocation that will remain available moving forward.
The budget language is also creating ambiguity about which programs will survive. While the bill specifies that Class II funds (the $1 million annual) “shall not be used to support individual solar initiatives,” it also says that it “shall primarily be used to support solar energy technologies in New Hampshire,” making it unclear whether the latter applies to residential or only commercial and industrial projects. 
Even so, the residential solar rebate program had already been eliminated through separate legislation in 2024, not through this budget. The program had devolved into an ineffective lottery system where installers couldn’t guarantee customers would receive rebates.
Advocates actually supported eliminating the residential rebate requirement to redirect funds toward more effective programs like income-tested rebates for low-income residents. But the Department of Energy has delayed implementing replacement programs, contributing to the surplus that lawmakers ultimately raided. 
The department, which administers the funds, will now need to determine how to allocate the remaining $1 million among programs that previously required more than $4 million annually.
To meet in the middle
The final provisions scaled back House Republicans’ original proposal to eliminate the Renewable Energy Fund entirely. Initial budget language would have returned all fund money to utility customers as monthly rebates starting in 2027.  
A compromise came after pushback from senators and clean energy advocates who argued the cuts went too far, particularly Loudon Republican Sen. Howard Pearl, whose district includes hydropower plants that benefit from Renewable Energy Fund grants.  
However, House Republicans still preserved their broader agenda through standalone legislation. A retained bill, House Bill 224, would revive the proposal to rebate all renewable energy fund money to ratepayers beginning in fiscal year 2028. The rebates would operate similarly to existing Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative rebates that already provide customers with small annual credits. 
Provisions included in early iterations of the latest budget bill, before ultimately being scrapped, targeted the Renewable Portfolio Standard itself, which generates the fund’s revenue by requiring utilities to purchase renewable energy or make alternative compliance payments.
Rep. Michael Vose, the Republican chair of the House Science, Technology, and Energy Committee, has previously defended the approach as necessary relief for ratepayers facing high energy costs.
The Ways and Means Committee will decide this fall whether to move forward with HB 224, given that the renewable energy fund will be “essentially depleted” by transfers to the general fund, Vose told the Bulletin on Tuesday. The committee could change the effective date to 2027, 2028, or later when the fund is no longer being used for general funding.
Vose supports returning money to ratepayers rather than the general fund, citing ratepayers being “constantly slammed with ever-increasing costs” for utility infrastructure maintenance. He also said that the transfer originated in Ayotte’s proposed budget in February, not as a legislative initiative. The governor’s office identified the $20 million to $21 million fund balance as available for general fund use beyond administrative costs, and “that was the plan all along,” according to Vose.
Others argue the cuts are counterproductive and eliminate a key tool for economic development and grid reliability. The funded projects help reduce electricity costs during, for example, recent heat waves when solar installations help “shave peak demand,” according Nick Paul, director of legislative affairs for Clean Energy New Hampshire. 
“Raiding the Renewable Energy Fund only stops projects that shrink electric bills,” Paul said. “Stopping those projects is not what is going to lower bills. Stopping them is what is going to raise bills.”
These projects also attract private capital investment that could be lost without state incentives, he noted.
At the same time, the fund transfer may even violate the New Hampshire Constitution by converting utility fees into taxes for general government purposes. A 2015 legal memo making this argument was written by Gordon MacDonald, who now serves as chief justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court. 
That argument centers on the distinction between fees, which must be used for their intended purpose, and taxes, which can fund general government operations. The Renewable Energy Fund is generated through alternative compliance payments.
But the impact for ratepayers appears modest. Conservation Law Foundation calculations show eliminating the Renewable Energy Fund would reduce bills by approximately 33 cents monthly for average residential customers.
For now, projects already approved for renewable energy fund grants will receive their awarded money, though this commitment isn’t explicitly reflected in the budget language, according to Krakoff. New applications, however, will compete for severely limited resources until July 2027, when normal fund operations are scheduled to resume.
The two-year funding drought creates a window for New Hampshire’s renewable energy development to slow to a crawl before potential restoration — unless the Legislature passes standalone bills next session to make cuts permanent.
“There’s going to be continuing efforts to weaken or even eliminate both the Renewable Portfolio Standard and the Renewable Energy Fund,” Krakoff said, describing what he characterized as “anti-renewable animus,” from House Republicans.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/solarnhira-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

(Photo credit: CSPAN)As President Donald Trump revealed this week that 14 countries will face steep economic tariffs come August 1, a new poll funded by Catawba College’s Center for North Carolina Politics & Public Service finds many are questioning the president’s decision-making capabilities.
The poll of more than 1,000 North Carolinians conducted by YouGov, found that 46 percent of those surveyed lack confidence in the decisions the president has made regarding tariffs. Forty-one percent expressed confidence in Trump’s decisions.
Among self-identifying Republicans, 75 percent expressed confidence in Trump’s decision-making on tariffs. But for Democrats it was exactly the opposite — 75 percent expressing no confidence. For Independent voters, 53 percent expressed a lack of confidence in the president’s decisions about his tariff policies, with fewer than one-third (31 percent) expressing confidence.
On inflation and the cost of living, 40% expressed confidence in Trump’s decision-making with 46% saying they were not too confident or not at all confident. Predictably, those who identified as Republicans were more willing to support the president on the economy, Democrats less so. Among Independents, 57% said they were not confident in the Trump administration.
Trump found support in the Catawba-YouGov poll for his handling of immigration. Eighty-seven percent of Republicans were confident in Trump’s immigration policies, compared to 72% of Democrats who did not favor the decisions the president has made regarding immigration.
Last week, Trump toured a detention center in the Florida Everglades that has been dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” The facility is viewed as a cost-effective solution for detaining undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Critics say the camp that can house up to 3,000 immigrants is unsanitary, and places those being held at great risk.

Again, the new poll underscores that North Carolina remains a purple state with voters split on how the president is moving forward in executing his agenda.
“So many of the topics garnered very close margins of those who expressed confidence versus those with a lack of confidence in the president’s ability to make decisions in his first six months in office,” said Dr. Michael Bitzer, director of the Center and professor of politics and history at Catawba College.
“While barely twenty percent of self-identified Democrats expressed confidence on any of the policies or issues asked, at least two-thirds of Republicans expressed confidence.”
Two areas where even Republican offered lower confidence scores in Trump’s decisions: defying court orders and bringing the nation together.
When it came to defying court orders, 61 percent of Republicans expressed confidence in Trump’s decision-making. As for and bringing the nation together, just 63 percent of Republicans had confidence the president would be able to accomplish that. Collectively, factoring in North Carolina Democrats and Independents, only one-third were confident Trump could unite the nation.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)The governor postponed her decision on a bill restricting local authorities from carrying out federal immigration enforcement until next year. Meanwhile, daily U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrest rates have doubled in Maine since President Donald Trump took office, new data show. 
The Maine Legislature passed the proposal in June — by just one vote in the House of Representatives and seven in the Senate — after it was one of the most debated on the chamber floors and following considerable changes in committee to narrow its scope. 
The amended version of the bill, LD 1971, prevents state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request but other restrictions — such as banning local authorities from providing office space for immigration authorities and limiting when state employees can inquire about a person’s immigration status — were removed.
With the Legislature now adjourned between its two-year session, Gov. Janet Mills opted to hold the measure until lawmakers return in January. Mills can then either veto the bill within the first three days of session or allow it to become law without her signature.
During public hearings, law enforcement authorities raised concern about the bill hindering federal partnerships that sometimes touch on some immigration issues, such as drug enforcement task forces, which led bill sponsor Rep. Deqa Dhalac (D-South Portland) to amend it so only work done by local police for the primary purpose of immigration enforcement would be banned. 
Mills understands the motivation behind the legislation to provide clarity to Maine law enforcement, her press secretary Ben Goodman said, but she believes it will do the opposite. 
“The bill is both overly broad and confusing, as it establishes a complicated legal regime of the type of interactions that are or are not permitted with federal law enforcement,” Goodman said in a statement.  
Maine Legislature passes restrictions on federal immigration enforcement

However, Sue Roche, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, believes the bill would provide necessary guardrails. 
“LD 1971 is about ensuring Maine’s state and local law enforcement aren’t using our limited taxpayer dollars to do civil immigration enforcement for the federal government and that they aren’t handing Maine residents over to immigration officers just based on their immigration status alone,” Roche said in a statement. 
The full extent to which state and local law enforcement are helping with immigration enforcement is not clear, but ILAP has tracked 17 traffic stops since March 2025 where such authorities have handed over at least 35 Maine residents and workers to immigration officers based on their immigration status. 
“While Maine’s state and local resources should not be wasted to investigate immigration status in any case, many of those impacted were known to be in a lawful immigration process, have a valid work permit, and no criminal record,” Roche said.
Immigration arrests increase in Maine 
ICE arrests in Maine have been increasing, particularly in recent weeks. 
Since Trump took office, ICE has arrested nearly 100 people in Maine, according to the Deportation Data Project. That’s about a 50% increase compared to 2024 numbers, according to the data collected through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against ICE brought by the Center for Immigration Law and Policy at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Arrest rates in Maine and other states specifically surged in recent weeks, after Trump’s top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, demanded that ICE ramp up arrests to 3,000 people per day.
The vast majority of these recent arrests in Maine were not people convicted of a crime. According to the data, only about 20% were people convicted of a crime, whereas about 47% were people with pending criminal charges and 32% were people with immigration violations. 
These figures don’t include arrests made by U.S. Border Patrol, which hit a nearly 24-year high in Maine in April with more than 100 arrests in just that month. 
Immigration arrests have also increased nationwide, more than doubling in 38 states, according to the data. 
There is now more funding allocated to further ramp up immigration enforcement, with the federal budget Trump signed into law earlier this month securing more than $170 billion for this aim. The package would give the Department of Homeland Security $45 billion for the detention of immigrants and give its immigration enforcement arm another $30 billion to hire up to 10,000 new agents.
Formal agreements with immigration authorities
Wells community divided over ICE agreement with local police

Maine lawmakers opted to postpone until next year another related bill before it got a chance to be considered by the full Legislature. The Judiciary Committee carried over LD 1259, which seeks to explicitly prohibit state or local law enforcement agencies or officers from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities.
Wells Police Department is the only Maine agency to contract with ICE under what’s called the 287(g) program, which Trump revived to bolster ICE’s capacity by deputizing local police officers to detain immigrants, an authority otherwise generally reserved to federal authorities. While that agreement is still in place, the department has yet to decide whether or when it will act on it beyond training.
Wells Police Chief Jo-Ann Putnam announced in early May a “wait-and-see approach” to credentialing its officers under the program in light of the pending legislation. As of Tuesday, Putnam told Maine Morning Star officers had already completed the training for the program but had not yet been credentialed, which Putnam said meant they have not yet performed any of the functions allowed under the agreement. 
“Nothing has changed,” Putnam said. “Absolutely nothing has changed.”
In light of the two related bills being pushed off to next year, Putnam said she had not yet decided what that will mean for her officers’ participation in the program until then. “I’m not 100% sure how long they would hold the training for,” she said. 
If they start undertaking federal immigration enforcement, Putnam reiterated that Wells police would only enforce immigration detainers for people who are designated as “criminal aliens” if officers come across them in daily work, though the agreement permits broader enforcement. 
Wells Police Department remained listed as a participating agency in the program on the ICE website as of July 8.
Residents who’ve organized against the agreement are pushing for a permanent termination. After the pause on credentialing, they submitted more than 900 signatures to the town from Wells residents in favor of withdrawing from the contract.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The justices’ reasoning in the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding Tennessee’s ban on youth gender-affirming care could have much broader implications, perhaps opening the door to state restrictions on health care for other groups of people, experts say.
The ruling could give states leeway to make rules on any other sex-related treatment — potentially affecting people of all genders, according to legal and health policy scholars.
In U.S. v. Skrmetti, three families and a physician argued that a Tennessee law barring the use of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors violates the U.S. Constitution’s equal protection clause. They asserted that the law discriminates on the basis of sex, since the state allows the use of similar treatments for cisgender boys and girls with other medical conditions.
The court weighed the argument of whether the law treats people differently, subject to what is called heightened scrutiny. Under this higher level of judicial review, the state must identify an important objective for a law and demonstrate how it helps accomplish that goal.
But the court’s conservative majority last month ruled that the Tennessee ban doesn’t merit such scrutiny because its restrictions are based on age and the medical uses of certain drugs, not sex. Twenty-six other states have similar laws to Tennessee’s.
U.S. Supreme Court upholds Tennessee prohibition on gender affirming care for minors

The Tennessee law “prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers and hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote. “The law does not prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing those same treatments for minors of the opposite sex.”
Justice Elena Kagan disputed that view during oral arguments.
“The whole thing is imbued with sex. It’s based on sex,” Kagan said. “You might have reasons for thinking it’s an appropriate regulation and those reasons should be tested and respect given to them, but it’s a dodge to say, ‘This is not based on sex, it’s based on medical purpose,’ when the medical purpose is utterly and entirely about sex.”
Tennessee’s law says the state has a “compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex.”
Some legal and policy experts say the court’s reasoning in Skrmetti could allow states to enact further restrictions on abortion, contraception, in vitro fertilization or other health care, particularly sex-specific treatment, sidestepping previous protections.
Jules Gill-Peterson, an associate professor of transgender history at Johns Hopkins University, called the ruling “consequential.”
“The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case,” she said. ”Everyone has a sex. Everyone is now much more vulnerable to sex discrimination in this country, even if it hasn’t taken place yet.”
She added that women, especially, could see rollbacks.
“It will greatly advance people’s ability to discriminate against women,” she said. “This case really kind of now altered the legal landscape in a pretty significant way.”










The court has basically decreed a new form of legal and political vulnerability that did not exist before the Skrmetti case.


– Jules Gill-Peterson, Johns Hopkins University associate professor


The ruling marks “a deeply concerning direction,” said Kellan Baker, executive director of the Institute for Health Research and Policy at Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ+ health nonprofit in the Washington, D.C., area.
“At any time and for any reason, a state legislature could decide that any medical indication is suddenly not politically palatable, and move to ban access to any type of care that legislature wants to target,” Baker said.
He added that the decision is likely to have “serious political ramifications” for more than just transgender people.
Eric Neiman, an attorney at Epstein Becker Green, a law firm focused on health care and employment cases, agreed the ruling “could allow states to regulate all kinds of medical procedures for children and adults.”
Ultimately, Neiman said, the decision indicates “deference to states in decision-making about care that can be provided to children.”
Sex-based protections
The decision builds on the 2022 Dobbs ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade, said Katie Keith, the founding director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown University Law Center.
“I don’t know that we would have seen this decision in the same way if we hadn’t had the Dobbs decision three years ago and the erosion of sex-based protections,” she said.
Keith pointed to state actions that followed Dobbs, such as a decision by Iowa’s attorney general to halt funding for emergency contraceptives for sexual assault victims. The policy drew significant outcry, which resulted in the office resuming funding.
Here’s how state lawmakers are taking aim at transgender adults’ health care

Leah Litman, a University of Michigan law professor, wrote in a recent essay in The Atlantic that Roberts and the other conservative justices revived “an outdated case” when they cited the 1974 decision in Geduldig v. Aiello, in which the justices ruled it was permissible to deny certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities.
“If the Republican appointees plan to revive this older case, they will take the law and the country back to a time when the government used the existence of ‘biological differences’ between men and women to excuse all kinds of discrimination against women,” Litman wrote.
Also at stake are previous appellate court decisions out of West Virginia and North Carolina that protected transgender adults’ access to public insurance coverage for transgender care. The Supreme Court threw out those rulings and ordered appellate judges to reevaluate in light of the Skrmetti decision. Another case involving gender-affirming medical care out of Idaho will also have to be reevaluated.
‘Scientific and policy debates’
Critics of gender-affirming health care for youth hailed the Skrmetti ruling, citing recent research that calls into the question the efficacy of such treatments. The decision was “a monumental victory, for children, science, and common sense,” Kristen Waggoner, president and CEO of Alliance Defending Freedom, wrote in an emailed statement.
But dozens of leading U.S. medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, have stressed that gender-affirming care for minors is safe and essential.
“Denying patients access to this care not only undermines their health and safety, it robs them of basic human dignity,” Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in a statement following the decision. “The ruling also sets a dangerous precedent for legislative interference in the practice of medicine and the patient-physician relationship that is at the core of our health system.”
But in his opinion, Roberts insisted that the case carries “scientific and policy debates.” “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best,” he wrote.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Sonia Sotomayor said the majority’s arguments mirror those made in defense of banning interracial marriage in the Loving v. Virginia case. The Supreme Court struck down the ban in 1967.
“In a passage that sounds hauntingly familiar to readers of Tennessee’s brief, Virginia argued in Loving that, should this Court intervene, it would find itself in a ‘bog of conflicting scientific opinion upon the effects of interracial marriage,’” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.
Advocates say the narrowness of the Skrmetti decision could make it possible to challenge state bans on health care for trans youth on other grounds.
“[The ruling] is not a blanket endorsement of the various state bans on medical care for transgender youth. It is a tortured and narrow upholding of Tennessee’s,” said Baker, of Whitman-Walker. “The court sidestepped the actual question about equal protection.”
For example, a plaintiff could argue that parents have a constitutional right to make medical decisions for their children. Supporters of transgender rights also noted the decision did not take aim at equal protection rights for transgender adults, but other obstacles remain amid an onslaught from the Trump administration.
President Donald Trump has issued an executive order recognizing only biological sex and not gender identity. The administration has also frozen federal grant money dedicated to LGBTQ+ health and issued warnings for gender-affirming care for minors.
And the administration last month finalized a rule barring health plans offered on Affordable Care Act exchanges from covering gender-affirming care — defined as surgeries, puberty blockers and hormone treatment — as an essential health benefit. The decision means that payments for such care cannot be applied toward deductibles.
“[The court] signaled that perhaps some of the kinds of protections, or maybe just backstops, people had been hoping existed, they’re just not there,” Gill-Peterson said.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)For 37-year-old Kyle Garvey, a typical day includes writing film reviews and doing some tutoring.
To do those things, the Columbus resident first needs to get out of bed.
Having had cerebral palsy since birth, that means having a home health provider to help him get out of bed, get dressed, eat meals, and anything else he needs during the day.
“It’s very basic life stuff,” Garvey told the Capital Journal.
The 11 hours per day of home care he receives is paid for by Medicaid, and the recent changes made to federally funded health care leave Garvey concerned.
“It’s important to me to have the stable support structure of Medicaid and Social Security,” Garvey said.

But Garvey insists his life “is a little bit stabler than a lot of people’s,” and speaking out about the importance of Medicaid, for him, is to help others.
“I know (Medicaid cuts) may not threaten me personally, and the cuts and stuff may not loom quite so tall over my personal life, but I’m just concerned about my community and the people that have worse situations than I do, and less of a support structure,” Garvey said.
The recently passed federal budget reconciliation bill made broad cuts of more than $1 trillion to the Medicaid program, largely in the implementation of work requirements and hospital tax changes.
Much of the changes targeted states who use their own funds to provide Medicaid to immigrants without “qualified” status. Estimates show nearly 12 million people across the country will lose their health insurance by 2034, as the Medicaid cuts are phased in.
What could be seen as a silver lining is the survival of Ohio’s Medicaid expansion group, which was in fear of elimination based on a provision of the state operating budget signed by Gov. Mike DeWine last week.
The provision of the state budget stated that if the federal contribution to the expansion group dropped by even 1% from the 90% contribution currently given to the state, Ohio would eliminate the expansion group, in a transition that could have resulted in more than 770,000 Ohioans losing their health insurance.
Nevertheless, health care advocates in Ohio say the federal cuts, as they stand now, will impact more than 400,000 Ohioans.
Willoughby resident Roman Sardo-Longo is a part of that expansion group that could have been on the chopping block. The 21-year-old is a first-generation American who credits Medicaid for opening up his life through mental health supports and gender-affirming care.
  Roman Sardo-Longo stands in front of the U.S. Capitol, after traveling to talk with representatives about Medicaid and the budget bill as part of a Planned Parenthood speakers bureau. (Photo courtesy of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Ohio.)
Sardo-Longo said he always had issues with anxiety and struggled to keep up with his education because he couldn’t bring himself to leave his house.
The fear of being misgendered as a transgender man, and delays in receiving gender-affirming care meant “everything was harder” for him.
“When I took my first (hormone replacement therapy) shot, I started to feel like my life was moving forward,” according to Sardo-Longo.
Medicaid is the only reason he could access the medical care that he needed to move forward and get his GED, think about going to school for engineering, and possibly get top surgery, he said.
He also joined Planned Parenthood’s “speaker’s bureau” as a way to tell the story of his health journey, and travelled to Washington D.C. to talk to congressional representatives about the budget changes.
“Very early on, things were really, really difficult for me, and so I don’t think I could have gotten through that part of my life without the therapy and the consults that I had,” he said. “You can’t work if you’re not healthy, you can’t work if you’re not happy or healthy enough.”
The necessity of Medicaid certainly isn’t lost on fellow Ohioan Mary Jane Sanese.
She spent a decade going through medical testing and appointments, and was eventually diagnosed at 23 with endometriosis, a chronic illness that affects the uterus, and can cause everything from inflammation to infertility.
The search for solutions was dependent on reliable health care and coverage.
“Even after (diagnosis), managing symptoms requires ongoing care with specialists,” Sanese said. “For me, that’s meant surgery, gastroenterology care, pelvic floor therapy, bladder treatments and routine preventive care to stay functional.”
But as she approached age 26, the age when she could no longer be covered by her mother’s health insurance, she couldn’t afford private insurance while working an hourly job and going to school full time.
She considered qualifying for Medicaid “a huge relief.”
A life without medical care or even just delayed care would mean “years of worsening pain, complications and irreversible damage” for her.
“The life of not having to worry about how I was going to afford treatment such as medication and appointments relieved me of so much stress, which I truly believe benefited my physical health,” Sanese said.
When the COVID-19 pandemic rolled in, she lost her job and faced much uncertainty, except when it came to her health care.
As a communications associate for Groundwork Ohio, she now has insurance provided by her employer, but the fact that she had the safety net of Medicaid when she needed it “quite literally saved my life.”
As part of her work, she helped advocate against the changes to Medicaid, in part by sharing her Medicaid story.
“No one should have to choose between going to the doctor or paying their rent for the month,” she wrote on Groundwork’s website as part of a call-to-action urging Ohioans to fight against the changes.

Democratic U.S. Senators Edward Markey, Jeffrey Merkley, Ron Wyden, and Chuck Schumer sent a letter to Trump, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and Speaker of the House Mike Johnson on June 12 outlining hundreds of hospitals that were considered at-risk under Trump’s spending bill.

“Enacting these drastic health care cuts that will kick millions of people off their health insurance coverage, rural hospitals will not get paid for the services they are required by law to provide to patients,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter. “In turn, rural hospitals will face deeper financial strain that could lead to negative health outcomes for the communities they serve.”
The 11 Ohio hospitals listed as at-risk under Trump’s spending bill according to the senators letter:

Southern Ohio Medical Center in Portsmouth (Scioto County).
Wayne Hospital Company in Greenville (Darke County).
East Liverpool City Hospital in East Liverpool (Columbiana County).
Coshocton Regional Medical Center in Coshocton (Coshocton County).
Twin City Medical Center in Dennison (Tuscarawas County).
Harrison Community Hospital in Cadiz (Harrison County).
Bucyrus Community Hospital in Bucyrus (Crawford County).
Holzer Medical Center in Jackson (Jackson County).
Galion Community Hospital in Galion (Crawford, Morrow, and Richland counties).
Adams County Regional Medical Center in Seaman (Adams County).
Fayette County Memorial Hospital in Washington Court House (Fayette County).

The letter said hospitals were “at risk of financial distress and even closure, conversion, or service reductions because of the cuts.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to the hospital systems for comment, but most did not respond by deadline. Those that did respond either said they are not at risk of closing or declined to comment. 
“Avita Health System, which includes Bucyrus and Galion Hospitals, is not financially at risk of closing,” said Kim Winkle, vice president of operations for Avita Health System.
Adena Health System, which oversees Fayette County Memorial Hospital, declined to comment.
Wayne HealthCare, which oversees Wayne Hospital, said in a June 24 press release they are not at risk of closing or cutting services, but said the spending bill “could have devastating consequences, particularly for mothers, infants, and low-income families.” 
The Ohio Hospital Association has not been notified of any member hospitals closing because of Trump’s spending bill, said Ohio Hospital Association Spokesperson John Palmer. 
The Democratic senators used data from the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina for their letter. According to the letter, 338 hospitals across the country were listed as at-risk.
The hospitals were determined to be at-risk because they meet one or both of two financial criteria — the hospital is in the top 10% Medicaid payer mix of rural hospitals in the country, or the hospital has experienced three consecutive years of negative total margins. 
“Rural hospitals are often the largest employers in rural communities, and when a rural hospital closes or scales back its services, communities are not only forced to grapple with losing access to health care, but also with job loss and the resulting financial insecurity,” the lawmakers wrote in their letter. 
Twin City Medical Center and Harrison Community Hospital were listed as having three years of negative margins. The other nine Ohio hospitals were listed as top Medicaid providers. 
The most recent rural hospital closure in Ohio was last year when the Community Memorial Hospital in Hicksville (Defiance County) closed due to financial issues.

President Donald Trump may have only the faintest idea of what’s in the massive budget bill he signed into law last Friday, but sadly, the contents and the destructive impacts they’ll have are no mystery to the nation’s already beleaguered charities.
Last week, North Carolina food banks sent out an urgent alert explaining that the bill’s massive cuts to SNAP food assistance will have devastating effects.
While the state’s food banks provide over 250 million meals each year, they noted, SNAP provides nine times as many. And there’s simply no way for charities to fill the gap left by the impending federal cuts.
Meanwhile, at a gathering of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, advocates told NC Newsline’s Greg Childress that the bill will eliminate funding for more than 166,000 units of Permanent Supportive Housing at a time when homelessness is already spiking to new and alarming levels.
The bottom line: Hunger and homelessness in North Carolina are about to get much worse. And we can all thank Trump and his Republican allies in Congress for making it happen.

Jeff Crossman has filed a class action lawsuit challenging Ohio’s plan to pay for a new Cleveland Browns stadium. The state budget finds the money by taking ownership of unclaimed funds left in the state’s care for more than 10 years.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit contends that’s an “unconstitutional and unlawful misappropriation of private property.”
Ohio unclaimed funds account, made up of forgotten deposits, uncashed checks and abandoned bank accounts, is worth nearly $5 billion.
To this point, the state has held those funds in perpetuity until their rightful owner comes forward to claim them. That approach is the broadly agreed-upon best practice around the country.
The handful of states that eventually do take ownership of abandoned funds wait far longer than Ohio proposes or limit the transfer to small dollar amounts.
Ohio’s new budget, however, rolls $1 billion in unclaimed funds to a new account supporting Sports and Cultural Facilities.
The majority is already spoken for — the Cleveland Browns are set to receive $600 million of that total to help fund their proposed Brook Park stadium.
Can they do that? Ohio Senators propose novel, if questionable, Browns stadium funding plan

Ohioans whose unclaimed funds get swept into the new facilities fund have a ten-year grace period in which the state will still honor claims. But to Crossman, that doesn’t legitimize the state’s plan.
“The State of Ohio intends to steal over a billion dollars in private property from its citizens and pour it into the pockets of Jimmy Haslam, one of America’s richest men,” Crossman insisted in a press release.
“Everyday Ohioans are rightfully outraged by this blatant abuse of power,” he added. “The government can’t just take someone’s property and give it to someone else. This type of outrageous behavior ignited the American revolution 250 years ago.”
Crossman warned the governor and state lawmakers are forgetting what the British learned at the Battle of Bunker Hill. The British won that battle, admittedly at great cost.
Crossman and former Attorney General Marc Dann showed up at the Ohio Statehouse the day lawmakers voted on the budget, to warn the lawsuit was coming if lawmakers didn’t change course. Dann explained that several Ohioans and constitutional scholars have contacted their firm since the budget passed.
“Their message has been loud and clear,” Dann said. “What the state is doing isn’t just wrong — it violates the very reason we have constitutions and laws.”
Dann argued that constitutional protections aren’t a suggestion, and the state budget is attempting to sidestep longstanding rights to property and due process.
“The legislature and governor,” he argued, “have no authority to convert Ohioan’s private property into a slush fund that can be used to subsidize a billionaire campaign contributor’s private football stadium.”
Democratic former Ohio lawmakers threaten lawsuit over Cleveland Browns stadium funding plan

The lawsuit alleges Ohio’s plan infringes on U.S. and state constitutional protections. The complaint cites the Fifth Amendment’s command that private property can’t “be taken for public use, without just compensation” as well as due process guarantees in the Fifth and 14th Amendments.
The complaint notes the Ohio Constitution holds private property “inviolate.” Absent a public emergency, the government must provide compensation prior to taking private property with oversight from a jury.
The procedure contemplated by the state budget doesn’t even provide notice to people losing property, Crossman and Dann complain.
“The right to pre-payment of just compensation, as established by a jury, and the right to notice and hearing prior to taking of private property are fundamental constitutional rights afforded to all, and the government may not abrogate those rights in the name of expediency or convenience,” the complaint states.
Gov. Mike DeWine could have vetoed the funding mechanism when the budget landed on his desk. Instead, he allowed it to stay in, arguing the approach met his expectations by not relying on general fund revenue, and establishing a funding stream to benefit facilities beyond one NFL team.
Still, DeWine attempted to distance himself from the idea.
“Look, it wasn’t my choice of where to take the money,” DeWine said at a press conference about the budget. “But I achieved the two objectives that I thought were the most important.”
Crossman and Dann’s lawsuit has been filed in Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.

In November of 2023, 57% of Ohioans voted yes on Issue 2: the legalization of recreational cannabis. But since then, many GOP legislators have been trying to change the law — angering citizens, dispensaries, Democrats, and even fellow Republicans.

“We’re kind of the long and the short of the issue,” Callender said, jokingly pointing out the height difference between him and Fischer.

For the past several months, the Ohio House and Senate chambers have been trying to compromise on their separate bills.
In short, the Senate’s proposal decreases THC content, reduces home growing from 12 plants to 6, imposes more criminal penalties, and takes away tax money from local municipalities that have dispensaries. The House’s latest version had none of those.

In June, Callender said an agreement was reached on following most of the House’s new version, which mainly focused on preventing children from accessing the drug.
But as we reported, the Senate pulled out of a deal at the last minute.
Once the senators said “no deal,” the chambers were left to figure out what to do to still pass legislation by the end of June.
But it never got there. The House GOP, made up of 65 members, couldn’t reach 50 “yes” votes.
“Those who are leaning ‘no’ have varied reasons why they’re leaning no — from, ‘I don’t want to vote for any bill that has the word cannabis in it’ to ‘it restricts too much and is against the will of the voters’ or ‘it’s going to harm local businesses and the hemp sales,'” Callender said.
Fischer, the state’s youngest lawmaker, who just turned 29, has been able to navigate the hemp side of the argument while Callender dealt with cannabis.
The Senate has also passed legislation that would completely remove hemp, low-level THC products such as delta 8, from being sold anywhere besides a licensed marijuana dispensary. This would prevent the grocery stores, smoke shops, wellness facilities, convenience stores, and gas stations from selling the product.
Fischer argues that this is against the free market, and there are better ways to regulate the product without harming businesses or consumers who don’t want to visit a dispensary or don’t have one in their area.
Delta 8 has become a major concern for Gov. Mike DeWine, who conducted an “undercover sting operation,” sending in teenagers to buy low-level marijuana from a convenience store.
As of right now, hemp products do not have an age requirement. Both Callender and Fischer say there should be, and also should have testing requirements like cannabis, which has all been included in their legislation.
“I don’t want to pass a policy that only punishes the people in Ohio that are playing by the rules, that are embracing regulation, that want to be productive and be a part of this conversation,” the Gen-Z legislator said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The governor, on the other hand, says he just wants something done — and has been asking legislators to move on this for years.
“I’m hopeful that the legislature will wrap this up and give us a bill and we can go on to other, other discussions,” the governor said. “This is the whole issue in regard to the implementation of what the people of the state of Ohio voted on. It’s important.”
Marijuana policy expert state Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, hadn’t been focusing on hemp while going through the negotiations process because he was under the impression that everything was fine with the Senate’s proposal, he said.
“We really haven’t had much discussion on hemp in the last six months or six weeks,” he said, adding that this is the number one priority to handle. “We felt it wasn’t the issue (we disagreed on).”
The Senate, even the last General Assembly when current House Speaker Matt Huffman was the Senate President, was in lockstep with DeWine on restricting marijuana access and handling hemp. The more marijuana-friendly House members, led by Callender, have been behind the stall.
“I believe that it’s really important that we get this done by June 30th, and particularly hemp, so our young Teenagers aren’t going to convenience stores this summer and getting intoxicated,” S. Huffman said in late June.
Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, stated that the lack of action prevents municipalities from receiving their share of the revenue. During the budget negotiations, lawmakers addressed a “defect” in the initiated statute, one that inadvertently prevents any of the tax revenue from being returned to its designated fund.
The law gives the 10% tax revenue from each marijuana sale to four different venues: 36% to the social equity fund to help people disproportionately impacted by marijuana-related laws; 36% to host cities — ones that have dispensaries; 25% to the state’s mental health and addiction services department; and 3% to the state’s cannabis control department.
Although the lawmakers could have expedited the distribution process by amending the law in the budget, they didn’t.
“There will not be distributions out to the local governments, to the host communities, until we deal with the entire marijuana bill,” Cirino said.
Cities would rather wait a few months to get their funding, Callender said, rather than have the Senate remove it completely — which was in that chamber’s proposal.
Asked if he was OK with the latest delay, Callender said he’s fine with it but thinks they need to do some implementation language.
“But generally, I’m fine taking another six months. I’d rather take six months and get it right than have something that is against the will of the voters,” he said.
“The will of the voters is a perfectly acceptable situation,” Fischer added.
Lawmakers will attempt to renegotiate in the fall.

(Getty Images)You’d be forgiven if among all the scary national and international headlines of the past few weeks you missed the first meeting of the newly formed Religious Liberty Commission.
You may not have even heard of this Trump-appointed commission of almost entirely Christian Nationalists tasked with “safeguard(ing) and promot(ing) America’s founding principle of religious freedom.” If religious freedom is something you value, you need to add this to your list of things to follow, because the first meeting made it clear that we are headed towards the end of religious freedom for all in our country. As an atheist, that really scares me.
President Donald Trump announced the commission during the National Day of Prayer event May 1. It is responsible for creating a report with recommendations for the president, due on July 4, 2026 (the 250th anniversary of our independence, just in case their intent to push the falsehood that the USA was founded as a Christian nation isn’t clear enough). The commission is just one of Trump’s many actions to appease his evangelical base, including his establishment of a “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias” in February.
Religious extremists have been messaging around “Christian discrimination” for decades. They have fabricated a narrative where they are victimized by anyone who believes, lives, loves, or looks different than they do. This effectively scares the public into putting its trust into officials who say they will protect them against “the other.” Evidence of these anti-Christian offenses that the commission is meant to investigate is twisted to privilege extremist religious beliefs over the safety and wellbeing of others.
As an example of so-called anti-Christian offenses, Attorney General Pam Bondi cited the arrest of 23 anti-abortion activists who were charged in 2020 with conspiring to storm an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C. Kansans are intimately familiar with the violence directed toward abortion clinics and providers after the assassination of physician George Tiller in 2009, and we don’t need to look beyond last month’s assassination of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband to see how religious extremists target Planned Parenthood and their supporters. Instead of understanding this, Trump pardoned all 23 activists this January.
The commission is made up of almost entirely of known right-wing Christians — including Texas Lt. Gov. and Chair Dan Patrick; former HUD secretary and vice chair Ben Carson; son of Billy Graham, disgraced evangelist Franklin Graham; former Miss California Carrie Prejean Boller; lawyers from Project 2025-affiliated organizations such as First Liberty Institute and Ethics & Public Policy Center; and right-wing TV and radio hosts such as Dr. Phil. A bishop, cardinal, and rabbi round out the members in what they tout as a “diverse” representation of faiths in America.
The commission will hold several more hearings over the next year to investigate the tired list of Christian Nationalist priorities, including so-called parent rights and “school choice,” prayer in schools, vaccine mandates, government displays of religious iconography, and “anti-Christian offenses.” As expected, the other key priority voiced throughout the day was to attack the LGBTQ+ community — especially trans kids.
During this first hearing, the real objectives of the commission became abundantly clear:

Rewrite history to make America a Christian nation. A key tenet of the Christian Nationalist political ideology is that America was founded as a Christian nation, and must return to this status to secure our future success. The commission repeatedly embraced this very narrow interpretation of key historical documents, including writings by the founders and the Free Exercise and Establishment clauses of the First Amendment. Both commissioners and witnesses denied the principle of church-state separation and a secular government.
Remake the courts with “courageous” Christian Nationalists. The courts, specifically the U.S. Supreme Court, will be the subject of many recommendations in the final commission report. The commission discussed which cases should be overturned, how Trump’s administration can assist with that, and how to make sure pesky state and local courts don’t get in the way. The Supreme Court has been chipping away at church-state separation for the past decade with crucial victories this term, but for this commission, this isn’t happening fast enough.
Promote religion in all parts of American culture, politics, and public life (but only if it’s their version of “Christianity”). Expert witnesses referred to a divine truth — the existence of a Judeo-Christian God — as the foundation for a moral, happy, and politically good society. Many devout Americans hold similar beliefs about their faith, but also recognize that our government should not prioritize one religion in a pluralistic society. Not only does this push minority faiths and nonbelievers such as myself outside of the bounds of this “virtuous citizenry,” but it asserts that one religion (Christianity) must be imposed on every person to create and maintain this good society.

In a world where we are facing very real threats to our physical, mental, and financial health, why did I spend five excruciating hours listening to a commission whose only job is to make recommendations? The obvious answer is because these individuals were hand-selected for holding a world view that advances the Christian Nationalist agenda and threatens any religious beliefs that fall outside of this ideology. The uncomfortable truth is that this rhetoric justifies hate crimes and the dissolution of rights for women and minorities has a new platform with the divine weight of presidential approval. As a lifelong atheist, I’m scared that we’re looking at the end of church-state separation and the rise of a theocracy weaponizing religion against people who don’t fall in line.
American Atheists just announced that it will no longer be hosting the 2026 World Humanist Congress in Washington, D.C., because the “Trump Administration’s actions … have created an environment that is not only incompatible with our values but also inhospitable to members of our global secular community.” They feared for the safety of their attendees because we are no longer a country welcoming of visitors, and especially not visitors who fall outside of a specific Christian identity.
But it’s not just the secular community who should be worried right now. Every person who has found within their faith the mission to love their neighbor, feed the hungry, protect the vulnerable, and embrace the stranger should be fighting for the sanctity of their beliefs. The members of the Religious Liberty Commission will not be including these priorities in their final report, and you will not find a place for your faith in their new America.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Some violence is kinetic — sudden and easily seen. Some is systemic — slow, sanctioned, and easily ignored.

Violence doesn’t always come with screams or sirens. Sometimes it slinks through legislation.
Ohio’s biennial budget is a slow, grinding assault on public education. This is a violence that unfolds over years and generations. It bleeds opportunity and shatters potential. It’s not breaking news, but it breaks futures all the same.
This is slow violence. Coined by scholar Rob Nixon, slow violence describes harm that accumulates quietly, invisibly, across years and lives. It doesn’t explode in a single moment; it seeps. Into school funding formulas. Into policy. Into the very scaffolding of what’s possible. 
Budgets may not detonate, but they can destroy lives. What we fund is what we value. What we refuse to fund is often where the quiet brutality begins. Because budgets aren’t just bureaucratic documents. They’re moral ones.
The bipartisan Ohio Fair School Funding Plan (FSFP) calculates the actual cost of educating a child and funds public schools accordingly. It accounts for factors like student-teacher ratios, minimum staffing levels, local demographics and special education needs. 
It’s not perfect, but it ensures that education, opportunity, and well-being aren’t dictated by skin color, home zip code or socioeconomic status.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s proposed budget kept the FSFP in name but gutted it in function, using outdated cost data that would’ve underfunded schools below even 1997 levels. The Ohio House scrapped it altogether, replacing it with an opaque formula stripped of equity. Ohio Senate leaders insisted they’d fully funded it. They hadn’t.
Before signing a final version of the budget forged behind closed doors by the House-Senate Conference Committee and passed by both chambers on June 25, DeWine made dozens of line-item vetoes. While the governor’s veto pen blunted some of the budget’s abuse, the shape and trajectory of its weaponization remain unbroken. 
Like Ohio Senate President Rob McColley and state Sen. Jerry Cirino’s Senate scheme, the signed legislation anchors the Fair School Funding Plan to obsolete cost data, starving public schools of about $2.8 billion. 
Ohio Republicans were especially ruthless to districts with high levels of student poverty. The state will pay those districts 107% less than promised. Even low-poverty districts will only collect 34% of what they’re owed — a 65% shortfall.
The cruelty of Ohio’s new biennial budget isn’t just in what it withholds — it’s in how it blocks communities from filling the gap. 
First, the state guts its obligation. Then it turns around and rigs the rules: restricting when districts can ask voters for support, capping what they’re allowed to save, even empowering counties to spike local bonds and levies. DeWine vetoed those provisions—for now. But Republicans hold the three-fifths majority to override him. The knife has been sheathed, not discarded.
Meanwhile, Republican giveaway season to the wealthy and well-connected rolls on. The governor left intact $1.1 billion in tax breaks for Ohio’s top earners and $600 million in free money for the out-of-state billionaire Browns owners to pay for their new megaplex playground. The math is clear — and cruel.
Though DeWine vetoed a new school voucher program, the budget adds more than $400 million in public money for private school tuition. All told, taxpayers will underwrite more than $2.4 billion for a privileged 10%, mostly upper-middle-class families already nestled in sectarian enclaves. 
These are structural acts of violence — deliberate disinvestment from the conditions that make learning, thriving, and democracy possible.
We know what happens when schools are starved: class sizes balloon, teachers flee, buildings crumble. Graduation rates fall. Crime ticks up. Wages fall. Hope recedes. The research is clear: when we cut education, we sever the future.

Public education is not a budget line item; it’s the backbone of democracy. Disinvestment shifts costs into the future, where they accumulate as inequality, incarceration, ill health, and civic decline.
No sirens. No endless news cycles. Just lines of a ledger that quietly strangle the systems our kids depend on. The damage is cumulative and eventually catastrophic.
To end slow violence, we need a politics of flourishing.
Flourishing means every Ohio student has what they need to learn and grow, regardless of race, place, or means. It provides the qualified teachers, safe buildings, engaging curricula, and mental health support they deserve.
A politics of flourishing lifts whole communities. Higher wages, lower crime, better health, deeper civic life — these are the dividends of investing in public education. It’s a politics that rejects the lie that public education and children are negotiable line items.
DeWine’s signature committed Ohio to violence by increment — consolidating cruelty day by day, month over month, year after year. The state’s Republicans didn’t just pass a budget — they legislated a slow violence.
Yet history gives homework: grassroots groundswell and relentless advocacy precipitated the DeRolph rulings that found Ohio’s public school funding system unconstitutional and led to Fair School Funding in the first place. 
As Nobel laureate Amartya Sen writes, freedom is not the absence of restraint — it’s the presence of capability. The harmful Republican budget makes people less capable. Yet, we have the power to heal.
Slow violence thrives in silence. It feeds on apathy, distraction, and the space between outrage and action. 
The assignment is to practice democracy — showing up, organizing, speaking out, voting, resisting.
The real test of democracy isn’t belief. It’s practice.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.

Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

She told a legislative panel Tuesday that the state's unemployment insurance trust fund is at risk of falling below federal solvency guidelines and that the situation could get worse by an economic downturn or rise in the jobless rate. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s unemployment insurance trust fund faces potential solvency issues that could worsen in the wake of massive federal employee layoffs or a recession, lawmakers were told Tuesday.
Labor Secretary Portia Wu told members of the Joint Committee on Unemployment Oversight that the state’s insurance trust fund of $2 billion currently meets federal solvency requirements. But she said that picture could change dramatically with new analysis reflecting economic downturns and unemployment levels that more closely reflect rates during those times.
“Claims levels are at historic lows right now because of the incredibly low unemployment rate,” Wu told the panel. “But again, as I was saying, we don’t anticipate that will continue.”
Wu’s comments included concerns about the potential for a massive displacement of federal workers under President Donald Trump (R). Some early state projections anticipate as many as 29,000 workers could lose their jobs as Trump culls federal agencies and employees.
The briefing came just hours before the U.S. Supreme Court lifted a lower court injunction that had been blocking Trump administration plans to slash federal payrolls.
Tuesday’s briefing was the first in what is expected to be a series of committee meetings leading to the 2026 legislative session.
Sen. Ben Kramer and Del. Lorig Charkoudian, Montgomery County Democrats who co-chair the panel, have sponsored identical bills to modernize the fund. This was the third year such legislation has been proposed. The meetings during the interim are a prelude to a fourth effort next year that could result in updated benefits and potentially changes — even increases — in assessments on employers.
Supreme Court opens door to large-scale federal layoffs

“I think the whole purpose of our getting together and starting to meet now and have this conversation is so that we have a better handle on what’s happening,” Kramer said. “I mean, some of the slides are a little bit scary, and they’re getting my attention.”
Charkoudian worried that abrupt changes in the surcharges on employers that could hit at the same time as an economic downturn that displaces workers.
“So, we talk about how do we fix the roof when the sun’s shining?” Charkoudian asked.
Even if anticipated economic downturns do not occur, Wu said the growing number of workers who are becoming eligible for the maximum weekly benefit is stressing the system to the point where the fund could fall below federal guidelines sometime between 2026 and 2027.
Currently, employers in Maryland pay taxes into the account — $26 per employee with a taxable wage base of $8,500. The rate has remained unchanged since 1992. Unemployed workers can receive a maximum weekly benefit of $430, an amount that has not changed since 2010.
Over time, market changes, inflation and a rising minimum wage have increased wages to the point where workers whose jobs might have earned benefits on the low end of the fund’s scale are moving closer to the maximum benefit.
“What’s happening is everyone is moving towards the ceiling of benefits, but that same thing isn’t necessarily happening to revenue,” Wu said. “So that’s where you start seeing a gap and eventually solvency problems.”
Inflation has also outpaced benefits: A dollar of benefits in 2010 went 24% farther than in 2025, Wu said, while average rents have grown by 30% over roughly the same period.
Mike O’Halloran, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, said other factors also play a role, and an increase in what businesses pay into the fund would be yet another state-imposed burden.
“Certainly, as legislators, you all are very well aware that some of the costs that businesses have taken,” he said. “Since 2015 … paid sick and safe leave, paid family and medical leave insurance, which has yet to come on board. So, I think when you’re talking about purchasing power, it’s also important to include some of those dynamics that employers are facing since they’re the ones that are funding the trust fund.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Charkoudian said during the briefing that new rates of $35-$50 per employee might have to be considered. Analysis from Wu’s department — the agency took no public position on any changes — included scenarios that raised the wage base to $15,000 in addition to changes in surcharges.
“I think we all appreciate and value our business and businesses in the state and ensuring their viability,” Kramer said. “But we’re also weighing it against what we’re looking at that’s being forecast, the solvency of the fund.
“I think engaging in this scenario with this body, we’re beginning the conversation,” he said. “So when we do get into session, we have a better handle of where we might want to go and how we do want to address it, keeping in mind all the checks and balances that are important to all of us.”
The unemployment rate in Maryland stood at 3.2% in May. That is higher than the 1.9% in June 2023 but still below the state’s 30-year average of about 5%.
Wu said the unemployment rate is key.
One analysis by the department projects the fund will fall below federal solvency guidelines by 2027 if the state moves back to its average unemployment rate and no changes are made to benefits or taxes levied on employers that feed the fund, Wu said.
An economic downturn, massive number of displaced workers, or a Great Recession scenario would hasten the pace at which the system becomes insolvent.
“We’ve been fortunate that it’s [unemployment] been so low, but I don’t think we can realistically count on it staying below 4% the way it has been, and even if it were to increase to the historical averages, that can create pressure on a fund,” she said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0391-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

“He is a unifier. He is someone who understands the importance of working equally with the executive branch as with the legislative branch,” said County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D), who tapped Barnes for the position. “He is someone who I believe will play a major role, an important role, in ensuring that the future of this county is as bright as the people in this room.”
A standing-room-only crowd filled the council chambers with supporters, including current and former state and county legislators and business and community leaders. Former Seat Pleasant Mayor Eugene Grant gave rousing remarks in support of Barnes.
“In this land, Prince George’s County, there’s been a lot of strange songs [that have] been sung for the past several years, but now the lyrics are changing,” Grant said. “Now the tune is changing. Now the beat is changing, and that change is coming through brother Darryl Barnes.”
Barnes was a Democratic state delegate from 2015 to 2023 representing the the 25th District. As chair, he will lead a five-member board that administers subdivision regulations in the county, approves various site plans and advises the county council on any proposed changes to zoning, among the body’s various duties.
The board, with the Montgomery County Planning Board, form the bi-county Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, which acquires, develops, maintains and administers a regional system of parks.

	Each member serves a four-year term. Barnes’ term will run until June 2029. He replaces former chair Peter Shapiro, who was appointed in April 2022. Shapiro’s last day was June 14, said County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III.
For now, the board has only four members, after the February resignation of William Doerner. Braveboy has yet to name a replacement for Doerner, who would serve until June 2026.
Barnes, who runs his own government relations firm, Barnes International, thanked the dozens of people in attendance with a goal to create an atmosphere for the county to “win, win, win.”
“This is a great day that we have now to forge new relationships and talk about things in which we want to transform this county to be,” said Barnes, who served as chair for the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland. “Park and planning will not be just for parks and recs in the county, but a destination for the world.”
Kimmel moves into top job at Maryland Food Bank
After working with. the Maryland Food Bank for more than a decade, Meg Kimmel was appointed to lead the statewide food distribution network on Monday.
“I am honored to lead the Maryland Food Bank at this important moment,” Kimmel said in a written statement. “I’m excited to continue the work to feed our neighbors and build stronger communities alongside our incredible teams, our network of food distribution partners, and our many donors, volunteers, and supporters.”
The food bank’s board of directors said Monday that they had selected Kimmel as the next president and CEO of the nonprofit organization. She will be taking over for former President and CEO Carmen Del Guercio, who is stepping down after holding those titles since 2016.
The Maryland Food Bank serves as a meal assistance hub for a majority of the state, connecting with local food banks and pantries to expand outreach for families needing extra help putting food on the table.
Kimmel has been with the Maryland Food Bank since 2012, serving in a variety of roles from the chief strategy officer to vice president of marketing and communications. She leaves her current position as the food bank’s chief operating officer to fill her new roles.
“By working together, we can both feed people who need a meal today and address the barriers that create hunger and hold it in place,” Kimmel said in the written statement.
Davis takes over as chair of Maryland Saves
Maryland State Treasurer Dereck Davis, a member of the MarylandSaves executive committee, was tapped Monday to be chair of the Maryland Small Business Retirement Savings Board, which oversees the management and operation of MarylandSaves workplace saving program.

In a statement from the board, Davis called MarylandSaves “a vital program that empowers Maryland workers to invest in their future financial security.”
“It’s a valued benefit that small and medium-sized business can offer their employees – at no cost to the employer,” his statement said. “I’m proud to support this important retirement savings solution for Maryland’s workforce.”
Gotbaum said MarylandSaves’ “program of emergency and retirement savings through payroll deductions is already helping thousands of Maryland businesses and tens of thousands of Marylanders. I look forward to Treasurer Davis’s leadership as MarylandSaves continues to innovate for Marylanders and other programs throughout our nation.”
MarylandSaves was created under the Maryland law that required most businesses in the state to offer their workers a  retirement savings program. Launched in 2022, the program now offers “thousands of Maryland employers an easy way to comply with the law,” said Executive Director Glenn Simmons.
“MarylandSaves is easy for employers to manage and offers an emergency savings feature that lets savers access their contributions to cover unexpected expenses,” Simmons said. “Employees are enrolled automatically, have full control over their accounts, can choose investment options, change their savings rate, or pause and reactivate their automatic savings later.”
Participation in the plan is voluntary, but business that join — or that offer their own retirement plan to their workers — are eligible for a waiver of the annual $300 filing fee with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Aisha-Braveboy-and-Darryl-Barnes-7-8-2025-1024x693.jpg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Attorneys for President Donald Trump told a federal district judge Monday that a request to turn an immigrants’ lawsuit into a class-action suit is little more than attempted “end run around” the Supreme Court and should be rejected.
The original lawsuit was filed by the immigrant advocacy group CASA and several pregnant immigrant women in an attempt to block Trump’s executive order denying citizenship to anyone born in the U.S. unless at least one of the parents was already a citizen.
The “birthright citizenship” ban was swiftly challenged in courts around the country and several judges, including Judge Deborah Boardman in the U.S. District Court for Maryland, issued preliminary injjunctions that kept the order from taking effect nationwide.
The government challenged the ability of the district judges to issue nationwide orders, and last month the Supreme Court agreed with the government, overturning the nationwide injunctions and sending the cases back to the lower courts for trial. Even though the injunctions were no longer in place, the government said it would not attempt to enforce the birthright citizenship ban for at least 30 days.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Within hours of the high court’s ruling, attorneys for CASA were back in court with additional immigrant plaintiffs, asking Boardman to turn the case into a nationwide class-action lawsuit on behalf of all immigrant children born in the U.S. after Feb. 19, the original effective date of Trump’s order, and their parents. Boardman last week gave Justice Department attorneys until July 7 to respond to the class-action motion.
“The relief Plaintiffs seek is functionally no different from their prior (and now forbidden) universal injunction,” Monday’s response from the government says.
Class action lawsuits are allowed for cases in which a class is so large that it would be impractical to account for all members, there are questions of law common to the people in the class, and the representative class members named in the suit will fairly protect the interests of the class.
Trump’s attorneys argue that these criteria aren’t met.
“Plaintiffs’ differing immigration statuses create issues of whether ‘there are questions of law or fact common to the class,’ and whether ‘the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class,’” the filing reads. 
Attorneys also argued that the court cannot issue a preliminary injunction because the previous preliminary injunction is still on appeal. They argued that plaintiffs are not entitled to a nationwide preliminary injunction, and that the court should stay the injunction pending its appeal.
The earliest date the administration would apply the order is July 27.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/U.S.-District-Courthouse-Greenbelt-9-30-2024-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-09 05:07:34.367986

May 21, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)In a Nebraska legislative session better known for its sound and fury than for a lot of substantive accomplishments, at least one bill stands as an exception.
At the eleventh hour, the Legislature voted to create a School Financing Review Commission, a bill sponsored by Sen. Jana Hughes and supported by 48 of the 49 state senators – with one senator excused and not voting.
A commission may not seem like a big deal, but it can and should have wide-ranging impact.
For several decades, our governors have declared and our legislators have generally echoed the notion that property taxes in Nebraska are too high, out of balance with the state’s overall tax level. Gov. Jim Pillen has recently said — yet again — that lower property taxes are his biggest priority.
As a result, the Legislature has been poking around at the margins, trying to effect change without ever getting at the biggest underlying problem: In our state, property taxes are the primary funding mechanism for our schools.
School districts generally receive more than half of their funding from local property taxes, and about half of the taxes an individual Nebraskans pays are from taxes on property.
Maybe there’s another way. But efforts to rebalance our three-legged taxation stool among income, sales and property taxes are not getting very far unless we take a long look at school funding.
Is our system the most efficient and effective way to support our fundamental responsibility to educate all Nebraskans? Is it the fairest way – both to taxpayers and to our children?
The last commission to review school finance met in 1988-89, and their work resulted in a school finance formula that started out well but was raided and distorted periodically since. Not to mention that circumstances change over 35 years.
This new effort to study and understand these fundamental questions in the light of today’s realities should move us toward outcomes that will be better understood, farther reaching and more substantive than what legislators have dinked around with in recent years.
Please say thank you to senators for supporting this. Then keep an eye on how the commission develops and what it ultimately recommends. This study should not be allowed to wither on the vine or get buried in a political graveyard.
This may not be flashy legislation, but following it through to a successful and substantive end could be one of the best things our government has done for us lately.

Ned Lamont has vetoed a good, if not perfect, housing bill, where do we stand?
Obviously, it’s roll-up-the-sleeves time. He and legislative leaders will take the summer to reconstruct what the governor foolishly rejected.
But before we get to the many issues the legislature needs to address in a September special session, we need to remind the governor and the bill’s cynical opponents of what’s most at stake: the freedom, opportunity and dreams of generations of our neighbors.
The governor — along with those screaming meemies at CT169Strong and many Republican lawmakers who say they want to solve the housing crisis but really couldn’t care less — doesn’t seem to understand that.
Governor Lamont always talks about jobs. And to that extent, he’s right. We need people able to afford to live in Connecticut  to fill vacancies and produce income and state revenues.
But you wonder whether he misses the point: that even more important than a job is the ability of families to move to and live in communities that provide them with other vital necessities: high-quality education, healthcare and other building blocks of opportunity.
Hundreds of thousands of state residents spend so much on rent and mortgage payments – way more than 30% — that they have little left for nutritious meals, transportation and warm clothing.
Meanwhile, Baby Boomers have no housing options to downsize into, so they stay in homes they can no longer afford or care for, leaving too little supply on the market to meet the demand. Home prices soar as a result – 60% or so since 2019 – driving many young families into the rental market, where that additional demand has propelled rents up 30% or so in that same period. That drives those at the bottom of the rental income spectrum, unable to pay the burgeoning rents, into homelessness, which was up 13% last year.
Governor, want to solve low test scores, absenteeism, and sagging high school graduation rates, all of which contribute to poverty, poor nutrition, swelling welfare rolls and un- or underemployment?
Don’t confine low- and moderate-income people to the meager 29 municipalities with a reasonable share of affordable housing. Those cities and first-ring suburbs have larger class sizes, underpaid teachers and fewer honors/AP classes and enrichments like art and music. Get the other munis to create some housing, (strategies below) so families who choose to can move to towns with higher-resource schools and abundant services.
Which brings us to resuscitating the vetoed bill.
The governor started off fine last week, insisting the bill’s opponents were spreading misinformation and that the target numbers of affordable units it included for each town were just that: goals, not mandates. He was right.
But apparently scared the screaming meemies would continue to screech their lies from now ‘til next Election Day, he vetoed the bill anyway. He could have shown courage and leadership, teaching the exclusionary obstructionists a lesson in decency. Instead, he admitted he hadn’t paid enough attention to the bill during the five-month legislative session.
That’s malpractice. For the truth is, the housing crisis in this state didn’t just materialize – it’s been getting worse for decades – yet he has shown little leadership on the housing issue for the entire six and a half years of his term in office. Yes, he’s thrown money at the problem. But there’s so much more he hasn’t focused on.
So here, governor, as I retire from housing policy work after more than two decades, are a few things I’ve learned that you might consider as you work to rewrite this bill:
Needed: real zoning incentives, real help for towns. 
The incentives offered in the bill – giving towns that create higher density zones near transit and other key locations a higher priority for state infrastructure grants – are well-meant. And despite the crocodile tears shed by the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns, they’re fair. Towns that allow the creation of homes the state sorely needs deserve money for roads, sewers and sidewalks. Towns that don’t don’t. 
But there’s a real question whether those incentives will actually incentivize. Here’s an idea: cash. Towns need operating revenue and the state can afford it, despite what’s coming down from Washington. Cash for what? Pay them a set amount for every multifamily unit they zone for. Pay for two more planners per town (many dislike regional or state planning help) so they can actually focus on their towns’ housing needs; more zoning enforcement officers who can seriously go after blight and code violations; and even stipends for zoning commissioners – to increase the pool willing to serve — who now heroically work late into the night for nothing but a possible thank you, and more likely abuse and criticism from town residents.
Erasing impediments. 
Towns stop housing by raising development costs in many ways. They charge too much for sewer hookups, stretch out approval periods interminably to increase lawyer fees, and on and on. The bill’s provision to end minimum parking requirements is a start and the CCM/COST whining about loss of local control is silly. 
Developers aren’t stupid. They’ll create enough parking without being required to, otherwise they won’t be able to rent their units. So what about penalizing towns that erect barriers to housing? Check with the best land-use lawyer in the state, Tim Hollister. He’ll give you plenty of ideas.
Getting real about towns. 
You, governor, opined that “the great majority” of towns want to create housing. Take it from me, they don’t – even though it’s in their interest to do so (more revenue from the grand list, downsized housing choices for their elderly residents ie. voters), homes for workers, customers and adult kids who want to come home after graduation.
Housing creation’s too risky for reelection-obsessed first selectmen wanting to get reelected. And even if towns do want to create more housing, most have no real experience creating it proactively. They need to learn how to attract and work with good developers, how to use new wastewater technology where there are no sewers, how to think instinctively about converting old strip malls, vacant offices, schools and other buildings into housing.
The bond money you’ve given them is great but, alone, it’s like clapping with one hand.
Helping calm resident fears. 
I learned years ago not to condemn residents for expressing “NIMBY” sentiments. The checks they sign to buy their homes are the largest most ever write and everything -– their kids’ education, their security, their retirement –- is tied up in their homes. So while they have nothing to fear -– research and mounds of experience show mixed-income and affordable homes don’t increase crime and school budgets nor lower neighboring property values -– they need to be heard, allowed to express their concerns and get their questions answered. ‘
So why not widely finance what my colleagues and I have started: community conversations, led by trained facilitators, to expand resident engagement and understanding. It works. We’ve been making progress with town residents and, I might add, towns’ economic development commissions, who have a particular interest in maintaining and attracting businesses, labor pool and jobs to town. Those conversations can also be sparked by videos we’ve made showing that good people live in affordable housing and the homes are beautiful. Towns are using them to deflate the myths.
Create a land-use planning program at UConn. 
Other states benefit from their programs, but Connecticut towns have a hard time finding competent planners because the pool is tiny. Getting kids interested in local government in high school and undergraduate school will inculcate them with a simple notion: that local and state policy can be shaped by them to meet vital needs like housing.
Try living just a week on the housing wage. 
You’re fortunate to have wealth and you’ve been good about not taking a salary as governor. But it might be eye-opening if you understood what you can, and can’t, manage on the state’s housing wage – about $35/hour, or what’s needed to afford a typical two-bedroom apartment in Connecticut, as calculated by the National Low Income Housing Coalition. About half the state’s workers don’t earn that much. Several years ago, New York City mayoral candidates lived in public housing for a few days. It was a stunt, but nevertheless instructive, even revelatory.
Food, but no kitchen, cooks or table
Here’s the bottom line. You can’t just throw money at housing. That’d be like saying we’ll provide meals by spending only on ingredients. You need cooking utensils and a stove (infrastructure), plates and glasses (tools), a cook (planners and developers) and a table (zoning) to serve it on.
So, please, put together a good bill that gets at the key issues, one that’ll pass and that, most important, keeps in mind our current and future neighbors who are suffering because they can’t find homes or are paying much too much for them. And then get out and support it. Loudly. And forcefully.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota can’t build the prison it needs at the price it wants without sacrificing quality and longevity.
That was the message delivered Tuesday to the Project Prison Reset task force by the state’s construction manager, the state engineer and the consultant hired earlier this year to evaluate the options for addressing prison overcrowding.
The message didn’t take.
Citing the political realities of a skeptical Legislature, the task force voted unanimously to recommend that lawmakers support a men’s prison at a price point of $650 million during a special session whose date has yet to be set. 
Prison task force rejects original Lincoln County site, tightens budget for new facility

That’s $50 million higher than the limit the group set last month. It’s also $75 million less than the experts said the group’s preferred project would cost hours before the vote.
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen, who leads the task force, said the figure is a compromise that moves the state toward a replacement for the 144-year-old penitentiary in Sioux Falls. 
“There is no appetite, none, for going above $650 million,” Venhuizen said.
House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said securing a two-thirds majority in both chambers — required for spending bills — will mean convincing lawmakers that the job can be done without cost overruns and supplemental budget requests. 
“We’re going to need to know that we can actually do it for $650 million,” Hansen said. 
Sioux Falls selected
The group also endorsed two vacant plots of industrial land in northeastern Sioux Falls just off Interstate 229, near Gage Brothers, a precast concrete company. The choice of which was left to legislators.
The task force voted to shoot down options in Mitchell or Worthing early on during its final meeting Tuesday, which took place at the Military Heritage Alliance in Sioux Falls. Other site options were ruled out during earlier meetings, and some communities, including Box Elder, removed themselves from consideration after submitting proposals. 
Unlike the residents of Mitchell and Worthing, Joe Bunker of Gage Brothers told the group his company had no qualms with having a prison as a neighbor.
“I just want you to know that we’re not opposed to it,” Bunkers said.
The buildings on the recommended prison campus should be designed to last 100 years, the task force decided, with 1,200 beds for higher security inmates and another 300 for lower-security inmates. 
That configuration was one of 14 options presented Tuesday morning from Arrington Watkins, the consulting firm hired to assess the prison system’s space needs. 
The price estimate for the northeastern Sioux Falls prison complex is $725 million. That’s $100 million less than a 1,500-bed men’s prison proposed for Lincoln County, whose failure to earn the support of the Legislature back in February spurred the creation of the task force.


 The two sites in northeast Sioux Falls selected as potential prison locations.
Multiple sites shot down
Mike Quinn of Arrington Watkins ran the task force through the options Tuesday morning. None came in below $600 million, the price cap the task force adopted previously.
In addition to brushing off Mitchell and Worthing as site options, the group’s final recommendations eliminated options that would have placed buildings in multiple locations. Those included a small prison just north of the penitentiary across a Big Sioux River diversion channel and an additional dormitory-style building in Springfield, current site of Mike Durfee State Prison.
Those options were an outgrowth of questions from task force members about the need for a single high-security facility.
Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead, a task force member, asked Quinn if any of the multi-building setups would be “the best option for the taxpayer.” 
The answer was no. Each prison site, regardless of size, Quinn said, would need to have recreation areas, kitchens and mess halls and other support areas.
“When you build three facilities, you’re building those buildings three times,” Quinn said, adding “it’s never more economical to split it up into smaller units.” 
Lieutenant governor suggests cheaper facility in Nebraska is ‘sub-par’
Hansen was one of several task force members to ask about a 1,512-bed Nebraska prison priced at $313 million for inmates at a variety of security levels.
South Dakota State Engineer Stacy Watters said the state of Nebraska has refused to release specifications for that facility, and denied a records request from South Dakota for more details, citing nondisclosure agreements with its contractors. 
What the state did learn, Watters said, was that the $313 million price only includes construction, not site preparation or design, and that it doesn’t include the intake area or medical facilities that South Dakota’s proposal does. Nebraska has already spent $130 million on buildings with those services over the past seven years, she said, and plans to use cheaper piping for its plumbing in the new prison project.
The design and materials being used in Nebraska are unclear, but “we had to assume that at that price, there was a reduced level of construction,” said Vance McMillan of JE Dunn, the state’s construction manager at-risk. 
Hansen questioned why Nebraska would hold back on sharing its design features for a public project. Venhuizen suggested that Nebraska is building a “sub-par” facility, and “that’s not something they’re really looking to admit.”
Other sites create doubt
McMillan told the group it had done all the due diligence necessary to keep its estimates low, bidding out every piece of the project. A cheaper price would mean building a prison that would need replacing sooner.
Comparisons to Nebraska or other states weren’t “apples to apples,” he said.
Report: Tough-on-crime policies could push prison construction costs as high as $2.1 billion

But House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, said lower reported price points in other states have created enough doubt to put a new South Dakota prison in political jeopardy at the prices offered Tuesday.
“I’m sitting here as majority leader trying to figure out how I can sell this to a two-thirds majority of the Legislature not knowing all the answers,” Odenbach said.
The state has $566 million set aside in an incarceration construction fund, a balance built by infusions of COVID-19 relief money and earning interest. About $50 million of that is earmarked for a women’s prison in Rapid City, which is currently under construction. 
The fund will grow by $23 million of interest in August, Corrections Department spokesman Michael Winder said Tuesday.
That the state has the money set aside makes the project more palatable, but Rep. Greg Jamison, R-Sioux Falls, said worries about ongoing operational costs and concerns that the state might not be getting the best deal have left some lawmakers unwilling to trust the experts.
“Other states are doing it for less. There’s a shadow of doubt, and we need to rebuild that trust,” Jamison said, to get legislative approval. 
Jamison suggested that the group vote for 1,500 beds, cap the price at $600 million, and  recommend looking for a new construction manager at-risk, as JE Dunn and Henry Carlson’s single proposal was the only one the state fielded back in 2023.
McMillan, as well as some task force members, bristled at the idea of dispensing with JE Dunn and starting from scratch. McMillan told the task force that every month wasted carries the potential for greater costs.
He urged them to make a decision, and insisted that the team that’s worked on prisons for the state for the past two years could meet whatever design specifications that lawmakers want.
“We would be happy to build you a steel structure that would last you 50 years. That’s a decision that you guys have to make,” McMillan said.
McMillan said it would be “a tall order” to build a 100-year facility for $650 million. 
Decision: 100-year prison for $650 million
Judge Jane Wipf Pfeifle, a task force member, said switching gears on a construction manager would ultimately cost taxpayers. She also questioned the wisdom of setting an “arbitrary” cap on costs that could hamstring a new prison’s ability to meet the state’s needs.
Two consultants’ reports since 2022 have pointed to inmate population growth that will outpace the state’s ability to house prisoners without major policy shifts or new construction. The experts, she said, have shown their work to explain their prices and how their designs can address the problem.

“They’re not saying ‘Gosh, I read in the newspaper that it’s cheaper in Arkansas or Nebraska,’” Wipf Pfeifle said.
Sen. Jamie Smith, D-Sioux Falls, was among the task force members to worry aloud about what the state would lose — including space for things like rehabilitation programming — by placing a cap of $650 million on the project.
Smith said he had little choice but to support the lower-cost compromise figure, but that “there are going to be corners that will have to be cut in order to get to that number, based on everything that you’ve seen today.”
Sen. Jim Mehlhaff, R-Pierre, expressed similar concerns. Based on a question from Mehlhaff, Corrections Secretary Kellie Wasko told the group that after closing up the penitentiary, she could likely fill 1,500 beds with the state’s current prison population.
“We might build a facility that is overcrowded the day we move in,” Mehlhaff said, adding that spending $600 million of saved-up money without solving the problem would be “a poor stewardship of taxpayer money.”
Even so, Mehlhaff said, he recognizes that his fellow lawmakers need to be willing to move forward. Mehlhaff moved that the task force recommend the Legislature to direct the Department of Corrections to “come up with a plan” to build 1,500 beds “in the most efficient way possible,” with 300 beds for lower-security inmates.
Attorney General and task force member Marty Jackley suggested a $650 million price cap as an amendment. 
Prison work group peppered with public testimony in first Sioux Falls meeting

That addition was “not necessarily friendly,” the Mehlhaff said, “but if we could move the ball forward, I could accept that.”
Before the final vote, both Venhuizen and Hansen, a 2026 gubernatorial candidate, lauded the result as a win. Venhuizen said the task force had produced a workable compromise. Hansen said the group was able to find a location that, unlike the original Lincoln County proposal, is palatable to neighbors.
When asked if the lower price might force the Legislature to build a facility meant to last less than 100 years, Venhuizen said “I would rather build it smaller” than cheaper.
Compromises will need to be made, he said, but those decisions will need to come from the Legislature.
Hansen said he also wants to see a durable facility. He couldn’t speculate on what kinds of compromises might be necessary, but said there’s no question that a higher price tag is off the table.

Bernat Bacete/Getty Images)After a Fox News interview raised the possibility of Alaska building a “Bear Alcatraz” Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility, the office of Gov. Mike Dunleavy said on Tuesday that the state has no such plans. 
The Dunleavy administration statement was prompted by an inaccurate story by Newsweek that summarized the interview, asserting that the state had suggested the idea.
“The story is false,” said Jeff Turner, Dunleavy’s director of communications by email. He said that he had demanded a correction from the Newsweek reporter. 
The Newsweek story referred to a July 1 interview on Fox News by host Laura Ingraham of Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff for pPolicy and homeland security adviser. Miller is known as the architect of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, and a vocal proponent of ramping up ICE arrests, detention and mass deportations.   
In the interview, Ingraham and Miller praised Florida for building a new ICE detention facility in the Everglades, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” for its isolation and being surrounded by wildlife in the Big Cypress Natural Preserve in Ochopee, Florida. It was constructed in just eight days, and can hold up to 3,000 detainees before deportation, and opened last week. 
Miller said he had pitched all Republican governors to build similar ICE detention facilities. “We want every governor of a red state, and if you’re watching tonight, pick up the phone call, DHS, work with us to build facilities in your state,” Miller said.
Ingraham said Fox reached out to states, including Alaska, for comment. “Alaska told us that ‘we don’t have alligators, but we have lots of bears.’ However, they aren’t aware of any plans for an Alaska version,” she said. 
“Of, I said, ‘Bear Alcatraz,’” Ingraham added, chuckling.  
When asked to comment on Alaska’s response to Fox News, Turner repeated there were no state plans to build such a facility. 
“I am not aware of any response from the state to Mr. Miller for a facility like the one in Florida,” Turner said. “The governor’s office was asked by Fox News if there were any such plans and the answer was no.”
Last week, President Donald Trump signed his signature domestic policy bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” which allocates a historic increase of $165 billion to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which administers ICE, through 2029. ICE’s budget is currently $10 billion.
The Department of Homeland Security said $165 billion includes $45 billion for new ICE detention facilities, $46 billion for border wall construction along the U.S.-Mexico border, $14 billion for deportation operations, and billions for hiring 6,000 new Customs and Border Patrol agents, and 10,000 new ICE agents.

My challenge for RFK and the vaccine panel is this: Listen to the science, consult doctors with different views and opinions, and treat the population as if they were your own family. 
The post Americans deserve better than RFK Jr. and his panel of vaccine skeptics appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","SINCE TAKING OFFICE as health and human services secretary under President Trump, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has launched an agenda aimed at dismantling the public health system as we know it.
Kennedy has let misinformation about vaccines run rampant and reversed Covid-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant women, while lifting conspiracy theorists into positions of power over vaccine policy. Those moves have sparked outrage in the scientific community and prompted national health groups to sue Kennedy this week over his assault on science and health. 
Kennedy has made massive cuts to the National Institutes of Health and vital research institutions, and Trump’s “big beautiful” tax and spending cut bill,  which Republicans passed and he signed last Friday, will result in massive cuts to Medicaid and wreak havoc on hospitals across the country.
One of Kennedy’s latest attacks has been on the CDC’s panel of vaccine experts by gutting the 17 original members and replacing them with eight vaccine skeptics. Even Republican senator Bill Cassidy called Kennedy’s new panel unqualified.
The panel of conspiracists recently discussed the long-standing practices for childhood immunization schedules. Already, we’re seeing global vaccine efforts stall, leaving millions, particularly children, at risk for preventable diseases. 
As a surgeon, I fear for the well-being of my patients. As a mom, I fear for the well-being of my children. As an American, I fear for our country. And as a global citizen, I fear for our world. 
Recently, RFK Jr. pulled funding from the global vaccine group, Gavi. As an organization, Gavi has paid for more than one billion children to be vaccinated through routine immunization programs, saving an estimated 18 million lives. His reasoning for pulling the funding: ignoring the science. The hypocrisy is extraordinary. 
Part of me cannot blame Kennedy for his decisions, as they are based on sheer ignorance. Kennedy has neither a medical education nor medical training. 
Kennedy may not have studied the Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918-1920 that killed 50-100 million people. A vaccine was developed years later, saving countless lives. He may not have studied smallpox either, which killed hundreds of millions of people until its eradication as a result of vaccinations in 1980. Kennedy may not truly know how live-saving vaccines are. 
He makes decisions based not on scientific facts but on misinformation, unproven studies, and health care influencers. How often do we hear the phrase, “Don’t believe everything you read on the internet”? Still, vaccine deniers read from the internet rather than from research papers. It’s time for Kennedy to go away from TikTok and pick up a textbook. 
Even Kennedy himself has acknowledged the dangers of his rhetoric, publicly admitting that Americans shouldn’t follow his medical advice—an astonishing admission from the leader responsible for national health. Earlier in the year when asked hypothetically if he would vaccinate his kids for measles, Kennedy responded with “probably.” 
Kennedy’s campaigns actively jeopardize the health of his own supporters, especially those in predominantly conservative states. This misplaced skepticism has already sparked avoidable outbreaks, including measles, underscoring a hazardous hypocrisy at the core of current health and human services leadership. 
America deserves a Department of Health and Human Services focused on confronting real, urgent health challenges through collaborative, evidence-based solutions.
My challenge for RFK and the vaccine panel is this: Listen to the science, consult doctors with different views and opinions, and treat the population as if they were your own family. The vaccine skepticism and rhetoric coming from this administration have already caused parents to have to bury their children. 
Instead of firing and completely shutting out the 17 independent experts that once served on the vaccine panel, RFK Jr. should welcome them back for their takes on science. The evolution of science relies on different expert opinions and analyses. 
There are doctors all around the globe who want to advance science and keep our children safe. The main mission of MAHA (Make America Healthy Again) is to protect our children. Doctors are eager to share their findings and practices with the the health and human services department, Kennedy, and his team of advisors.  
Before Kennedy and the vaccine panel go into work each day, I hope they think of what’s best for their children. Odds are, that’s what’s best for the millions of other children in the United States and across the globe. What can we do to improve the lives of our children? Changing regulated vaccine schedules for children is not the answer. 
As a physician and a mom, I use science to guide the decisions I make for my children. I hope Kennedy will start to do the same in setting policy for the entire country.

The Supreme Court said Tuesday those cuts could proceed, for now. (Photo by Kent Nishimura/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court late Tuesday lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked attempts by President Donald Trump and his DOGE Service to restructure the federal government.
Labor unions, advocates and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.

“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”










For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson



Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”

“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

The short route is currently served by diesel ferries like the Tokitae, seen here approaching Whidbey Island. (Photo by Tom Banse)Washington aspires for its largest-in-the-nation fleet of passenger ferries to operate reliably and emission-free by 2050.
To get there, the plan is to convert six existing vessels to hybrid-electric power, build 16 new plug-in boats, and add shore charging to 16 terminals — all by 2040.
But only one conversion is done. And neither new vessels nor electrified terminals are expected to be operational before the end of the decade. 
With projects taking longer and costing more than expected, achieving the ambitious mid-century goal for the ferry system looks increasingly unattainable.
“We can’t do everything we want to do. We can’t buy everything we want to buy, so let’s talk about the priorities,” said Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, chair of the state House Transportation Committee, ahead of a work session Tuesday on where things stand in the ferry agency’s pursuit of electrification.
Rep. Andrew Barkis, R-Olympia, the lead Republican on the committee, agreed after the meeting.
“We need to sit down and review this whole thing — how we’re doing this, why we’re doing this — for the next 20 years for Washington State Ferries,” he said.
Conversion of the Wenatchee, a Jumbo Mark II-class vessel with a 202-car capacity, is done and it returns to service Thursday, a year later than expected. Its $133 million cost is much more than originally budgeted. Planned conversions of two other boats are on hold indefinitely.
A week ago, Gov. Bob Ferguson announced he’d accepted Florida-based Eastern Shipbuilding Group’s bid to build three new hybrid electric ferries. The first one — at a total cost of about $405 million — is expected to be delivered in about five years. 
The large price tags and long timelines are stirring conversations among lawmakers and with the governor on how they can erase Washington State Ferries’ carbon wake, given limited resources and high demand for service.
“The path from here to there is going to be a little more unpredictable and bumpy, but we’re going to get there,” said Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee. “We’re headed in the right direction.”
Liias said he’s ready to focus on procuring new boats and using cleaner, renewable diesel to fuel existing ones, and pause converting existing boats to electric power for the time being.
A new boat will be in use for 60 years while a converted one gains an estimated 25 years of service, he said. Adding new vessels and switching the entire fleet to cleaner-burning diesel could get the state to 90% of its emission reduction goal by 2050, he postulated.
“We need to be more eyes wide open after what we’ve seen with the Wenatchee,” he said. ”We want to see cleaner air, but we can’t write a blank check.”
The cost-benefit of converting the jumbo ferry came up late in Tuesday’s work session
State ferry officials estimated $96 million of the $133 million total could be viewed as directly related to changing the vessel to a hybrid-electric. Though the amount would be less when factoring in savings from buying less diesel fuel when operating on battery power, they said.
Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Port Angeles, vice chair of the transportation committee, wanted to know what amount of greenhouse gas emission reduction would be achieved. State ferry officials didn’t have an immediate answer.
“From a cost perspective, is this an efficient or good use of the state’s money? To me, it seems pretty expensive,” he said. “I would hope that there would be quite significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if we’re going to continue down this path.”
Executive orders issued by former Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee in 2018 and 2020 are steering Washington State Ferries’ transition to an emission-free fleet. There’s also a separate state law requiring state agencies to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2040 and to be at net zero a decade later.
In 2020, the ferry agency published its System Electrification Plan. It carried an estimated cost of $4 billion, but that figure is “outdated,” David Sowers, who oversees the electrification program, told House members. “It doesn’t reflect the current bidding climate,” and other costs like tariffs, he said. So far, the agency has secured $1.68 billion.
After the meeting, Bernbaum said his questions regarding the conversion were to better understand “what we are actually paying for” in the push to carry out the electrification program.
If the goal is protecting the planet from the effects of climate change, and there is $80 million to spend, is it better spent on converting one ferry or on a utility-scale solar or wind farm?” he said.
“We should be aspiring to get to net zero. But we should be spending those dollars in a wise way and that means not being absolutist,” he said. “I think we’re in a nice reflection point when we’re starting to get the data back and it gives us an opportunity to reflect and think about if this is the best path forward.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/WSF-washington-state-ferries-ferry-boat-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 22:00:24.379150

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)North Providence Town Councilor Stefano Famiglietti swept the four-way Democratic primary for the open Senate District 4 seat Tuesday, with nearly 69% of votes as of 9:04 p.m.
Results are preliminary and unofficial, with mail ballots submitted Tuesday still being tabulated, Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Board of Elections, said via text Tuesday night. Roughly 10.5% of the district’s 22,000 registered voters cast ballots in the special primary.
Famiglietti, 33, a lawyer, rang in his victory with friends, family and supporters at the Knights of Columbus hall on Douglas Avenue in North Providence. In a phone interview, he chalked up his strong showing to his community ties, including as a Town Council member since 2018.
“I know this community,” Famiglietti said. “I was born here. I went to school here. I worked here. I walked every night sharing my ideas with the community, and the community responded.”
The special primary was triggered by the death of the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died in April after a battle with cancer. Ruggerio held the seat for 40 years prior to his death.
Famigietti noted his close ties to Ruggerio, pledging to “follow in his shoes,” if elected. First, he must beat Republican Alexander Asermely in an Aug. 5 general election. 
Senate President Valarie Lawson, who succeeded Ruggerio in chamber leadership elections, congratulated Famiglietti in a statement Tuesday night.
“As a councilman with deep roots in the community, Stefano has a keen understanding of the needs of District 4, and he will carry forward the sincere commitment to service that Senate President Dominick Ruggerio exemplified,” Lawson said.
Former state Rep. Marcia Ranglin Vassell, who finished a distant second with 15% of the vote, said she did not plan to call Famiglietti to concede or congratulate him.
“I don’t have his number,” Ranglin-Vassell said in a phone interview Tuesday night. She also said she had not looked at the results, though she planned to.
Ranglin-Vassell, 65, a Providence Public Schools teacher, is also planning to file a formal complaint with the state elections board against Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and Famiglietti supporter, over Corvese’s actions at Veazie Street Elementary School polling place in Providence earlier in the day.
Ranglin-Vassell alleges Corvese violated state election rules by entering the polling place wearing stickers for Famiglietti. 
Corvese declined to comment. Famiglietti, who was not there at the time, said Ranglin-Vassell’s accusation was “nonsense,” and “disappointing.”
Also yet to concede Tuesday night was third-place finisher Lenny Cioie, who drew 11.6% of votes. Cioe’s tone was dejected as he reflected on the outcome of the primary race.
“The machine won, as usual,” Cioe said of the results. “It is what it is. I’ve run against the machine before.”
Cioe, 66, a registered nurse and progressive, unsuccessfully challenged Ruggerio in the last three Democratic primaries for the seat spanning North Providence and north Providence.
Famiglietti, whose campaign was led by Ruggerio’s family members, disputed Cioe’s claim. 
“That’s been a fallacy this whole campaign, all this talk about the establishment and the machine,” Famiglietti said. “They missed the fact that I’ve been in this community since I was born.”The fourth candidate, Manny Taveras, finished with just under 5% of votes. Taveras, a first-time candidate and brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, praised his campaign team and supporters.
“I really wanted to win this election, but I am very proud of how hard my team fought, said Taveras, 40, an account executive for a pharmacy benefits management company. “There are so many doors opening for so much more in the future.”
Among those doors could be a bid for the now-open seat on the North Providence Town Council. Taveras acknowledged he might run, but did not confirm. Details of the election for the open town council seat have not been set.
The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026.

In a written order published Friday, the court reversed the conviction of Rigoberto Guillermo Walker and said that prosecutors may elect to retry him for attempted murder.
If the case is not retried, Walker will still be guilty of first-degree assault and may be sentenced for that crime.
Walker was the perpetrator of a shocking 2019 incident when he stabbed a 74-year-old woman at random outside an assisted living facility.
According to prosecutors, Walker approached the woman, who was using a walker while she was gardening, began cursing at her, then attacked her with a knife.
Walker, who was on probation for other assaults at the time, had numerous prior convictions, including four for arson, and was convicted at trial in 2022. 
Before jurors deliberated in that trial, the judge issued the jury instructions that said in part, “unless the contrary appears from the evidence, the jury may draw the inference that the accused intended all the consequences which one standing in like circumstances and possessing like knowledge should reasonably have expected to result from any act knowingly done or knowingly omitted by the accused.”
That was a mistake, because the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in 1978 that judges should not use that particular jury instruction, known as the “Mann instruction.” It’s named after the federal case that struck it down, because it can prejudice a jury against the defendant by shifting the burden of proof regarding the accused person’s intent from the prosecution to the defense.
Walker’s attorney objected to the language, but prosecutors argued in favor, incorrectly saying that the Supreme Court and appeals court had approved it.
Writing in last week’s order, the appeals court said that the confusion is understandable, because in some cases it has found the use of that prejudicial jury instruction to be harmless.
In addition, the state changed some standard jury instructions a few years ago. 
While other uses of that old language were found to be harmless, it was not harmless in Walker’s case, the court ruled. 
“Here, Walker was convicted of a specific intent crime in a trial where the sole contested issue in relation to the attempted murder charge was whether Walker acted with the specific intent to kill,” wrote Judge Marjorie Allard on behalf of the court.
“Moreover, the potential prejudice caused by the Mann instruction was amplified by the fact that the prosecutor expressly referred to the instruction in closing argument and used the instruction to argue the State’s theory of specific intent. Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the giving of the Mann instruction — an instruction condemned by the Alaska Supreme Court nearly five decades ago — was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.”

Labor unions, advocates, and local governments that sued to block the cuts said the president exceeded his authority with the executive order by moving to dismantle the federal government without congressional approval.
A U.S. District Court judge in Northern California agreed and issued a preliminary injunction to stall the executive order while the case was heard. A divided 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision.
But the White House pressed an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that Trump’s executive order did not restructure the government but merely called for reductions in force, which it said is within the president’s power.
The Supreme Court agreed in a one-page order Tuesday, saying the government was likely to prevail on its claim and the injunction should be stayed while the case proceeded.
In a sharp, 15-page dissent, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said the district court judge had determined that the administration plan would not just cut jobs but would “fundamentally restructure” the federal government. He made a “reasoned determination” that the order should be stayed while the case was heard, she wrote.
“But that temporary, practical, harm-reducing preservation of the status quo was no match for this Court’s demonstrated enthusiasm for greenlighting this President’s legally dubious actions in an emergency posture,” she wrote.
“At bottom, this case is about whether that action amounts to a structural overhaul that usurps Congress’s policymaking prerogatives — and it is hard to imagine deciding that question in any meaningful way after those changes have happened,” she wrote. “Yet, for some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.”
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a brief concurrence, said she agreed with Jackson that the president does not have the authority to remake government without congressional approval.  But she said the executive order and an implementing memo from the Office of Management and the Office of Personnel Management call for the changes to be “consistent with applicable law,” and it’s for lower courts to determine if they are.
A White House spokesperson called the decision a “another definitive victory” for the Trump administration.
“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”
Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,’” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.
The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups, and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.

Democrats blocked it.,Ian Karbal,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/briefs/pa-house-republicans-tried-to-force-a-vote-on-a-transgender-athlete-ban-democrats-blocked-it/,"The bill had already passed the GOP-controlled Senate, with five Democrats joining every Republican in supporting it.","A view of the state Capitol dome in Harrisburg. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Members of the Republican minority in the state House tried to force a vote on a bill that would ban transgender athletes from participating in women’s sports in public schools and publicly funded colleges. 
But, Democrats on the House Education Committee blocked them.
The bill had already passed the GOP-controlled Senate, with five Democrats joining every Republican in supporting it. After crossing over to the Democratic-controlled House, the bill stalled in the Education Committee.
The maneuver House Republicans used to try to force a vote is called a discharge resolution, which allows 25 lawmakers to petition to have a bill forced out of committee after it’s sat for 15 session days. 
But Democrats on the panel re-referred the measure to the House Health Committee, effectively resetting the clock and avoiding a vote on the proposal itself.
The vote to re-refer it passed on party lines, 14-12. Nine Republicans spoke against the move to effectively block a vote on the bill, framing the underlying issue as a matter of “safety,” and portraying Democrats’ move as a way to stop debate.
“It’s time we stand with our female athletes in Pennsylvania,” said Rep. Bryan Cutler (R-Lancaster), minority chair of the committee. “They not only deserve a fair shot on the field, I believe they’ve earned a fair vote and a full vote on the House floor.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Rep. Peter Schweyer (D-Lehigh), chair of the Education Committee, said in a statement that he opposes the bill, and it belongs in the Health Committee instead of his own. 
“I will never support legislation that targets any at-risk community, including our LGBTQIA+ neighbors,” Schweyer said. “Simply stated, SB 9 would make school harder for kids already facing serious and severe bullying.”
Defending the decision to push the bill out of his panel, Schweyer added, “SB 9 would not add one teacher to the classroom, repair one broken school building air conditioner, buy one new textbook, or help one kid get into college or find a good paying job.”
The push to vote on the measure comes after the University of Pennsylvania agreed to ban transgender athletes from participating in gendered sports earlier this month, following pressure from the Trump administration. As it stands, 27 states have bans on transgender athletes participating in school sports. 
Until February, the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association allowed transgender athletes to participate in women’s sports, but changed the rules to comply with an executive order signed by President Donald Trump.
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear cases over bans in West Virginia and Idaho last week

Corinne Goodwin, chair of the Eastern PA Trans Equity Project, said that transgender athletes, like all students, benefit from participation in school sports.
“When they participate in school sports, our youth learn important lessons including how to win with dignity, how to lose with grace, how to support their teammates, and how to play by the rules,” Goodwin wrote in a statement. 
She added moves to ban transgender athletes from school sports can have negative impacts on all students, and the anti-transgender rhetoric that can accompany these efforts has had damaging effects on the health of transgender Pennsylvanians.
“As an example of how this has had an impact, calls/contacts to our info and referral line have increased by over 100% this year as has attendance at the community support groups,” they added. “People – especially parents of transgender youth – are concerned not only about their mental health, but for their physical safety.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/state-capitol-dome-scaled-e1752020042584-1024x621.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 21:04:53.803348

“It clearly rebukes the continued assaults on the President’s constitutionally authorized executive powers by leftist judges who are trying to prevent the President from achieving government efficiency across the federal government,” the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, said in a written statement.
But labor unions, advocates and political leaders say that the decision undermines the value of federal employees, threatens the operation of federal services, and could even endanger American citizens.
In a statement Tuesday evening, the American Federation of Government Employees, along with the rest of the coalition of unions, nonprofits and municipalities bringing the suit against the administration, decried the Supreme Court’s decision as a “serious blow to our democracy.”
The coalition said the decision put “services that the American people rely on in grave jeopardy.”
“This decision does not change the simple and clear fact that reorganizing government functions and laying off federal workers en masse haphazardly without any congressional approval is not allowed by our Constitution,” the statement read. “While we are disappointed in this decision, we will continue to fight on behalf of the communities we represent and argue this case to protect critical public services that we rely on to stay safe and healthy.”










For some reason, this Court sees fit to step in now and release the President’s wrecking ball at the outset of this litigation.


– Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson


Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that as a state with a high concentration of federal workers, “any action against our federal employees is a direct strike against Maryland’s people and economy.”
“Today’s Supreme Court ruling on AFGE v. Trump will embolden President Trump in his mission to dismantle the federal government and threatens to upend the lives of countless public servants who wake up every day to deliver essential services and benefits that people rely on,” Moore said in a written statement. He noted that thousands of Maryland residents have already been laid off from federal agencies under the Trump administration.
In a post to X on Tuesday evening, U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-5th) wrote that Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought are continuing to “vilify and traumatize the patriots serving our nation, unconstitutionally reorganizing the federal government.”
“The Supreme Court’s decision today demonstrates that federal employees, their families and livelihoods, and the vital services they provide to the American people are of no concern to the Trump Administration,” Hoyer wrote. “I stand with our federal employees against these attacks.”
U.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) said in an X post that the ruling “will give Trump’s wrecking crew more awful ideas about sacking critical federal workers,” referencing layoffs at the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who help notify state and local agencies about impending dangerous weather.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) added that layoffs could also put Americans at risk by “decimating essential public services” like food inspections and Social Security.
“As Justice Jackson put it in her dissent, ‘this was the wrong decision at the wrong moment, given what little this Court knows about what is actually happening on the ground,'” Van Hollen said in a statment. “She is right. The Court’s decision to allow this damage to be done before ruling on the merits shows how detached they are from the reality of the moment.”
Van Hollen said the administration’s plan “isn’t about efficiency, it’s about rigging the government to only benefit the wealthy and powerful special interests.”
“We are not done fighting in Congress, in the courts, and in our communities to defend the dedicated public servants who go to work on behalf of the American people day in and day out,” he said.

The Feb. 11 executive order directed federal agencies to prepeare for “large-scale reductions in force” and to work with members of the Department of Government Efficiency — the DOGE Service that was run at the time by billionaire Elon Musk — to develop a plan to reduce the size of the workforce. Military personnel were exempted, but virtually every other federal agency was affected.
The order was quickly challenged in court by labor unions, taxpayer and good government groups and by a half-dozen local governments: Harris County, Texas, Martin Luther King Jr. County, Washington, and San Francisco City and County, California; and the cities of Chicago, Baltimore, and Santa Rosa, California.
They argued that the goals of the executive order far exceeded the president’s authority to reduce the size of agencies. Under the DOGE plan, they argued to the Supreme Court, “functions across the federal government will be abolished, agencies will be radically downsized from what Congress authorized, critical government services will be lost, and hundreds of thousands of federal employees will lose their jobs.”
“There will be no way to unscramble that egg: If the courts ultimately deem the President to have overstepped his authority and intruded upon that of Congress, as a practical matter there will be no way to go back in time to restore those agencies, functions, and services,” their court filing said.
That was echoed by Jackson, who said the district court judge was in the best position to determine if the president’s order consisted of “minor workforce reductions” or whether it was a massive reorganization that overstepped executive authority.
“With scant justification, the majority permits the immediate and potentially devastating aggrandizement of one branch (the Executive) at the expense of another (Congress), and once again leaves the People paying the price for its reckless emergency-docket determinations,” she wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/GettyImages-2198372169-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 21:04:53.803348

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on July 7.
WINDSOR — A sign with a large pink background was stuck in the red mulch over the weekend under a green canopy in front of the entrance of Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax, boutiques of flowers spread around its base.
“MUST BE GOD NEEDED A CHEERLEADER IN HEAVEN,” the sign announced, saying just enough for people who understood its reference.
Students and teachers are in mourning over the loss of one of their own, 14-year-old Maameyaa Ntiriwaa. Everyone knew her as “Pinky,” in keeping with the electric pink color of her long, neatly woven braids.
Pinky, who had recently graduated 8th grade and was on her way to high school in the coming school year, died in a drowning incident at Kennedy Pond in Windsor on July 2. She had come to Windsor with family friends, police said last week.
“She was a bright light in any dark day,” said Danielle Rothy, whose family lives on the same street in Fairfax as Pinky’s and coached her on BFA Fairfax’s cross-country team.
“She had a vibrant personality, a big smile, and so much sass,” Rothy said, her voice choking during a phone interview with the Valley News on Monday.
The pink sign out in front of the school was put up by Pinky’s classmates, Rothy said, to honor their friend, who was an enthusiastic member of BFA Fairfax cheerleading squad.
In the neighborhood, Pinky was the leader among a band of 15 or so kids who all lived within doors of each other, Rothy said, noting that Pinky served as a role model for them, including for Rothy’s own two children, a 9-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son.
“She was on the older side of the kids in our neighborhood and she took care of all the younger ones. She was the leader and they all just followed her around like little puppies behind their mom,” Rothy said.
Pinky “would take care of everybody and was kind to everyone,” Rothy said. And a peacemaker.
“She was always trying to mediate issues between other people,” Rothy related.
Pinky’s family is from Ghana, according to Rothy, although all the children were born in the U.S. After Pinky’s death, Rothy, Fairfax’s parks and recreation director, said she was approached by Pinky’s fellow cheerleaders to ask if they could all wear pink — “her favorite color” — in honor of their belove squad member in the town’s annual July 4th parade.
“But instead of just having the cheerleaders do it, I opened it up to the entire town and invited people to wear pink” said Rothy, who took to social media in a call for parade-goers and the town to wear something pink to commemorate the Pinky.
The celebration in pink for Pinky continued over to the town party in the park, where one of the food vendors donated all the tips from his tip jar to Pinky’s family, Rothy reported in a social media post. “A lot of people wore pink. It was a very much a pink parade and it was hard, but we did it,” Rothy said.
Last week, a person who described themselves as a friend of Pinky’s family launched a GoFundMe campaign to raises money for her family and help pay for Pinky’s funeral service.
By Monday afternoon, the campaign had received 532 donations and raised more than $36,000.

(Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year.
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA.
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.
 


Reed: ‘Further cuts would have been an abject disaster’
Rhode Island Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, called the Trump administration’s retreat on more mass layoffs at the VA “a reprieve for veterans and their families” in a statement Tuesday.
Reed is a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs (MilCon-VA), which oversees VA funding, issued the following statement:

“The Trump Administration’s initial arbitrary workforce cuts have already harmed veterans and their families,” Reed said. “Trump and DOGE were downsizing simply for downsizing’s sake – not because they carefully studied appropriate staffing levels. Their careless cuts diminished essential services and increased wait times. Further cuts would have been an abject disaster and halting them is significant. This about face is a direct result of strong advocacy from veterans, their families, and everyone who cares about keeping our promise to those who serve. Now we need to reverse the loss of 30,000 VA employees, restore staffing levels, and get the VA running at full capacity again so it can deliver for those who faithfully served.”
In March, Reed spoke out against the Trump Administration’s proposal to cut over 80,000 workers from the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Troopers reported seeing what they believed was a firearm in the man’s hands, and when he didn’t respond to commands, one of them opened fire. A later search found no firearms in the man’s apartment.

A state trooper shot and killed a man Monday in Putney after reportedly seeing what he believed was a firearm in the man’s hand and after the man ignored police commands, according to the Vermont State Police. 
A later search of the man’s apartment, police said Tuesday, turned up no firearms. 
Scott Garvey, 55, who lived in the apartment at Putney Landing where the shooting occurred, died from gunshot wounds to his torso and left lower extremity, according to a state police press release Tuesday evening. 
Trooper Peter Romeo, who fired on Garvey, has been placed on paid relief-from-duty status, which is standard state police protocol following a shooting. 
Romeo works out of the state police barracks in Westminster, where he has been assigned since his graduation from the Vermont Police Academy in January 2023, according to the press release.   
Events leading to the shooting began around 11:20 p.m. Sunday, when police received a call from a person at the apartment reporting a “mental health concern,” the release stated.

A mental health caseworker embedded with the state police “dealt with the concern over the phone, and troopers did not respond to the scene,” according to the release. 
At about 7:15 a.m. Monday, the release stated, police got another call coming from the apartment, followed at 11:15 a.m. by a report from another Putney Landing resident that Garvey was outside “exhibiting concerning behavior and making threatening” comments. 
Troopers went to the apartment along with the mental health caseworker. 
“Mr. Garvey returned to his apartment and barricaded himself inside while continuing to make threatening statements, including of self-harm,” the release stated. 
The caseworker and troopers tried to talk with Garvey to resolve the situation to no avail. The troopers then got a warrant to enter the apartment to charge him with criminal threatening and disorderly conduct, the release stated. 
“Upon entering the apartment at about 4:30 p.m., troopers encountered Mr. Garvey and reported that they saw an object in his hands that they believed to be a firearm,” according to the release. “Mr. Garvey did not respond to commands given by the troopers. Trooper Romeo fired his service weapon.”
State police did not say how many shots were fired. Garvey was pronounced dead at the scene. After the shooting, the release stated, a search of the apartment found no firearms inside. 
The Vermont Attorney General’s Office and Windham County State’s Attorney’s Office will be conducting independent reviews of Romeo’s use of force. 
The Windham & Windsor Housing Trust, owner and operator of the Putney Landing apartment complex, posted a statement Tuesday on Facebook.
“We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that took place yesterday at Putney Landing during an encounter between Vermont State Police and a resident experiencing a severe mental health crisis,” the post stated.
Despite “efforts to de-escalate and bring the situation to a peaceful resolution, the confrontation ended in the loss of a life — a heartbreaking outcome for everyone involved,” the posting added.
The post did not name the resident who died, but he was later identified Tuesday evening by state police as Garvey.
“Our shared responsibility is to care for one another and to build a stronger, more compassionate response to those in crisis — one that upholds the dignity and value of every person,” the post later noted.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 23:21:48+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. Josh Elliott files to challenge Lamont for governor,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/rep-josh-elliott-files-to-challenge-lamont-for-governor/,It wasn't clear if Josh Elliott was committed to an all-or-nothing run for governor or was testing Democrats' appetite for an alternative.,"State Rep. Josh Elliott, D-Hamden, a liberal who recently predicted that Gov. Ned Lamont would not go unchallenged for the Democratic nomination if he runs in 2026, filed papers Tuesday creating a gubernatorial campaign committee.
Unclear was whether Elliott was committed to an all-or-nothing run for governor or a campaign to test Democrats’ appetite for an alternative to Lamont, whose centrist politics on fiscal issues are a source of tension with some on the left.
Elliott, who has called for a more progressive tax structure, said by text he will make a formal campaign announcement Monday in Hamden.
Elliott, who declined further comment, ran for secretary of the state in 2022, staying in the campaign through the nominating convention, then opted to quit and seek reelection to the House. 
“I don’t think it’s an all-or-nothing,” said Rep. Anne Hughes, D-Easton, a progressive ally of Elliott. But she also cautioned against a comparison to 2022, saying, “I think this is a really different moment.”
Hughes said the party needs a more aggressive approach to a Trump administration that she says is promoting “a police state” and dismantling the social safety net, and there is a desire for generational change.
“The governor doesn’t understand the urgency,” she said.
Elliott, 41, a five-term state lawmaker, is the first Democrat to file papers creating a gubernatorial campaign committee. Lamont, 71, said last month he was seriously considering a third term but stopped far short of an announcement.
Jen Tooker, the Westport first selectwoman, is a declared candidate for the Republican nomination. New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, also a Republican, has an exploratory committee and is expected to run.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Elliott had informed him of his intention to open a campaign, but he declined to speculate on whether Elliott would try to force a primary if Lamont runs.
“Josh has become a very good friend and trusted colleague,” Ritter said. “And he indicated to me that he wanted to go out and talk to people.”

Lamont, who has consistently scored positive, if not exemplary, approval ratings since a rocky start in 2019, is widely seen as well-positioned in a general election, given fiscal  policies that have cut taxes, paid down debt and produced record budget reserves.
Those same fiscal policies have generated criticism from some labor leaders, most notably Ed Hawthorne, the president of the Connecticut AFL-CIO. Lamont’s vetoes of a labor priority, a measure that would have provided jobless benefits for strikers, and an omnibus housing bill, also provoked complaints on the left.
One Democratic strategist who has been privy to discussions among the potential of a challenge to the governor said of Elliott’s filing: “I think this is a shot across the bow.”
The strategist declined to be quoted by name, citing the sensitivity of those discussions. If nothing else, the strategist said, Elliott could make Lamont more open to policy overtures from the left.
Rob Blanchard, the governor’s communications director, had no direct comment on Elliott’s candidacy but stressed the governor’s Democratic credentials.
“From day one, Gov. Lamont’s focus has been on expanding opportunity and making Connecticut more affordable for working families. He championed progressive priorities such as free child care for families making less than $100k, paid family and medical leave, expanding our earned income tax credit for our lowest-earning residents, and increasing our minimum wage to one of the highest in the country,” Blanchard said.
Blanchard indicated the governor would not rest on that record.
“While that’s a proud record on affordability and opportunity that could go up against anyone,” Blanchard said, “the governor understands that more must be done to bring costs down for families across Connecticut, and it will continue to be the No. 1 focus of his administration.”
Hughes said the upset victory by 33-year-old socialist Zohran Mamdani in the New York mayoral primary has exposed an appetite for new leadership, as did the recent announcement of a 37-year-old Hartford school board member, Ruth Fortune, that she would challenge U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District.
In an interview the day after Mamdani defeated former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a Democratic mayoral primary in New York City, Elliott was reluctant to find evidence of vulnerability by Lamont in Cuomo’s defeat, given Cuomo’s resignation over sexual harassment accusations.
“You need to be really aware of luck — and that’s not to in any way detract from that race — but I think that Mamdani got lucky to be against a truly unsympathetic competitor, where Ned is a nice guy and is really likable,” Elliott said.
Elliott did note, however, that he began his own career by announcing an intention to run a primary against Rep. J. Brendan Sharkey, D-Hamden, who then was the House speaker. Sharkey ultimately did not run in 2016.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/52977603-5EC8-4655-B7E3-AC939496E087_1_105_c.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 20:04:40.374748

Ed Rendell signed it into law later that day.","Government reform activist Gene Stilp speaks at a press conference in the Capitol, Monday, July 7, 2025, on the 20th anniversary of the pay raise vote that upended the Pennsylvania Legislature. (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)On the 20th anniversary of a legislative pay raise scandal that upended the General Assembly, government watchdogs said undemocratic practices persist at the state Capitol.
“How things get done determines what things get done,” said Tim Potts, president of the group Democracy Rising. “And if that process is corrupt, you’re probably not going to get a very good result.”
After a 2 a.m. vote on July 7, 2005, the legislature passed a bill without debate to increase salaries by 16% to 34% for government employees in legislative, executive, and judicial branches. After passing 157-40 in the House and 28-22 in the Senate, Gov. Ed Rendell signed it into law later that day.
But controversy broke out over the way the pay hike was enacted and served as a breaking point for government reform advocates. 
The legislature “went rogue,” according to Barry Kauffman, executive director of Common Cause Pennsylvania. 
Pennsylvanians struck back after seeing, “cowardly legislators slink secretly into the night to pass exorbitant pay raises and benefits that violated the state constitution and demonstrated disrespect for their constituents,” he said.
The move spurred a grassroots effort to repeal the raise just four months after it went into effect, as well as a movement to vote out all incumbent lawmakers in the 2006 primary.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Anti-corruption advocates like Potts and Eric Epstein, founder of the watchdog group Rock the Capital, drove the effort to repeal the bill. Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon County — then a businessman and entrepreneur — launched a PAC, PACleanSweep, dedicated to removing incumbents. 
Gene Stilp, a reformer and activist, challenged the legality of the pay raise in court, resulting in the state Supreme Court ruling in September 2005 that the bill’s unvouchered expenses were unconstitutional for all government employees, except state judges. Common Cause filed suit in federal court to repeal the bill, but the case was thrown out in 2006.  
Two decades later, those same advocates still have their eyes trained on state government, and they are doubtful enduring changes to legislative culture took root.
“Reform in Pennsylvania is like spraying perfume in a sewer,” Epstein said. “Twenty years later, we still have a government of corruption, lies and sewage.”
Before the bill could be repealed in November 2005, lawmakers received payments classified as “unvouchered expenses,” ranging from $1,300 to $14,500 before taxes. Twenty-seven senators and 103 representatives accepted the increased salary.
Lawmakers who took the 2005 pay raise who remain in office include Sen. David G. Argall, R-Carbon County, Sen. Anthony H. Williams, D-Philadelphia, Sen. Christine M. Tartaglione, D-Philadelphia, and Sen. Vincent J. Hughes, D-Philadelphia. 
At the time, rank-and-file legislators made just under $70,000, but currently earn more than $110,000 as a result of cost-of-living increases enacted 20 years ago. Today, only California and New York lawmakers earn more than Pennsylvania lawmakers.
According to Stilp, “there’s not a class of new legislators who have the backbone to do anything about reform in this building.” 
But he says he believes reform is possible when more people get involved. He mentioned his 2009 lawsuit against the State Ethics Commission as an example of a citizen-led effort to change a legislative process. 
According to Kauffman, the backlash to the salary scandal and the changes it achieved could provide a blueprint for future reform and an example of democracy in action at a time when political norms are being challenged daily on the national level.

A year before the pay raise passed, the legislature had employed a similar process to pass a bill legalizing slot machine gambling for the first time. 
The 2004 gaming bill also was approved in the early morning hours and immediately drew opposition from lawmakers and activists, who argued it violated constitutional provisions intended to make the legislative process transparent for the public. 
Specifically, critics condemned its sponsors for introducing it as a one-page bill on an unrelated issue, and then amending it into a 145-page proposal to legalize slot machines. After lawmakers and activists challenged the measure, the state Supreme Court eventually upheld its constitutionality in 2005.
In the wake of the controversy over gaming, the tactics used to pass the pay raise immediately sounded an alarm for government watchdogs.
“This was so incredibly brazen,” Kauffman said, due to a “massive number of violations of the (state) constitution, the fact that it happened in the middle of the night, [and] that no constituent had an opportunity to vent or voice their concerns with their public official.”
Critics asserted lawmakers had violated the constitutional prohibition on lawmakers increasing their own compensation. They said a pay increase may not take effect in the same session in which it was approved. Essentially, an incumbent lawmaker must be reelected before benefitting from a vote to increase the legislature’s pay. 
At the time, the General Assembly skirted that requirement by awarding itself “unvouchered expenses,” equivalent to forthcoming salary increases. It also argued the bill’s establishment of annual cost-of-living adjustments violated a state Constitutional mandate requiring compensation to be fixed by law. 
Strong public opposition was evident in protests and rallies, but activists also employed new techniques to get their messages across, including Stilp using a symbolic giant, inflatable pink pig. The anti-incumbency movement also used early social media, relying on Yahoo Groups to post articles criticizing the bill to generate public conversation, Diamond said. 
“It was an amazing amount of public support in an age where we didn’t have the social media we have today,” he told the Capital Star.
The early effects of the movement hit the state Supreme Court first. Justice Russell Nigro became the first and only member of the high court to be denied retention in the November 2005 election.
Protesters gained traction over the next year. PA Clean Sweep recruited 113 candidates to run against sitting legislators in the 2006 primary elections, Diamond said. As a result, 17 senators and nearly one fourth of House lawmakers were defeated.
According to Tim Potts, the movement, and particularly the unseating of a Supreme Court justice, has empowered Pennsylvanians in the long-term to depend on the courts for protection by upholding the Constitution. 
This year, Pennsylvanians will decide whether to retain three Supreme Court justices. Politicians on both sides of the aisle say the outcome could direct the results of cases on important policy issues, such as reproductive rights and marijuana legalization.

Jason Ellsworth, R-Hamilton, listens as delegates to the state GOP convention discuss removing his right to vote, along with eight other senators'. (Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Nine Republican state senators who were stripped of their ability to vote for GOP party leadership during a state convention last month have lodged a protest with the party, requesting the elections be nullified.
In a continuation of a feud that began during the 2025 Legislative session, divisions within the state Republican party were on full display during the June convention.
The nine senators — Jason Ellsworth, Hamilton; Bruce Gillespie, Etheridge; Gregg Hunter, Glasgow; Josh Kassmier, Fort Benton; Gayle Lammers, Hardin; Denley Loge, St. Regis; Wendy McKamey, Great Falls; Russ Tempel, Chester; and Shelley Vance, Belgrade — all broke with the majority of their party in a series of votes taken in conjunction with Democrats to establish Senate rules and move forward large pieces of legislation, including the state’s budget. Many bills the Nine championed were priorities of Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte’s administration.
The GOP Executive Committee censured the Nine during the session, saying they no longer considered them to represent Republican values. Members of the Nine, however, have argued their views represent the true identity of the GOP.
During the convention, Sen. Barry Usher of Yellowstone County made a motion to approve all credentialed delegates except for the Nine, a motion backed by fellow Freedom Caucus member Rep. Jane Gillette, of Three Forks, and approved by a majority of delegates. The vote to elect Art Wittich as the new party chair and additional members of leadership went forward without the votes from the Nine or their proxies.
The disenfranchised senators “represent the thousands of Montana Republicans committed to Republican values who elected those Senators to speak for them,” states the letter of protest sent by lawyer Joan Mell on behalf of the Nine. “The Republican Party is not the party of extremists. As Senators they had the right to vote and participate in the party process. The wholesale disregard of fundamental party voting rights embodied in the Bylaws may not be left unaddressed.”
The letter requests party leaders reconvene the convention to correct the “parliamentary snafu that left these Senators voiceless and emboldened the Freedom Caucus PAC faction to pursue its manifesto.” Mell further accuses the Freedom Caucus members of “bullying” and “exclusionary tactics through subterfuge, surprise and intimidation.”

When Usher made his motion during the convention, then-party Chairman Don Kaltschmidt ruled it out of order, but Gillette successfully demanded the ruling be put to a vote.
Mell said in her letter that Gillette’s motion should have also been ruled out of order, and requested a response within 10 days.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the Montana GOP said: “It’s clear these nine senators represent a small minority within our party. The Montana Republican Party remains focused on empowering conservative voters and advancing the principles Montanans elected us to uphold. The letter has been referred to our legal counsel and the rules committee for review. We’ll have more to say soon.”
Speaking to the Daily Montanan on Tuesday, Mell said that it’s clear in the party bylaws that senators have a right to cast votes in party elections, and to remove that power requires changing the bylaws, not a simple vote during the convention.
“You can’t do that on a whim,” she said.
If a senator wanted to make such a motion, Mell said, they should have put out a notice before the meeting, or convened the rules committee to determine whether such a motion could be made.
“The tragic thing is that they are nine members of the Legislature who have all been elected by Montana voters, to have their voice and vote,” Mell said.
Mell addressed her letter to both the current and former party chair, though she told the Daily Montanan she believes Kaltschmidt has the “burden of acting on it.”
Wittich, who earned 140 votes to Stacey Zinn’s 94, said in remarks following his election that he looked forward to bright days for the party ahead.
“We’re a red state. We could become a bright red state,” he said. “And we can do it without dividing and subtracting. We can grow.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6330-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-07-08 20:04:40.374748

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Trump administration has approved another project in Utah under the president’s national energy emergency declaration, green-lighting the expansion of a facility in Carbon County that will allow for increased oil exports. 
Once it’s completed, the Wildcat Loadout Facility in Helper will be able to load about 100,000 barrels of Uintah Basin oil each day to be shipped via train to refineries in Texas and Louisiana. 
The Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, approved the proposal from Coal Energy Group 2 LLC on July 3 to expand the facility. The proposal includes adding more loading and unloading areas, a tank farm (a site with above-ground tanks to store oil), loading systems and other “related facilities to increase project capacity to transload oil,” according to the BLM. 
The proposal was approved under an accelerated, 14-day environmental review process, part of President Donald Trump’s national energy emergency order declared in January. Using the same process, the administration approved a new uranium mine in southern Utah in May, the first project to be approved under the new guidelines.

The new review expedites a process that in the past has sometimes taken years, and sidesteps public comment.  
Coal Energy Group 2 currently holds a BLM right of way on the 270-acre site, which was issued in 1982 to load coal onto railway cars. But in recent years the site has been used predominantly to load oil, with the coal facilities sitting idle since 2016, according to the BLM. 
The company has tried to expand the site for several years, first applying in 2023. That application was met with opposition from environmental groups and politicians, including Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet and Rep. Joe Neguse, both Democrats, who penned a letter to the BLM urging them to prepare a broader environmental review. 
Both lawmakers remain opposed to the project, calling it “profoundly flawed” in a June 23 statement. 
“There is no credible energy emergency to justify bypassing public involvement and environmental safeguards. The United States is currently producing more oil and gas than any country in the world,” the statement reads. 
Meanwhile, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office told Colorado Newsline it is considering joining a lawsuit challenging the president’s energy emergency declaration.

Other groups criticized the decision last week, calling it rushed and warning of environmental risks. 
“There is no energy emergency, plain and simple. Hidden behind a shroud of secrecy, the BLM has rushed through its approval of this massive oil shipping expansion project,” said Landon Newell, a staff attorney with the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. “This thinly analyzed decision threatens the lifeblood of the American Southwest by authorizing the transport of more than one billion gallons annually of additional oil on railcars traveling alongside the Colorado River. Any derailment and oil spill would have a devastating impact on the Colorado River and the communities and ecosystems that rely upon it.” 
“The Trump administration’s refusal to hear community concerns about oil spill risks is pure hubris. Local communities know better than D.C. bureaucrats how this dangerous increase in oil trucking and rail traffic will affect their health and safety,” added Wendy Park with the Center for Biological Diversity. “This fast-tracked review breezed past vital protections for clean air, public safety and endangered species.”
The expansion would take place on 30 acres of “previously disturbed lands” (meaning they’ve been altered in some way) within the 270 acre site, according to the BLM analysis.
Trucks currently bring in oil from the Uinta Basin to the Helper site — the BLM estimates there are 77 truck deliveries at the site per day. The expansion would result in an additional 345 deliveries each day, according to the BLM’s analysis. The facility could now be able to load about 100,000 barrels of crude oil daily, which would be transported to refineries along the Gulf Coast. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The BLM acknowledged in its analysis that the project’s expansion wouldn’t actually mean more oil production in Utah. 
According to the agency, Utah is already under-producing — as of February, the state produces about 182,000 barrels of crude oil each day, despite having a higher capacity. 
The BLM’s analysis states that Salt Lake City’s refineries can only process 80,000 barrels of waxy crude oil (the kind of oil that is largely produced in the Uinta Basin) each day. Additionally, Carbon County can currently load about 180,000 barrels onto railway cars per day, according to the BLM. 
“Therefore, crude oil export capacity currently exceeds crude oil production for the entire state of Utah,” the BLM’s analysis reads. “In other words, a BLM decision to authorize the Wildcat Loadout Facility expansion will not necessarily increase crude oil production in the Uinta Basin (which hinges on overall market forces). Instead, so long as the price of crude oil remains low, production in the Uinta Basin will likely remain static.” 
Expanding the facility will still shift where the loading occurs, the BLM analysis reads, “by providing a more convenient location to transfer crude oil from trucks to rail cars.” 
“Responsible energy development plays a key role in supporting local communities and national priorities,” said BLM Green River District Manager Elijah Waters in a news release. “This project reflects our commitment to advancing critical infrastructure while ensuring careful stewardship of Utah’s public lands.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/DSC_0678-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 20:04:40.374748

(File photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year.
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing, prior to the Biden administration, of roughly 398,000 employees. That would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. The agency announced Monday that the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in spending on “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) programs as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
VA secretary says ‘health care and benefits are not being cut’

“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA.
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits.
More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

It has 1,000 employees, including 40% who are tribal members, according to the presentation. (Photo courtesy NM legislative presentation)The vice president of a local tribe is asking the New Mexico Attorney General and the state Legislature to intervene against online gambling apps that he says are using a backdoor to allow illegal sports gambling here and, in doing so, threatening tribal gaming rights. 
Mescalero Apache Reservation Vice President Duane Duffy told a panel of state lawmakers this week that platforms like Kalshi allow customers to do online sports betting under the guise of commodity futures trading. The companies are “wiggling” their way into New Mexico, a state where online sports betting is illegal, he said.
“That is a threat to the gaming market here in the state, and a clear violation of the state tribal gaming compacts,” Duffy told members of the interim Economic & Rural Development & Policy Committee on Monday at the tribe’s Inn of the Mountain Gods, which houses its casino. “And so that is something that we are going to have to work together on [to] address.”
He said he and other tribes intend to approach lawmakers ahead of the 30-day legislative session in January to see whether there’s a legislative way to crack down on the companies. He also intends to seek help from the New Mexico Attorney General, he said. 
Duffy did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. Neither did Kalshi. 
Lauren Rodriguez, chief of staff  for the New Mexico Attorney General, told Source New Mexico in an email that the office had received a letter from gaming tribes regarding the matter. The office has been in communication with one of the tribes, Sandia Pueblo, regarding Kalshi and the office is “continuing to monitor developments in related lawsuits brought by other states,” she said.

Duffy’s comments come as other states seek help from a federal agency to crack down on the companies, which they say are undermining hard-fought legislation regulating gambling at the state level.
In early June, Arizona’s director of gaming wrote a letter to the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, naming Kalshi as well as Robinhood and Crypto.com as companies that bypass the state’s gambling regulations by pretending they are allowing users to buy “contracts” or engage in “trading” financial products when in effect they are just trying to predict which team will win a sporting match.
“The [companies] claim that their operations enable ‘trading’ of financial derivatives, which is conduct regulated by the [commission],” Johnson wrote. “In truth, there is no meaningful difference between buying one of the contracts offered by the [companies] and placing a bet with any other sportsbook.”
Arizona is among seven states that sent cease-and-desist letters to Kalshi, according to online sports gambling news site SBCAmericas. Several other states have launched investigations, according to the site. 
The tribal gaming compacts between 14 tribes and pueblos in New Mexico result from negotiations between the tribes, the governor’s office and the New Mexico Legislature. The 2015 gaming compact, which is in effect until 2037, requires the parties to reopen “good-faith negotiations” if any “internet gaming” is authorized in New Mexico. 
Mescalero and other tribes cited that provision recently when seeking an official opinion from Torrez about the activities of Jack Pocket, an app that allowed users to buy lottery tickets online. 
In February, Torrez concluded that Jack Pocket’s activities amounted to “internet gaming,” which meant, per the compacts, the state needed to reopen negotiations with the tribes to evaluate its impact. Torrez also determined that Jack Pocket was operating without a necessary authorization from the New Mexico Lottery Association. 
Duffy told the committee Monday that as a result of the AG’s intervention, Jackpocket has “since ceased that operation when it comes to the online lottery sales.”
Growth of sports betting may be linked to financial woes, new studies find

Rodriguez, Torrez’s spokesperson, told Source that while it is monitoring the situation that the office would not be issuing a formal opinion about Kalshi like it did about Jackpocket, because the request for its opinion on the matter did not come from state elected officials like legislators or district attorneys. 
New Mexico Sen. Bill Sharer (R-Farmington) asked Duffy to elaborate on what he’s asking the Legislature to do, suggesting he would like to avoid reopening compact negotiations. 
“What’s the solution to this? Because I don’t think we can stop the internet,” Sharer said.
Options Duffy listed include lawsuits and seeking help from the governor’s office, the Legislature or the AG. He told lawmakers he was just putting the issue “in your ear” because the problem would not be going away. 
“There’s no mechanism that exists right now that allows the tribes or racinos to engage in internet gaming, and to have these outside entities from outside the state doing that…it’s taken out of our pockets, sending it out of state,” he said. “And we don’t have that ability then to revenue share to our full potential.”
According to the latest figures, tribal casinos across the state generated more than $219 million in “adjusted net win” in the first quarter of 2025, which includes the amount of money made on gaming machines minus the amount paid out in non-cash prizes. The state received more than $20 million in revenues deposited into the general fund this quarter, as a result. 
Duffy said the Inn of the Mountain Gods and its casino, which generated more than $15 million in the first quarter of 2025, constitute  the tribe’s sole source of revenue, excluding federal and state grants. The casino accounts for a huge part of that, especially as the tribe’s ski resort increasingly loses customers due to reductions in snowpack, he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-at-4.11.22 PM-1024x499.png,,,2025-07-08 19:09:35.964322

Game and Fish reconsiders proposed changes amid a legislative discussion about making special tags saleable — a hugely unpopular idea with sportspeople.
The post Outcry causes Wyoming to back off plan to curb ‘landowner tag’ advantages appeared first on WyoFile .","A week from now, the appointed officials who oversee Wyoming’s wildlife are devoting an extraordinary seven hours to a single agenda item. 
The topic is proposed changes to the state’s system of awarding special hunting tags to landowners. It’s a system that causes some problems. Specifically, in some hunt areas, almost all the licenses available are gobbled up by landowners, leaving the general hunting public empty-handed. 
Wyoming Game and Fish commissioners are allocating an entire day of their Casper meeting to the proposed reforms after seeing landowners’ responses to the changes at presentations given by biologists and wardens this spring around the state. Meetings went late into the evenings, Game and Fish Commissioner Rusty Bell told WyoFile, and public comments, mostly opposing the changes, piled up by the hundreds. 
In response, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department reversed course. The department is no longer recommending most major changes, though the decision-making will happen on a higher level, Game and Fish spokeswoman Amanda Fry said.
“Ultimately, it’s up to the commission what happens,” Fry told WyoFile. “Our agency, we can only provide recommendations.”

The changes once being recommended, which were several years in the making, would have made it more difficult for landowners to acquire coveted tags that “come off the top.” That means they’re allocated in advance of the lotteries where rank-and-file public hunters vie for limited opportunities. Before the outcry from landowners, Game and Fish had proposed several big changes: 

Acres owned to qualify for landowner licenses would have quadrupled, going from 160 to 640 acres. (Cultivated land was exempted from the change, and would have remained the same.)
The number of “animal use-days” that must be demonstrated for landowner tag eligibility was proposed to increase from 2,000 to 3,000. 
Wildlife managers also sought to require that landowner tag holders possess “significant interest” in a property or at least 20% ownership of a land-owning corporation, trust or LLC in order to be eligible.

Those proposed regulation changes are all no longer being recommended, according to a “public comment summary and response” memo that agency staff sent the Game and Fish Commission on June 19.  The memo shows that about 70% of the 380 comments the department received opposed the proposed changes. Just 9% of respondents stated support. 
One reform is still being recommended. Notably, it will make it easier for big game and turkey hunters to acquire landowner tags. Specifically, the definition of “immediate family member” would be expanded to include “step-parents,” “step-grandparents,” “step-siblings” and “step-children” in order to accommodate blended families. 
The changes to landowner licenses that were being pursued dated back to the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce, which was co-chaired by Josh Coursey and Rusty Bell, who’s now a Game and Fish commissioner. During the group’s 2021 and 2022 meetings, the public learned that in some hunting areas, the majority of coveted licenses for quarry like bull elk were ending up in the hands of landowners. The meetings also highlighted that properties were being subdivided into 160-acre parcels for the purpose of owners obtaining more hunting licenses for friends or family.

In Wyoming, landowner licenses date to 1949. They can only be used by an applicant or an immediate family member. Apart from the acreage requirement, landowners must provide habitat for the applicable species: elk, deer, pronghorn or wild turkeys. Recipients — who are capped at two licenses for each species, good throughout the hunt area — are supposed to prove that they’re providing that habitat via the “animal use days” condition (e.g., 2,000 elk on their property for a single day or 20 mule deer for 100 days.) 
The Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce, charged with addressing the top-priority wildlife policy issues facing the state, was unable to agree on recommendations for landowner tag reforms. 
In 2023 and 2024, however, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department hosted a series of public meetings about the topic. Then in November 2024, the agency’s commissioners directed the department to craft proposed regulations. 
In the meantime, the Wyoming Legislature got involved.

During the Legislature’s 2025 general session, Kemmerer Republican Sen. Laura Pearson introduced a bill, Senate File 118, “Landowner hunting tags-amendments,” that would have allowed landowners to sell their landowner tags via an open market — a structure other western states allow, where the tags often fetch big bucks. Hunting organizations lobbying in Cheyenne worried that the bill would create more interest in the landowner license program, exacerbating problems that already exist for public hunters disadvantaged by the current system.
Pearson pulled back her bill. But already, landowner licenses have been broached in two legislative committees during the interim period ahead of the 2026 budget session. Dave True, a Natrona County rancher, pitched an idea in June to the Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee that would allow for landowner licenses to be saleable under certain conditions, such as by those who possess at least 2,000 acres.
The transferable tag idea also came up at a June meeting of the Agriculture, State and Public Lands & Water Resources Committee. Tempers flared, the Powell Tribune reported.

Bell, the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce co-chair who’s now a Game and Fish commissioner, told WyoFile that he believes the Legislature is where the “best solutions” are going to come from. He specified that he spoke only for himself. 
“Something that the Legislature can take up … is allowing the [Game and Fish] commission to put a cap on the amount of landowner tags in any given area,” Bell said.
But Bell also warned that a firestorm awaits if lawmakers hit the gas on making landowner tags saleable. During his time on the Wyoming Wildlife Taskforce, he heard and reviewed hundreds of public comments that revealed what resident sportspeople make of the idea. 
“It will change the landscape of hunting in Wyoming forever — that’s what we got back from that public comment,” Bell said. “It’s not going to go over well with sportsmen. It’s going to go over just about as well as selling our public lands.”

Legislative leaders have appointed 11 lawmakers and education officials to the School Redistricting Task Force to craft new school district boundaries for Vermont’s public education system.
The task force was created by H.454, now called Act 73, the sweeping education reform bill that Gov. Phil Scott signed into law this month. Six lawmakers and five former superintendents and school business managers have been appointed to the task force.
The appointees plan to work to consolidate Vermont’s 119 school districts — contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions — into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
These new larger districts would oversee a minimum of 4,000 prekindergarten through grade 12 students, but no more than 8,000 students “to the extent practical,” according to the law.

Three lawmakers and two former school officials were nominated by Senate and House leadership, while one member was appointed by Scott.
One day after signing the education reform bill into law, Scott appointed Dave Wolk, the former state senator and the longtime president of Castleton University, to serve as his lone appointee on the task force.
Wolk has previously served as a principal at both Barstow Memorial School and Rutland High School, and the superintendent of schools in Rutland City.
Scott said in a press release that Wolk’s experience in education and the Legislature “will bring an important perspective to this work and will prioritize what’s best for our kids.”
Wolk said in the release that he plans to “approach the Task Force with an open mind, knowing that the results of the endeavor are not likely to be popular or widely embraced across the state.”
“But it is important work, with a short timeline, and it must be done thoughtfully, with a focus on what is best for all of our students and educators, as well as Vermont taxpayers,” Wolk said. “It will be very challenging but very necessary, for the benefit of Vermont.”
This week, leadership from the House and Senate announced their own picks.
The Senate Committee on Committees — composed of Sens. Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, and Ginny Lyons, D-Chittenden Southeast, along with Republican Lt. Gov. John Rodgers — appointed Dr. Jennifer Botzojorns, a retired superintendent for the Kingdom East School District, and Chris Locarno, a retired director of finance and facilities for the Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
Senate leadership also appointed Sens. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia; Martine Gulick, D-Chittenden Central; and Wendy Harrison, D-Windham to the task force.
“I look forward to working with colleagues to create an educational landscape that is right-sized and provides equity within a thriving public education system,” Gulick said.
Beck, the Republican minority leader, was one of three senators who along with three House members helped craft the final contours of H.454 before being sent to Scott.
He’s drawn the ire from public education advocates for his association with private schools, called independent schools under state law. (Beck is a teacher at St. Johnsbury Academy).
Last month, Beck and Sen. Seth Bongartz were accused in ethics complaints of using their positions to advance provisions that benefited the private schools they are associated with.
In a press release, Beck said he was looking forward to “this important work and providing Vermont students from all corners of Vermont with an excellent education.”
On Tuesday, House Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington, announced her appointment of Reps. Edye Graning, D-Chittenden-3; Beth Quimby, R-Caledonia-2; and Rebecca Holcombe, D-Windsor Orange-2, to the task force.
Krowinski also appointed Jay Badams, a former superintendent, and Kim Gleason, a former school board member.
Krowsinki, announcing her appointments in a press release, said the task force “is an important step in building a public education system that is more equitable, more sustainable and more responsive to the needs of students and communities.”
Gleason, a former member of the State Board of Education, said she was grateful for the opportunity “to represent the important voices of school boards in governance and community engagement as these systemic changes in the Vermont education landscape are being considered.”
During its first meeting later this summer, the task force plans to select two co-chairs from among its members — one from the House and one from the Senate.
The body is then expected to finalize and deliver new school district maps to the Legislature by Dec. 1. Lawmakers then expect to take up the new maps for consideration during next year’s session, which begins in January.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 22:28:01+00:00,CT Mirror,"Defying lawmakers, DEEP opts to keep Wallingford transfer station closed",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/deep-wallingford-transfer-station-permit/,"CT Dept of Energy and Environmental Protection said it won't issue transfer station permit, a move that puts agency at odds with language in budget bill.","Attempts to reopen a shuttered garbage transfer station in Wallingford cannot go forward for the time being, state officials said this week, despite a provision in the state budget that directed Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration to sign off on the plan.
On Monday, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said it would not issue a temporary operating permit to the owners of the transfer station, which had been subject to several complaints and violations before it closed in 2023.
The decision puts the agency at odds with controversial language inserted into the state’s sprawling budget bill — also known as the “implementer” — that directed officials to issue the permit while the facility’s owners completed a formal application to reopen the transfer station.
“In consultation with the Office of the Governor and the Office of the Attorney General, the State has determined that the provision of the budget implementer bill concerning the ‘Wallingford Transfer Station’ cannot be acted upon as drafted and does not provide the Department the authority to issue a ‘temporary operating permit,'” DEEP spokesman James Fowler said in a statement. “The Department will continue to work to resolve open violations of state statutes and regulations at that facility.”
Fowler has previously said the agency was not involved with drafting the language regarding the permit, which also appeared to catch several lawmakers off guard before it was added into the budget two days before the end of the legislative session.
Still, the proposal became law when Gov. Lamont signed the budget on June 30.
The transfer station is owned by Country Holdings LLC. An attorney for the company, Joseph Mazzarella, on Monday accused DEEP of flouting the plain language of the law and said he would consider taking legal action to force the agency to issue the permit.
“It says what it says, and it seems to me they’re going through extraordinary gyrations to try to avoid complying with the law,” Mazzarella said. 
Mazzarella previously told the Connecticut Mirror that he was involved in getting the the permit language included in the budget on behalf of Country Holdings’ owner, Richard Antonucci Jr. In addition to the Wallingford property, the amendment also blocked the proposed sale of a transfer station in Torrington by conveying its operating permit to a recently-established public waste authority.
According to Mazzarella, both provisions offered a boost to Antonucci’s plans to compete against another hauler, USA Waste and Recycling, which he argued has already consolidated its control over much of the state’s waste business.
“How can that be good?” Mazzarella told CT Mirror in an interview last month.
But several lawmakers have since said they had no knowledge of the language addressing the transfer stations — or its origins — before they were asked to vote on the budget.
State Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, said he was surprised when he saw the language for the first time in an amendment to the budget bill that passed the House on June 2. “I represent Wallingford, I think maybe I would’ve known about this,” he said, according to a video of the debate.
Fishbein’s colleague, State Rep. Mary Mushinsky, D-Wallingford, said the language amounted to a legislative “rat” — a pejorative term used by lawmakers to describe ideas that are included in the budget without going through an public hearing. On Monday, she praised DEEP’s decision not to go ahead with issuing a temporary permit for the property.
“It’s a wise move for now,” Mushinsky said. “We should never run stuff in the budget implementer that hasn’t been run by somebody.”
Wallingford’s mayor, Vinny Cervoni, also expressed disappointment in the process through which the language made its way into the budget. He said he only learned about it from lawmakers after the fact. And he said he was supportive of DEEP’s decision to allow for a regular review process before approving any new permits for the facility.
“The facility really, to put it politely, is in a state of disrepair,” Cervoni said. 
Country Holdings acquired the transfer station in 2019 from Covanta, which had previously operated a waste-to-energy incinerator on the property. At the time of the sale, daily operations at the transfer station were being contracted out to another company, Country Disposal Services, which had the necessary permits to operate the facility.
That arrangement continued for several years until disagreements between the two companies led Country Holdings to fire Country Disposal in early 2023. (Mazzarella said the two companies are not related, despite their similar names.)
In July of that year, DEEP issued notices of violations to both companies after determining that Country Holdings had continued to operate the facility without a valid permit. 
The notices also documented a number of problems at the site including an excessive buildup of trash, improper storage and a failure to inspect waste coming into the facility. In addition, as a result of “numerous” fires on the property, DEEP ordered an engineer to inspect the structural integrity of the buildings.
Those notices remain unresolved as of this week, the agency said. 
“The Department has concerns about the physical condition of the facility to accept solid waste,” DEEP’s Fowler said in a statement. “The facility has been prone to fires in the past, and is believed to be in poor physical condition, including gaps and voids in the walls and ceilings that expose solid waste to stormwater and vectors. … These violations must be addressed — through execution of a consent order or otherwise.  The Department has consistently encouraged the owners of the facility to address the open violations and seek a permit to operate through the Department’s standard process.”
The owner of Country Disposal, Michael Couden, declined to comment about his past involvement in the property on Tuesday.
Mazzarella, however, said that the issues largely stemmed from Country Disposal’s operation of the transfer station. After taking over the facility, he said Country Holdings notified DEEP about its problems and began working to clean up the site before being hit with violations.
“We were operating under the presumption that we were doing the right thing,” Mazzarella said. “It’s a Catch-22, that’s the whole issue in a nutshell.”
In response, Fowler said that notifying authorities of problems at the transfer station did not absolve the owners of their responsibilities. 
“As the property owner, Country Holdings is still subject to the laws and regulations governing the operation of the facility,” Fowler said. “Violations occurred on their property under its control, and Country Holdings operated the facility even though it did not hold the required permit to do so.”
Cervoni, the mayor, said he had spoken with the owners of Country Holdings about their plans for the site — which include the potential development of modern waste-to-energy technologies — and that he was “not unsympathetic” to their frustrations. Still, he said he wants to take more time to understand the company’s proposals and for officials to resolve any outstanding issues at the property.
“We could use the facility for disposal of our local waste, but at the same time the whole thing should occur through the normal process,” Cervoni said.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA  — A Leavenworth County District Court judge held off on a decision Monday on whether to lift a temporary restraining order he placed on CoreCivic last month, stopping the company from housing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees at its vacant Leavenworth prison.
Judge John Bryant said he would take CoreCivic’s motion to reconsider the temporary restraining order “under advisement.” He ordered the city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic to finalize the wording for the temporary restraining order.
Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager, said there were no rulings issued from the hearing, although the judge did hear arguments from both parties on whether or not to reconsider the temporary restraining order.
In a June hearing, Bryant placed a temporary restraining order on CoreCivic to keep the company from accepting ICE detainees until a case could be settled between the city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic. The parties are at odds over whether CoreCivic has to go through the city’s development process to receive a special use permit before reopening the prison, which was closed in 2021.CoreCivic has sought to reopen the facility as the Midwest Regional Reception Center. The company asked the judge to reconsider the temporary restraining order, revealing it had a contract with ICE that would pay $4.2 million per month to house immigrants in its vacant Leavenworth facility.

(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year.
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous changes made under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings.
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide (reduction in force) is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA.
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

(chuchart duangdaw / Getty Photos)Ahead of New Mexico’s next 60-day legislative session in 2027, the interim Tobacco Settlement Revenue Oversight Committee on Monday strategized about how to best approach raising taxes on electronic nicotine products.
While New Mexico law imposes a 25% tax on traditional tobacco products, the tax on e-cigarettes is half that: 12.5%.
For the last two years, New Mexico lawmakers have tried to amend the state Tobacco Control Act to say anything that is nicotine derived should be taxed like other nicotine products, American Heart Association lobbyist Mahesh Sita told the committee.
In the most recent legislative session, state Rep. Elizabeth “Liz” Thomson and Sen. Martin Hickey, both Albuquerque Democrats, carried a bill that would have raised taxes on all nicotine products to 40%.
The state Senate and the House Health and Human Services Committee passed the bill, but it did not receive a final vote in the House Taxation and Revenue Committee.
The 2026 legislative session, the last regular session under Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, is a short session, meaning lawmakers can only consider pieces of legislation approved by the governor on her “call,” or deemed “germane” to the state government budget.
“There is a new session coming up — it is a call session, so things may be more difficult — but we’re planning out for the following session,” Hickey said on Monday.
Thomson asked Sita and Linda Siegle, a lobbyist for the Cancer Action Network, about other states that have passed legislation for regulating not just existing nicotine products but also those that the industry may come up with in the future.
Thomson said the tobacco industry stays “miles, not just steps” ahead of lawmakers.
“By the time we get a bill done, with the language, they’ve left us in the dust,” she said.
Sita said the latest tobacco products are synthetic, so the tobacco industry argues they can’t be taxed as tobacco. However, Sita argued they should be, since they are derived from nicotine.
“Other states have done it, and the new products — the chews and the like — with a high content of nicotine, have very addictive properties,” Sita said.
Sita pointed to California and Massachusetts as examples, and said his organization has proposed a uniform taxing system on all nicotine products based on their wholesale value, comparable to the existing cigarette tax.
Officials from the New Mexico Department of Health Nicotine Use Prevention and Control program presented data to the committee showing that in 2023, more than a third of New Mexicans aged 18 to 29 years used some kind of nicotine product, while 22% of high school students and nearly 13% of middle school students used them.
Hickey said the greatest inhibitor to young people starting to use nicotine is cost, and Siegle said making e-cigarettes’ cost comparable to traditional tobacco is probably the best approach to curbing young people’s use.
“The e-cigarette market is rapidly evolving,” Siegle said. “Now there are all these other products out there, I don’t even know what we’re taxing on them — if we’re taxing them, because they’re not listed in our statute.”

Trump signed the bill on July 4. Every Republican member of Michigan’s U.S. House delegation voted to pass the legislation, which made it through the House 218-214.
That includes U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), who is running for governor.
“We’re cutting taxes on tips and overtime, protecting Social Security, rebuilding American manufacturing, and putting an end to handouts for illegal immigrants and able-bodied adults who won’t work,” James wrote in a statement shared on X. “This bill secures our border, strengthens our economy, and keeps our word to the American people.”
Two of James’ constituents, Warren residents Kyle Johnson and Taylor Johnson, participated in a virtual press conference for the Michigan Democratic Party on Tuesday.
Their six-year-old son, who they adopted when he was three weeks old, has Down syndrome.
While Taylor Johnson said he is an otherwise healthy six-year old, she added that “even the healthiest child with Down syndrome needs a lot more support than a child without Down syndrome.”
He has a heart defect, sleep apnea, takes a daily medication to manage his hypothyroidism, wears ankle braces and goes to speech therapy every week, “because school can’t do all of the therapies that are needed to support a child with a disability all the time.”
Most of that is covered by Medicaid, she said.
“George is having a healthy, happy childhood because his medical needs and because all of the things that he needs to thrive are so well supported,” Johnson said. “And that is not in spite of his disability. That is because of access to Medicaid and great quality health care.”
But she said while the full extent of how they will be affected by the law remains vague, some cuts – like what is deemed necessary to be covered by Medicaid – are already clear, and will affect things like their son’s speech therapy, which Hertel called “a basic tenant of quality of life.”
Taylor Johnson and Kyle Johnson visited Washington, DC, in May as guests of U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor). She says they visited James’ office, but only a staffer would meet with them.
“He looked at our six-year-old son and said we are in support of cutting waste, fraud and abuse,” Taylor Johnson said. “So we’re just here as parents to tell everybody that George is not waste, fraud and abuse. He’s a child. He’s an American. He’s trying to live a happy, healthy American childhood, and in order to do that, he needs extra support.”
Kyle Johnson added that James is “supposed to be our Congressman, but I don’t feel like he is. I feel like he’s the administration – he’s Trump’s Congressman. Because he’s made it very clear that he doesn’t actually want to serve the needs of his constituents like George. He wants to pander to and be a sycophant for the administration.”
He said it’s important for people to share the stories of how they will be impacted by the legislation so that people understand its implications.
“People like Congressman James don’t want you to hear these stories. They want the victims of their actions to remain nameless and storyless, because without the context of stories like George’s, it’s really easy to say things like ‘trimming the fat,’” Johnson said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-08-181325-1024x571.png,,,2025-07-08 19:09:35.964322

Caledonia County State’s Attorney Jessica Zaleski plans to resign as the county’s top prosecutor on July 25. 
The Caledonian Record first reported the decision last week. 
In an interview, Zaleski said the choice was sparked by a desire to move closer to her parents in North Dakota. She’s tapped Claire Burns, a deputy state’s attorney, to take over the office in an interim capacity. 
State’s attorneys in Vermont are elected every four years. Following a resignation, the local political party of the resigning prosecutor submits names to the governor for consideration. The governor then appoints a replacement — typically from the list of suggested candidates. 
Though she cited family reasons for her departure, Zaleski noted that “everything” about the job had changed during her tenure, making the work more challenging.

“The caseload, the volume of violent crime — particularly homicides — the inability to properly staff the office in a way that controls and manages the workload,” she said.
The judicial system would benefit from more staff in all roles, Zaleski said, including defense attorneys and judges.
Vermont’s stubborn court backlog, exacerbated during Covid-19, has been a constant focus for prosecutors, the defense bar and lawmakers in recent years. 
According to data from the Vermont Department of State’s Attorneys and Sheriffs, most prosecutors have more than 200 criminal cases on their docket. Since the end of 2023, the number of pending homicide dockets statewide has increased by about 30%, from 90 to 117, as of May. Zaleski’s office has prosecuted a number of high-profile shootings and homicides, including a case involving a 15-year-old charged with second-degree murder last year. 
Caledonia County has the second most severe case backlog in the state, according to state data, measured by the percent of pending cases older than the state’s disposition guidelines recommend.

Reflecting on the challenges she’s encountered on the job, Zaleski cited frustrations with Vermont’s juvenile justice system, particularly the lack of a secure detention facility for children and youth offenders. In the rural Northeast Kingdom, accessing resources — like mental health and substance use treatment — is a constant concern for community members, she said. 
Despite the job’s difficulties, the prosecutor said there was much to enjoy about her work. 
“The experience generally has been exhausting but incredibly fulfilling. I’m very proud of the work that we’ve done under incredible pressure and lack of resources,” she said. 
Zaleski is one of at least three prosecutors to leave office in the past year. Former Windham County State’s Attorney Tracy Kelly Shriver stepped down mid-term in July 2024. Last month, longtime Windham County Deputy State’s Attorney David Gartenstein retired.

Paul Cornelius, the DOC chief of staff, said in an email to the Iowa Capital Dispatch that the request for proposal, or RFP, is meant to “explore future options for health care delivery and to replace our current electronic health record system.”
“This is an exploratory step — no final decisions have been made, and no immediate changes are planned for staff or services,” Cornelius wrote. “The goal is to evaluate how we can best meet long-term health care needs while continuing to provide high-quality care.”
The RFP has not been posted publicly, but the department intends to look at private companies to provide health services in Iowa’s correctional facilities. According to reporting from the Gazette, an email sent from the DOC to its medical staff stated this change is a response to ongoing challenges with staff shortages, the rising costs of pharmaceutical drugs and transportation, and a need to expand the system’s mental health and substance abuse treatment capabilities.
The privatization of health care in Iowa’s prisons would hurt the care providers currently working for the DOC, Todd Copley, president of AFSCME Council 61, said.
“This is a slap in the face to the public employees who’ve kept Iowa’s correctional health system running through crisis after crisis,” Copley said. “Instead of investing in the frontline workers already doing the job, the state wants to hand it off to a private contractor. That’s not a solution, it’s a mistake.”
Under the proposal outlined in the email to staff, all health care workers in the DOC system would be employed by the company contracted to provide care should the department decide to award a contract. Copley said this is cause for concern because current DOC workers could see pay cuts if they are offered to keep their position, and because these health care professionals would no longer have access to Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS), the state’s public pension system, as they would no longer be public employees.
While labor advocates opposed contracting out health care work in state correctional facilities, AFSCME 61 stated in was supportive of another part of the plan — updating the DOC’s electronic health record system. While updates to the record system are “long overdue,” Copley opposed tying these upgrades to workforce changes, saying the move “risks disrupting care, weakening accountability, and undermining staffing.”
Instead of pursuing privatization, Copley called for the state leaders to use funds from the state’s budget reserves toward better pay for health care staff and system upgrades.
“The governor has bragged about a $1.8 billion surplus,” Copley said. “If that’s not enough to upgrade systems and pay a competitive wage to public healthcare workers, then what are we saving it for?”
While Iowa has built up a sizable surplus over several years, Republicans at the Iowa statehouse are planning to use those funds in part to finance the implementation of recent tax cuts. In the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers approved a $9.425 billion budget, spending more than the projected $8.5 billion in revenue for Fiscal Year 2026. This shortfall was made up for by drawing from the state reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and remaining balance from previous years.
Rep. Timi Brown-Powers, D-Waterloo, said the RFP to privatize health care in Iowa’s correctional facilities is due to Republicans’ budgeting decisions, saying the move would be a “costly mistake.”
“We shouldn’t be surprised that Republican leaders are once again making Iowa workers pay the price for their poor budgeting decisions by privatizing healthcare at the Iowa Department of Corrections,” Brown-Powers said. “It’s part of a disturbing pattern of short-sighted choices as Republican lawmakers continue to ruin the state’s finances and spend more than available revenue, which hurts working families and costs the state more in the long run.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/health-care-stethoscope-cash-_-Getty-RF-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sentenced four foreign nationals, two of whom admitted to illegal reentry and two for possession of fraudulent immigration documents, to time served in prison and remanded them to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, according to the Montana U.S. Attorney’s office.
U.S. District Judge Brian M. Molloy presided over all four cases.
Two Mexican citizens, Francisco Alcocer-Sanchez, 62, and Luis Alberto Vega-Lili, 57, pleaded guilty in May 2025 to single counts of use or possession of fraudulent immigration documents.
According to press releases from the U.S. Attorney’s office, law enforcement made contact with Vega-Lili on a train in Havre in March.
The government alleged in court documents that when Vega-Lili spoke to Border Patrol agents, he acknowledged his Mexican citizenship and that he did not have immigration paperwork to enter or remain in the United States. He provided a Mexican passport issued in North Carolina.
Further investigation by law enforcement found that in 2008, Vega-Lili submitted an incomplete application for naturalization because he was married to a U.S. citizen, but she since passed away, per the U.S. Attorney’s office.
The government further alleged that during a security search of Vega-Lili’s cell, agents found a fraudulent Social Security card and fraudulent permanent resident card in the sole of his boot containing information belonging to a person from India, born in 1973 and living in Texas.
In the other case, court documents say that law enforcement agents arrested Acocer-Sanchez on Feb. 28, in Fairview, Montana/McKenzie County, North Dakota during a DUI stop. Alcocer-Sanchez provided an expired licensed permanent resident card with his picture, but another name and alien number. Law enforcement noticed the card was missing security features and the next day verified his true identity and a prior removal from the United States. He later acknowledged his Mexican citizenship and and illegal status in America.
According to the U.S. Attorney’s office, Alcocer-Sanchez’s immigration history shows he was granted status as a lawful permanent resident on Feb. 12, 1991, but that status was revoked on June 25, 1998, following his conviction for importing cocaine, an aggravated felony. There is no record he applied for readmission into the United States.
The two men were sentenced to time served of 121 and 131 days in prison, respectively, and remanded to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol upon release, according to U.S. Attorney Kurt Alme.
 Illegal reentry 

In two additional Monday press releases, Alme said that two foreign nationals had been sentenced to time served for illegal reentry and also remanded to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.
A Mexican citizen, Jose Luz Rojas-Flores, 35, and a Honduran citizen, Enys Jose Rosales-Lara, 39, each pleaded guilty in May to one count of illegal reentry.
According to court documents, Rojas-Flores was removed from the United States in 2012, again in 2013 after serving a 30-day sentence for illegal reentry, and again in 2015 after serving a 60-day sentence.
The press release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office said that in April 2025, the Havre Police Department encountered five individuals during a traffic stop, none of whom spoke English and all of which had Mexican identification documents. Rojas-Flores had no documents permitting him to enter or remain in the U.S., and he later admitted to crossing into the country near El Paso, Texas, in 2020.
According to Alme, also in April, law enforcement conducting a traffic stop in Havre found Rosales-Lara, who possessed a Honduran Identification Card but no additional documents. He admitted to entering the U.S. in late 2023 near El Paso, Texas, and that he had no lawful right to remain in the United States.
The two men were sentenced to time served of 73 and 74 days, respectively, according to Alme.
The two cases were part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that mandates the Department of Justice to “repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations, and protect our communities from the perpetrators violent crime.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/borderpatrolcar-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Every dollar the Oklahoma Legislature invests in the state’s public higher education system produces over $17 in economic output, a new study found. 
Oklahoma public higher education supported over 111,000 jobs either directly or indirectly and  produced over $460 million in tax revenue at state, county and local levels, according to the study published by the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education. The regents contracted with the University of Cincinnati Economics Center to conduct the study. 
“The state regents and our public colleges and universities remain focused on producing successful graduates that fulfill Oklahoma’s evolving workforce needs,” said Regent Dennis Casey in a statement. “The $14.61 billion total economic impact of our state system clearly shows that public higher education is integral to Oklahoma’s continued economic growth.”
Over the past decade, the number of Oklahomans over 25 with an associate degree or higher grew more than 5%. 
Median annual earnings also increased with degree level earned. In 2023, people with less than a high school diploma had a median annual earning of $30,185. Those with a bachelor’s degree earned a median $57,336, while a graduate or professional degree earned $71,642. 
Almost 94% of resident undergraduate students were employed in Oklahoma one year after graduation. Over 61% of non-resident graduates stayed in Oklahoma and entered the Oklahoma workforce. 
“Oklahoma’s public institutions play a crucial role in shaping the workforce, driving innovation, and advancing economic development,” said Chancellor Sean Burrage. “Our Blueprint 2030 strategic plan prioritizes aligning academic programs to meet employment needs, with the goal to produce more educators, engineers, computer scientists, and nurses.”
Blueprint 2030 is the strategic plan by the regents to produce workforce-ready graduates, focus on student success and improve system efficiency and effectiveness.
Every dollar invested in the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship program generates $5.88 in economic output, according to the study. Oklahoma’s Promise offers qualified Oklahoma students an opportunity to earn a scholarship for college tuition. 
One year after graduation, over 94% of Oklahoma’s Promise graduates were employed in the state and after five years that number was 86%. 
Graduates of Oklahoma’s Promise earned over $197 million in wages in 2023, compared to the $171 million in wages earned by graduates who didn’t go through the program.
The last economic impact study was released in 2019 using 2016 data. A spokesperson for the state regents said studies like this are generally conducted every five to 10 years because of the time required for data collection and analysis.

Missy Irvin of Mountain View said during a Game and Fish/State Police Subcommittee meeting on July 8, 2025 that she wanted to have more conversations about emergency preparedness in Arkansas after devastating flash floods in Texas killed over 100 people last week. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas lawmaker said Tuesday that she wants a legislative subcommittee to focus on emergency preparedness for flooding in light of the disastrous flooding in Texas that had killed at least 109 people as of Tuesday afternoon.
Such a discussion is “really critical at this time,” Sen. Missy Irving, R-Mountain View, said during a meeting of the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Game and Fish/State Police subcommittee.
Flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Texas occurred last weekend in an area popular with campers. Camp Mystic, which serves young girls, saw more than two dozen of its campers and counselors killed in the disaster, along with its longtime director and co-owner, CBS reported. 
The river rose rapidly early Friday morning after a storm system parked itself over the region, dumping heavy rain. The river rose over 25 feet in two hours, according to a stream gauge close to Camp Mystic. 
Irvin, co-chair of the Arkansas subcommittee, said she knew the Texas floods were on the minds of many legislators, especially given the Camp Albert Pike flood that killed 20 people in Arkansas 15 years ago.
“In future meetings I really want to focus on emergency communication, the lack of cell phone coverage in many areas of the state of Arkansas, and really work with our federal delegation, with our FCC [Federal Communications Commission] commissioner — bringing those people in and seeing what we can do to really push the ball forward to make sure that we have good warnings in place,” Irvin said. 
County government is also an important piece of the warning and response puzzle that must be accounted for, Irvin said.
Mike Hagar, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, which oversees both the Arkansas State Police and the Division of Emergency Management, said his department was looking into what it could do “more proactively” on emergency preparedness in conjunction with the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism.
“Unfortunately, the world that we live in and the arena that we all work under — we typically are more reactive, after-the-fact. We’re reactive; once the disaster happens, that’s when we assign resources to come in and try to mitigate that disaster as much as possible,” Hagar said. “Obviously, we need to do better. They say if it’s predictable, it’s preventable.”

(Courtesy of Centers for Control and Prevention) New Mexico health and veterinary officials urged the public to prevent mosquito breeding and protect against bites after officials detected the West Nile virus in insect populations in Bernalillo County last week.
Mosquitos, which require blood for their breeding cycle, spread West Nile virus by biting infected birds and then biting humans or horses—mostly in the summer. No vaccines exist for people, nor do specific treatments for the infection.
No West Nile cases in humans have emerged so far, New Mexico State Public Health Veterinarian Erin Phipps told Source NM.
“We typically start to see cases in July and August,” she said. “We have not yet seen a case this year, but that’s not unusual. It’s a little too early to stay if that portends a more mild season.”
New Mexico has had more than 500 recorded cases of West Nile since 2005, and at least one death recorded in all but two of the years. New Mexico’s most severe year occurred in 2023, with 80 recorded cases and eight deaths. While multiple species of mosquito can spread the disease, the Culex family of mosquito, which can live anywhere in the state, is the main culprit.
The majority of people who experience the infection have no symptoms, while about 10% to 20% of people experience fevers, muscle aches or headaches.
“Those are often undiagnosed because they mimic any other common illness,” Phipps said.
Only about 1% of the cases progress to a more severe stage, called a neurologic infection, Phipps said, which causes seizures, disorientation and profound weakness, potentially leading to permanent disability or even death.
“While it’s relatively rare, it’s very serious so we encourage everyone to take the prevention measures that they’re able to to decrease their risk of infection,” Phipps said.
An approved vaccine does exist for horses, which can also suffer brain swelling or other complications from contracting the disease. The New Mexico Department of Agriculture reported 19 cases of West Nile in horses in 2023, resulting in six fatalities.
“Vaccinating horses against West Nile virus is one of the most effective steps owners can take to protect their animals during mosquito season,” New Mexico State Veterinarian Dr. Samantha Holeck said in a statement. “Prevention through vaccination is far safer – and often less costly – than trying to treat the horse after infection.”
New Mexico state law delegates mosquito control to municipal and county officials, but Phipps said residents can take some additional measures to minimize bites and breeding spaces for the insects. Those include wearing loose-fitting clothing, using insect repellents and avoiding being outside at dusk and dawn.
Mosquitos can lay eggs in very small bodies of standing water — think the amount in a bottle cap — and larvae can transform into adults in as soon as a week. Phipps encouraged changing standing water at least every week, and removing any debris that could collect water.
“Now is the perfect time to start thinking about West Nile, because prevention is key,” Phipps said.

Ian Masters, R-Berkeley.","Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, sits in a meeting of the House Public Heath subcommittee on March 5, 2025 in Charleston, W.Va. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Several clergy leaders in Monongalia County are calling on House Speaker Roger Hanshaw to “conduct a full investigation” into how an antisemitic comment was made by a personal Instagram account belonging to Del. Ian Masters, R-Berkeley.
In addition to the comment — which Masters has denied making — the clergy leaders are also asking Hanshaw, R-Clay, to look into the account’s profile picture, which features symbols associated with neo-Nazi and white supremacist beliefs.
“As clergy, we condemn antisemitism in the strongest terms possible,” the letter reads. “… Jewish people have been the subject of horrific violence and oppression by governmental actors over the centuries, including in the United States. Whether Delegate Masters is indeed the one who made these comments deserves thorough scrutiny.”
The clergymembers who signed onto the letter include: Rabbi Joseph Hample, Tree of Life Congregation; Rev. Jenny Williams, United Methodist; Rev. Zac Morton, First Presbyterian Church; Pastor Stephen Prince, United Methodist; Rev. Stephen Lowe, Morgantown Church of the Brethren — Mennonite and Pastor Teresa Prince, United Methodist.
The comment the clergymembers are referring to was left on June 21 by an account with the handle @NoQuarterMasters in response to another comment on a post from April 12 about Dave Portnoy, founder of Barstool Sports. Masters has denied making the comment since West Virginia Watch first reported the story on June 24. At that time, he said he didn’t have “any active Instagram” account and didn’t acknowledge any affiliation with the handle @NoQuarterMasters.
When the comment was made, the account still used Masters’ full name and was previously tagged and featured in photos of Masters posted by other public Instagram pages.
On June 27, House Majority Leader Pat McGeehan issued a news release saying he obtained “definitive proof” showing Masters did not make the comment. He did not release the proof upon request. 
In their letter to Hanshaw on Tuesday, the Monongalia County clergymembers said the release from McGeehan “evoked antisemitic tropes” as the Majority Leader specifically called out Del. Mike Pushkin, D-Kanawha, and Del. Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia — the only two Jewish members of the state Legislature. 
After the two asked for an investigation into Masters’ social media and his resignation if the allegations were true, McGeehan said they were “not interested in the truth” and were making “deceptive accusations” because they “desire power and social status at the expense of others.”
“There is a long and terrible history of painting Jewish people as deceptive, power-hungry sub-humans who use trickery to advance their agendas,” the clergymembers wrote. “These stereotypes have been used again and again to justify some of the worst atrocities in human history.” 
Last week, McGeehan and Masters gave separate interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively to WRNR TV regarding the comment and the allegations against Masters. WRNR is owned by another member of the House Republican caucus, Del. Mike Hornby, R-Berkeley, according to the Secretary of State.
McGeehan said he personally investigated the incident and found the person responsible: A “basically homeless” man with an unnamed illness and substance use disorder who was “probably going to eventually die in the near future.” 
Masters, McGeehan said, gave the man his old inactive iPhone in 2024 but left his social media accounts — including Instagram — logged in. The man used Masters’ account, McGeehan said, to leave the comment.
In his interview the next day, Masters reiterated McGeehan’s explanation, though in less crass terms. The man, he said, was a friend of his late brothers and he wanted to help him while he was struggling. His name has not been released. 
The profile picture on the page showing symbols burnt into wooden pendants, Masters said, was his and was a “memorial” to his late brother, who loved Norse mythology. The symbols shown included several classified by the Anti-Defamation League as being affiliated with antisemitic beliefs, including the Wolfsangel, which was was appropriated by Nazi Germany as the divisional insignia for several Waffen-SS units and is currently used in the logo for the Aryan Nations in the U.S. and Europe.
Outside of McGeehan, leaders for the West Virginia House Republicans have not commented on the allegations against Masters. The state Democratic Party — led by Pushkin — has requested a “legitimate” investigation into the matter. 
McGeehan said last week that the matter was settled due to his investigation. 
“This is over as far as I’m concerned,” McGeehan said. “… There’s a lot of things that would go into [an official investigation] and I’m not going to have some sort of witch hunt. I’ve done due diligence.”
In their letter to Hanshaw, the clergymembers from Monongalia County said McGeehan has “waived off the scandal” and that his own investigation is not an appropriate conclusion given the allegations at hand.
“McGeehan stated publicly that he has looked into the matter and that he will not further pursue what he is alleging has taken place: the federal crime of impersonating a lawmaker. He has also stated that he is a longtime friend of Delegate Masters,” the clergymembers wrote. “For these reasons we believe he is unable to impartially and fully investigate the matter. We are calling upon [Hanshaw] to initiate a full, impartial investigation to right the prejudiced wrongs being perpetuated by members of the House.”",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ian-Masters-20250305.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo MDT)The only public rest area along a nearly 100-mile stretch of the heavily traveled Interstate 90 between Billings and the Wyoming border has reopened after more than a year of closure.
The rest stop, located between the town of Hardin and Billings, is the latest in a series of state construction projects looking to rehabilitate rest stops throughout the state. 
In Hardin, crews improved the experience of taking a break along the side of a highway. There’s more parking space — 30 truck stalls and 22 vehicle stalls at the Westbound site, and 28 truck and 21 vehicle spaces at the Eastbound site — and buildings are now more energy efficient and ADA accessible, too. MDT also added fenced off pet areas, ADA-accessible picnic areas with shelters, and new waters supply and wastewater treatment facilities.
“Rest areas are essential for highway safety, offering drivers a safe and convenient place to stop, which helps reduce the risk of fatigue-related crashes,” Mike Taylor, MDT Billings District Administrator said in a press release. “With increasing travel across the region, it is important that these facilities are designed to accommodate growing demand and ensure accessibility for all. We are proud to open this new facility.”
As part of the facility expansion, Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks got an updated Watercraft Inspection Site, and an MDT Weigh Station was added.
“We are excited to complete this important restoration project,” Nolan Smith, a construction manager for Dick Anderson Construction said in a release. “Our team worked hard to ensure the upgraded facilities not only meet the needs of today’s travelers but will accommodate future visitors for years to come.”
In recent years, the state also completed projects at Quartz Creek and converted the Gold Creek rest area, both along I-90, near Garrison into a facility geared toward large truck parking. Three other facilities have been rebuilt by CDM Smith — I-90 rest areas near Columbus and Hysham as well as one along I-15 near Divide between 2015-18, costing a little more than $19 million in total. A new rest area was also built along I-90 near Three Forks, closing one nearer to Bozeman.
Much of the work stems back to complaints in the 1990s about rest stops throughout Montana. One of those was safety, and the Hardin project added additional lighting as well as video surveillance.
In 2009, major changes in the state’s rest area program were initiated when it received dedicated funding and a more formalized process for prioritization of projects. Five years later, the 2014 Rest Area Plan was finalized and remains the guidebook for those projects within the state. It was amended in 2019 to add data and projections, Charity Burns, a MDT spokesperson, wrote in an email. 
Two of the 69 rest stops in Montana remain closed, Bad Route near Glendive as well as the westbound Dena Mora (Lookout Pass) rest area on I-90. The Glendive rest area could be open by late fall, Burns added.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/HardinRestArea.png,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

Green International Airport is officially the best airport in the United States, Travel + Leisure, the New York-based travel magazine declared Tuesday.
T.F. Green received a score of 84.9 in the annual competition based on reader surveys evaluating airport accessibility, check-in and security processes, restaurants and bars, overall design, and shopping. Last year, the Warwick airport ranked second in the nation with a score of 82.31 — .01 points behind Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
The Twin Cities airport has now dropped to fourth place. In second place for 2025 is Portland International Airport in Oregon, which achieved a score of 82.44.
No other New England airports cracked the top 10 T.F. Green’s honor will appear in the August 2025 issue of Travel + Leisure, along with being featured online as part of the magazine’s annual World’s Best Awards. 
“To be named the No. 1 domestic airport by some of the most seasoned travelers in the world is both humbling and inspiring,” Iftikhar Ahmad, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation, said in a statement. “We’re proud to be Rhode Island’s gateway to the world and the fastest growing airport in the country.”

Voters praised T.F. Green for its size and quick check-in time. Many readers said they travel farther in order to fly out of T.F. Green to avoid the more congested big city airports, according to Travel + Leisure.
In last year’s second-place ranking, the magazine took note of “an extraordinary number of comments about the bathrooms.” In 2023, the airport completed renovations in the men’s and women’s restrooms, which now have marble floors and fresh flowers in vases.
The best airport award adds another feather in T.F. Green’s cap as it works to stand out from competitors like Logan International Airport in Boston or Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The Warwick airport will also remain the official hub of the New England Patriots for another three years.
Gov. Dan McKee called the honor not just an “incredible” designation for the airport, but the entire state of Rhode Island.
“The airport’s commitment to reliable, smooth, and convenient travel has paid off for countless passengers each year, getting them where they need to go when they need to be there,” McKee said in a statement. “I look forward to the new heights PVD is soaring towards, and what it brings to our economy, tourism, and business landscape.”

Registered nurse Amanda Manatt, 36, of Marshalltown, was recently charged by the Iowa Board of Nursing with misappropriating patient medications, falsifying records, committing an act that might adversely affect a patient, and being convicted of an offense that directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the nursing profession.
The board alleged that in December 2023, Manatt diverted an unspecified number of doses of controlled substances from a hospital’s supply and “took them for her own personal use.” In addition, she was accused of falsely documenting that the patients had actually received the drugs, which they had not.

Court records show that in 2024, Manatt was criminally charged with 10 felony counts of prohibited acts involving controlled substances, one felony count of insurance fraud, and one misdemeanor count of tampering with records.
State prosecutors alleged that while working at UnityPoint Health-Marshalltown Hospital, Manatt repeatedly withdrew painkilling drugs such as morphine, fentanyl and hydromorphone, claimed to have administered them to her patients, and then kept the drugs.
In one instance, a 22-month-old child identified as “E.M.” allegedly came to the Marshalltown Hospital emergency room in November 2023 after being attacked by a dog that prosecutors said “badly mauled” the child’s legs.
“E.M. was crying out in pain and Manatt was supposed to administer pain narcotics,” prosecutors alleged in charging documents. “Instead of administering the pain narcotics to E.M., Manatt diverted the pain narcotics and kept them for herself.”
Prosecutors also alleged that in December 2023, while Manatt was again working in the Marshalltown Hospital’s emergency room, a patient arrived with head and ankle injuries sustained during a fall down a flight of stairs. Manatt allegedly kept some of that patient’s fentanyl for her own use, according to prosecutors.
In March 2024, while Manatt was working at Mary Greeley Medical Center in Story County, prosecutors alleged, she stole hydromorphone intended for an emergency-room patient who was being treated for post-operative pain related to the fusion of spinal vertebrae.
In October 2024, all of the state charges against Manatt were dismissed with Assistant Marshall County Attorney Brianna Nelson informing the court that Manatt was then facing newly filed federal charges related to the same conduct.
Court records show the federal charges included eight counts of acquiring controlled substances through fraud or deceit while working at the Marshalltown hospital, plus four counts of acquiring controlled substances through fraud or deceit while working at the Story County hospital, and one count of one count of false statements related to health care matters.
In March 2025, federal prosecutors agreed to dismiss 10 of the 13 charges in return for Manatt’s agreement to plead guilty to two counts of acquiring controlled substances through fraud or deceit and one count of making false statements related to health care matters.
She is currently scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 14, 2025.
Other nursing board actions
In separate, unrelated disciplinary cases, two other Iowa nurses agreed recently to surrender their licenses:
— Registered Nurse Jennifer Kinson, 46, who was alleged to have stolen intravenous morphine from an unspecified patient or agency.  The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals, and Licensure investigated the allegation and concluded the allegation was founded, the board alleges.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Kinson agreed not to contest the charges and agreed to surrender her license.
The board has not disclosed where Kinson lives, where the alleged theft took place, when it occurred, the manner in which the drugs were taken, or whether any patients were harmed.
However, court records show that in May 2023, Kinson was criminally charged with prohibited acts involving controlled substances and tampering with records. She was accused of diverting medications from at least 10 patients at an Iowa Select Specialty Hospital campus in Wright County.
In November 2023, county prosecutors agreed to a deferred prosecution that resulted in the criminal charges being dismissed due to Kinson pleading guilty to other charges in another county.
The other charges appear tied to a February 2024 case in which police met with administrators at Veterans Memorial Hospital in Waukon to review video evidence that suggested Kinson, a former nurse at the hospital, had stolen morphine from patients. Kinson was then charged with illegal possession of a controlled substance. She later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of misdemeanor fifth-degree theft and was fined $105.
— Licensed Practical Nurse Julie Porter, who was first licensed in 1989. Board records show that in 1993, while living in Waverly and known as Julie Wefel, Porter was charged by the board with willful or repeated departure from the minimum standards of nursing.
The board alleged she was employed at a long-term care facility from 1991 through 1992, when she failed to respond to reports from two certified nursing assistants that a patient was experiencing chest pain. The patient died during that shift, the board alleged, and Porter was fired a week later.
The board also stated in December 1991 and February 1992, Porter received five separate five-day suspensions at work for excessive absenteeism, falsely documenting treatments which had not actually been completed, and not reporting for work as scheduled.
As a result of the allegations, Porter’s license was placed on probation for two years.
Recently, the board charged Porter with failing to assess or evaluate the status of a patient and with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient. The board alleged that in August 2023, after working an overnight shift at an unspecified facility, Porter falsely documented completing a patient assessment.
“When confronted with video footage showing she was at the nurses’ station at the time she reported performing the assessment, (Porter) admitted she did not perform the reported assessment,” the board alleges.
The available board documents give no indication as to the patient outcome in the 2023 case.,
Porter recently agreed to voluntarily surrender her license.

The township paid for the concert with national opioid settlement funds. (Photo courtesy of Irvington Township)Irvington officials took $632,000 in funds meant to help people struggling with addiction and spent it instead on two “opioid awareness” concerts, steering the bulk of the money to a township employee who’s a DJ, a state watchdog said in a new report released Tuesday.
The township blew more than $14,000 on popcorn, cotton candy carts, shaved ice, and other food, almost $13,000 on luxury VIP trailers for performers, and more than $205,000 to promote the summer concerts, which were held in 2023 and 2024, investigators from the state comptroller’s office found.
“These funds are supposed to be lifelines for communities overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic — not a slush fund to host concerts and throw parties,” acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh said in a statement. “Irvington wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars that should have been used to save lives and help people recover from addiction.”
Irvington Mayor Tony Vauss denied the report’s findings, released a 36-page response, and vowed to proceed with a defamation lawsuit officials filed against Walsh’s office in April.
“We’ve been definitely going back and forth with the comptroller’s office over these issues for a while now, and we actually had to file a lawsuit because we totally, totally disagree with what they’re saying,” Vauss told the New Jersey Monitor. “I mean, there’s no basis in law. They’re coming up with theories. We’re just like, how are you coming to these conclusions?”
The $632,000 was part of more than $1 million Irvington has received in national opioid settlement funds, which pharmaceutical companies are paying to atone for their role in the deadly opioid crisis.
Towns and counties across New Jersey, as well as the state itself, are expected to receive more than $1.1 billion by 2038 and began receiving the funds in 2022. But a state council tasked with advising public officials on the best use of the funds didn’t issue guidance until last month.
That’s one reason why Walsh’s scrutiny isn’t fair, said attorney Christopher Kinum, who represents Irvington.
“Every municipality is using the funds for a different reason. These funds were disbursed before there was guidance. All there was, was some term — ‘evidence-based.’ ‘Proven evidence-based methods to combat the opioid crisis,’” Kinum said.
Irvington officials have been fighting the comptroller’s probe for months, asking courts to block the office from releasing its findings. Lower courts initially sided with Irvington, forbidding the office from releasing its report and even extending that injunction to Gov. Phil Murphy, Senate President Nicholas Scutari, and Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, who received early copies for review. 
But an appellate judge last month ordered the injunction lifted, saying Irvington had a chance to respond to a draft report and the issue was moot anyway because the report was already partially released. He stayed the report’s release until the state Supreme Court decided whether to hear Irvington’s appeal.
That court on Tuesday declined to hear the case, clearing the way for Walsh to release his report — which his office did, within minutes.
The report is blistering, blasting township officials for deciding to hold the concerts with no input from community groups, residents on the frontlines of the opioid crisis, or even the township’s own health and public safety officials.

Entertainment companies tied to Antoine “DJ Qua” Richardson, a township employee, received $368,500 to secure performers, with officials failing to seek competitive bids in violation of procurement law, investigators said. Officials spent no money on Narcan, although they said they did distribute doses of the overdose-reversing drug at both concerts. Most concert materials promoted the performers, the mayor, and the concerts, rather than educating residents about addiction or offering information about treatment, according to the report.
Officials failed to track metrics to evaluate the concerts’ success, as required by the settlement agreements, and yet proceeded with a second concert anyway against the advice of the comptroller’s office, the report says.
Walsh’s office made 28 recommendations, including urging the state Department of Human Services to bolster oversight and issue detailed guidance to local public officials on acceptable use of opioid settlement funds. The office also referred their findings to various agencies for further action.
“Local governments are asking for direction, and DHS is the agency with that expertise,” Walsh said. “A passive approach by state government risks setting local governments up to fail and may invite more waste.”
Irvington did not hold an opioid awareness concert this year, but Kinum said the concerts are not off the table in the future. The township still has close to a half million dollars in unspent opioid settlement funds.
“We are exploring it,” Kinum said. “This is an evidence-based proper use of funds. We’ll take a look at it, and we potentially want to bounce ideas off that board (the state advisory council).”
Kinum cited an April letter a Rutgers Health manager sent Irvington expressing support for their concerts and the concerts’ role in emphasizing “cultural competence and community engagement.”
But opioid-awareness concerts are not something the New Jersey Harm Reduction Council recommends.
Jenna Mellor heads that council and also sits on the state advisory council that issued June’s guidance.

That guidance was shaped by 15 months of data research and input from experts and residents who have firsthand experience with addiction, Mellor noted. The council’s five-year strategic plan prioritizes expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, harm reduction supplies and services, and wraparound supports, including affordable housing and legal aid.
“Public education is good. Reducing stigma is good. No one is disputing that. But it’s not what turns the tide on any of this,” Mellor told the New Jersey Monitor.
“These are precious dollars,” she added. “We are facing federal budget cuts. We are always in a struggle to have a state budget every year that meets the basic needs of residents. Our recommendations are really what is smart use of this money, because they immediately, in real time, save people’s lives.”
Mellor and other members of the state advisory council were fighting their own battle Tuesday.
They sent an open letter to Murphy and legislative leaders, calling on lawmakers to return $45 million they diverted in opioid settlement funds (the money is going to four hospitals to offset federal Medicaid cuts). At least two of the hospitals are led by Murphy allies.
Harm reduction advocates protested and held a die-in in the Statehouse in Trenton last week, in an effort to persuade legislators to reject the diversion. Lawmakers approved the budget anyway.
In Tuesday’s letter, six members of the 11-member council urged lawmakers to “reverse the raid of opioid settlement funds” and establish “lockbox protections” around how the funds can be used.
“We are deeply alarmed by this decision and what it means for the future of New Jersey’s overdose prevention efforts,” they wrote. “Raiding the opioid settlement fund completely undermines the role of our Council, which exists to ensure these funds are used for overdose prevention initiatives that are effective, evidence-based, and rooted in community need.”
Elected officials should consider their legacy and their accountability to their constituents in deciding whether to heed the council’s call to reverse the cuts, Mellor added.
“My dad says it’s OK to be wrong, but don’t be wrong long,” Mellor said. “There’s part of leadership that requires finding solutions and not accepting the status quo. If our lawmakers wanted to fix this, they can. I’m hopeful that they will do the right thing.”

Residents in King, Spokane and Clark counties can now report hate crimes and bias incidents to the non-emergency hotline at 1-855-225-1010 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. This pilot will last 18 months, before Washington expands the hotline statewide in January 2027.
Staff can help callers find support services or assist in reporting incidents to local police. Anyone in the three counties can also report online. If experiencing an active emergency, residents should call 911, not the new hotline.
“Hate crimes not only directly harm individuals but also can instill harm throughout the community,” state Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement. 
The Legislature created the hotline last year, with mostly Democratic support. 
Oregon established a similar hotline in 2020, and has seen reports steadily rising since then, from about 1,100 in 2020 to more than 5,800 last year. But spam and harassment calls are driving much of that increase, a new report found this month. At the same time, reported incidents declined slightly last year, which officials attributed to waning confidence in the program.
Oregon’s attorney general called the developments a “a sobering gut check and a call to action.”
California’s hotline, implemented in 2023, saw about 1,000 hateful acts reported in the first year.
Most years, Washington sees 500 to 600 hate crime incidents reported to police, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs. This places Washington consistently in the top five states with the most reports. Hate crimes can be based on race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or disability, among other protected classes.
For decades, the state’s hate crime statute called such actions “malicious harassment.” But in 2019, amid the rise in these crimes, lawmakers changed the term to the more commonly used “hate crime offense.”
“We took an important step in 2019 by changing our hate crime laws — but the rise in hate and bias incidents shows there’s still more to do,” said Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, who sponsored last year’s bill creating the hotline. “That’s why this hotline matters. It’s not just about policy — it’s about people. It’s about making sure every victim is heard and supported.”
Since 2019, legislators have made more changes to the hate crime statute, such as specifying the charge as a “crime against persons,” which makes perpetrators subject to supervised release after finishing their sentence. They also removed the requirement for “physical injury” to meet the hate crime threshold. And they took out from the law the term “swastika” in recognition of religious communities that use the symbol Nazis appropriated.
Lawmakers also added property damage as a possible basis for a hate crime.
And later this month, another law, passed this year, will take effect to clarify that bias need not be the only motivation to commit a hate crime. 
Unlike hate crimes, “bias incidents” don’t rise to the level of a crime. Examples of such conduct include insulting language based on someone’s gender, mocking someone with a disability or creating racist drawings.
“When immigrant families in my network face verbal harassment that makes them afraid to send their children to school,” Catalina Velasquez, executive director of the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, said in a statement. “When transgender people of color experience daily microaggressions that chip away at their humanity, when our elders are told to ‘go back where they came from’ — these are acts of violence that shape our material conditions and our ability to exist safely in the world.”
Washington’s state Republican Party called the new hotline a “snitch line” that would be “weaponized against those with viewpoint diversity.”
Beginning in July 2027, the attorney general’s office will publish annual reports on calls the hotline receives.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/person-with-cellphone-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

These include proposals to establish a climate superfund, repeal the state’s 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases that is currently tied up in court and establish a comprehensive data privacy law. 
Legislation that would prohibit local police from entering into contracts with federal immigration enforcement authorities will also be picked back up next year, as well as an omnibus tribal sovereignty bill. 
On the final day before lawmakers adjourned this year, legislators passed a joint order listing the proposals that will be revisited when the Legislature reconvenes in January. They will resume work on the bills based on where they left off when the session adjourned last month. 
While some of the bills had yet to make it out of committee, others received initial chamber votes but not enough to determine the final outcome. The 193 carry over bills compiled by Maine Morning Star don’t include those that were left on the special appropriations and study tables, which will also be carried over, as well as any bills otherwise left in the possession of the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee. 
Though there were no formal limitations as to the types of bills that could be introduced in the first regular session, the second session is limited to budgetary matters, legislation from the governor, as well as proposals considered emergency in nature by the Legislative Council, which is composed of the ten elected members of legislative leadership.
Often, committees will carry over legislation from the first session as a way to act on legislation that couldn’t be introduced in the second session. Lawmakers may also determine that a proposal needs more time to be workshopped or may depend on external factors with longer timelines than the first session allows, such as a court case.

Ned Lamont and New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, both exploring runs in 2026, agreed they have similar ideas on local control over zoning.","The mood was congenial as politicians joked and laughed at a Tuesday celebration of the opening of a 154-unit affordable housing complex in New Britain.
Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat weighing a run for a third term, joked about the ease of building housing in Houston, which doesn’t have zoning. He spoke alongside Republican New Britain Mayor Erin Stewart, who has created an exploratory committee for a gubernatorial campaign, at the ribbon cutting of the building, which was funded through nearly $8 million in state grants.
Their easy banter and public comments Tuesday gave a potential preview of one issue that is unlikely to be a topic of heated debate between the two should they find themselves going up against one another in a 2026 gubernatorial race — housing policy.
Both politicians, who easily won the New Britain vote in their last elections, agreed their ideas on housing are similar, with a focus on local control.
“This is great for my neighborhood,” Stewart said, gesturing at the former homewares manufacturing factory behind her, which is now home mostly to families earning between $30,000 and $80,000 annually. “This is not good for a bedroom community that is home to two-acre properties and white picket fences. I think that’s what the argument is all about. When it comes to policy, you don’t want to take away local control from the people that live in those communities.” 
Lamont has long adopted a more moderate stance on housing policy and spoken in favor of local control. He said he and Stewart have similar ideas on the issue.
“When it comes to transit-oriented we’ve been here,” Lamont said, of New Britain. “You have the FasTrak. We’ve done a lot of housing together along that [route].”
During Stewart’s tenure, New Britain has focused on building more housing and shops near its bus stations.
Lamont last month caused a political stir when he vetoed Democratic lawmakers’ housing omnibus bill, House Bill 5002. The sweeping measure would have required towns to plan and zone for a set number of units, removed some off-street parking mandates for smaller housing developments and prioritized state funding for towns that develop more housing near public transit, among other things.
Although the governor’s staff had negotiated the bill and previously indicated he would sign it, after pushback from local groups, Lamont sided with Republicans and vetoed the bill. 
After the veto, another potential Republican opponent, Westport First Selectwoman Jen Tooker, who has already announced her candidacy for governor, said in a statement that Lamont’s veto was “a victory, for sure,” and criticized the proposal for diluting local control. 
Lamont’s office is now in negotiations with lawmakers and plans to call a special session to vote on a reworked bill.
Stewart said she was among the local officials who reached out to Lamont to ask him to veto the bill.
“You have a lot of legislators who come up with great ideas for what may work for them in their communities, but it just doesn’t work in other communities across the state,” Stewart said. “And you know, Connecticut, we’re 169 different fiefdoms, and we have to be respectful of that.”
She said housing policy should be focused on giving communities the tools and training they need to develop what they want to see.
Lamont said his staff is working to “clean up,” and “clarify,” a few details of the housing bill, but declined to offer details. He added he’d like to have a special session later this month.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4799-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)Over the weekend, Deputy House Democratic Leader Laura Telerski published an op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader in which she castigated House Majority Leader Jason Osborne for his “out of touch” budget statements on the House floor late last month. 
“He stood up and said that people at the barbershop or the grocery store aren’t asking about Medicaid reimbursement rates,” she wrote. “It was an elitist dismissal.”
She went on to argue that “the reality is that working people do think about the ways this budget harms them.”
I was watching, too, on June 26 when Osborne delivered that facepalm closing argument, and Telerski’s criticism is legitimate. But that’s not even the most frustrating thing about Osborne’s speech. He was essentially claiming that the purpose of public service is to give the people what they want, for themselves, while keeping them in the dark about broader, more consequential matters that affect the whole — directly or indirectly, now or later. For that reason, his barbershop stand wasn’t the “man of the people” flex he intended it to be. Instead, it was a confession of compromised legislative stewardship and, worse, a purposeful abdication of responsibility to all the people of the state — including those very barbershop and grocery store patrons.
As a top Republican leader in the State House, Osborne should understand better than most how much Medicaid — reimbursement rates included — does matter to the function of the state’s entire care system. He should also understand that it’s his job as a lawmaker and party leader to report back to his constituents about the direct and indirect price that will be paid for the cuts he supports — and in their name.
But here’s what he said on the House floor: “When I go to the barbershop … or the grocery store, or anywhere else in the state, they’re not asking me about all of the things that are in (House Bill 2) like, you know, elevator weights and measures and Medicaid reimbursement rates and all of these things that the folks in finance (here, Osborne is interrupted by a small Democratic uproar in the chamber, prompting a sharp general reprimand from House Speaker Sherman Packard) … The one thing they ask me about is, ‘When are you going to repeal those car inspections?’ And that’s what we are doing today.”
Huh.
Osborne didn’t intend it as such, but that’s a good example of what happens when governance by self interest overrides governance for the public good. Systems designed to benefit the whole are often complex and budget policy is what allows those systems to function — or not. That complexity is the main reason we elect people to serve in legislative bodies to make decisions on our behalf and at our behest. Maybe direct democracy could work for something like repealing car inspections, where a benefit can be weighed with relative ease against the potential consequences. But to take anecdotal public disinterest in something as broadly consequential as Medicaid reimbursement rates — or the program as a whole — as some sort of a mandate for applied ignorance is broken government in action. It is, in true modern Republican fashion, callousness rebranded as political bravery.
As a rolling result of that brand of legislative aloofness, you’re likely to hear one question again and again from the voting public as the ripples of federal and state budget cuts inevitably spread outward and undermine crucial care and support systems: How could this happen? 
Republicans will most likely answer by continuing to blame phantom “waste, fraud, and abuse” or immigrants or the LGBTQ+ community or previous administrations or the amorphous boogeyman known as “The Libs.” But the real answers aren’t hard to find. Follow the money, follow the policies that directed, redirected, or eliminated that money — the tax cuts, the budget cuts, the universal school vouchers — and then follow those policies to the politicians who championed them. 
If their defense amid all of the crumbling still amounts to something like “Medicaid reimbursement rates are boring,” we’ve clearly set the bar too low for public service.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Osborne-press-conference-1024x758.jpg,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

Brian Buswell, an attorney for RPW ENT LLC, which operates The Lookout Kitchen, said they were “currently negotiating with the state” on those issues. He said couldn’t comment further.
The company had operated restaurants at Beavers Bend, Lake Murray, Robbers Cave, Roman Nose, Quartz Mountain and Sequoyah state parks.
State officials said the restaurants will be closed until further notice.
Sterling Zearley, the agency’s executive director, on Tuesday declined a request for an interview.
The agency said in a statement that it was working to minimize disruptions to park operations and provide alternative food options, such as grab and go sandwiches, snacks and drinks. It was also looking into the use of food trucks, the agency said.
In 2022, the agency canceled its contract with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen.
The company had been hired to redesign, rebuild and revitalize the six restaurants
In 2024, the state’s multicounty grand jury indicted three people, including Swadley’s founder Ronald Brent Swadley, in connection with the controversial state contract to operate park restaurants. They were charged with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state. 
The three have pleaded not guilty, and a trial date has been set for Nov. 3, according to court records.
The Lookout Kitchen was awarded the state park restaurant contracts following the dispute with Swadley’s.

(Letcher County Tourism)Some Appalachian leaders are urging Congress to stop a Trump administration plan to slash funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission. 
President Donald Trump’s discretionary budget proposal released in May calls for cutting funding to the economic development agency by 93%, or from $200 million to $14 million for fiscal year 2026. 
More than 80 elected officials, education institutions, businesses, churches and nonprofits sent a letter to members of Congress calling on them to protect funding for the regional commission, according to Appalachian Voices, a nonprofit organization that works to advance a just economic transition in Central and Southern Appalachia based on clean energy. 
The Appalachian Regional Commission is an economic partnership between the federal government and 13 state governments, including Kentucky, in a region of the U.S. that has been historically impoverished. Congress created the commission in 1965.

The letter says that Appalachia “has built incredible momentum towards a multi-industry economy that provides good jobs that take good care of the communities around us” in recent years and credits the commission with “driving forward this potential.” 
“Reductions to its programs pose a risk to innovative initiatives in workforce development, community revitalization, and American-made resilient energy,” the letter says. The letter was sent to the chairs, vice chair and ranking member of House and Senate appropriations committees.
With Trump and the GOP’s megabill signed into law, Congress is poised to begin focusing on appropriations for the next fiscal year and responding to the president’s discretionary budget funding proposal. 
In a press release about the letter, Jeffery Justice, of Letcher County, said the commission “has been and continues to be a driving force in the Appalachian Renaissance.” Justice is the president and executive director of the Pine Mountain Partnership, an economic development initiative in Eastern Kentucky. 
“We must maintain momentum in order to build a more diverse, sustainable economy,” Justice said. 
Ruthie Caldwell, a grant writer in Eastern Kentucky, said the commission has “helped young people learn skilled trades so they don’t have to leave home to find a good-paying job” and “brought in tourists who shop at our local businesses — and even some folks who end up investing in new ones.” Caldwell is the owner of Vision Granted based in Floyd County. 
“I’ve worked with recovery programs where people are turning their lives around — getting jobs, rebuilding families, and finding hope right here in their hometowns,” Caldwell said. “The ARC is one of the few federal programs that truly understands our region and meets us where we are. It helps us build a better future from the ground up. Cutting this funding now would undo so much of the progress our communities have worked so hard for. I hope Congress will continue to invest in Appalachia — we’re worth it, and the work is far from done.”

,DC,2025-07-08 21:10:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,USDA chief outlines plan to block China from U.S. farmland ownership,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/usda-chief-outlines-plan-block-china-us-farmland-ownership,,"President Donald Trump’s administration will pursue a ban on Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland as part of an effort to strengthen farm security, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said Tuesday.Appearing alongside other Cabinet officials, Republican governors and members of Congress at an event outside the U.S. Department of Agriculture headquarters in Washington, D.C., Rollins announced a department initiative to block “foreign countries of concern” from owning U.S. agriculture lands.Rollins said officials will even try to revoke lands already owned by China-backed entities.The administration will “take swift legislative and executive action to ban the purchase of American farmland by Chinese nationals and other foreign adversaries,” she said.The executive branch will also work with state and local officials “to do everything within our ability, including presidential authorities, to claw back what has already been purchased by China and other foreign adversaries.”Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the nation’s food supply was a national security issue on par with energy and water supplies.Plan detailsThe seven-part initiative, titled the National Farm Security Action Plan, is based on the idea that “farm security is national security,” according to a preamble to USDA’s written plan.U.S. farmers dominate the global industry, the preamble said.“Because that dominance is earned and not assured, it is critical we continuously adapt our approach to American agriculture security and elevate it to the top echelon of national security priorities,” the document read.To protect U.S. farmland, the USDA, with help from the Justice Department, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and cooperative state and local governments, will seek to block investment by foreign adversaries and launch an online tool to help farmers report on potential unknown foreign ownership.The administration will look for vulnerabilities in the agricultural supply chain and attempt to ensure crop and nutrition programs are not being used to fund terrorist or criminal activity, while cutting down on fraud and abuse. The plan instructs the administration to strengthen biosecurity measures.The initiative also calls for making sure foreign governments cannot access USDA research grants or other department funding programs.The USDA will continue to work with the national security establishment and law enforcement to protect the agriculture sector’s critical infrastructure, according to the plan.After Republican Sens. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama and Roger Marshall of Kansas at the event criticized the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an executive branch agency, for not having a spot for the Agriculture secretary, Rollins said she would be joining the panel as of Tuesday afternoon.Farmland securityAt the Tuesday event, speakers offered few specifics about the initiative but praised the administration for elevating the issue of foreign investment in farmland.“A country has to be able to feed itself, fuel itself, and fight for itself to truly be free,” Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said. “We now have a president who understands it and is willing to do everything within his power to make sure the United States continues to be the greatest country on the face of the planet.”“Our farmland is not just dirt, it is our national security, it is our economic future, it is our children’s heritage,” Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said. “And it is under threat, and the leaders here recognize that.”Speakers emphasized what they called the threat of Chinese ownership of U.S. farmland.“Today, we tell China to get the hell out of American agriculture,” Marshall said.Nebraska Gov. James Pillen said his state had moved to ban Chinese equipment from telecommunications infrastructure and has worked to deny Chinese companies from owning farmland. He related a story of stonewalling Chinese-owned Syngenta, which sought a meeting with the governor.“I said, ‘I have no interest in having a meeting,’” he said. “‘Have no interest in you being in Nebraska. My suggestion would be to leave. My suggestion would be to get a different job.’”The company later sold their assets in Nebraska, Pillen said.Alabama and ChinaTuberville, who is running in the state’s gubernatorial race next year, appeared to say China owned 2.2 million acres of farmland in his state alone – a number that actually describes the acres of land owned by all foreign entities in the state. Chinese entities own no acres in Alabama, according to USDA data.“China is a threat,” he said. “They're not a threat. They are dominating us in almost everything that they do because we've sat back and the politicians have been counting their money instead of doing what's right and helping this country stay in the front. We've got to be number one. We can't be number two. We've got to fight back.“They are coming into our country and buying our farmland. In my state of Alabama alone, they own 2.2 million acres of farmland. That's right in Alabama. Foreign adversaries.”Asked about the comment, Tuberville spokesperson Mallory Jaspers said he was referring not only to Chinese ownership but all foreign adversaries and indicated that he opposed any foreign ownership of U.S. farmland.“Sen. Tuberville believes American farmland should be owned by Americans,” she wrote in an email.The most recent year-end USDA report on foreign investment, in 2023, showed Chinese-linked investors held about 276,000 acres of U.S. farmland nationwide.An analysis from the American Farm Bureau, an advocacy group, estimated Chinese investors accounted for only about .02% of all foreign owned U.S. agricultural land.GOP governors back planIn addition to Lee, Huckabee Sanders and Pillen, who spoke outside of USDA, the Republican governors of Indiana, Idaho, Iowa, South Dakota and Oklahoma signed a Tuesday letter to Rollins in support of the plan.“As America First Governors, we firmly stand together in our unwavering support of President Donald J. Trump and his administration’s National Farm Security Action Plan,” they wrote. “This plan is a critical and decisive response to the invasion of our land, food system, and sovereignty by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).”",,,,2025-07-08 18:07:47.363488

The Republican from Jackson made the long-expected campaign announcement Tuesday with a video featuring clips of him speaking to constituents and sharing a stage with President Donald Trump as well as footage of his football career at the University of Georgia.
Jones was elected lieutenant governor in 2022, and before that he served in the state Senate for a decade.
“Today, I see a Georgia where families are prospering,” Jones says in the announcement. “A Georgia where businesses are moving here and growing here. A Georgia where our families are safer thanks to tougher crime laws. And our schools strengthen thanks to empowering parents’ rights.”
“What do I call all that we’ve accomplished together? Just a start,” he adds. “Because our work’s not done yet, and that’s why I’m running for governor.”
Jones pledged that if he is elected, he will work to eliminate the state income tax, reduce fentanyl deaths and continue to prevent transgender girls from playing on girls’ school sports teams.
The Republican field

But before he has a chance to kick his feet up in the governor’s mansion, Jones will have to win the GOP primary, where his only major challenge so far is Attorney General Chris Carr, who entered the race early back in November and has sopped up plenty of donor dollars since then.
Carr announced Monday that he had raised $1.25 million between February and the end of June for a total of nearly $3.5 million since joining the race.
“This campaign has always been about Georgia, and these numbers show just how motivated folks are to keep Georgia strong,” Carr said in a statement Monday. “That kind of energy can’t be bought — it’s earned, and we’re ready to deliver.”
Because Jones entered the race after the end of the filing deadline in June, he has not filed a financial disclosure report.
Carr, who was appointed by then-Gov. Nathan Deal as the state’s top lawyer in 2016 and elected twice since then, has campaigned as a tough-on-crime conservative.
Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone indicated there will be a spirited debate between the two candidates.
“Chris Carr is a smart, principled conservative with a proven record of leadership – and the discipline to get things done,” Mazzone said. “He’s spent his career serving the people of Georgia, not himself. We look forward to a campaign that will offer a clear contrast between a record of results and a record of self-interest.”
But with official qualifying not set to begin until spring, there’s still plenty of time for other Republican heavyweights to enter the race.
That could include Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Rome Republican who is arguably more aligned with Trump than either candidate already in the race. That could be a boon in the GOP primary but potentially a hindrance in a general election where a candidate would need more moderate support.
Greene told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last month that she was weighing whether to step down from Congress for a run at the governorship.
“It’s definitely something that I think is smart for me to consider, but it’s not a decision I take lightly,” she said. “I absolutely love my district. I cannot say that enough times. I think Georgia’s 14th District is wonderful. and I have a very powerful position in Congress. But I love my state. I really do.”
If Greene’s flaw is that she has more appeal with the base than the general electorate, another potential GOP candidate could have the opposite problem.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is seen as a potential candidate for governor, even though delegates at the state GOP convention last month passed a resolution seeking to bar him from qualifying for the ballot as a Republican.
Raffensperger’s refusal to cooperate with Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia earned him respect from some liberals and moderates but made him persona non grata with elements of the conservative base.
The Dems
Whoever walks away with the GOP nomination will face a Democrat hungry for a win after nibbling around the edges in recent election cycles.
  Sen. Jason Esteves. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
In 2018, candidates for governor in Georgia competed for an open seat after Deal was term-limited from running again. At the time, a Republican president named Donald Trump was implementing policies that were more popular with the Republican base than swing voters.
That year, Stacey Abrams narrowly lost the governor’s race to now-Gov. Brian Kemp.
Since then, Democrats’ hopes have been buoyed with statewide wins from Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff and former President Joe Biden in 2020. Warnock also eked out a reelection victory in 2022.
Party leaders are seeing similarities to 2018 and hoping that continued demographic changes, get-out-the-vote infrastructure and frustration with federal Republicans will be enough to push Democrats over the top and reclaim the governor’s mansion for the first time in two decades.
So far, two frontrunners are aiming to be the one to lead that charge.

State Sen. Jason Esteves and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms have both claimed major fundraising hauls since entering the race earlier this year.
Each claimed war chests of $1.1 million during the period between February and June. Bottoms’ haul includes a $200,000 personal loan to her campaign, while Esteves donated the maximum amount of $8,400 to his campaign but did not loan his campaign money.
In a statement following Jones’ Tuesday announcement, Esteves sought to tie the Republican hopefuls to the White House.
“We can’t afford a governor who cares more about cheerleading for Donald Trump than making life better for Georgians,” Esteves said. “Whether it’s Burt Jones or Chris Carr, the truth is they’re both running on out-of-touch agendas that will raise costs, leave millions of Georgians uninsured, and abandon working families. As the GOP primary becomes a race to the extreme, I’m focused on what really matters: making life more affordable, expanding health care access, and investing in Georgia.”
State Rep. Derrick Jackson, a Tyrone Democrat running for governor, reported raising just over $88,000 since February, including a $77,000 loan from himself.
The Democratic field still has time to coalesce as well, and more could join the field of candidates.
Abrams was reportedly considering a run as recently as April, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. She comes with the advantage of being a national star and the Democrat to come the closest to winning a gubernatorial election in recent history but also the baggage of two recent losses – including a nearly 8-point loss in 2022.
But the darkest of dark horses might come in the form of former Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, whose messy divorce from the GOP began after Trump’s refusal to concede in 2020 and was finalized in January when the party banished him for supporting Vice President Kamala Harris for president.
In an episode of the AJC’s “Politically Georgia” podcast released July 1, Duncan said he’d be open to running for statewide office as a Democrat.
“If given the opportunity to be taken seriously by the Democrats and have an opportunity to shift the platform, I’d certainly think about it.”

Gilchrist is seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor, which will be decided by voters in next year’s August gubernatorial primary election, while Byrum is seeking the position of secretary of state. Democratic Party delegates will decide who gets that nomination during its 2026 nominating convention.
Announcing their support for Gilchrist on Tuesday were Democratic state Sens. Veronica Klinfelt of Eastpointe and Paul Wojno of Warren, and nine members of the Michigan House of Representatives.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
House Democrats on that list include state Reps. Brenda Cater of Pontiac, Kimberly Edwards of Eastpointe, Morgan Foreman of Pittsfield Township, Peter Herzberg of Westland, Donavan McKinney of Detroit, Cynthia Neeley of Flint, Amos O’Neal of Saginaw, Laurie Pohutsky of Livonia and Mai Xiong of Warren.
Support from Edwards, Klinefelt, Wojno and Xiong could be crucial for Gilchrist in Macomb County, who would face current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in August 2026 if all three candidates are able to make the ballot. Neeley’s support of Gilchrist is also striking as both she and Swanson serve Genesee County.
Republicans including U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt of Porter Township, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard of DeWitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are seeking their party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Meanwhile, Byrum on Tuesday also announced that several sitting and former Democratic legislators were throwing their support behind her secretary of state bid.
That list includes state Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor, Pohutsky and other state representatives, like Kara Hope of Holt, Will Snyder of Muskegon and Penelope Tsernoglou of East Lansing.
“Barb Byrum has dedicated her career to ensuring her constituents have free, fair, and transparent elections, and I know she will fight tirelessly to protect those rights for all Michiganders,” Pohutsky said in a statement.
In a statement, Irwin said Michigan, now more than ever, needs a secretary of state with a solid foundation in legislative experience and the ability to work with lawmakers to make strides forward. Byrum served three terms in the House prior to being elected as Ingham’s clerk.
“As a former colleague, I saw Barb Byrum stand strong for our values when under attack from Republicans, and I also saw her ability to work across the aisle when appropriate,” Irwin said.
Also announcing their support for Byrum on Tuesday was her mother and former Michigan State University Trustee Dianne Byrum, as well as:
​​Former House Democratic Floor Leader Kathy Angerer of Dundee;

Former State Rep. Joan Bauer (D-Lansing);
Former State Rep. Pam Byrnes (D-Chelsea);

Former State Rep. Mary Valentine (D-Norton Shores).

Byrum currently faces incumbent Deputy Secretary of State Aghogo Edevbie in the race for the Michigan Democratic Party nomination. No Republican candidate has yet to declare a bid for the party’s nomination.
Rogers nets police officer support, El-Sayed has $1.8M over 3 months in respective U.S. Senate bids
On the U.S. senate front, in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township), Republican candidate and former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) announced Tuesday that he has the support of the Police Officers Association of Michigan.

The association known as POAM said in a release shared by Rogers’ campaign that the candidate will work toward a shared mission of keeping Michiganders safe.

“No candidate is a better friend to law enforcement or more committed to keeping Michigan families safe than Mike Rogers,” POAM President James Tignanelli in a statement. “He has dedicated his life to service and understands the sacrifice. Mike will also be a fierce ally in our mission to make Michigan’s streets safer every day. The Police Officers Association of Michigan is all in for Mike Rogers.”

Rogers thanked POAM for its support.

“From keeping deadly drugs out of our communities, to protecting victims, and locking up the bad guys, I will fight alongside our brave law enforcement to make each day safer than the last. I’m grateful for the Police Officers Association of Michigan’s full support.”
Meanwhile, Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Abdul El-Sayed said Tuesday that he has raised $1.8 million over three months in his campaign to replace Peters.
On social media, El-Sayed said 95% of the donations were under $100 each.
“After traveling 8,000+ miles across Michigan, downing 592 espresso shots and eating 15 whitefish along the way, this movement is just getting started,” El-Sayed wrote on X.

El-Sayed will face state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) and former state House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) in next year’s Democratic primary.

(Getty Images)Gov. Tony Evers along with advocates for the environment and for LGBTQ people as well as Democratic Party lawmakers hailed Tuesday’s state Supreme Court ruling that strips a Wisconsin legislative committee’s power to block state regulations.
Republican leaders in the Legislature — who’ve deployed that power successfully against the Evers administration for the last six years — condemned the Court’s action as consolidating power in the executive branch.
Tuesday’s ruling, written by Chief Justice Jill Karofsky for the Court’s four-member liberal majority, found that state laws giving the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) the power to block state regulations were unconstitutional.
The ruling said that in doing so, the committee was rewriting state laws that affected the rights and duties authorized for executive branch officials.
JCRAR has repeatedly thwarted Evers administration rules since the governor first took office in 2019. Tuesday’s ruling was the result of a lawsuit Evers filed in 2023 challenging the committee’s actions in suspending a rule that bans conversion therapy and indefinitely blocking an update to the state building code.
“The people of Wisconsin expect state government to work — and work better — for them,” Evers said in a statement Tuesday applauding the ruling.
“For years, a small group of Republican lawmakers overstepped their power, holding rules hostage without explanation or action and causing gridlock across state government,” Evers said.
“Today’s Wisconsin Supreme Court decision ensures that no small group of lawmakers has the sole power to stymie the work of state government and go unchecked,” the governor said. “This is an incredibly important decision that will ensure state government can do our important work efficiently and effectively to serve Wisconsinites across our state.”
Conversion therapy ban maintained
The ruling ensured that a rule will continue barring therapists treating LGBTQ people from using conversion therapy to try to change sexual orientation or gender identity.
JCRAR suspended the rule in early 2023 after it was last promulgated. The professional board that had enacted the rule reinstated it in April 2024 after the Legislature concluded its 2023-24 session. Tuesday’s ruling will prevent JCRAR from blocking the rule again.
“The continuous suspensions of the rule represented legislative overreach in the rule-making process and threatened the ability of professions in Wisconsin to create their standards,” said the National Association of Social Workers Wisconsin Chapter (NASW-Wisconsin) in a statement welcoming the Court’s ruling.
The association has sought the conversion therapy ban since 2018.
“After seven and a half years of trying to ban the harmful, discredited and unethical practice of conversion therapy and having the rule repeatedly blocked by the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules, I am thrilled by this ruling,” said Marc Herstand, the social worker association’s executive director. “Professions have the right to establish their own conduct code, and no social worker should ever engage in the practice of conversion therapy.”
Republicans attack ruling
Sen. Steve Nass (R-Whitewater), chair of the committee, criticized the Court’s ruling.
“Today the liberal majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court ended nearly 7 decades of shared governance between the legislature and executive branch agencies aimed at protecting the rights of individuals, families and businesses from the excessive actions of bureaucrats,” Nass said in a statement.
“The liberal junta on the state supreme court has in essence given Evers the powers of a King,” he said.
Nass also attacked Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, charging that in the budget that lawmakers passed on the evening of July 2 and Evers signed shortly after midnight, Vos “gave away the power-of-the-purse-string for the next two years, so our options of defunding bureaucrats are now off the table.”
Vos also released a statement attacking the ruling.
“For decades, case law has upheld the constitutionality of the legislative rules committee to serve as a legitimate check on the powers of the Governor and the overreach of the bureaucracy,” Vos said. “The absence of oversight from elected representatives grows government and allows unelected bureaucrats to increase red-tape behind closed doors.”
Praise for the decision
Democrats, LGBTQ allies and environmental advocates said it was JCRAR’s practices, often shrouded in secrecy — not the rule-making process — that interfered with democracy.
“Today’s court decision is a victory for Wisconsinites, who deserve the freedom to have a government responsive to everyday people, not special interests and right-wing extremists,” said Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison). “This decision sends a clear message: We are working toward making Wisconsin a place where everyone can build a better life.”
Abigail Swetz, executive director of the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Fair Wisconsin,  called the outcome “a powerful step in the right direction towards ending the harmful practice of conversion therapy,” and credited the advocacy of NASW-Wisconsin and other community members and partner groups.
Swetz also urged lawmakers and the governor to take “an even more powerful step” by passing SB 324, legislation banning conversion therapy in all licensed professions.
In a joint statement the Legislature’s LGBTQ+ caucus called the ruling “a victory against the abusive and discredited practice of ‘conversion therapy’ and a victory for LGBTQ+ people who want to live as their authentic selves.”
Environmental impact
Environmental rules were not at the heart of the Court’s ruling Tuesday, but environmental groups said the outcome would strengthen efforts to enact stronger environmental protections.
“The bottom line is that good environmental rules now face a much easier path to getting to the finish line and becoming law—which is good for the environment and public health,” said Evan Feinauer, an attorney for Clean Wisconsin, in a statement the organization issued.
Clean Wisconsin said JCRAR has  blocked regulations on PFAS contamination, nitrates, surface water pollution and remediating contaminated lands.         
“Far too often in recent years JCRAR’s ability to object to any proposed rule, for almost any reason, or no stated reason at all, prevented agencies like DNR from doing their jobs,” Feinauer said. “That political gridlock prevented our government from being responsive to environmental and public health challenges.”
In a statement from Midwest Environmental Advocates, executive director Tony Wilkins Gibart said that through JCRAR’s control of the rulemaking process, “small groups of legislators have been able to block the implementation of popular environmental protections passed by the full legislature and signed by the governor.”
MEA filed a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Wisconsin Conservation Voters and Save Our Water, a group of residents affected by PFAS contamination in and around Marinette and Peshtigo.
When JCRAR blocked a rule in December 2020 that regulated firefighting foam containing PFAS, it perpetuated the discharge of PFAS-contaminated wastewater in the Marinette wastewater treatment plant, MEA said Tuesday.
“Committee vetoes were anti-democratic because they allowed a handful of legislators to make decisions that affect the entire state,” said Jennifer Giegerich, government affairs director of Wisconsin Conservation Voters, said in the MEA statement. “We’re pleased this ruling restores constitutional balance and strengthens accountability for environmental decisions that impact all Wisconsinites.”

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A New Jersey law that acts as a privacy shield for judges and law enforcement officers faced scrutiny Tuesday during a hearing in front of the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.
Both sides in the case suggested that a ruling in the other’s favor would have a “chilling” impact — either on the First Amendment or on the livelihood of those in public service. The statute, known as Daniel’s Law, allows certain public officials to keep their home addresses secret, and a group of data brokers and other companies like media outlets argue it is overly broad, unconstitutional on its face, and violates their free speech rights. They are seeking to have the law struck down.
“The chilling effect here is that people are invoking the statute saying that I am barring you from disclosing this information in any context whatsoever, for any reason, regardless of what I myself are doing, and I can get a thousand bucks for that,” said Michael Berry, attorney for news and digital information company Thomson Reuters, which opposes the law.
The case before the 3rd Circuit began when Atlas Data Privacy Corp. sued numerous data brokers on behalf of individuals covered by Daniel’s Law. Atlas alleges the data brokers did not comply with requests for personal information to be taken down — and says they owe damages that could amount to millions of dollars.
Under the law, businesses that receive a takedown request must comply within 10 days or they can be sued for $1,000 per claim.
The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office joined Atlas in Philadelphia Tuesday to defend the law. The three-judge panel asked why data brokers who receive a takedown request should believe that someone is a cop or a judge without requiring verification before complying. 
“What if it’s — there are 400 Michael Zuckermans in my database, I guess I’m just going to take them all down because I got this notice?” asked Judge Cindy K. Chung.
“In that kind of applied circumstance where there is someone who has a very, very common name, multiple John Smiths, the data broker could, of course, go back to that John Smith and say, ‘We’re so sorry. We’re having trouble figuring this out. We’ve got a number of John Smiths,’” said Michael Zuckerman, a deputy state solicitor general.
Berry argued that New Jersey could have enacted a more narrowly tailored statute that would not face challenges, noting that the law here bars disclosure with no exceptions and allows people to be punished for releasing information that is made available by the government.
“Here, we’re not dealing with information that is actually private, nor that there’s a reasonable expectation of privacy because it has historically been a matter of public record,” he said. 
Judge Stephanos Bibas replied: “Well, New Jersey is now changing the reasonable expectation of what’s private.”
Daniel’s Law was enacted in 2020 following the murder of Daniel Anderl, the son of U.S. District Judge Esther Salas. Anderl was killed when a disgruntled attorney attempted to assassinate Salas after obtaining the judge’s home address online. The law allows public officials to request that their home addresses and phone numbers be kept confidential, with civil and criminal penalties possible for anyone who ignores those requests. Since 2020, lawmakers have amended the law to broaden who the law applies to and permit the recovery of attorneys’ fees and punitive damages if someone willfully disregards the law.
Tuesday’s hearing was not the first time that the privacy law has faced a legal challenge.
The New Jersey Supreme Court upheld the law in June, ruling that it bars journalists from printing the home addresses of certain public officials.
Also last month, a separate case initiated by Atlas cleared an initial hurdle when U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle rejected the defendants’ motion to dismiss the roughly 40 lawsuits involved.
It is not clear when the 3rd Circuit will rule on the case it heard Tuesday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-08 20:57:51+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Corps revises Pearl River flood study, sets new comment period",Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/08/corps-revises-pearl-river-flood-study-sets-new-comment-period/,The Corps of Engineers released a revised study on potential flood controls for the of the Pearl River that runs through Jackson.,"Heading into the Fourth of July weekend last Thursday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a revised study on potential flood controls for the part of the Pearl River that runs along Jackson. The Corps has narrowed its focus to two proposals, and only one of them would resemble the long-debated “One Lake” plan.  
The latest step in an effort decades in the making, the 243-page document highlights an array of flood control measures such as building levees, lowering the river’s banks, and elevating and floodproofing vulnerable structures.
The public can view the study, submit comments and find information on upcoming public meetings through the Corps’ website. The public comment period lasts until Aug. 18. 
In last week’s study, which is a revision of a draft the Corps released last year, the agency wrote that “Alternative E1” could be the “NED plan,” or the option that most aligns with the Corps’ cost-benefit criteria. Alternative E1 includes all the above mentioned measures, but notably omits building a dam that would essentially create a lake on the Pearl River. 
The idea to pool a section of the river into a lake has been a key component of proposals local officials have favored for years. From 2011 until last year, the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District, the project’s local government sponsor, pushed an idea coined as “One Lake,” which would have widened the river f0r recreational use. While the Corps last year determined One Lake’s cost wasn’t justifiable, the agency instead pitched a dialed back version of the idea as the potential NED plan.

The Corps in its new study said that plan, “Alternative D1,” may have more potential for recreation than E1, but added that the two options have equal flood control benefit. The agency’s final selection, it wrote, will likely come down to those two proposals.
The costs of either would be considerably more than what the Corps considered last year: E1, the agency estimates, could cost between $708 million and $753 million, while D1 could cost between $873 million and $918 million. While the Corps pledged $221 million towards the project in 2022, the federal government is only responsible for 65% of costs, meaning the local flood control district, also called the levee board, would have to raise between $248 million and $321 million for the remaining balance through a combination of local taxes and state appropriations.
Levee board attorney Keith Turner told Mississippi Today that either proposal would expand the district to include more homes. Turner said that for many homes, tax payments needed to fund either project would still be lower than what they pay for flood insurance now. 
Part of the higher costs comes from four levees, totaling about 6 miles, that the Corps includes in both D1 and E1: a levee that would protect 250 homes in the Canton Club neighborhood; a levee in northeast Jackson that would protect 415 homes, but would require the acquisition of two other homes; a levee that would protect 40 homes in south Jackson; and one that would protect 40, mostly industrial, structures in Richland. 
Both projects would also “adversely affect” endangered or threatened species within the Pearl River’s natural habitats, the study says, including three different types of turtles. D1, the Corps wrote, would impact a wider range of species, including the Gulf sturgeon, than E1.

In a presentation to board members at a Monday meeting, Turner said he disagreed with “a lot” of what’s in the new study and that the board will submit a long list of comments to the Corps. For instance, he said the Corps’ greatly inflated its cost estimates with overly safe projections. Turner added the Corps didn’t consider additional maintenance costs from maintaining the shortened river banks under E1, which would just be underwater under D1.
The board last year gave its support to Alternative D (the same as D1 without the levees, which weren’t included in last year’s study), although Turner said their support doesn’t necessarily impact what the Corps chooses. 
Turner said the current timeline would allow the Corps’ final study to come out in November, and then a final decision to be made in December. That call would fall to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works, a currently vacant role. President Trump earlier this year nominated Adam Telle for the position, leaving it up to the Senate to confirm the choice. Telle, Magnolia Tribune reported in May, has ties to the state, including having worked for former Sen. Thad Cochran, who once advocated for the project in his role in the Appropriations Committee.
The Corps is preparing to hold a series of public meetings, including a virtual meeting on July 14, in-person meetings in Monticello on July 29, Slidell on July 30, and in Jackson on July 31. Information on those meetings is also available on the agency’s website.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/06150220/Pearl-River-flooding5.jpg,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 20:54:31+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont finishes review of 203 bills passed in 2025 with a veto,Mark Pazniokas and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/lamont-vetoes-bil/,Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed a measure Tuesday that would have given the town of Plainfield leverage in blocking a proposed trash-to-energy plant.,"On the last day to act on the 203 bills passed in the legislature’s annual session, Gov. Ned Lamont vetoed a measure Tuesday that would have given the Eastern Connecticut town of Plainfield leverage in blocking a proposed trash-to-energy plant.
In vetoing House Bill 7004, the governor heeded calls by labor and business groups. The measure would have allowed environmental justice communities of a certain size to reverse decisions on permitting by the state through referendums.
“Allowing permitting decisions to be overturned by referenda undermines the principles of objectivity embedded in our state permitting processes, will discourage important investments in infrastructure and ultimately will drive up cost of living for residents,” Lamont wrote in his veto message.
The veto was his third and least controversial: The others were an omnibus housing bill that had been drafted in consultation with his office and a measure that would have provided jobless benefits to strikers, which had been passed despite his veto threat. 
The governor also had previously used a line-item veto to excise sections of two other bills that became law.
No attempted veto overrides are expected.
House Bill 7004 was passed by the Senate in the final hour of the annual session in a deal with the Republican minority, which can control the flow of business in a session’s final days by extending debates. The measure was called for a vote with the expectation of a veto by Lamont.
Construction trade unions had lobbied against the bill on the grounds it could prevent job-producing projects. The Connecticut Business and Industry Association also was opposed.
“Predictability is critical for those seeking to do business in our state,” Lamont wrote.
Under current law, referendums challenging permitting decisions by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection are only allowed in certain environmental justice communities located in towns with populations under 10,000. In addition, those referendums can only challenge a permit denial, not an approval. 
The bill would have increased that eligibility to towns with up to 16,000 residents, covering Plainfield and two dozen other communities, and would have allowed residents to challenge approved permits.
Its sponsor in the upper chamber, Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, denied that it had been drafted specifically to address the proposed waste-to-energy plant in her district.
Instead, she said it was intended to apply more broadly across Eastern Connecticut, which she noted is dotted with former mill towns that still bear the consequences of industrial pollution, and which is already home to three waste-to-energy facilities, in Plainfield, Lisbon and Preston. 
“Many of us in the delegation are tired of having the most populated area of Connecticut want to put stuff in the eastern part where it’s less populated, where people live here,” she said, even pointing to a year-old example when then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy sought to build a state police firing range in Griswold. 
“Everything that maybe nobody else wants, they want to always push in Eastern Connecticut,” she said.
But another member of the Southeastern Connecticut delegation who served as the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Aundre Bumgardner, D-Groton, said that the Plainfield proposal had been the primary impetus for the bill. Bumgardner, whose district does not include Plainfield, said that Somers had introduced him to a few of her constituents from the town in order to hear their concerns about the proposed facility. 
“That came out of Plainfield,” he said. 
Bumgardner, who serves as vice chair of the Environment Committee, said that he agreed with Somers that the region has had to accept more than its fair share of polluting facilities and that local governments should have more say in future siting decisions. 
“I think at the end of the day, every resident of a community should have the ability to vocalize strongly, vocalize where they stand on projects or infrastructure projects or facilities that are proposed to be sited in their backyard,” Bumgardner said. “Again, whether they’re urban, rural or suburban communities, they should have that right.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CT-state-capitol-1024x855.jpg,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday that Iowa officials have contacted the White House to be involved in discussions on how to keep immigrant agricultural workers in the country.
The governor spoke about the budget reconciliation bill Tuesday outside the Iowa Capitol with Bob Quinn, host of The Big Show, a farm radio show on WHO Radio. Reynolds, Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer and Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig attended the show’s Sweet Corn Day event, which included discussions on the radio program as well as sweet corn provided by Titan Goodyear Tires.
Both Reynolds and Naig sat down for interviews with Quinn at the event. While the state officials did talk about their love for corn, they also talked about other issues impacting Iowa’s agriculture sector — including a proposal introduced by President Donald Trump during remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Thursday on allowing farm workers without legal status to stay in the country with support from their employers.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump said at the event that the issue was brought up by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, who had said the Trump administration’s mass deportations have negatively impacted farms and agricultural businesses in the country. Trump said he’s working on legislation with Rollins and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem that would aid these impacted businesses and farms by allowing employers to vouch for their undocumented employees to allow them to remain in the country.
“We figured it out, and we have some great stuff being written,” Trump said. “And let the farmers be responsible.”
Reynolds told Quinn that Iowa has reached out to the Trump administration to be involved in the discussions of this policy, and to “actually continue to highlight how important it is so that we get this right.”
“Secretary Rollins has done a great job of just pointing out the need in agriculture for this outside labor — a lot of them being there year after year after year,” Reynolds said. “And it’s how we make things work. So it’s really important to the industry that we’re able to maintain that.”
The governor added that these discussions were something that should follow having a secure U.S. border, but said that because of the Trump administration’s actions on immigration law and border security, the country is in a place where stakeholders can have a “robust conversation” about what a program would look like to allow some workers to remain in the country.
Reynolds: Cuts in federal legislation will hit other states harder
Reynolds also said Iowa is equipped to deal with federal funding cuts made in the “big, beautiful bill” signed by Trump last week. Reynolds has praised Republicans in Congress for getting the measure to Trump’s desk, saying Thursday after the measure passed the U.S. House that it “reflects what everyday Americans believe — work should be rewarded, laws should be enforced, and government should get out of the way.”
The measure makes the 2017 tax cuts approved during Trump’s first term, and increases spending for federal immigration enforcement efforts. It also includes spending cuts for public assistance programs, implementing Medicaid work requirements and shifting some funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) from the federal government to states — changes hunger and health care advocates say will hurt people in need across the country.
However, Reynolds argued these changes will have a smaller impact on Iowa than in other states. Iowa has already moved forward to implement Medicaid work requirements on a state level through a law signed this session and a waiver request submitted to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in April that include similar requirements to what was outlined in the budget reconciliation bill.
Many advocates have talked about how the changes to Medicaid will also mean less money for health care providers, prompting concerns in Iowa about further closures of rural hospitals and health care providers. Reynolds said she believes some of these concerns can be addressed through provisions passed in her rural health care bill, which includes measures to seek more federal funding to implement a “hub-and-spoke” model to create more regionalized rural health care services that provide easier access to general and specialized care.
“That will really help make sure that no matter where you live in the state of Iowa, especially in rural Iowa, that you have access to high quality health care,” Reynolds said.
She said she has also reached out to the federal government on this topic. Iowa’s existing Centers of Excellence Program is a model for this health care system, Reynolds said, which she said could show the administration how giving states flexibility, “alongside the funding,” could help improve rural health care availability.
She also said Iowa is working to address SNAP payment errors, the metric used that would trigger states’ payment for SNAP benefits under the law. States with payment error rates above 6%, as assessed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, would be required to pay into the system beginning in 2028.
Iowa’s payment error rate in Fiscal Year 2024 was 6.14% — just above the cutoff. Only eight states — Idaho, Nebraska, Nevada, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming were below the threshold in FY 2024.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The Florida Department of Education has begun writing regulations to implement some of the education-related bills lawmakers approved this spring, including the training teachers must have to respond to children experiencing allergic reactions.
The Department of Education held three brief public meetings on the proposed regulations Tuesday, the first step in the rulemaking process. Ultimately, the state Board of Education must approve the rules following a mandatory public-comment period.
New laws seek to protect student athletes, restrict corporal punishment

SB 1514 requires an “adequate number” of charter and traditional public school personnel to be trained to respond to allergic reactions, including administering epinephrine. 
Language drafted by the department defines “adequate number” as “trained personnel and contracted personnel whose duties include regular contact with a student who has experienced or is at risk of a life-threatening allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis.”
According to the draft language, the training must include recognition of symptoms of an allergic reaction, administering an epinephrine delivery device that contains a pre-measured dose, and procedures for accessing and recommending care when students are on school grounds. Specific language can be found here.
The department posts its approved trainings to its website.
Existing regulations require students to have a health plan with the school nurse regarding life-threatening allergies, including a plan of action for students unable to inject themselves with epinephrine. 
Form of high school diplomas and certificate of completion
Another rule discussed Tuesday relates to HB 1105, which, in part, eliminates certificates of completion. The certificates are given to students who complete credits required to graduate but do not score high enough grade point averages to graduate. 
Eliminating the certificate better sets students up for success, lawmakers said when debating the bill.
Lawmakers suggested that most jobs either require a high school diploma, college degree, or neither, rendering a certificate of completion effectively useless. Eliminating the certificate, lawmakers argued, would encourage students to study harder.
The state is taking public comment on draft language eliminating the certificates and changing rules establishing graduation requirements for students with disabilities. 
Community service for Bright Futures
The department discussed a proposed rule for high school students to more easily earn community-service hours needed to qualify for the Bright Futures scholarship, the Lottery-funded merit award for in-state students going to college.
The rule change would allow high schoolers working as paid tutors for the Reading Achievement Initiative for Scholastic Excellence (RAISE) program to count their work hours as the requisite community-service hours. Existing regulations permit only unpaid hours.
RAISE is designed to increase reading scores for elementary students and includes an opportunity for high school students to provide tutoring. 
The highest level of the Bright Futures scholarship requires students to perform 100 hours of community service. 
A date has not been set for the Board of Education to approve the rules.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 20:39:19+00:00,CT Mirror,Two more CT unions break off contract talks with Lamont,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/two-more-ct-unions-break-off-contract-talks-with-lamont/,"The Judicial Branch unions declared an impasse after being offered $2,000 bonuses, just days after Lamont’s office said it would offer raises.","Two more state employee bargaining units declared an impasse Tuesday with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration after the Executive Branch offered $2,000 lump sum bonuses in lieu of raises.
The breakdown in talks between the administration and unions representing judicial marshals and their immediate supervisors comes just six days after Lamont’s office insisted it was preparing to offer raises to bargaining units.
The latest declarations now mean three bargaining units have stopped negotiations with the governor and are preparing to seek arbitration. The 1,300-member Judicial Professional Employees Union, which represents probation officers, information technology analysts, assistant clerks, counselors and other support staff, announced an impasse July 2.
But unless Lamont — whose administration has pledged raises on multiple occasions — strikes a compromise, it could find itself at odds with the bulk of state government’s unionized workforce, even as the governor weighs launching a campaign for a third term in the near future.
“We have to wonder if, from where he sits, the governor even sees the lives of working families and the public they serve,” said Bobby Perez, president of the 100-member marshal supervisors’ unit within CSEA-SEIU Local 2001, who said the lump-sum payments won’t address problems with recruitment, retention and a rising cost of living.
 About 35 bargaining units, nearly all of state government’s unionized workforce, are working under contracts that expired when the current fiscal year began July 1.
Lamont negotiated, and legislators approved, a new contract in late May for nearly 900 unionized state police troopers, granting those employees a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase this fiscal year. A step typically adds about 2 percentage points, bringing the effective value of the raise to about 4.5%.
“The decision to withhold a raise for some state workers, while others, like the State Police, receive the raises they deserve, shows a blatant disregard for the hard-working public servants who keep this state running,” Perez said. “We will not accept this disrespect, and we will continue to fight for the fair wages our members have earned.”
Angelo Arena, president of IBPO Local 731, which represents about 700 judicial marshals, said, “We now face the reality of working under an expired contract without the wage increases we deserve, all while health care costs continue to rise. As a result, our courthouses remain critically understaffed, and the public remains at risk.”
Lamont’s office told The Connecticut Mirror last week, shortly after the Judicial Professional Employees Union became the first unit to pursue arbitration, that offers of raises were forthcoming for all unions.
The Lamont administration did not comment Tuesday immediately after the two latest bargaining units to break off talks made their announcement.
The governor’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said last week that “Gov. Lamont immensely values the contributions of our state employees, as evidenced by consistent wage increases, and our offer will reflect that.”
Since 2021, as Connecticut has enjoyed unprecedented surpluses driven by aggressive and increasingly controversial budget caps, most unionized workers have received effective annual raises of 4.5%.
But negotiations typically address work conditions and other issues besides compensation.
And while administration officials haven’t disclosed specifics, the governor and many legislators have expressed increasing concerns over remote-work rules, set up shortly after COVID struck Connecticut in spring 2020, and their effects on productivity. Unions have been reluctant to alter those work-from-home rules.
Still, state employee unions have been clear they will hold the governor to his word when it comes to raises.
Lamont told hundreds of members of Council 4 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, during an April 25 conference in Mystic, that “Every year that I’ve been here, you’ve gotten a raise, and every year I’m here, you’re going to get a raise.”
But the governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, often has been at odds with labor over his budget policies.
Union leaders say the administration has been too slow to rebuild a workforce that shrank during the 2010s to help close frequent budget deficits.
They also say the governor has been too focused on building large fiscal reserves and paying down Connecticut’s sizeable pension debt to the detriment of education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
“Connecticut faces a public service crisis, and our leadership team stepped up to propose real solutions in contract talks with the Judicial Branch’s representatives,” said Rob Moreau, president of the Judicial Professional Employees Union, which broke off contract talks with the administration last week after no raise had been offered. “We were focused on addressing recruitment and retention gaps by boosting investments in the staff that all state residents depend on. Unfortunately, branch representatives came up short on the kind of appropriate pay that would make a difference.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IMG_5682.jpg,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546

Childcare Arkansas includes a range of search options such as county, city, ZIP code and “Better Beginnings” quality ratings. The Arkansas Department of Human Services ranks childcare quality on a scale of one to six.
The database also allows searches for specific criteria such as the ages of the children accepted at a facility, hours of operation, whether transportation is provided and whether the provider accepts school vouchers via the LEARNS Act. The search function includes an interactive map of results.
The LEARNS Act is a wide-ranging 2023 education law that includes several early childhood education provisions, among them the requirement for the new “parent-friendly” website. The law also requires “local lead” organizations throughout the state to assess local and regional access to pre-K and what gaps or barriers should be addressed. The Childcare Arkansas site includes a search function for local leads.
“Through the LEARNS Act, which created the Local Leads program, and tools like this website, we are empowering Arkansas families to make informed decisions and helping set our children on the path to success from early childhood on,” Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in Monday’s news release announcing Childcare Arkansas.
The website also allows parents to file complaints against childcare facilities and search the School Readiness Assistant portal, which provides eligible families with “free or reduced childcare at approved state licensed providers, pending the availability of funds,” according to the portal’s website.
Arkansans face more challenges than most accessing child care, report shows

The LEARNS Act also moved the state’s Office of Early Childhood from the Department of Human Services to the Department of Education. The law “codified a commitment to improve access to quality childcare providers and streamlined education from cradle to career,” Secretary of Education Jacob Oliva said in Monday’s news release.
In 2023, childcare for infants in Arkansas cost only 1.8% less than four-year public college tuition and 22.5% less than the average rent cost, according to a study released earlier this year by the Economic Policy Institute.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office will consider joining a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency, he told Newsline in an exclusive interview on Saturday.
Last week, the Trump administration’s Bureau of Land Management invoked the emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of a permit to expand a loading facility near Price, Utah for oil coming out of the nearby Uinta Basin. The expansion could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day.
It’s anticipated that the expansion of what’s known as the Wildcat Loadout facility — located on publicly owned federal lands — and other nearby facilities will allow the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for transport in the Uinta Basin Railway project. Eagle County and state officials have long opposed increased oil trains along the Colorado River.
In a June 27 letter to Jerry Davis, acting Utah state director for the BLM, Weiser wrote that an expedited environmental assessment for the proposed Wildcat right-of-way expansion would be a “violation of applicable laws and regulations” that would block proper public input and “subject Colorado communities to significant economic, environmental, and health and safety risks.”
Weiser argued there is no national energy emergency given the United States produced more oil last year than any nation in history, and he urged the BLM to follow standard, legally required procedures in reviewing the project. An attorney for Eagle County and an environmental group that successfully sued the federal government to delay the rail project, also sent letters.
But late Thursday, the BLM issued its approval, finding “no significant impact” related to the expansion, which Colorado opposes due to increased derailment, wildfire and oil-spill risks, and the agency directly cited its authority under Trump’s January executive order declaring a national energy emergency, allowing for the fast-tracking of fossil fuel projects.
On Saturday, before a fundraiser here for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, Weiser said he had not heard about the expedited approval of the Wildcat Loadout or had time to debrief the ruling.
“I am sorry to hear that. I’m not shocked, but it’s a sign of the times we’re in — the lack of stewardship to protect our land, air, and water is appalling,” Weiser said. “We’re going to have to be creative to find every way we can to make sure that these decisions aren’t being made hastily with long-term, harmful consequences.”
In May, 15 states — led by the attorneys general in Washington and California — filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s energy emergency executive order. Calling it a “fake” emergency designed to line the pockets of Big Oil, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown pointed to the order’s exclusion of clean energy projects as it strips away vital environmental protections.
The May lawsuit claims Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency is a violation of the National Emergencies Act itself, which is designed to prevent frivolous or partisan declarations.
“We don’t think it is a real emergency,” Weiser said Saturday. “Up until now, this national energy emergency order hasn’t affected Colorado. But given these dynamics (of the expedited BLM approval), we’re going to be looking at that to make sure that we can do all we can to protect Colorado.”
Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta cited what they deemed illegal fast-tracking of environmental reviews by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in violation of the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, among other key environmental laws.
“The only ‘emergency’ is that the president disagrees with policies to address climate change in Washington state and elsewhere,” Brown wrote in May. “He is illegally using emergency authorities to keep the nation reliant on energy sources like coal, oil and gas.”
Weiser has previously said he will keep all of his options open in opposing the Uinta Basin oil expansion as it seeks to vastly expand oil-train traffic along the headwaters of the endangered Colorado River, which supplies water to more than 40 million people. The BLM approval in a two-week window now has him questioning Trump’s national energy emergency rules.
“So we didn’t have an ability to make this case [back in May], but we at the time said that we would be looking closely at whether and when it would affect Colorado and we’d be ready to file,” Weiser said Saturday. “And with this, now we have to look at it.”

Article summary

The domestic policy law signed by President Donald Trump last week creates new work requirements that could jeopardize food assistance benefits for 360,000 Illinoisans.
Illinois will be required to cover a greater portion of the administrative costs and benefits of SNAP, which could cost several hundred million dollars.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the changes will substantially reduce costs for the federal government while most states will have to pay significantly more.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story. 


Hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans could lose benefits from a federal food assistance program while the state will be required to cover more costs under changes passed in the latest domestic policy plan.

President Donald Trump signed the “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” into law on July 4, making sweeping changes to social services programs, including Medicaid. Among the programs being revamped is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP. The bill institutes new work requirements for many people to remain eligible for benefits and shifts some costs for the program to the states.

Food stamps were first established in the 1930s during the Great Depression. Renamed to SNAP in 2008, the program provides monthly stipends for low-income Americans to purchase select foods at grocery stores. While states implement the program and pay a portion of administrative expenses, the federal government has historically covered the cost of the benefits.

Under the law, work requirements to qualify for SNAP benefits have been expanded to include people up to age 64, along with homeless people, veterans and young adults leaving foster care. Previously, only people age 18-54 had to meet work requirements.

Those populations didn’t previously have to prove they were doing a certain amount of work, but when the changes kick in, they will have to do 80 hours of paid, unpaid or volunteer work each month to qualify for benefits, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The law continues to provide exemptions for people who are physically unable to work, such as for pregnancy.

The changes could leave 360,000 people in Illinois at risk of losing eligibility, according to the state.

“Trump and Republicans would rather children go hungry so their friends can receive tax cuts,” Gov. JB Pritzker said in a statement. “Here in Illinois, we have been working to combat food insecurity for years, and while no state can backfill these costs, the State of Illinois will continue to fight against these harmful impacts and stand up for working families.”

About 1.9 million people were using SNAP in Illinois as of March 2025, according to the USDA.

New costs for the state

Illinois and most other states will have to cover a greater portion of costs for SNAP under the law, including benefits based on the state’s error rate of over- and under-payments on benefits.

Beginning in federal fiscal year 2028, which begins in October 2027, the law requires states with an error rate greater than 10% as of at least FY25 to cover 15% of the cost of benefits. States with lower error rates would cover a smaller portion of the benefits. Illinois recorded an 11% error rate in FY24, according to the USDA.

More than 1.8 million Illinoisians received $4.7 billion of SNAP benefits in FY25, according to the state. If Illinois must pay 15% of the cost of benefits, it could leave the state on the hook for $705 million — or about 1.3% of the current-year budget.

Also beginning in federal fiscal year 2027, which begins in October 2026, states will have to cover 75% of administrative costs for SNAP, rather than 50%. This year’s state budget appropriates $60 million for administrative costs for SNAP — up $20 million from last year.

The changes are part of initiatives by congressional Republicans and the Trump administration to shift more responsibility for assistance programs to states. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates changes to SNAP will reduce federal spending by $279 billion over 10 years but increase state spending on SNAP by $121 billion over the same time. The CBO predicts some states could abandon the program or choose to provide a lower level of benefits and not make up for reductions Congress made to the program.

Pritzker and 22 other governors sent a letter to Congress last month saying it’s possible states will have to leave or reduce the SNAP program because of the new cost requirements.

O. Williams Hall on the campus of the Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Baton Rouge. (Photo courtesy Southern University)Nine Southern University students who had their visas revoked by the Trump administration earlier this year have since had them reinstated, according to the university. 
Seven of the students are enrolled at Southern University’s main campus in Baton Rouge and two are at Southern University at New Orleans. 
The nine students had their visas revoked in early April without explanation from federal officials, Southern spokeswoman Janene Tate said at the time. She did not disclose the students’ names, citing the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. 
The Southern students are among 16 international students enrolled at Louisiana universities known in April to have lost their visas in the Trump administration’s sweeping termination of at least 1,800 students’ legal status to study in the United States. 
Of the seven other students, three were enrolled at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and two each attended the University of New Orleans, Tulane University according to representatives with the schools. 
Two LSU students have since had their visas revoked, according to LSU spokesman Todd Woodward. 
The university confirmed that two Iranian-born students were arrested by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement last month. 
One of the students, Pouria Pourhosseinhendabad, is currently being detained at the ICE facility center in Jena. The agency has not responded to requests for comment about why he is being detained.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Sweat beaded on foreheads inside the sweltering warehouse of 84 Lumber on Richmond’s Southside Tuesday, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin appeared unfazed by the heat as he declared victory on one of his administration’s signature promises — slashing red tape across Virginia’s government by 25%.
“The heart of the day is recognizing that when we reduce the burdens of excess regulations on businesses in Virginia, businesses come, businesses thrive, businesses grow,” Youngkin said to applause. “Today is about results. Today is about commitments kept. Today is about promises made — and a team of extraordinary individuals working together to keep those promises.”
Youngkin announced that Virginia has surpassed his administration’s goal of cutting regulatory requirements by 25%, six months ahead of schedule. 
The benchmark, established in Executive Order 19 during his first year in office, set in motion a sweeping review of every agency’s rules, guidance documents, and permitting practices — an effort that culminated in the streamlining or repeal of nearly 89,000 regulatory requirements and the elimination of 11.5 million words from official documents, according to state officials.
“The 25% was broken through, and I’m convinced we can get to 35,” Youngkin said. “It’s about setting targets and hitting them — and then blowing through them and doing even more.”
 From paperwork to paychecks

The governor connected the regulatory rollback to broader economic wins during his term, including more than $120 billion in corporate investment commitments, 270,000 new jobs, and 15,000 high-growth startups.
“Jobs that are open and ready,” Youngkin said. “And we have had 15,000 high-growth startups over the course of the last three years, and our goal is to get it to 20,000.”
While the administration emphasized the savings — pegged at $1.2 billion annually by the Office of Regulatory Management — Youngkin also said the effort was as much about speed and accessibility as cost.
“Regulatory and permitting timelines (have been) cut 65% in our Department of Environmental Quality,” he noted. “VDOT alone has eliminated 20,000 regulatory requirements, hundreds of pages of incorporated documents. That saves Virginians time — and time matters.”
 Housing, licensing, and stormwater

Youngkin pointed to housing as one of the clearest examples of regulatory reform making a difference.
“We went to look at the whole building code,” he said, “and said, ‘Let’s reduce (regulations), maintain safety, but let’s reduce them.’ What we found is $24,000 of cost savings to building a home — that reduces the cost of the home by nearly 6%. That means someone has to pay less to get into the home of their dreams.”

Hans Klinger, a real estate executive and president of the Home Builders Association of Virginia, said the impact has been felt throughout the industry.
“Regulation affects every part of (the homebuilding) process — what gets built, how long it takes, and what it costs,” Klinger said. “When the system becomes too complex or outdated, the burden extends beyond our builders. It pushes families out of homeownership, drives up rents and holds communities back.”
Klinger credited Brian Horn, director of the Department of Housing and Community Development, with leading a streamlining of more than 48,000 housing-related regulations. 
“Several individual items could have easily added $25,000 to $35,000 to the cost of a single home,” Klinger said. “That directly goes down to the homebuyer — it’s a pass-through cost.”
The Uniform Statewide Building Code is currently under formal review by the Department of Housing and Community Development. As part of that process, the state is accepting public comments on proposed changes through December. Virginians can weigh in by visiting the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall website.
Environmental regulations were also a major focus. Andrew Wheeler, the former Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief under President Donald Trump who helped launch Virginia’s Office of Regulatory Management, described the previous system as lacking accountability.
“We quickly discovered that over 50% of the regulations in Virginia were drafted by agencies and were not reviewed by anybody outside of the agency writing the regulation,” Wheeler said. “That’s just not good government.”
He offered stormwater regulations as a case study: “We had a stack of 23 inches of stormwater regulations and guidance documents, and we whittled that down to five inches.”
Wheeler did not elaborate further on which regulations were cut. 
 A “common sense” filter

Throughout his remarks, Youngkin emphasized that the process wasn’t about gutting public protections, but about eliminating redundancy and inefficiency.
“Why in the world do we have three competing (regulations)?” he asked. “Why do we demand the maximum level of insulation on everything we do that drives up housing costs?”
The process, he said, involved a practical “common sense score” alongside economic reviews. Some regulations stayed — especially those tied to health and safety — while others were restructured or repealed. “We’re not saying all regs are bad,” Youngkin said. “What we’re saying is excess regulation is bad.”
Agencies were tracked using a color-coded dashboard — green for those ahead of schedule, yellow for those close behind and red for those lagging. “It allows us to focus management attention on who we need to put a little pressure on to get going,” Youngkin said.
The results varied by agency. Some exceeded the 25% benchmark, while others are still working toward it. But overall, the state’s regulatory code has been pared down by one-quarter — a milestone Youngkin says proves that “we can deliver results.”
Despite repeated references to the $1.2 billion in annual savings and 89,000 streamlined regulations, neither Youngkin nor administration officials on Tuesday provided a detailed breakdown of how those figures were calculated. The administration also did not release a full cost analysis or explain the specific methodology used to tally reductions across agencies.
 Legislative roots and next steps

Del. Michael Webert, R-Fauquier, said the success of Youngkin’s effort builds on work that began under previous legislatures.
“In 2018 under Speaker Kirk Cox, we passed House Bill 883 — a pilot program dealing with occupational licenses and the Department of Criminal Justice,” said Webert, who sponsored the proposal. “Even with COVID and the delays, they still hit 25%. That goes to show you how overburdensome government can be.”
Youngkin’s reforms were institutionalized early in his term through the creation of the Office of Regulatory Management, which now oversees the review process, cost-benefit analysis and agency transparency. 
Under the administration, all agencies are required to annually publish a Unified Regulatory Plan, publicly outlining new or amended rules for the coming year. Guidance documents, permits, and actions are tracked on the Virginia Regulatory Town Hall website.
Wheeler said one of the biggest reforms was requiring economic analysis of not just new regulations, but also legacy rules. 
“We built off of the pilot program that was created for two agencies, requiring a 25% reduction across all agencies by the end of this year,” he said. “It’s only July — we’re not at the end of the year — and we’ve already met the 25% reduction.”
Youngkin, whose name continues to swirl in speculation about his political future beyond the Virginia governor’s mansion, was eager to link the policy win to broader economic momentum in Virginia.
“At the heart of our commonwealth today, businesses are thriving,” Youngkin said. “We broke through $120 billion of commitments from companies to invest in Virginia … and we’ve got roughly 200,000 jobs in Virginia that are ready for someone to say ‘Yes, thank you. I will come work for you.’”
Reflecting on the original pledge, Youngkin acknowledged he wasn’t sure exactly how his administration would meet the 25% reduction goal — but credits a coordinated effort across state government for delivering results ahead of schedule. 
“I didn’t know how we were going to do it,” he said. “But I knew we could. Now, we’re going for 35%.”

All seven defendants made brief court appearances Tuesday before Judge Tracy Lee Dayton, and all had their cases continued to August 13. Dayton said on that date she expects to take a guilty plea from Josephine Edmonds, the first to do so.
The judge did not discuss the terms of that deal or whether Edmonds will get jail time or have to testify against other defendants.
Edmonds is facing four felony charges. including witness tampering and illegal possession of absentee ballots stemming from the 2019 election. Her attorney Public Defender James J. Pastore would not comment on the agreement.

Moments later, Dayton revealed that a second defendant, Jazmarie Melendez, also is negotiating a plea with the Chief State’s Attorney’s office and will meet prosecutors next week.
Deputy Chief State Attorney Lisa D’Angelo confirmed that the meeting will take place but did not say what any terms of a potential deal with Melendez would entail. 
D’Angelo made her first appearance in the case, replacing Kevin Lawlor, who recently retired. Lawlor has been in charge of the office’s multiyear investigation that led to all of the arrests.

Melendez is one of three sitting city council members facing election fraud charges for either mispresenting who is eligible to vote absentee, fraudulent voting, taking possession of voters’ absentee ballots or being present while voters filled out those ballots. Melendez is facing six felony counts from the 2023 mayoral election.
The five other defendants are city council members Maria Pereira and Alfredo Castillo, Margaret Joyce, Nilsa Heredia and Wanda Geter-Pataky. All had their cases continued until August 13.

Dayton said at that time she expects plea negotiations to occur with the other five defendants to see if a resolution to the cases can be reached, otherwise a trial date will be set. Attorneys for all of the defendants met with Dayton in her chambers for nearly a half hour.
While that meeting was occurring, several of the defendants, including Castillo and Geter-Pataky, sat together on a court bench, complaining about all the trips to court.
Geter-Pataky, the vice chair of the city’s Democratic Town Committee, is facing 92 separate criminal charges, including conspiracy to take possession of multiple voters’ absentee ballots. 
Heredia is facing similar charges as Edmonds from the 2019 election but has not entered plea discussions with the state yet.
Her attorney Ken Krayeske had applied for accelerated rehabilitation — a form of probation — for Heredia but was denied by Dayton, who signaled the case was not going to be business as usual.
Dayton said that allegations of election fraud and voter manipulation were serious matters comparable to cases stemming from the embezzlement of public funds.
“I have granted [accelerated rehabilitation] in very, very serious situations,” Dayton said. “I certainly understand my ability and discretion to do so. I find this case to be more serious. I think taking someone’s vote is more serious than taking someone’s money.”
Meanwhile, Joyce, who lists no permanent address, was recently fined $1,000 by the State Elections Enforcement Commission for what they described as an “egregious” violation of state law for her actions in the 2024 Bridgeport elections. 
According to State Elections Enforcement Commission staff, Joyce told state investigators that she was compensated during those 2024 elections for the sole purpose of soliciting absentee votes — which is a violation of state law. They said she also admitted to taking possession of at least one voter’s absentee ballot ahead of those contests, which is a felony in Connecticut.
Joyce is currently facing nine criminal charges from the state’s investigation of the 2023 elections.

(Getty Images)In 2024, the max temperature in Phoenix sat at or above 100 degrees for approximately 30% of the year — and that non-stop consecutive heat has environmental advocates and doctors worried about the years to come as climate change continues to make the world and Arizona hotter.
Last year saw Arizona break a number of heat related records and Phoenix experienced 113 consecutive days of 100 degrees or hotter, the longest run ever recorded. The next highest run was set in 1993 and was 76 days, the third longest run is from 2023 at 66 days.



In fact, a number of the most recent heat-related records all come from more recent years. The top 10 for the most consecutive days with temperatures at or above 110 includes 2020, 2021 and 2022. The record was shattered in 2023, when Phoenix experienced 31 consecutive days of 110 degrees or higher heat.
This year has already had a 17-day run of temperatures exceeding 100 degrees, including seven where highs were above 110.
The records have also taken a grim toll.
While 2024 was the hottest year on record for the state, there was a slight decline in the number of heat-related deaths from the record-breaking 2023, where 645 people lost their lives in Maricopa County due to the heat. Those 645 deaths in 2023 made up more than half of all heat-related deaths reported nationally, according to Centers for Disease Control data.
Overall temperatures have been rising across the globe, contributing to what we are seeing in Arizona. The global temperature has risen by approximately 2 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, but in Phoenix you can add another 5 degrees to that number due to the urban heat island effect.

The urban heat island effect is when the temperatures in an urban area increase due to the heat retained by structures and ground coverings, lack of vegetation and other impacts of urbanization.
That heat island also leads to other environmental effects, such as more and more days where pollution lingers in the atmosphere.
A previous analysis of data from the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality showed that Phoenix in recent years has experienced more days where the level of ozone in the air exceeds health and safety standards.

For example, in 2015, Phoenix experienced 33 exceedance days for the whole year. In 2022, the region experienced 53, a 60% increase.
“We are at the epicenter of this crisis in the United States and there is nothing that kills more in regards to global warming or extreme weather than heat,” Dr. Jack Tuber, a Phoenix pulmonologist and member of the Sierra Club said to the Mirror.
A ‘People’s Hearing’ 
On a hot Thursday evening when temperatures outside were a sweltering 103 degrees, local environmental advocates, students, physicians and more were gathering at South Mountain Community College to discuss the impacts of extreme weather.
The event featured a large number of groups from the Sierra Club Grand Canyon Chapter to the Union of Concerned Scientists, and even religious leaders who have opened their doors to vulnerable populations who often find themselves endangered by extreme heat.
The event, dubbed the “People’s Hearing” on extreme heat, featured representatives of Democrats Sen. Mark Kelly and Congresswoman Yassamin Ansari. State Sen. Priya Sundareshan, a Tucson Democrat and former attorney who focused on climate issues, also attended.
While the event focused on the stories of those impacted by climate change and extreme weather, it also had another major goal: to implore policy makers to pay attention to the climate crisis and bring into focus concerns about President Donald Trump’s plans to roll back environmental protections.
Trump’s head of the EPA has vowed to eliminate regulations meant to curtail pollution, fire staffers that serve overburdened areas and push EPA scientists to approve new chemicals, moves that former and current employees have begun to voice their concerns over.
“I’m actually horrified at the administration’s planned rollbacks,” Vernon Morris, a climate scientist and Arizona State University professor. (Morris said at the event that he was speaking on behalf of himself and not the university.)

Morris voiced concerns over rollbacks to agencies like the EPA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which scientists have warned could harm weather prediction models, leading to further harms and even deaths.
“There is no precedent for what we are experiencing today,” Dr. Ryan Glaubke, a paleoclimatologist and member of the Union of Concerned Scientists, told the audience. “We are pushing the climate into uncharted territory.”
Glaubke and other scientists who spoke all agreed that climate change is real, happening and that humans are largely responsible — observations that have consensus among the scientific community.
However, how to go about addressing that crisis and helping those directly impacted by it is not as easy to answer.
‘The weight of the sun’ 
It takes less than 30 seconds of being exposed to an object that 130 to 140 degrees to get a second- or third-degree burn, according to Dr. Clifford Sheckter, a burn surgeon at the Regional Burn Center at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center in California.
Sheckter is also the Burn Prevention Committee Chair for the American Burn Association and does health policy research focusing on the prevention and health economics of burn care.
When the Mirror took the temperatures of common objects in Phoenix at midday in late June, temperatures regularly were dangerous. A sidewalk registered 136 degrees, the road was a blistering 146, a bike rack was 125 degrees, a mailbox clocked in at 136 and sand in a kid’s playground reached 131 degrees.

Those temperatures are already causing severe burns on people, particularly among the unhoused, those with drug and alcohol addiction issues and, as Sheckter pointed out, those with neuropathy.
Neuropathy is seen largely in people with diabetes and it is a condition where a person loses sensation in their hands or feet. Sheckter said they have seen patients who don’t realize they’ve burned their feet until it is too late.
The Phoenix Police Department has also come under fire for ignoring the danger of extreme heat. In June 2024, two officers held a woman down on the hot pavement leading to severe burns — and it wasn’t even the first time officers had caused similar injuries.
For the family members of people who work in the heat, though, the dangers are known to them and they’re only getting worse.
“Try to imagine the weight of the sun on your skin for 8 to 10 hours,” Jazmin Moreno, with the non-profit environmental advocacy organization Agave Community Threads, said to the crowd when speaking about her father who has worked in construction for the past 30 years. “This isn’t just weather, it is a climate crisis on full display… Climate change is real, and denying it won’t make the heat go away.”
For doctors like Sheckter and local pulmonologist Tuber, though, that crisis means an increase in certain types of cases and a new need for more education.
For burns, it means getting information to parents on how to make sure their kids are safe on playgrounds, and that those who have neuropathy are paying close attention.
“These are ways we’ve been able to save countless lives, through prevention,” Sheckter said, although he admitted that, “at the end of the day, there is no way you can force somebody to put their shoes on when they go outside.”
But for Tuber, the challenge is a bit more difficult.
Vector borne illnesses — those illnesses that are transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks and fleas — are seeing a rise due to climate change. The change in the earth’s climate has allowed for the insects that carry these diseases to spread farther and wider than ever before, impacting new populations.
Illnesses like malaria, Lyme disease and the West Nile virus have all seen their numbers increase, with climate change being cited as a major contributing factor.
Add to Arizona specifically that more heat, less rain and more building also translates to an increase in coccidioidomycosis, also known as Valley Fever, and you have what Tuber calls an “environmental disaster.”
The increase in heat is also not helpful for people’s lungs.
“The lungs are exposed, just like skin, to the ambient air temperatures, and if you are breathing drier, less moist air, you are going to be transpiring more humidity out from the lungs into the environment,” Tuber said, comparing it to like leaving a cut apple out. “There is a lot of truth to the heat causing more trouble to the lung than if there was not so much heat.”
This week, the state got its first monsoon storms of the season as the majority of the state is still under heat advisories and wildfires, made more aggressive by the drier conditions created by climate change, rage in the state.

Henry McMaster’s office said Tuesday.
More than 100 people, including 30 children, were killed when rivers in the Texas hills flooded over the weekend, inundating a girls’ summer camp along with nearby homes. At least 25 people remained missing as of Monday, though the total number unaccounted for was still unclear, The Texas Tribune reported.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott asked McMaster for the state’s help in a Monday phone call, according to the South Carolina governor’s office. McMaster obliged, deploying a specialized team from South Carolina Task Force 1, which is trained to find and, when possible, help people in all sorts of disaster scenarios.
The team includes two K-9s trained in detecting human remains through Greenville nonprofit Foothills Search and Rescue.
“Team South Carolina stands ready to offer any support we can,” McMaster said in a statement. “In some of our toughest moments, the people of Texas were there for us. Now, it’s our duty to return that support and stand by our friends in their time of need.”
Last year, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department employees traveled to South Carolina to help clean up debris left behind when Helene swept through the state as a tropical storm.
A federal mutual aid system called the emergency Management Assistance Compact helped coordinate the effort. South Carolina has long participated in the program and sends teams to help wherever disaster strikes, said Kim Stenson, director of the state’s Emergency Management Division.
“Over the years, we’ve helped coordinate assistance for incidents in Kentucky, Florida, California, Alaska, and now Texas,” Stenson said in a statement. “Our emergency response community stands ready and capable of answering the call when help is needed.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-floods-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 16:10:49.435543

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Peter Mancini leaned back in his shade-covered yellow-checkered lawn chair outside Veazie Street Elementary School Tuesday afternoon, gazing out at a parking lot filled with lawn signs, but no people.
Mancini was there to greet voters and potentially sway their choice for the open Rhode Island Senate District 4 seat before heading inside the Providence polling place. But his steamy stakeout had yielded little success, save for a sub sandwich dropped off by friends around noon.
“It’s the heat,” Mancini said of the lackluster turnout. “And, it’s a special election.”
The heat is on in R.I. Senate District 4 ahead of Tuesday’s Democratic primary

The race to fill the open seat in the district spanning North Providence and the northern part of Providence was prompted by the death of former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio. Ruggerio died in April, after representing the district for 40 years.
Four Democrats are running: North Providence Town Councilperson Stefano Famiglietti, for whom Mancini was volunteering, along with former state Rep. Marcia Ranglin-Vassell, Lenny Cioe and Manny Taveras. 
The sleepy primary appeared to fly under the radar of many of the district’s 25,000 residents, including some who showed up to vote on Tuesday. 
Rhonda Cardin, a 59-year-old North Providence retiree, cast her ballot for Famiglietti, a family friend. But, leaving the polls at Dr. Joseph A. Whelan Elementary School Tuesday afternoon, Cardin confessed she didn’t recognize the names of the other candidates on the ballot.
“I want to be able to get in touch with my senator when I have a problem, and I know Stefano will be number 1,” Cardin said.
Oyeniran Oyewale, 47, a small business owner, struggled to recall Ranglin-Vassell’s name when explaining his support for her. But Oyewale touted Ranglin-Vassell’s message of change and support for residents — seniors, children and small businesses — as the most persuasive to him.
Oyewale and Cardin were among 30 voters who cast ballots at Whelan during a 45-minute midday period as the heat index climbed to nearly 100 degrees. In the seven hours since polls opened at 7 a.m., the Mineral Spring Avenue polling place welcomed 231 voters through its doors, despite construction work that limited onsite parking, said JoAnn Chiarini-Corey, the polling place moderator.
Just 1.5 miles south at Veazie Street, 57 ballots were cast through 1 p.m., said Robert Colantonio, moderator for the polling place.
More than 22,000 voters are registered to vote in the district, including nearly 10,000 Democrats, and 9,700 unaffiliated voters — a partisan bent that puts emphasis on the Democratic primary more than the general election.

Low drama race
Colantonio cited the heat and summer schedule as factors for the low turnout. But the race has also been low drama, said Colantonio, who has worked as a local polling administrator for 20 years.
There’s been little mud-slinging — or really any interaction at all — between candidates. But on Tuesday morning, Ranglin-Vassell said she reported one of Famiglietti’s supporters to the Rhode Island Board of Elections for allegedly breaking state election rules.
A video taken by Ranglin-Vassell and shared with Rhode Island Current shows Rep. Arthur Corvese, a North Providence Democrat and Famiglietti supporter, inside the Veazie Street polling place, asking poll workers for the number of on ballots cast. Ranglin-Vassell can be heard telling him, “You’re not supposed to be here.” 
Ranglin-Vassell later explained that Corvese was intimidating poll workers, and also breaking state rules preventing anyone but candidates from wearing campaign stickers inside a polling place. 
Corvese declined to comment.
The Board of Elections has not received any formal complaints as of 3 p.m. Tuesday, said Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Board of Elections. The Providence Board of Canvassers has not received complaints either, Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, confirmed via email. 
Despite her frustration with Corvese, Ranglin-Vassell said the day was “going great,” as she greeted voters outside Whalen early Tuesday afternoon. 
The mood inside was similarly cheery, despite the lack of air conditioning. Poll workers fanned themselves and chatted about the pending forecast, which included a heat advisory and a flash flood watch. 
“That could be bad,” Chiarini-Corey said to another poll worker of the weather forecast.
Bad not just for commuters, but also candidates relying on a post-work rush to boost turnout.
Many of the midday voters were retirees, including Joel Darelius, a former maintenance supervisor for the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority. Darelius, 72, of North Providence, insisted that funding the cash-strapped public bus service should be a top priority of state lawmakers, including his new state senator.
“I think it’s ridiculous,” Darelius said of the General Assembly’s refusal to fully close the agency’s deficit. “It’s a public service.”
Bill Sullivan, 59, was fueled more by national politics in his decision to cast a ballot Tuesday. Sullivan, a former Democrat who became a Republican in 2016, had to disaffiliate in order to participate in the Democratic primary. Sullivan cast his ballot for Famiglietti, citing his history on the North Providence Town Council.
“The other people are too far left for me,” Sullivan said. “I don’t like their agenda.”
He did not give specific examples of policies he disliked among the other candidates when asked.
Voting continues through 8 p.m. Tuesday, with unofficial results from the Board of Elections expected shortly after. The winner of the primary will face the sole Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, in an Aug. 5 general election to decide who serves the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year.

Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) is working with her congressional colleagues to introduce legislation that will seek to counter China’s stranglehold on critical materials and set aside $10 billion to make it happen.
Unveiled Tuesday, the Unearth America’s Future Act was described as a means to lower costs, create jobs and ensure Michigan workers and manufacturers are leading the way in critical mineral production.
At present, the U.S. and many other nations are dependent on China for these materials, including cobalt, lithium and magnesium, which are needed in the manufacture of many high tech electronics. Stevens’ bill aims to fix that by putting money toward responsible domestic mineral production. The legislation would also support partnerships between government and private industry, with investments in innovation that would keep jobs in Michigan.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Donald Trump has pushed an agenda that puts our economy and national security at risk,” Stevens said in a statement. “They talk tough and make headlines but their policies have only caused prices to rise, weakened our manufacturing industries, and left America more dependent on China. This bill is about real results.”
Stevens’ bill would enact a three-part strategy on critical material production. It would provide direct federal incentives, focus on innovation investment and create fair labor policies around production.
The incentives would aim to boost domestic mineral production, while the investment portion would aim to drive clean and competitive manufacturing. The act is currently supported by United Steelworkers and was developed with collaboration from other labor, industry, environmental and trade organizations.
Stevens is one of several Democrats seeking the nomination next year to run for the U.S. Senate seat being opened up by the retirement of U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Township). Also in the running are state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, and former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit).",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4041632-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 16:10:49.435543

House Minority Leader Brad Jones and his colleagues will find their own work altered as a result of what President Donald Trump signed into law.
The post Sour taste as Mass. pols unpeel ‘big, beautiful bill’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE TOP REPUBLICAN in the Massachusetts House is still parsing the so-called “big, beautiful bill” that became law Friday to figure out where he lands.
House Minority Leader Brad Jones is nearly certain of one thing, though: he and his colleagues will find their own work altered as a result of what President Donald Trump signed into law.
“This [law] is, what, nearly 1,000 pages, touches on hundreds of different aspects of tax and public policy and spending policy?” Jones said in an interview Monday. “I would find it nearly impossible to think that the Legislature wouldn’t have something to do to bring us in sync, or to address something funding-wise that we view as a priority that’s now not going to be covered by the federal government.”
Top lawmakers, including Democrats who wield supermajority margins in both chambers, had their hands full over a long holiday weekend beginning to unpack one of the most significant new federal laws in decades, a package with major impacts for MassHealth, food aid, clean energy and more.
Rep. John Lawn, the point person for the House on most health care matters, said Monday he expects the new law to be “devastating” for Massachusetts — and he “do[es] not see any silver lining in these cuts.”
Hundreds of thousands of people who lose MassHealth coverage will still need care, Lawn said. He expects they will still show up in emergency rooms and “go into the free care pool,” further straining community hospitals and safety-net providers who are already struggling financially.
“The cuts will really ripple across our entire health care system,” he said.
His counterpart on the Health Care Financing Committee, Sen. Cindy Friedman, agreed.
“It’s not hyperbole to say that this bill is far from beautiful, and in fact is terrible for our economy, for our working-class residents, and for government operations of Massachusetts,” Friedman said in a statement.
Both Lawn and Friedman signaled they will have their hands full developing and navigating a legislative response — Friedman said “it will take an immense, collaborative effort to even begin to mitigate the negative impact this bill will have on just physical health here in Massachusetts” — to the Medicaid cuts.
However, Lawn said the timeline is not clear, especially because lawmakers are still trying to get a better grasp of the full scope of impacts.
“We’ve already been having discussions, but until we knew actually what the cuts would be, how we go from there will remain to be seen,” he said. “As you know, we’ve got a hospital system and health care system that’s very fragile going into this, and these cuts will really have effects downstream on our workforce, especially in our rural areas.”
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not yet released updated projections on how the final law could affect Medicaid enrollment by state. Nonprofit health policy organization KFF previously estimated the House version of the bill could cause 165,000 to 275,000 Bay Staters to lose coverage by 2034.

Food Security and Assistance
Tens of thousands of Bay Staters are also at risk of losing access to food aid.
The Massachusetts Law Reform Institute estimated that about 175,000 Bay Staters could lose some or all of their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits under the law, which according to anti-hunger group Project Bread tightens work requirements, eliminates SNAP eligibility for immigrants with legal status, and shifts a significant portion of program costs to state governments.
For about half a century, food stamp benefits have been completely funded by the federal government, while Washington and states split administrative costs evenly, according to Leran Minc, Project Bread’s director of public policy.
The new law will require states to pick up 75 percent of administrative costs and, depending on a state’s “error rate” in paying out aid, 5 percent to 15 percent of benefit costs. Minc said those two changes could together add roughly $450 million per year to the amount Massachusetts must pay per year to maintain SNAP.
“We’re very much concerned about what are we not going to be able to do, or what are we going to scale back on because we’re covering that amount,” Minc said.
“If the state ultimately decides that they can’t fund that, it’s a bit of an open question of what the federal government would do,” he added. “What’s expected is that cost-sharing, cost-shift would slide proportionally, so if the state was only able to cover half of their obligation, the federal government would likely only cover half of their obligation. That becomes a very big cut to the program, so then there have to be decisions made of, ‘How do we scale back eligibility and benefit levels?'”
Cost-sharing changes will not take effect immediately — especially if Massachusetts winds up triggering a carveout delaying implementation in states with the highest payment error rates — so there will be some time for lawmakers and Healey to craft a response plan.
Minc said Beacon Hill could also invest more to lower its payment error rate, which might lower the share of benefits that state government needs to cover.
“It would be really hard to walk away from that 85 percent and still find a way to help people meet their basic needs, so I believe once we think about all those different facts, as much as it’s a bitter pill to swallow, I feel fairly hopeful it is a pill they will swallow,” he said of the cost to cover benefits.
House and Senate Democrats in recent years have deployed state dollars to plug gaps opened up by changes to federal programs or to continue offering services once funded by the federal government, like free school meals and so-called C3 grants to early education providers.
While legislative leaders have not made any pledges yet, they’re already facing calls from advocacy groups to once again function as a financial cavalry.
“If we do not mitigate this federal damage in the Commonwealth, hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents will go hungry, get sicker, grow poorer, and struggle unnecessarily – and our local communities and economies will suffer the consequences,” said Georgia Katsoulomitis, executive director of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.
Sen. Jo Comerford, a regular advocate for enhanced food security funding through SNAP and other programs, said Monday that the “big brutal betrayal bill” represents “cuts to lifeline programs” for people across Massachusetts. She said cuts to food aid programs are particularly surprising in light of increases in food insecurity nationally.
“They’re cutting at a time when folks are struggling more,” she said.
Comerford stressed that it will take time for the impacts of the new federal law to trickle through state agencies and for issues to reveal themselves. As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Steering, Policy and Scheduling, the Northampton Democrat is involved in the Senate’s “Response 2025” effort to address changes out of Washington. She said she believes state government is “bracing for real hardships here.” 
She said she has focused on protecting Bay Staters from federal cuts and has not identified a positive from the new federal law.
“We’re all preparing for how Massachusetts responds to what happens out of Congress and we’re doing it in, I think, responsible ways as we understand that it’s going to be a range of cuts, from health care to food security to other critical programs for constituents,” she said, pointing to an $800 million cushion lawmakers built into the new state budget and the governor’s further budget cutting. “I hope that for the people I work for there isn’t pronounced or prolonged hardship. That’s what I hope will be the case. I fear that people will experience some — they certainly are experiencing anxiety right now, that’s without question. I hope we’re able to work together as the House and Senate and the administration to do the best we can in these really, really difficult circumstances for the people we serve.”
The “Largest Tax Cut in History”
The White House promoted the bill the president signed on July 4 as a “once-in-a-generation piece of legislation that makes good on his campaign promises and puts America First.” The administration said the new law features the “largest tax cut in history for middle- and working-class Americans,” a permanent increase in the Child Tax Credit for more than 40 million families, a $12.5 billion outlay to modernize air traffic control across America, federal spending cuts that total $1.5 trillion, funding for a “Golden Dome” missile defense system, and more.
“President Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill delivers on the commonsense agenda that nearly 80 million Americans voted for – the largest middle-class tax cut in history, permanent border security, massive military funding, and restoring fiscal sanity,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. “The pro-growth policies within this historic legislation are going to fuel an economic boom like we’ve never seen before.”
The bill includes a handful of policy ideas that Trump made popular last year on the campaign trail. For example, most workers will be able to deduct the first $25,000 they earn in tips annually from their taxable income through 2028. Similarly, the first $12,500 that an individual earns in overtime pay will be eligible for a deduction through the 2028 tax year.
The Joint Committee on Taxation last week estimated that, for calendar year 2027, the largest tax cut by percentage will benefit people who earn between $15,000 and $30,000, a projected 27.1 percent tax cut that translates into about $3 billion saved. By dollar amount, people who make $200,000 to $500,000 stand to benefit the most, to the tune of $51.2 billion in total tax savings (which represents a 3.5 percent cut). 
From less than $15,000 to more than $1 million, every income bracket is expected to see a tax cut under the new law, the committee said. Across the board, taxpayers can expect to save a cumulative $179.8 billion (3.8 percent) in 2027.
Bay State Republicans have been far slower than their national counterparts to embrace the new law. Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr of Gloucester was not able to provide a comment on the bill Thursday when the US House sent it to Trump and told the News Service on Monday that he was still analyzing the legislation.
“There’s not a lot to say right now,” Tarr said. When asked if he expects the federal law to be a net positive to Massachusetts, he said, “Don’t know. Not sure. That’s why it doesn’t make sense to talk right now. When we know, we’ll be happy to talk.”
Jones gave the new law a mixed review. He said some of the tax code changes, like allowing tax deductions on tips in overtime pay, could be great for some Bay Staters, but voiced concerns about cuts to Medicaid and food aid.
“I put myself in the category of TBD,” Jones told the News Service. “Depending where you are situated, tax-wise, you know, maybe it’s a big upside, at least initially. But from what I read, most of the beneficial tax things — overtime and tips — are sunsetted, so you may get a false sense of, ‘Oh, wow. This is wonderful.’ Whereas some of the things that you think have more downside are maybe more permanent.”
“If you read a lot of reports, the gap between the bookends of worst-case [and] best-case can be pretty broad,” he added.

Others, including a cadre of GOP representatives who withheld their support for the bill until the final vote, have raised concerns about what the new law will mean for federal debt. The Congressional Budget Office said last week that its estimate is that the new law will increase federal deficits by $3.4 trillion between now and 2034. 
S&P Global Ratings said states and nonprofit health care providers “are affected by new Medicaid stipulations that standardize work requirements for recipients, reduce the provider tax, and introduce other programmatic changes that could financially pressure issuers in the longer term.” 
“On the positive side, modifications to some federal income tax provisions could benefit individuals in states with high tax burdens and potentially support employees in some industries,” S&P Global Ratings Chief Analytical Officer Nora Wittstruck said.
One of the more closely-watched policy sections of the federal legislation here was a proposed 10-year ban on state-level regulation of artificial intelligence, which was removed by the US Senate before the bill went to Trump. During an appearance on WCVB’s “On The Record” Sunday, Sen. Barry Finegold talked about the need for state and federal guardrails on the technology.
“I think people really don’t understand what regulating AI means. We want artificial intelligence to grow. It is an incredible technology and it’s going to do wonderful things. But just like social media early on, we didn’t really truly understand what this thing would become,” he said, agreeing with a host that state lawmakers “missed the boat” when social media first took off. “And I think to have proper guardrails around artificial intelligence is a good thing.”
The Andover Democrat said he’s been working with state senators from New York and California on AI issues but said the country “absolutely” needs comprehensive federal regulation of AI as well.
“We don’t want to have, you know, 50 different versions of an AI bill and 50 different regulations for each state. So should this happen on the federal level? It should. Is it happening? No. The same reason why we still don’t have a federal privacy bill,” Finegold said. “So that’s why states like ours, I believe, need to step up — not to fully regulate it, but to have proper guardrails so people don’t get hurt.”
Big Weekend For Budget Action
Gov. Maura Healey signed a $60.9 billion state budget on the same day Trump signed the federal megapackage into law.
The fiscal 2026 spending plan Healey approved has a few measures built into it to absorb some federal funding changes. She vetoed $130 million, lawmakers left a roughly $800 million cushion of projected but unappropriated revenues, and the budget also deploys a larger bucket of income surtax revenues.
Healey’s team will also wait to pay roughly $125 million in earmarks until at least the fall, at which point officials hope they will have a better sense of whether that spending is feasible.
Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz said last week that his team has been examining the megabill’s impacts on Medicaid, the Massachusetts Health Connector, food aid, higher education and taxes.
Gorzkowicz said he expects to have a solid grasp on how those issue areas will affect state government and the state budget within about a month. The full impact of other provisions outside that shortlist might take longer to parse, he added.
The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation said in a report published Monday that Medicaid impacts to the state budget “could be close to $100 million” in fiscal 2026, which started July 1.
Still, the cavalcade of federal changes will not hit all at once, and the bigger impacts on the state budget might be more concentrated in subsequent fiscal years. 
Extension of many tax cuts will start this year and appear when Bay Staters file tax returns next year. Some clean energy tax credits will also end in the coming months. Reforms and restrictions on health insurance could start next year, Medicaid work requirements will not begin in most states until the end of 2026, and a major shift in federal funding toward Medicaid and food aid will not start until 2028, according to The New York Times. 
As the Times noted, the combined effect means many of the law’s tax benefits will arrive soon, while cuts will be delayed largely until after next year’s midterm elections.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A mining company released an initial assessment this week that outlines the potential for an open-pit gold mine northwest of Lead in South Dakota’s northern Black Hills.
According to Dakota Gold’s new report, its Richmond Hill project could produce between 2.6 million and 3.9 million ounces of gold over 17 to 28 years, based on an analysis of historic data from the previously mined area and 146 exploratory holes drilled in the past three years. 
The nearby Wharf Mine, operated by a different company, has produced about 3 million ounces of gold since 1982. The Homestake Mine, also nearby, produced more than 40 million ounces before it closed more than two decades ago.


Not accounting for taxes and production costs, Dakota Gold estimates the Richmond Hill mine could generate $6.1 billion to $8.7 billion worth of gold at current prices. Developing the mine would would require an estimated initial investment of $384 million.
The company expects to advance into production as soon as 2029, “firmly placing Dakota Gold as having one of the largest development gold assets in the U.S.,” said CEO Robert Quartermain in a news release. 
The company will need a large-scale mine permit from the state of South Dakota, and has already taken steps toward producing a socioeconomic study, an initial part of the permitting process. The Richmond Hill deposit sits mostly on previously mined, privately owned land, which Dakota Gold believes could streamline permitting.
The company estimates the mine could generate $400 million to $600 million in state severance taxes over its 17- to 28-year lifespan, and hundreds of jobs.
The project would be half a mile north of the Wharf Mine, which is the only operational, large-scale gold mine in the state, operated by Chicago-based Coeur Mining. The Wharf Mine is visible from the Terry Peak Ski Area.
Dakota Gold has offices in Lead and Canada. Richmond Hill is one of the company’s multiple exploratory projects in the Homestake mine region.

With the facility update, the release stated Muscatine Community College will offer a new computer numerically controlled machining program, alongside expanded welding education slots and labs and other spaces for high school students participating in a career academy.
The largest contribution to the renovation came in the form of $1 million from the State of Iowa Career Academy Incentive Fund grant, according to the release, followed by a $250,000 donation from Roy J. Carver Charitable Trust, $50,000 from HNI Charitable Foundation, $25,000 from the MCC Foundation and $10,000 from the Midwest One Foundation.
Individual donations to the project totaled $5,200, and Eastern Iowa Community Colleges matched $325,000 for local gifts.
“Our success is built on partnership,” DeWinter said in the release. “When the college identifies a need, we bring together our partners in government, business, and the community to make it happen. At the core of it all is student learning, which changes lives and builds communities.”

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava wants the state to give the county monitoring authority over the new Everglades immigrant detention center.
The mayor cited in a Tuesday letter to the state’s top legal officer the county’s ownership of the land where the detention center is located as warranting remote video access, weekly reports, and scheduled site visits.
Gov. Ron DeSantis used his authority under a 2023 emergency declaration against illegal immigration to commandeer the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport and built the detention center in eight days.
“Given the critical environmental significance of this area and the deep-rooted commitment Miami-Dade has made to properly protecting and preserving our treasured Everglades, it is imperative that local authorities maintain clear transparency in all stages of their handling,” Levine Cava wrote.

Additionally, the mayor voiced deep and growing concern about the safety of people in the custody of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in a separate Tuesday letter to Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Five people have died in ICE custody in Florida this year, three at the Krome North Service Processing Center in Miami, according to press releases from ICE.
“Detention centers like Krome and the newly opened facility in the Everglades have been placed in isolated areas with poor access to hospitals and legal counsel,” the mayor wrote.
The county received 32 calls regarding life-threatening conditions from the ICE detention center in Miami in June, Levine Cava wrote to Noem. In June 2024, there were five emergency calls.
Immigrant advocacy group wants legal action
Levine Cava’s letters come as she faces mounting criticism over the county’s response to the detention center, which the state is calling “Alligator Alcatraz,” where detainees started arriving Wednesday.
The Florida Immigrant Coalition paid for two billboards calling for Levine Cava and county officials to sue the state to stop the detention center.
“We feel that the mayor and the county commission are not just failing to protect the rights and wellbeing of the detainees and prospective detainees at the facility, which is obviously the most important thing, but they’re not also protecting the interest of Miami-Dade residents, who theoretically are the owners of this land,” said Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for FLIC.

But the county is in defense mode in a lawsuit from environmental groups, asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to halt activity at the detention center. Attorneys for the county responded to the suit from Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity on June 30 by stating that the court couldn’t force the county to take action against the state.
“State law affirmatively requires the County to use best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law, and the County’s failure to comply with that statutory duty could have dramatically adverse consequences for the public interest, including but not limited to the suspension from office of County officials elected by the voters of Miami-Dade County,” the response states.

Who’s allowed to visit?
While members of Congress can conduct oversight visits at federal immigration detention facilities, it’s not clear who will enjoy the same authority over the detention center in the Everglades. The Trump administration recently changed the policy governing Congressional visits to detention centers, requiring 72-hour notice, according to Axios.
Officers guarding the site denied entrance to a group of state Democratic lawmakers Thursday.
“This is a blatant abuse of power and an attempt to conceal human rights violations from the public eye,” wrote Democratic Sens. Carlos Guillermo Smith and Shevrin Jones and Reps. Michele Rayner, Angie Nixon, and Anna Eskamani in a press release Thursday.
A spokesperson for the Florida Division of Emergency Management, which is in charge of the detention center, wrote in an email to Florida Phoenix that the lawmakers were turned away because the center is not under the jurisdiction of the Florida Department of Corrections, and that statute only allows visits for legislative committees.
“Florida Statutes grants inspection authority to a legislative committee, not to individual legislators engaging in political theater,” wrote Stephanie Hartman, FDEM’s deputy director of communications. “This distinction is crucial for ensuring that oversight is conducted through formal, established legislative processes.”
FDEM, DHS, and the attorney general’s office didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment regarding Levine Cava’s letters.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)University of Wisconsin system campuses will raise their undergraduate tuition by a maximum of 5% next year, under a plan UW President Jay Rothman announced Tuesday. 
The announcement comes just days after the state Legislature passed and Gov. Tony Evers signed a state budget that includes increased investments in the system by over $200 million for operational costs and over $800 million for capital projects. While the increases took a different direction from Republican’s proposed cuts, they are nowhere near the $855 million operational budget increase initially requested by the system last year when Rothman warned that tuition increases would be on the table if there wasn’t significant investment. 
Rothman said in a statement that the state’s universities have become dependent on tuition due to lagging state funding over many years, but the “turnaround” from proposed cuts to the state investing in the budget will help “preserve access and affordability” for students and families. 
“Preserving quality while maintaining our ability to be a leader on tuition affordability in the Midwest is a top priority,” Rothman said. “After a decade of a tuition freeze and lagging state aid, we believe we have struck a balance for students and families with this proposal and the recent state investments in the UWs as part of the 2025-27 biennial budget.”
Rothman will ask the UW Board of Regents to approve a 4% increase at all campuses for the 2025-26 year. 
Individual campuses would also have the option under his proposal of implementing an additional 1% increase. All universities except UW-Green Bay plan to adopt that. UW-River Falls is also seeking to increase its tuition even further by 5.8% to support “ student success initiatives.” 
Under the proposal, nonresident undergraduate tuition at each campus would increase by the same percentage or dollar amount. 
The system noted that most of the increases approved in the state budget are for specific purposes, including virtual mental health services, wage increases and addressing staff recruitment and retention. 
State funding today makes up about a fifth of the UW’s total revenue. The UW system’s 2023-25 biennial budget was $13.7 billion with 58% of that coming from program revenue, 24% from the federal government and 18% from general purpose revenue. 
In 1984-85, state general purpose revenue made up 41.8% of the UW System’s budget. 
According to the UW system, the average increase when segregated fees and room and board costs are included would be 3.8%. 
If approved, the increase will be the third consecutive year of tuition increases for UW since the end of a 10-year tuition freeze in 2023. The system said its tuition increased just 7.7% from 2015 to 2025, below the tuition increases for its peers in other states that had increases ranging from  21.7% to 28.8% over the 10 years.
The UW Board of Regents will consider the plan on July 10.
Here are the proposed resident undergraduate tuition costs for 2025-26 at each campus:

UW-Eau Claire: $10,067
UW-Green Bay: $8,985

June 28, 2025 | Photo by Leah Craig/Michigan AdvanceThe sweeping and draconian cuts to Medicaid by the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have left healthcare advocates around the country reeling. 
At a virtual press conference hosted Tuesday by the Protect MI Care coalition, policy experts, advocates, and stakeholders contextualized what changes in the recently enacted “big, beautiful” bill will mean for Michiganders. 
“By passing this bill, members of Congress have chosen to rip away healthcare from millions of Americans,” Monique Stanton, president and CEO of the Michigan League for Public Policy said. “Hundreds of thousands of Michigan residents, including kids, seniors in nursing homes, people with disabilities, all stand to lose coverage, lose access to services, or face longer wait times because of these tax cuts.”
CEO of Michigan Health and Hospital Association Brian Peters explained that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts that federal funding for Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program will undergo a $1.02 trillion reduction by 2034. The budget office later clarified that this reduction stems from a revised enrollment estimate,  anticipating 79.5 million Medicaid beneficiaries by 2034 instead of the previously projected 90 million.
Peters went on to state that the effects of this legislation will be far-reaching as the reductions won’t just impact Medicaid beneficiaries; they’ll affect all patients.

Essentially, hospitals and healthcare providers rely on the federal funding disbursed through Medicaid to fund critical services and patient care. This is made possible by the Medicaid provider tax program, which allows states to maximize healthcare funding by levying taxes on providers instead of taxing citizens. 
Elizabeth Hertel, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, explained that if 40% of a county’s residents are Medicaid beneficiaries, 40% of that hospital’s revenue comes from Medicaid.
“Our hospitals and our providers will face limiting services or closing locations, and healthcare workers will lose their jobs when a hospital or provider limits services or closes,” Hertel added. “They don’t stop seeing patients who have Medicaid. They stop seeing everybody who lives in or visits that community.”
For Michigan hospitals, Peters noted, that’s a loss of more than $6 billion in funding over the next decade. 
The future of Medicaid has effectively been shifted to individual states, many of which may have to begin either limiting Medicaid benefits, lowering the rates they pay providers, or stiffening eligibility requirements so that fewer people will qualify for coverage.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

Hospitals typically work with three to five-year strategic plans, which means that, while these changes aren’t set to take effect immediately, healthcare providers must make crucial staffing and budgeting decisions sooner rather than later. 
State legislatures are likely to be in a similar position. To Peters, the potential for future disruption is a present call to action. 
“I think there’s the opportunity in the here and now, working with our state officials, our state lawmakers, and certainly at the federal level as well, to create new legislation, new policies that can help the provider community and the healthcare community,” Peters said. He went on to add that he looks forward to working with partners in the state government to mitigate the impact of this new legislation.

“We’ve been following up with them, and we’re going to continue to do so,” Morrisey said. “I’m going to get back to the office and launch another call there, because we’re going to push.”
Nine people from Ohio County died in flash flooding caused by heavy rain that began June 14. The flooding also caused an apartment building in Fairmont to collapse, displacing more than two dozen residents. 
Morrisey formally requested a federal disaster declaration for Marion and Ohio counties June 20, but Donald Trump’s administration has yet to grant the declaration. Disaster declarations allow affected areas assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, depending on the circumstances. 
Trump on Sunday approved a disaster declaration for the state of Texas, where flash floods killed at least 104 people last week. 
Morrisey’s comments were in response to a question from Ogden News reporter Steven Allen Adams after a press conference Tuesday at Yeager International Airport, in Charleston.

  A joint investigation by The Independent and MuckRock.
After years of mourning family and friends who succumbed to aggressive cancers, activists in Missouri finally won federal recognition that radiation released during the development of nuclear weapons is to blame.
Since the publication of a six-month investigation by The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has pressed for Missourians to be included among the states where residents are eligible for compensation. The provision extending help to the St. Louis region, where uranium was processed for the first atomic bombs, New Mexico, where the first bombs were produced and tested, and six other states, was finally included in the massive budget reconciliation bill signed Saturday by President Donald Trump.
“We blinked and after 13 years of being in the dark, we were in the sun,” Dawn Chapman, co-founder of Just Moms STL, said in an interview with The Independent.
Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

The passage was celebrated as a victory in a news conference in a St. Louis County park adjacent to Coldwater Creek, contaminated by radioactive waste since 1949.
Hawley and Chapman were joined by Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and activists from around the country to get the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act renewed and expanded. The law, originally passed in 1990, lapsed in 2024.
“It’s a tremendous privilege to be with these heroes who are beside me and behind me,” Hawley said as he opened the news conference.
The people who lived in the areas now eligible for compensation have waited far too long for help, Hawley said.
“The truth is, it wasn’t just the people of Missouri who had waited for 70 years to have justice done,” Hawley said. “It was the people of the Navajo Nation. It was the people of Utah, it was the people of New Mexico, it was the people of Idaho, it was the uranium miners and atomic veterans from all over the country who had been waiting for decades for the federal government to finally own up to what it had done.”
The Navajo Nation has suffered from fallout swept by winds onto its Arizona lands from nuclear weapons tests, Nygren said. More than 100 uranium mines were on reservation land and, in 1979, the Church Rock Spill, the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history, poured 94 million gallons of radioactive waste into the Puerco River.
“People were devastated because their livestock, their cattle, their land, their water resources were extremely affected,” Nygren said.
All of New Mexico’s downwinders could be compensated under Senate’s ‘big, beautiful bill’

Under the provisions included in the budget bill, Missourians who contracted one of 20 cancers, including lung or breast cancer, after living in any of 21 zip codes for at least two years are eligible for compensation. Leukemia is also covered, but only if it occurred at least 20 years after residence in the designated areas.
In addition to Missouri, the budget bill allows compensation for radiation exposure related to the Manhattan Project in 14 zip codes in Tennessee, two zip codes in Alaska and three in Kentucky. New Mexico is included among the states where fallout spreading downwind from atomic and nuclear tests contaminated the land. The downwind areas, in Arizona, Nevada and Utah in the original compensation act, now include New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho and Montana.
New Mexico delegation, radiation victims renew call for compensation

Missouri is also working to identify if other areas are contaminated.
During this year’s legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill expanding the state’s ability to find radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region. The measure, which Gov. Mike Kehoe has indicated he will sign Thursday, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land and removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation.
The celebration of the bill’s passage is clouded by the memories of people who died without compensation or acknowledgement that nuclear material caused their deaths, Chapman said at the news conference.
“The hard thing today, and why it’s so heavy, is there’s so many people that should be behind us, that have already passed on,” she said. “There’s many people from the Navajo nation that have passed on, that were part of this fight, that are not here to be recognized.Our government made it harder. They did everything they could to hide the truth from us.”
The compensation can cover medical costs for people who are still alive, or they can elect to receive a single payment of $50,000. Family members of people who died of one of the listed cancers are eligible for a one-time payment of $25,000, to be divided equally among the living heirs.
The compensation for people who lived downwind of nuclear tests or worked in uranium mining was increased to $100,000.
The money will help people pay for treatments and expenses not usually covered by insurance, Chapman said.
“When you look at this list of cancers, and you look at the cancers that people are getting in North County, they’re horribly aggressive,” she said. “And we have great hospitals and cancer centers here, but what we do not have is the ability for a mom who’s already used up all of her parental leave, her family medical leave, to take extra time off with her child.’
The new federal legislation sets the starting date for possible exposure at 1949, a key date uncovered in the joint investigation by The Independent and its reporting partners.
Giving The Independent access to the documents obtained through years of federal Freedom of Information Act requests was “one of the scariest, riskiest things that we did, and it is the thing that ended up paying off the most,” Chapman said. “It is the thing that launched RECA, when Sen. Hawley read the story and saw the documents that you guys put up.”
The documents showed that during the war, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium for the Manhattan Project, the name given to the effort to build the bomb, in downtown St. Louis. Uranium from the Mallinckrodt plant was used in the first sustained nuclear reaction in Chicago, a significant breakthrough.
An internal Mallinckrodt memo from 1949 shows the company was storing highly radioactive residue called K-65 in deteriorating steel drums at the St. Louis airport near Coldwater Creek. The material was so dangerous, the memo said, that Mallinckrodt couldn’t simply put it in new containers because “the hazards to the workers involved in such an occupation would be considerable.”
Efforts to find a buyer for the waste resulted in a sale in 1965, and within a few years, most of the waste was sold and moved just up the road to a site on Latty Avenue in Hazelwood where it, again, sat exposed to the elements and adjacent to Coldwater Creek.
In early 2024, more than 70 years after workers first realized barrels of radioactive waste risked contaminating Coldwater Creek, the federal government put up signs warning residents. Cleaning up the creek carries a cost estimated at $400 million.
“We are here today in the very park that made me sick,” said Karen Nickel, a co-founder of Just Moms STL. “I grew up on that street right there, a place where I played as a child, never knowing the danger from radioactive atomic bomb waste.”
Nickel has lupus and other auto-immune diseases she believes were caused by the radiation but her illnesses are not covered in the compensation act expansion. She doesn’t regret the hard work, even if it won’t help her, she said.
“I feel like the little girl who got sick here didn’t suffer in vain,” Nickel said. “This moment is bittersweet. It’s victory wrapped in grief. But I also hope that no other community has to wait this long to be heard.” 
The waste was spread by efforts to remove it. After extracting valuable metals from the bomb waste, the buyer, Cotter Corp. initially received permission to use a pit at the Weldon Spring quarry in St. Charles County, which was already a disposal site for other radioactive waste.
After that decision was reversed over concerns that radiation was already leaking from the quarry, over a period of 2 ½ months in the summer and fall of 1973, Cotter took the problem into its own hands, without telling government regulators.
The company mixed the radioactive waste with tens of thousands of tons of contaminated soil from the site and illegally dumped it in a free, public landfill called West Lake, under three feet of soil and other garbage.
The landfill was declared a federal toxic Superfund site in 1990. In 2010, a subsurface smoldering event, similar to an underground fire, at the Bridgeton Landfill threatened the radioactive waste buried in the since-closed Westlake Landfill nearby. That fire sent noxious and hazardous fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. The company in charge of the Bridgeton Landfill now spends millions a year to contain it.
At the news conference, activists from across the country who lost family members told a part of their story and their fight for recognition and compensation.
Maggie Billiman, whose father Howard Billiman was a Navajo code talker in World War II, said her family lives downwind from where 100 nuclear weapons were tested. He died of stomach cancer in 2001.
“When we heard RECA was passed, we cried for happiness,” Billiman said.
Sherrie Hanna of Prescott, Arizona, said she lost both her husband and her father to cancer and received compensation under the act before it expired in 2024. She was worried it would not be renewed, Hanna said.
“For many of us downwinders, myself included, the question is not if we will receive a cancer diagnosis but when,” Hanna said.
To get the renewal and expansion passed, Hawley said he had to overcome resistance among Republicans to new federal spending and find legislation that had to pass to carry it.
“It happened because it’s justice,” Hawley said. “But there’s more to do.”

Danny Alvarez, state Sen. Jay Collins, Rep. Karen Pittman Gonzalez, and Rep. Michael Owen in Tampa on July 7, 2025. (Photo by Don Kruse for the Florida Phoenix)Hillsborough County Republican state lawmakers fielded questions from supporters regarding the increasing cost of living in Florida on Monday night as they held a recap of the just-concluded 2025 legislative session.
Sen. Jay Collins and Reps. Danny Alvarez, Karen Gonzalez Pittman, and Michael Owen fielded queries on a host of other topics as well, such as concerns about chemtrail sightings and alleged voting irregularities, during the hour-plus meeting in Tampa.
Other topics that have dominated the headlines from Tallahassee this year — from immigration to the enmity that developed between Gov. Ron DeSantis and fellow GOP member of the Florida House — went untouched during the proceeding.
Affordability remains front and center among Floridians, encapsulated by one Republican in the audience who asked what the lawmakers were doing on property insurance, property taxes, and auto insurance rates.
Regarding property insurance, Rep. Danny Alvarez described how just weeks after he was elected in 2022, he confronted the topic in Tallahassee.
“The very first vote I ever took was in a special session where I was told that if I voted on this bill, the insurance rates would go down and our crisis would stop,” he said. “That was partially true.”
That vote did stabilize reinsurance rates, Alvarez said, but “we weren’t told all the truth when we voted.”
That was a reference to a Tampa Bay Times report that emerged during this year’s session that insurers claiming financial ruin following Hurricane Irma in 2017 and Hurricane Michael in 2018 had paid $680 million in dividends to shareholders while simultaneously funneling billions to affiliated companies.
“So, I voted on something without all the information,” he told the audience.
Subsequently, “for the first time in a long, long time” legislators began using their oversight authority in committee hearings, calling upon the sitting and former state insurance commissioners to testify about why they didn’t bring more attention to a 2022 report detailing money transfers from Florida insurers to out-of-state affiliates.
“I was told that people were dying on the vines and were going to run away from Florida, when in reality all they had done was shift their money to their secondary companies that were making billions of dollars while we suffer,” Alvarez said. “That was completely unfair, and we are righting that wrong.”
Lawmakers in the House did introduce a proposal (HB 881) this session that would have required property insurers to demonstrate that fees, commissions, and other payments to affiliates were fair and reasonable. But that measure died in committee.
Property taxes
Both Gonzalez Pittman and Owen are serving on the 37-member House Select Committee on Property Taxes. That’s the group slated to meet throughout the year to devise a strategy for how the state could wean itself off property taxes without suffering a major reduction in revenues. That work is expected to help inform lawmakers, who have already said that they intend to place a constitutional amendment on the 2026 statewide ballot to repeal property taxes.
Owen, a freshman lawmaker who previously served on the Hillsborough County Commission, said that although some counties don’t rely so much on property taxes to fund important services, others like Hillsborough essentially “run” through that revenue source. He dismissed some of the ideas that have already been proposed in the committee so far, but said he would not do anything that would essentially “defund the police.”
“What I’m saying is, we will have to come up with another solution to pay for our first responders if we are going to [remove] property taxes from Hillsborough County because it’s such a great percentage of what we use to pay our first responders,” he said. “I’m not saying that we can’t get it done. I’m saying that’s a heavy lift.”
Another member of the audience asked the lawmakers about escalating energy costs — the average energy bill went up by more than 50% between 2018 and 2023.
“What is your opinion on TECO and the never-ending increases that we’re all experiencing right now?” the Hillsborough Republicans were asked. “And why isn’t there any competition coming?”
The legislators had little substantive to say about the issue, with Alvarez noting that Florida public utilities can raise their rates only if approved by the Public Service Commission (PSC). He and Sen. Collins said a possible remedy to address the state’s growing energy needs could come from small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), listed in a feasibility report written by the PSC earlier this year. “It’s something that we should be at the very forefront of,” said Collins.
Alvarez acknowledged that such technology is “probably over 10 years away.”
Chemtrails
One audience member asked the four Republicans, “When will we stop seeing the chemtrails?” That was a reference to a bill banning weather-modification projects recently signed into law by Gov. DeSantis and that just went into effect last week.
Although such projects exist, what many people consider chemtrails are actually harmless “contrails” (for condensation) caused by freezing water vapor emitted by jet engines.
“People should be able to contact law enforcement and make sure that those flights do not take off and, if they are, when they land, they’re given a citation,” Gonzalez Pittman said.
The lawmakers stayed clear of opining too much when asked by another member of the audience about an allegation by a Republican congressional challenger to Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor of  “substantial” voting irregularities in their race last fall, which Castor won by more than 15 points. The questioner asked if they would look at “overturning this election.”
The Republicans bobbed and weaved regarding the question, with Collins ultimately pivoting to how strong voting integrity protections are in Florida and how DeSantis recruited him to run for the Legislature, and not Congress, which he originally intended to do in 2021.
He said the governor persuaded him to run in the Senate District 14 race (in which he defeated Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz by 10 points), promising, ‘”You’ll get more done in a year than you would in 20 years in Congress.'”
“And the man didn’t lie. He was 100% right,” Collins said.
Collins is considered a leading candidate to become the next lieutenant governor. DeSantis said last week he would make his long awaited appointments for both that position and for the chief financial officer seat “in relatively short order” following the July 4 holiday weekend.
Topics not on the agenda
Not discussed was the Hope Florida Foundation. Prosecutors have opened an investigation into the nonprofit program initiated by Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis. In April, state lawmakers began investigating $10 million in “donations” it received from a Medicaid overpayment settlement.
Shortly after the legislative session broke in early May while lawmakers continued to work on the state budget, Gonzalez Pittman passed out a flow chart in a meeting with constituents showing where that flow of that money had moved around, ultimately landing with political committees that spent the money opposing the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis last year.
That display had angered the governor, who blasted the South Tampa lawmaker a week later during a Hope Florida event in Brandon, saying that she had “took propaganda that was done by far-left Democrats,” and adding that she had done a “poor job as the representative from South Tampa.”
The evening was marked by numerous references to how the Republicans now represented the “red” county of Hillsborough, whose shift to the right over the past five years has been echoed across Florida. Less than five years ago, county voters went for Joe Biden by more than six percentage points over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election, while re-electing State Attorney Andrew Warren by more than six points.
Flash forward to last November, when Trump bested Kamala Harris by three points and Warren, running after being suspended for two years by DeSantis, fell short in his bid to recapture the state attorney’s office by more than five percentage points.

(Danielle Prokop, Source NM)New Mexico justices Tuesday morning denied Tesuque Village residents’ emergency petition in a dispute over a proposed sewage permit for a nearby resort and development.
Chief Justice David Thomson delivered the ruling from the bench after a short deliberation, saying the arguments made by residents failed to meet the bar for the high court to intervene in an emergency fashion. Thomson also allowed administrative hearings on the permit to resume. The court had previously paused them until they could hear arguments from the parties.
Earlier this year, the New Mexico Environment Department approved a draft permit for Bishop’s Lodge and a nearby development in Tesuque to discharge up to 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two disposal fields on the property.
Tensions have been building for the last year, as dozens of residents in the village of about 1,000 have opposed multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort. In April, attorneys for the nonprofit Protect Tesuque filed an emergency petition. In asking the high court to weigh in, Protect Tesuque claimed the state regulators’ permitting actions violated the state constitution and said the permit would threaten water quality downstream.
New Mexico Supreme Court asked to weigh in on Tesuque wastewater conflict

Both NMED and owners of Bishop’s Lodge maintain the permitting process’ validity and both have said the treated wastewater quality exceeds state and federal standards. Both argued Protect Tesuque’s claims did not meet the threshold of an emergency, needlessly interrupted the permitting process and requested a lower standard of safety requirements.
The panel of five justices asked questions of all parties during the 50-minute hearing, but appeared skeptical regarding Protect Tesuque’s stance.
For instance, justices remarked that given that no final decision has yet been made regarding the permit, residents still have avenues to appeal in the administrative process, making emergency intervention by the state Supreme Court unnecessary.
Attorney Tom Hnasko, who represented Protect Tesuque, said he doesn’t know what comes next. “We’ll have to regroup,” he told Source NM after the hearing.
Rusty Day, a board member at Protect Tesuque, said after the hearing he was “disappointed at the delay,” and said the group would seek a potential appeal in the administrative process.
“They didn’t rule on the merits, so now we need to wait, months, if not years to get a dispositive ruling on the merits,” Day said.
Leadership at Juniper Capital, which owns Bishop’s Lodge resort, issued a statement Tuesday saying they appreciated the court’s ruling.
“Bishop’s Lodge will continue using its state-of-the-art Membrane BioReactor wastewater treatment facility to fully treat effluent from the hotel and adjacent homes under the existing permit from the department,” said Chris Kaplan, the head of asset management, in a statement. “We continue to exercise good environmental stewardship and water conservation for the benefit of our guests, residents and the entire Tesuque Valley.”
State environment officials did not immediately respond to a request from Source NM on the next steps for the administrative hearings. This story will be updated as needed.

Samuel Corum/Getty Images (file photo)The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned plans for mass layoffs but still anticipates the exit of 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year. 
Previous downsizing goals aimed to return the agency to 2019-level staffing of roughly 398,000 employees, which would represent the loss of about 70,000 jobs and a 15% overall decrease. A Monday announcement claimed the new reduction goal would be done through attrition from voluntary early retirements, deferred resignations and a federal hiring freeze.
As of Jan. 1, the VA had roughly 484,000 employees. Just six months later, the number of employees had shrunk to 467,000. This reduction of nearly 17,000 employees is expected to be followed by the exit of around 12,000 additional employees by Sept. 30.
Monday’s announcement cited numerous VA performance improvements under President Donald Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins. Collins, a longtime Trump ally and former Georgia congressman, was sworn in as the 12th secretary of Veterans Affairs earlier this year after a presidential appointment. The Trump administration touted steps to end treatment for gender dysphoria, stop more than $14 million in DEI spending as cost-cutting measures and other savings. 
“Since March, we’ve been conducting a holistic review of the department centered on reducing bureaucracy and improving services to Veterans,” Collins said in a statement. “As a result of our efforts, VA is headed in the right direction — both in terms of staff levels and customer service. A department-wide RIF is off the table, but that doesn’t mean we’re done improving VA.”
The VA reductions come at a time of short staffing for the agency’s Georgia locations. Last month U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff pressed Collins to fill positions at Atlanta’s VA medical center to reduce long wait times affecting veterans’ care. A June Inspector’s General report found that there were 208 primary care vacancies at the Atlanta VA. 
The VA officials have said reductions will not impact veteran care or benefits. More than 350,000 positions are exempt from the federal hiring freeze and all VA mission-critical positions are exempt from the Deferred Resignation Program and Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation.
The VA has also promised additional changes to improve operational efficiency, including consolidating administrative functions such as call centers and payroll systems.

Nashville had the fifth-highest reported gun theft rate in 2022, with 210 incidents per 100,000 residents. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)This story originally appeared on Stateline. 
A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Dugan has been indicted on charges that she helped an immigrant without legal status who came to her courtroom for a hearing on a misdemeanor charge evade federal immigration authorities. 
Dugan was arrested in April and indicted in May. She’s pleaded not guilty to charges of concealing an individual to prevent arrest and obstruction. 
The case has become an example of the Trump administration’s effort to punish judicial interference with its escalation of immigration enforcement. In April, 31-year-old Eduardo Flores-Ruiz was in Dugan’s courtroom when federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Drug Enforcement Agency and FBI arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse to arrest him. 
Prosecutors say Dugan helped Flores-Ruiz out a side doorway to avoid arrest but the doorway Dugan led Flores-Ruiz and his attorney use led to the same hallway in which the agents were waiting and one took the elevator down with them. Flores-Ruiz was arrested on the street outside. 
In May, Dugan had filed a motion to dismiss the charges against her, arguing she is immune from prosecution because she was acting in her official capacity as a judge and that the arrest violated Wisconsin’s sovereignty as a state by disrupting a state court hearing and prosecuting a state judge. 
On Monday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph recommended that the motion to dismiss be denied. The final decision on dismissal is up to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman, who does not need to follow Joseph’s recommendation. 
“We are disappointed in the magistrate judge’s non-binding recommendation, and we will appeal it,” Dugan attorney Steven Biskupic, a former federal prosecutor, said in a statement. “This is only one step in what we expect will be a long journey to preserve the independence and integrity of our courts.”
In her recommendation, Joseph wrote that judicial immunity applies when a judge is being sued for civil damages, not criminal charges. 
“A judge’s actions, even when done in her official capacity, does not bar criminal prosecution if the actions were done in violation of the criminal law,” she wrote.

Navarrete Villegas holds a B.A. in global studies with a minor in psychology from Saint Leo University in Florida and a master’s degree in bilingual journalism from the City University of New York’s Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
Her first day at CT Mirror was Monday.
CT Mirror’s Manager of Membership Irene Mackey chatted with Navarrete Villegas about her plans for her new role. Their conversation is below:
CT Mirror: What drew you to CT Mirror and the role of Community Engagement Reporter?
Navarrete Villegas: What drew me to CT Mirror was its commitment to in-depth, transparent policy reporting that not only informs readers but also holds the government accountable. As a bilingual journalist passionate about bottom-up journalism, I was excited by the opportunity to connect directly with Hartford communities through engagement-driven reporting that centers voices often left out of mainstream coverage.
CT Mirror: Hartford, like many cities, has communities that feel overlooked or misrepresented by traditional media. How will you build relationships with residents and earn their trust as a new voice in local journalism?
Navarrete Villegas: I will build relationships with residents and earn their trust by being present in the third spaces they gather at, by providing resources whenever they need them and by explaining when and how policies affect their everyday lives. I believe trust is built through consistency, listening without judgment and showing up even when there’s no story to file. For me, it’s important that through the relationships we build, they see me not just as a reporter, but as Mariana.
CT Mirror: Community focused journalism often blends reporting with resource-sharing. How will you determine when a story should answer a question, surface a systemic issue, or guide the reader toward action?
Navarrete Villegas: I will determine when a story should inform, reveal, or guide by listening with no assumptions, closely to the communities’ concerns, identifying gaps in access to information, and assessing what’s most useful at the moment. 
CT Mirror: CT Mirror has historically focused on state policy. How do you plan to connect city-specific concerns to broader state policy issues?
Navarrete Villegas: State policy affects the daily lives of people at a local level. Hence, I plan to connect city-specific concerns by identifying how local challenges, like housing, health care, or education, are shaped by decisions made in the Capitol. By grounding policy reporting in residents’ lived experiences, I can help bridge the gap between legislation and everyday impact.
CT Mirror: What are you most excited to learn or experience as you embed yourself in Hartford’s neighborhoods?
Navarrete Villegas: I’m most excited to learn about how communities in Hartford build systems of care for one another and how they stay connected across generations and neighborhoods. I’m also eager to experience their artistic expressions and the foods that bring people together.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mariana-Navarrete39-copy-1024x1024.png,,,2025-07-08 17:06:57.263546

This excerpt, which Reardon wrote in 2023 on the anniversary of the 2008 presidential debate hosted at Ole Miss, recalls a rare moment of relative political harmony. 

Fifteen years ago yesterday, I was thinking, “What the hell have I gotten myself into?”
It had started months earlier when Chancellor (Robert) Khayat, Vice Chancellor Gloria Kellum and Provost Carolyn Staton assigned me to work with student leaders to plan student activities to go along with the 2008 presidential debate between Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain. My friend, Dr. Andy Mullins, had worked arduously to make sure that Ole Miss would put on a first-class affair. I recruited Jennifer Taylor, director of student programming, and her assistant, Bradley Baker, to assist with the students. We were lucky to have Dave Brooks, a production consultant from Cleveland, Ohio, advise and assist us. We couldn’t have done it without him.
I remember distinctly our first meeting with the students when all kinds of ideas were being tossed around. Our student group represented a cross section of the Ole Miss campus, and they were lively and creative. Eventually, they decided to host a week-long series of events and cap it off with a “festival” in The Grove on the day of the debate. 
I also remember sitting in a meeting in the Lyceum boardroom around what has to be the longest table in north Mississippi with administrators, PR folks, maintenance and landscape crews, communication and tech folks, law enforcement leaders and others responsible for assuring that Ole Miss put on a first-class event. When it came my time to give a report on the student events, I said, “Well, the students are planning a festival in The Grove with music and food and speakers.” After Dr. Kellum and Provost Staton looked at me with a “Have you lost your mind?” gaze, I went on to report what the students were planning. I’m sure that most around the table were envisioning a football Saturday with copious amounts of alcohol, blue blazers, chandeliers, fried chicken and fisticuffs. I wish that I could remember all the outstanding students who worked so hard to make the festival happen. Students like Caleb Herod, Anna Rogers, Sarah Rogers, Jake McGraw, Tyler Craft, Tyler Rose Clemons, Kent Ford and others put together a great plan. The event would be an effort to draw attention to the importance of voting and the importance of having free and open dialogue about the election. The students planned for music, food, high-tech displays, voter registration, and providing a forum for dialogue. And, having fun on a day without classes.
We ended up with a strong line-up of music with the North Mississippi All Stars, Josh Kelley, Paul Thorn, Saving Abel, the Mayhem String Band, the Kudzu Kings and the Ole Miss Gospel Choir. I recruited my former student Ben Campbell, award-winning radio disc jockey from KNIX in Phoenix, to emcee. He was funny as always and even revived his imitation of me doing Tone Loc. We started at noon with an amazing acapella solo rendition of the national anthem by a member of the Ole Miss Gospel Choir, and when they finished their set with “O, Happy Day,” I was feeling pretty good about things and thinking, “Wow. This is gonna be good.”

My friend and food expert extraordinaire John T Edge helped us bring to The Grove some of the South’s all-star foodies. We had Newk’s with pimento cheese and caramel cake and sweet tea, Taylor Grocery with fried catfish plates, Jim and Nick’s of Birmingham with barbecue, Taqueria del Sol of Atlanta with tacos and Chef John Folse and Company out of New Orleans with a variety of Cajun dishes. The food was outstanding, but we ran into one little problem. The state of Mississippi Tax Commission showed up about 20 minutes before serving was to begin and demanded that all these businesses provide tax IDs or they wouldn’t be able to serve. Evidently, some uninvited entity had their feelings hurt and reported us to the tax commission. I was riding around in a golf cart with Mississippi’s treasured cartoonist Marshall Ramsey when I got a call about the situation. John T and I tried everything we could think of to get the tax deputies to allow us to go on with the event. I ended up reaching out to Gloria Kellum, asking for her help in getting in touch with “someone in charge.” As it turned out, she was right beside Gov. Haley Barbour at the time. After a quick chat with him, she told me to hold on — help was on the way.
About 10 minutes later the governor’s chief of staff showed up, and I watched from a distance as he had a quick conversation with the tax deputies. Only he spoke as they listened and soon walked away. He looked at us, gave us a thumbs up and lunch was served. We had permission to proceed. It helps to know someone who knows someone. Catfish, tacos, pimento cheese, sweet tea, caramel cake, barbecue, gumbo and jambalaya for all!
I was unsure how the tech displays would be received. Boy, was I surprised when there were long lines all day for the mobile buses and booths from Dell, FedEx, Apple, Cellular South (C Spire) and Microsoft. There were virtual reality displays, new technology, video games and lots of other neat stuff that was well beyond this digital immigrant’s understanding.
The Rock the Vote tent for voter registration was busy all day. They had become a great, valued partner in sponsoring the festival and were excited about the number of students who registered to vote that day.
There were also speakers, most who were stumping for a candidate or for themselves. There were personalities everywhere. Harry Smith did CBS’s The Early Show from the union early that morning. Chris Matthews set up Hardball on the Union Plaza. Katie Couric was everywhere and dropped by the Tri Delt house to visit her sorority. Sean Hannity set up in the union. It was a big day for Ole Miss to be seen by the nation and the world.
What gave the whole affair legitimacy was a concept that the students came up with called “Issue Alley.” Along the sidewalk that leads into The Grove from Farley Hall were designated spaces where groups with agendas could set up. This turned out to be a huge success. The lion lay down with the lamb. The NRA set up next to pro-choice groups. We had the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians setting up next to Rednecks for Obama. We had windmills promoting clean energy. All in all, we had about 30 organizations and associations represented. No one hit anyone or called each other names.
Around 5:30, I got a call to let me know that there was a ticket to the debate available for me if I wanted it. I chose to pass. I was where I wanted to be.
As The Grove darkened and the North Mississippi All Stars rocked their last song, two large screens on either side of The Grove came to life with the logo of the presidential debate. I’m no Sean Spicer, but I’m estimating that there were approximately eight to ten thousand in The Grove that night watching the debate. I pulled my golf cart well behind the crowd and watched from afar. There was a diverse crowd mixed with town folks, families, students and visitors. I don’t remember any booing or arguing or demonstrating. 
That day in The Grove there were no fights; there was no shouting. No one called anyone names. There were those on the Left and those on the Right, but they were sitting next to and across from one another eating fried catfish or gumbo and drinking sweet tea. We provided news outlets a beautiful, positive Ole Miss backdrop for their reporting. There were White folks and Black folks and folks from far away. There were young folks and old folks. There were no arrests. And, as the debate wound down and as PBS NewsHour host and debate moderator Jim Lehrer said, “And good night from Ole Miss,” I thought to myself that this is the way it is supposed to be.
It’s hard to believe that just 10 years ago might be considered “the good old days,” but they were. 
And that was the best day that I ever had at Ole Miss.

Sparky Reardon was dean of students at Ole Miss from 2000-2014. During Reardon’s 36-year tenure at the University of Mississippi, he handled everything from organizing student events to enforcing discipline and managing campus crises. Reardon’s love for writing and reminiscing (along with encouragement from friends) led to The Dean: Memoirs & Missives. He lives in Taylor, where he cherishes his solitude, his porch and the occasional poker game.

Shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, park dispatch received multiple satellite SOS reports stating that individuals had fallen into Avalanche Creek, and CPR was being performed on two of the individuals.
A group of four visitors from Florida were gathering for a photo on the rocks above Avalanche Gorge when one individual slipped and fell into the water, and a second and third person trying to help also fell in.
Two of the individuals were swept through the gorge while one was able to grab ahold of tree branches in the gorge, waiting for help, the release said.
Rangers who responded found both individuals who had been swept through the gorge to be responsive, as bystanders performing CPR were successful in resuscitating them. It wasn’t immediately clear how the individuals were removed from the creek or the number of bystanders on scene who came to their aid.
The first ranger on scene was informed of the individual who was trapped in the gorge. The ranger was able to rappel to the individual and secure them while the technical rescue team was assembled and retrieved both the individual and the ranger.
All patients were transported to Logan Health in Kalispell, the park said. One patient was transported by ALERT, the second patient by Three Rivers Ambulance, and the third patient by Whitefish Ambulance.
All members involved are in stable condition, according to the release.
Drowning is the number one cause of death in Glacier National Park, according to park officials, and visitors are reminded to watch their surroundings near water.
“Swift, cold glacial streams and rivers, slick rocks or slippery logs all present dangers. Never walk, play, or climb on slippery rocks and logs, especially around waterfalls,” the news release warned.
In the news release, park officials thanked visitors “for their heroic efforts” that saved two lives, as well as Three Rivers Ambulance, ALERT and the Whitefish Fire Department.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/26715498635_3991420426_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 15:07:42.807883

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)An appeals court will not reconsider its decision finding that the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal citizens lack standing to bring a voting discrimination case against the state of North Dakota, a ruling that could impact the makeup of the state Legislature.
The Native American Rights Fund, one of the legal groups representing the plaintiffs in the case, in a statement called the decision “a loss for Native American voters in North Dakota.”
The plaintiffs could still file a petition asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case.
In the lawsuit, filed in 2022, two North Dakota tribes and three Indigenous North Dakotans argued that a redistricting plan adopted by the state in 2021 diluted the power of Native voters, thereby violating the Voting Rights Act. 
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 sided with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to adopt a different map.
In a 2-1 decision in May, a panel of three judges on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that finding on the basis that private parties cannot bring lawsuits alleging racial discrimination under the Voting Rights Act.
The plaintiffs requested that the case go before all 11 judges on the 8th Circuit for a rehearing, noting that the panel’s decision is at odds with how other federal appellate circuits have interpreted the law.
A total of 19 state attorneys general, a handful of advocacy groups and former Department of Justice attorneys filed briefs in support of an en banc hearing. 
North Dakota opposed the rehearing request. While they didn’t file anything on the en banc petition, 15 other Republican-led states had previously submitted briefs to the 8th Circuit in support of North Dakota’s position.
North Dakota tribes ask circuit judges for rehearing of voting rights case

The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.
It’s the only circuit to rule that private individuals cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws racially discriminatory voting practices. The court in a 2023 ruling in a separate case declared that it is the role of the U.S. attorney general to enforce compliance with Section 2.
In the North Dakota lawsuit, the plaintiffs had attempted to use a separate civil rights law as a vehicle to file their Voting Rights Act claim. That law, Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code, says people may sue for “the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities” granted by the Constitution and federal law.
They noted in briefs that for decades, the bulk of lawsuits enforcing Section 2 have been brought by private individuals. The plaintiffs reasoned that even if the court found that they can’t bring a lawsuit directly under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, they still have a right to file their lawsuit through Section 1983. 
The 8th Circuit panel in its May ruling said this was not a viable path either.
“The fair map we secured led to a historic first – a Spirit Lake Nation member elected to the North Dakota legislature,” Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street previously said in a statement about the ruling. “This decision threatens that progress and weakens our voice in state government.”
Last week, the full 8th Circuit decided 7-3 not to give the case another look. The three judges who wanted an en banc hearing were Chief Judge Steven Colloton, former Chief Judge Lavenski Smith and Judge Jane Kelly. One judge didn’t participate in the decision.
In 2024, after Welte’s ruling, three Native American lawmakers were elected to the state Legislature from District 9, drawn to include two reservations: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit. All three are Democrats.
Brown is a freshman lawmaker. Marcellais had previously served 15 years in the statehouse until he lost his bid for reelection in 2022, after district lines were redrawn in 2021. Davis was first elected in 2022, then reelected last year. 
The 8th Circuit did not weigh in on the underlying question of whether North Dakota’s original 2021 map is discriminatory; it only found that the plaintiffs do not have the right to file the suit in the first place. The May opinion indicated the appellate court would send the case back to Welte and direct him to dismiss the lawsuit. 
The state is still waiting to see what, if anything, will happen next in the case. The plaintiffs have about a three-month window to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the lawsuit if they choose. They have not announced whether they intend to go that route.
If the 8th Circuit’s decision takes effect, North Dakota would revert back to the 2021 map. Three state lawmakers would represent different districts in that scenario. Brown, D-Warwick, would go from representing District 9 to District 15. Rep. Donna Henderson, R-Calvin, would switch from District 15 to District 9B, while Sen. Kent Weston, R-Sarles, would switch from District 15 to District 9.
The state would have to decide whether the ruling disqualifies those lawmakers from finishing out their terms, according to a June memo from Legislative Council.
Traditionally, when redistricting has shifted state lawmakers into different legislative districts, they have been allowed to serve until the next election cycle, the memo states. However, under the state constitution, state lawmakers are forbidden to live outside the district they represent.
All three lawmakers who would change districts are up for reelection in 2026.

On Monday, the KCC unanimously approved the company's plan to build new natural gas and solar plants. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector) TOPEKA — The Kansas Corporation Commission gave Evergy the go-ahead to build two natural gas plants and a new solar plant, over the objections of multiple parties.
Evergy Kansas Central customers will see bills increase about 8.6% to build the new plants, KCC filings said.
EKC, the subsidiary of Evergy Inc. that serves Kansas customers, will be 50% co-owner of the two 710-megawatt combined cycle gas turbine plants and 100% owner of the Kansas Sky solar facility, to be built in Douglas County. The Viola gas plant will be built in Sumner County, and the McNew gas plant will be in Reno County.
Cost of construction is estimated to be $788.75 million for the Viola plant and $800.52 million for the McNew plant, according to EKC’s filings. The solar field is expected to cost $228.1 million.
The other half of the two natural gas plants will be owned by Evergy Missouri West, but only if the Missouri Public Service Commission — KCC’s Missouri counterpart — approves the construction.
The Missouri commission’s staff has recommended against pre-construction approval because too many costs in the proposal were uncertain, according to Missouri Public Service Commission filings.


Work in progress
The unanimous decision from Kansas’ regulatory commission Monday afternoon to approve building two natural gas plants and a solar field was the first time in 15 years the KCC has been asked to do a pre-determination docket, said Brian Fedotin, KCC counsel.
In a pre-determination docket, Evergy seeks KCC approval before beginning construction. The company can then use a construction work-in-progress rate mechanism, called a CWIP,  approved by the Kansas Legislature in 2024, according to the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board. The CWIP lets companies begin charging customers for new infrastructure projects while they are under construction, rather than waiting until the next rate case to recover costs.
In Kansas, utility companies typically invest in infrastructure or other initiatives and then add the costs of those projects during a rate case that occurs after the projects are completed. The CWIP allows the company to collect dollars to fund projects as they are built, and it can be added to customer bills one year after construction begins. 

 
Rate concerns
The decision to build the natural gas plants was opposed by the Citizens’ Utility Ratepayer Board, industrial consumers and environmental groups, among others. In general, most agreed with building the solar plant, according to documents filed at KCC.
Commissioners also made note of their concerns about Evergy rates.
“The commission is concerned and troubled by the frequency and magnitude of rate cases, and strongly encourages Evergy to focus on pacing its proposed investments to better align those investments with actual load growth and the mitigation of large rate increases,” said Commissioner Dwight Keen at Monday’s virtual hearing.
Keen said that while the commission approves the addition of generation capabilities to meet the needs of Kansans and ensure stability of the power grid, they remain concerned about rate increases. Evergy currently has a separate rate case at KCC, asking for as much as a 15% hike to residential rates, which would be on top of the increase from building the plants.
Evergy last received a $41 million rate hike in 2023.
“The commission understands that from time to time, new investment in electric capacity is needed to support reliability and economic development in Kansas,” he said. “However, affordability and genuine maximum capacity needs must be major priorities and proactively pursued as Evergy addresses a seemingly endless list of ostensibly justifiable projects and initiatives.”
His words were matched by opponents to building the natural gas plants.
 
Opponents
Jim Zakoura, president of the Kansas Industrial Consumers Group, said Evergy has enough generation to meet electricity demand if current electricity systems, such as coal plants, are not retired before the end of their useful manufacturing life.
“Evergy’s plans to retire coal facilities early, while those facilities continue to provide electric service at costs which are far lower than new gas-fired generation, is not related to increased electric demand,” Zakoura said in a statement. “It is simply trading low-cost generation for high-cost generation to serve the same level of demand. Retail ratepayers get no greater value for their money — only higher prices.”
KCC staff and commissioners don’t agree.
“The oldest of the Jeffries units was commissioned in 1978 and will be over 50 years old if the proposed Viola combined cycle gas generation plant comes online in 2029,” Keen said. “It is impossible to know the exact timing of when coal units will retire. Load growth may require their lifespan to be extended, or environmental policy changes or technological advances may shorten their lives.”
Keen said an October 2022 fire at the Jeffrey Energy Center in Pottawatomie County caused that unit to be out of service for more than a year.
Officials with the Sierra Club, which testified in the Missouri Public Service Commission case for Evergy’s proposed plants and not in the Kansas case, said ratepayers are being asked to take on costs and subsidize a billion-dollar industry.
“Governor Kelly and KCC Commissioners supported and approved these gas plants, and now they have the opportunity to ensure that utilities and data centers pay their fair share, because the alleged new demand for electricity is from data centers, not Kansas families or existing businesses,” said Zack Pistora, director of the Kansas chapter.
Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project, expressed concerns that natural gas prices are difficult to predict.
“I am really worried that we are going to push ourselves into a really risky position with fossil fuels,” she said. “I obviously am concerned about the climate impacts of adding fossil fuels, right? But secondarily, gas prices are so volatile. We saw that with Winter Storm Uri. It’s supply and demand.”
Winter Storm Uri brought arctic weather to the Midwest in February 2021, resulting in increased utility prices for most customers after natural gas prices shot high because of production problems and high usage.
Costs of natural gas are a “straight pass-through” from the utilities, she said. She referred to Empire District Electric, which in 2007 served southeast Kansas.
“They were heavily invested in gas and people couldn’t pay their bills,” Barnett said. “They were one of the first utilities that began to invest in wind in Kansas. It wasn’t because they cared about the environment or cared about clean energy. It was because they were trying to diversify their fuel mix so that they weren’t reliant on gas.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said in a statement the company is pleased with KCC’s approval to help ensure system reliability.
“Kansas and Missouri are experiencing record economic growth, and today’s predetermination order affirms that the plants are needed to serve customers and are an efficient way to meet the growing demand,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KCC-commission-2-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-07-08 15:07:42.807883

(IPBS logo)Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations will be eliminating its entire statewide team of reporters and editors at the end of the year after the Indiana General Assembly defunded the organization.
“This is an incredibly difficult decision, but with the loss of state funding, individual stations have to make some very difficult decisions to address funding shortfalls and are focused on sustaining services to their local communities,” said Mark Newman, the executive director of Indiana Public Broadcasting Stations, Inc.
IPBS is a non-profit consortium of 17 public radio and television stations established in 1979. IPBS and its member stations are partners on education initiatives, civic affairs programming and public safety projects.
Indiana lawmakers in April cut the program’s $3.675 million annual funding after a lower-than-expected revenue forecast. Other programs were trimmed, but IPBS lost its entire line item.
Shortly after, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that cut all federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides funding to the Public Broadcasting Service, National Public Radio and member stations, alleging “bias” in the organizations’ reporting.
Outside of public dollars, stations largely rely on donations and grants.

IPBS posted a statement Tuesday with few details.
“Amid the loss of state funding and the threat of potential federal funding cuts, the Indiana’s public broadcasting stations have proposed strategic changes and reductions for the IPB News statewide reporting collaboration,” the post said.
According to IPBS, its 17 member stations serve 95% of Hoosiers, delivering critical public safety information at no charge to Indiana residents. Such local broadcasting was crucial during flooding in North Carolina when residents didn’t have access to power, with hosts using their stations to connect residents to resources.
“The state funding cuts are being felt for real. This is the impact on public services that Hoosiers depend on and care about. It’s a quality of life matter and a necessity of life matter. That’s the hand we’ve been dealt,” Newman told the Indiana Capital Chronicle.
He said the organization’s focus will be to maintain their “core services,” or local content in Indiana communities.
“This is a transformative time. This is an opportunity to figure out a way to do this better, more effectively and with more impact. Focusing on how our stations operate and what we do. We intend to be here the next fifty years,” Newman said.
“Individual stations will continue to collaborate on statewide reporting relying on the deep community knowledge and on-the-ground work of local reporters who live in, listen to, and report for their own communities. This proposed approach and reorganization to the IPB News statewide reporting collaboration is an immediate consequence of state funding cuts. Specifics of the plan will be released in the near future,” the post concluded.

The law, signed by Gov. Ned Lamont in June, will require battery manufacturers to create a state-approved plan for battery disposal and recycling that includes free, drop-off locations across Connecticut. It will cover single-use batteries, rechargeables, those found in laptops, e-bikes, scooters and more.
The law goes into effect in October, but gives manufacturers until 2027 to get the collection programs up and running.
The new battery recycling program is Connecticut’s latest crack at something called “extended producer responsibility” or EPR. Similar EPR programs already exist in the state for paint and mattresses. The idea is that manufacturers bear responsibility for a product’s environmental impact beyond its point of sale.
Right now in Connecticut, the burden of recycling batteries is left up to cities and towns. And it can be an expensive proposition, said Jennifer Heaton-Jones, executive director of the Housatonic Resources Recovery Authority.
Currently, her group organizes battery drop-offs in western Connecticut.
“A hazardous waste event for us, on average, is about $50,000 for one day,” she said.
There’s the cost of collecting batteries, shipping them to a recycling facility and even telling people where to go, she said.
“Municipalities lack the resources, the financial resources, to be able to reach every resident when it comes to recycling in general and then to be able to educate a resident on a very specific item like batteries,” Heaton-Jones said.
The law could also reduce the risk of fire for trash collectors, by increasing the options for proper battery disposal. In May, a sanitation worker in North Haven suffered minor injuries when a lithium ion battery exploded during compacting, causing the garbage truck to catch on fire.
“We need an immense amount of water to be able to contain the battery,” said Fire Chief Paul Januszewski.
“It’ll emit a tremendous amount of smoke, heat and flames and you will not be able to put it out with a common fire extinguisher,” he said.
Battery manufacturers will have the next year to come up with a collection and recycling plan.
Until then, you can find your nearest battery drop off location by going to Call2Recycle.org

After years of mourning family and friends who succumbed to aggressive cancers, activists in Missouri finally won federal recognition that radiation released during the development of nuclear weapons is to blame.
Since the publication of a six-month investigation by The Missouri Independent, MuckRock and The Associated Press, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley has pressed for Missourians to be included among the states where residents are eligible for compensation. The provision extending help to the St. Louis region, where uranium was processed for the first atomic bombs, New Mexico, where the first bombs were produced and tested, and six other states, was finally included in the massive budget reconciliation bill signed Saturday by President Donald Trump.
“We blinked and after 13 years of being in the dark, we were in the sun,” Dawn Chapman, co-founder of Just Moms STL, said in an interview with The Independent.
Records reveal 75 years of government downplaying, ignoring risks of St. Louis radioactive waste

The passage was celebrated as a victory in a news conference in a St. Louis County park adjacent to Coldwater Creek, contaminated by radioactive waste since 1949.
Hawley and Chapman were joined by Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren and activists from around the country to get the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act renewed and expanded. The law, originally passed in 1990, lapsed in 2024.
“It’s a tremendous privilege to be with these heroes who are beside me and behind me,” Hawley said as he opened the news conference.
The people who lived in the areas now eligible for compensation have waited far too long for help, Hawley said.
“The truth is, it wasn’t just the people of Missouri who had waited for 70 years to have justice done,” Hawley said. “It was the people of the Navajo Nation. It was the people of Utah, it was the people of New Mexico, it was the people of Idaho, it was the uranium miners and atomic veterans from all over the country who had been waiting for decades for the federal government to finally own up to what it had done.”
The Navajo Nation has suffered from fallout swept by winds onto its Arizona lands from nuclear weapons tests, Nygren said. More than 100 uranium mines were on reservation land and, in 1979, the Church Rock Spill, the largest release of radioactive material in U.S. history, poured 94 million gallons of radioactive waste into the Puerco River.
“People were devastated because their livestock, their cattle, their land, their water resources were extremely affected,” Nygren said.
Under the provisions included in the budget bill, Missourians who contracted one of 20 cancers, including lung or breast cancer, after living in any of 21 zip codes for at least two years are eligible for compensation. Leukemia is also covered, but only if it occurred at least 20 years after residence in the designated areas.
In addition to Missouri, the budget bill allows compensation for radiation exposure related to the Manhattan Project in 14 zip codes in Tennessee, two zip codes in Alaska and three in Kentucky. New Mexico is included among the states where fallout spreading downwind from atomic and nuclear tests contaminated the land. The downwind areas, in Arizona, Nevada and Utah in the original compensation act, now include New Mexico, Colorado, Idaho and Montana.
Missouri is also working to identify if other areas are contaminated. 
During this year’s legislative session, Missouri lawmakers passed a bill expanding the state’s ability to find radioactive contamination in the St. Louis region. The measure, which Gov. Mike Kehoe has indicated he will sign Thursday, would authorize the Department of Natural Resources to seek a search warrant to conduct investigations on otherwise off-limits government land and removes a $150,000 annual cap on how much the state can spend on an investigation.

Nickel and Chapman founded Just Moms STL to advocate for the community to federal environmental and energy officials (Theo Welling/Riverfront Times).
The celebration of the bill’s passage is clouded by the memories of people who died without compensation or acknowledgement that nuclear material caused their deaths, Chapman said at the news conference.
“The hard thing today, and why it’s so heavy, is there’s so many people that should be behind us, that have already passed on,” she said. “There’s many people from the Navajo nation that have passed on, that were part of this fight, that are not here to be recognized.Our government made it harder. They did everything they could to hide the truth from us.”
The compensation can cover medical costs for people who are still alive, or they can elect to receive a single payment of $50,000. Family members of people who died of one of the listed cancers are eligible for a one-time payment of $25,000, to be divided equally among the living heirs.
The compensation for people who lived downwind of nuclear tests or worked in uranium mining was increased to $100,000. 
The money will help people pay for treatments and expenses not usually covered by insurance, Chapman said. 
“When you look at this list of cancers, and you look at the cancers that people are getting in North County, they’re horribly aggressive,” she said. “And we have great hospitals and cancer centers here, but what we do not have is the ability for a mom who’s already used up all of her parental leave, her family medical leave, to take extra time off with her child.’
The new federal legislation sets the starting date for possible exposure at 1949, a key date uncovered in the joint investigation by The Independent and its reporting partners.
Giving The Independent access to the documents obtained through years of federal Freedom of Information Act requests was “one of the scariest, riskiest things that we did, and it is the thing that ended up paying off the most,” Chapman said. “It is the thing that launched RECA, when Sen. Hawley read the story and saw the documents that you guys put up.”
  A photo taken in 1960 of deteriorating steel drums containing radioactive residues near Coldwater Creek, by the Mallinckrodt-St. Louis Sites Task Force Working Group (State Historical Society of Missouri, Kay Drey Mallinckrodt Collection, 1943-2006).
The documents showed that during the war, Mallinckrodt Chemical Works processed uranium for the Manhattan Project, the name given to the effort to build the bomb, in downtown St. Louis. Uranium from the Mallinckrodt plant was used in the first sustained nuclear reaction in Chicago, a significant breakthrough.
An internal Mallinckrodt memo from 1949 shows the company was storing highly radioactive residue called K-65 in deteriorating steel drums at the St. Louis airport near Coldwater Creek. The material was so dangerous, the memo said, that Mallinckrodt couldn’t simply put it in new containers because “the hazards to the workers involved in such an occupation would be considerable.”
Efforts to find a buyer for the waste resulted in a sale in 1965, and within a few years, most of the waste was sold and moved just up the road to a site on Latty Avenue in Hazelwood where it, again, sat exposed to the elements and adjacent to Coldwater Creek.
In early 2024, more than 70 years after workers first realized barrels of radioactive waste risked contaminating Coldwater Creek, the federal government put up signs warning residents. Cleaning up the creek carries a cost estimated at $400 million.
“We are here today in the very park that made me sick,” said Karen Nickel, a co-founder of Just Moms STL. “I grew up on that street right there, a place where I played as a child, never knowing the danger from radioactive atomic bomb waste.”
Nickel has lupus and other auto-immune diseases she believes were caused by the radiation but her illnesses are not covered in the compensation act expansion. She doesn’t regret the hard work, even if it won’t help her, she said.
“I feel like the little girl who got sick here didn’t suffer in vain,” Nickel said. “This moment is bittersweet. It’s victory wrapped in grief. But I also hope that no other community has to wait this long to be heard.”

The waste was spread by efforts to remove it. After extracting valuable metals from the bomb waste, the buyer, Cotter Corp. initially received permission to use a pit at the Weldon Spring quarry in St. Charles County, which was already a disposal site for other radioactive waste.
After that decision was reversed over concerns that radiation was already leaking from the quarry, over a period of 2 ½ months in the summer and fall of 1973, Cotter took the problem into its own hands, without telling government regulators.
The company mixed the radioactive waste with tens of thousands of tons of contaminated soil from the site and illegally dumped it in a free, public landfill called West Lake, under three feet of soil and other garbage.
The landfill was declared a federal toxic Superfund site in 1990. In 2010, a subsurface smoldering event, similar to an underground fire, at the Bridgeton Landfill threatened the radioactive waste buried in the since-closed Westlake Landfill nearby. That fire sent noxious and hazardous fumes into surrounding neighborhoods. The company in charge of the Bridgeton Landfill now spends millions a year to contain it.
At the news conference, activists from across the country who lost family members told a part of their story and their fight for recognition and compensation.
Maggie Billiman, whose father Howard Billiman was a Navajo code talker in World War II, said her family lives downwind from where 100 nuclear weapons were tested. He died of stomach cancer in 2001.
“When we heard RECA was passed, we cried for happiness,” Billiman said.
Sherrie Hanna of Prescott, Arizona, said she lost both her husband and her father to cancer and received compensation under the act before it expired in 2024. She was worried it would not be renewed, Hanna said.
“For many of us downwinders, myself included, the question is not if we will receive a cancer diagnosis but when,” Hanna said.
To get the renewal and expansion passed, Hawley said he had to overcome resistance among Republicans to new federal spending and find legislation that had to pass to carry it.
“It happened because it’s justice,” Hawley said. “But there’s more to do.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)In what’s already becoming a sizzling U.S. Senate primary, the top three Republican candidates plan to participate in a Kentucky tradition known for politicians’ trading jabs in front of a crowd. 
Former Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris confirmed with event organizers their plans to speak at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic in August. A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Andy Barr told the Kentucky Lantern he also plans to speak. 
The picnic, which is also a barbecue fundraiser for the St. Jerome Catholic Church in Graves County, has become a premier Kentucky tradition for elected officials and election hopefuls. In front of a fiery crowd of Republicans and Democrats, politicians take to the stage to lob verbal blows at their opponents — who are typically feet away watching the spectacle themselves. 
The only Democrat to announce for the U.S. Senate seat, Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, was invited to speak by picnic organizers, but had not responded to the invitation, according to a media advisory issued Tuesday. Her campaign did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from the Lantern. 
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, whose plans to not run for reelection in 2026 set off the jockeying for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, has not yet confirmed his attendance with organizers this year but has acknowledged the invitation, the advisory said. He attended the Fancy Farm Picnic last year, and has gone to the event since the 1980s, when he was first elected to the U.S. Senate. Before the 2023 picnic, McConnell’s appearance was still pending in the days leading up to the event. 
An appearance on the stage this year could be an interesting one for McConnell, should he choose to go. The Republican candidates have attempted to distance themselves from the long-time incumbent in order to bring themselves closer to President Donald Trump, who has yet to endorse a candidate in the race. 
Republican U.S. Rep. James Comer and the Democratic candidate challenging him, John “Drew” Williams, of Marshall County, have both agreed to speak at the picnic. 
Other politicians speaking are: 

Republican Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell
Republican Attorney General Russell Coleman
Republican state Sen. Jason Howell
Republican state Rep. Kim Holloway

Fancy Farm Picnic organizers said that no one asked to speak so far has declined the invite. Republican state officers Auditor Allison Ball, Secretary of State Michael Adams and Treasurer Mark Metcalf have not confirmed their plans. Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul has also not confirmed if he will attend. 
Kentucky’s top Democrats — Gov. Andy Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman — have not confirmed if they will attend the picnic this year. Neither of them attended last year’s event. The Fancy Farm Picnic is scheduled for Saturday, Aug. 2.

Advocates say a toxic supply of fentanyl is to blame.,"Twenty-two people died in Connecticut from fatal overdoses during a 72-hour period last weekend. Advocates say a toxic supply of fentanyl is to blame.
“This is a public health emergency. People need to know that there’s a toxic supply of opioids in Connecticut,” said John Hamilton, president of Liberation Programs, a treatment and prevention nonprofit based in Bridgeport.
He said there hasn’t been a spike like this since March, and that the state has actually recently seen a decrease in fatal overdoses.
Hamilton said there’s been an increase in fentanyl quantity in the samples they analyze at his organization, and that fentanyl has also been combined with medetomidine, an animal tranquilizer. He said this combination was first seen in Philadelphia a few years ago, but came to Connecticut only two months ago.
“If they’re going to use, people need to go low and slow because if they were using three bags before, and they use three bags today, it will kill them,” Hamilton said.
He said he and his team recognize that only one out of 10 people will seek treatment this year, so their goal is to keep the other nine out of 10 alive. They’re trying to do this by distributing Narcan, or Naloxone, and engaging with and informing people about the toxic supply.
According to a Yale School of Public Health report from 2016-2017, people who went into treatment for one month but didn’t receive medication to aid in their recovery were 70% more likely to fatally overdose than those who didn’t receive any treatment at all.
“[We’re trying to] keep them engaged and give them accurate information and treat them with love and dignity. They have a multitude of issues that they need to address before even considering treatment,” he said. “We try to build on their recovery capital until they’re ready to be involved in formal treatment. It’s the best treatment possible, which is meeting people where they are without our agenda, and we’ll continue to do that.”
He said they’ve increased their hours, too.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said at a press conference last week that fatal overdoses can’t continue. He said the potential cuts to Medicaid will leave people with fewer resources to fight their addictions.
The deaths occurred in Fairfield County, New Haven County and Hartford County.

DOVER — The Dover Hope Zone has kicked off a series of free summer events aimed at promoting fitness, wellness, and community engagement among local children and families through its new initiative, “Hope Streets.”
Designed as a community violence prevention program, Hope Streets transforms neighborhood parks and select streets—closed temporarily to traffic—into safe, active spaces where kids can play and families can gather.
The program also provides nutritious meals and snacks, play equipment, and a variety of structured activities in an effort to encourage healthy living and community connection.

Sponsored by Nemours Children’s Health, Hope Streets is made possible through collaboration with a wide range of local partners, including community centers, churches, youth-serving organizations, healthcare providers, schools, and local businesses.
Together, they offer services such as health screenings, water stations, music, EMT support, and volunteer-led activities.
Organizers aim to create opportunities for kids to be active and safe while bringing resources directly to neighborhoods that need them most.
Schedule for Hope Streets

The Dover Hope Zone is part of an interdisciplinary justice reinvestment initiative led by The Hope Commission, in partnership with the Wesley College of Health & Behavioral Sciences and Delaware State University.
While Hope Streets focuses on community wellness, the broader initiative provides critical reentry services for justice-involved individuals living in the 19901 and 19904 zip codes.
The Hope Commission, known as Delaware’s leading correctional reentry program, offers a comprehensive suite of services for high-risk men returning from incarceration.
Programs include cognitive-behavioral therapy, vocational training, educational support, behavioral health services, and family reunification—efforts aimed at reducing recidivism and enhancing public safety.

(Screenshot/WisEye)State laws that let a 10-member committee of the Legislature override regulations are unconstitutional, a majority of the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.
The ruling hands the administration of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers a victory in an ongoing battle with the Legislature’s Republican leaders.
It also affirms that the state Legislature cannot renew its attempt to block regulations against conversion therapy for LGBTQ people, and appears to clear the way for an update of Wisconsin’s building code that was suspended nearly two years ago.
The ruling finds five statutes, granting power to the Legislature’s committee that reviews and periodically suspends administrative rules, violate the Wisconsin Constitution.
Taken together, wrote Chief Justice Jill Karofsky for the four justices making up the Court’s liberal wing, the statutes give the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules the power to effectively change state laws without going through the full legislative process.
“The ability of a ten-person committee to halt or interrupt the passage of a rule, which would ordinarily be required to be presented to the governor as a bill [to block the rule], is simply incompatible with Articles IV and V of the Wisconsin Constitution,” Karofsky wrote.
The Court’s three conservative justices took issue with the majority opinion, asserting that rulemaking itself involves legislative power and that Tuesday’s ruling improperly constrains the Legislature as the elected representatives of the people.
‘Legislative veto’ lawsuit 
The decision is the second to come from a lawsuit Evers filed in the fall of 2023, Evers v. Marklein, accusing the Republican leaders of the Legislature of exercising an unconstitutional “legislative veto” hampering the lawful powers of the executive branch to make administrative rules.
The Evers administration argued that five statutes granting JCRAR the power to review, object to and block rules before or after they are promulgated violate the state Constitution. Those include a law enacted in December 2018, after Evers was elected governor but before he took office, that allows the committee to lodge “indefinite” objections blocking a rule.
The Court majority agreed with the administration’s argument.
The Wisconsin Constitution requires that for a law to be enacted, it must pass both the Assembly and the Senate and then be presented to the governor to be signed or vetoed.
“By permitting JCRAR to exercise discretion over which approved rules may be promulgated and which may not, the statute empowers JCRAR to take action that alters the legal rights and duties of persons outside of the legislative branch” without going through the lawmaking process, Karofsky wrote.
The indefinite objection “prevents the agency from promulgating a rule unless the Legislature passes a bill enacting the rule,” she wrote. “Said another way, legislative inertia after an indefinite objection could permanently stop the promulgation of a rule.”
The law allowing the committee to pause a rule for 30 days before it is promulgated “essentially allows JCRAR to capture control of agency rulemaking authority from the executive branch during the 30-day pause period,” Karofksy wrote.
The pause, which can be extended to 30 days “operates as a ‘pocket veto,’” she wrote. “Even if such an interruption is relatively brief, the constitution does not contemplate temporary violations of its provisions.”
Similarly, after the rule has been promulgated, JCRAR’s power to suspend it multiple times “means that even after promulgation, JCRAR could suspend a rule repeatedly in perpetuity with no other checks in place,” the chief justice wrote.
Clearing way for conversion therapy ban, new building code
In overturning the five statutes, the Court majority also revoked two earlier rulings that had affirmed some of JCRAR’s powers — one from 1992, upholding the committee’s temporary suspension of a rule, and the other from 2020, endorsing the power to suspend a rule multiple times.
Evers’ suit focused on two rules that JCRAR blocked, both produced under the umbrella of the state Department of Safety and Professional Services (DSPS).
One rule prohibited therapists from using discredited conversion therapy to try to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBTQ people. It was adopted by the Wisconsin Marriage and Family Therapy, Professional Counseling, and Social Work Examining Board.
“When the Board created new professional conduct rules banning conversion therapy, it exercised its statutory authority,” Karofksy wrote. “But when JCRAR objected to the rule it effectively blocked the Board’s authority” under Wisconsin law “to govern the professional conduct of its licensees.”
The conversion therapy rule was suspended in January 2023, but reinstated after the Legislature concluded its work for the 2023-24 session.
With “the multiple suspension provision,” however, Karofsky wrote, “JCRAR has the authority to suspend this rule again, in perpetuity.”
Another rule updated the state commercial building code to international standards set in 2021.
“The goal of these chapters is to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public,” Karofsky wrote. JCRAR’s indefinite suspension of the code in 2023  “prevented DSPS from completing its statutory rulemaking duties,” she wrote.
Conservative justices object
Justice Brian Hagedorn, one of three members of the Court’s conservative wing, wrote an opinion that concurred with the majority on narrow grounds but dissented on finding the five laws at issue unconstitutional.
The JCRAR indefinite objection to the building code rule is unconstitutional under a 1992 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling, Hagedorn wrote.
He argued that the conversion therapy rule is now outside the Court’s purview, however.
“This ethical rule is already in effect; it is no longer suspended,” Hagedorn wrote. “Since a ruling on JCRAR’s actions with respect to this rule would have no legal effect, this claim is moot, and we have nothing further to decide.”
Hagedorn criticized the decision’s far-reaching findings that whole statutes were unconstitutional, however. He said it also failed to grapple with arguments about the constitutional status of regulation by executive branch agencies.
“The effect of the majority’s decision is to greenlight executive alteration of legal rights and duties outside the lawmaking process while prohibiting legislative alteration of legal rights and duties outside the lawmaking process,” Hagedorn wrote.
Former Chief Justice Annette Ziegler and Justice Rebecca Bradley published separate sharply worded dissents.
Ziegler wrote that the majority ruling was the outcome of “this court’s misguided quest to restructure and unbalance our state government, culminating in even more power and control being allocated to the executive branch.”
“The legislature has delegated executive branch agencies broad rulemaking authority with the understanding that it will be able to oversee administrative rulemaking through JCRAR,” Ziegler wrote. “The majority now pulls the rug out from under the legislature…”
Bradley, invoking lyrics from Bruce Springsteen’s song “Badlands” in which the singer says “a king ain’t satisfied ‘til he rules everything,” charged that the majority “lets the executive branch exercise lawmaking power unfettered and unchecked.”
Her dissent offered a full-throated attack on the administrative state and executive branch regulatory authority.
“The majority invokes the Wisconsin Constitution to take power from the People’s elected representatives in the legislature and bestow it on the executive branch, empowering unelected bureaucrats to rule over the People,” Bradley wrote.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Local grocers sounded alarm bells Tuesday about the potential negative impacts that incoming restrictions to Nebraska’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program could have on businesses and the more than 150,000 Nebraskans who use the program. 
During this year’s legislative session, lawmakers passed waivers to SNAP — a government food assistance service some also refer to as food stamps. The updates would remove soda and other energy drinks from the list of SNAP-eligible purchases starting in 2026. 
Nebraska would be the first state in the nation to ban soda and energy drinks from SNAP purchases. Gov. Jim Pillen has publicly supported the state waivers, referring to the affected drinks as “junk.”
“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” Pillen said at a USDA event in May. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently approved the waivers, and Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services held a hearing Tuesday to hear public comments on the proposed changes. The updates still require approval from DHHS’ Office of Economic Assistance, Pillen and the Attorney General before they take effect. 
USDA approval also comes on the heels of congressional passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill, which will increase work requirements for SNAP participation, requirements not addressed during the state hearing. 
Only two people spoke at the hearing — representing advocacy group Nebraska Appleseed and the Nebraska Grocery Industry Association — though more organizations submitted written testimony that were not immediately made available to the public. 
Public comments
Shannon McCord, vice president of the grocer group’s board of directors and operator of a local grocery store in Superior, Nebraska, said the “state-by-state patchwork approach” to SNAP regulations is confusing to retailers and could do more harm than good. 
“Even if the intention is good, these waivers are going to add costs and do real harm to local grocers,” McCord said. 
The waivers would require grocers to update their payment systems, which McCord described as a “costly and complex task” that would be significantly harder for small and rural retailers like himself to accomplish. His store in Superior is also near the Kansas border, which does not have the same SNAP restrictions, and he fears the changes could encourage his customers to travel across the border for their groceries. 
For businesses operating on slim margins like his own, McCord said the restrictions could force owners to make layoffs or other cutbacks, or even close their doors. Additionally, he said it would add shame and stigma to customers who depend on SNAP. 
“If (retailers) disappear and we develop a food desert, are we really solving a health problem when customers are only getting food from dollar stores and processed boxed foods?” McCord asked. 
Madison Castor, law clerk with Nebraska Appleseed, said past attempts at restricting access to SNAP have undermined the program’s effectiveness. Rather than imposing restrictions, she claimed that efforts to add incentives to use SNAP benefits on healthier food items like produce have proven more effective at promoting healthier living. 
By forcing businesses to update their payment systems, Castor feared that would reduce the number of businesses that accept SNAP as payment overall. This would greatly impact the health and livelihoods of Nebraskans who rely on the service. 
“SNAP is a vital and temporary lifeline for thousands of Nebraskans,” Castor said. “Over 150,000 of us count on SNAP to help put food on the table at a time when costs are high and family budgets are tight. These proposed rules seek to implement a SNAP restriction waiver that harms the dignity and autonomy of Nebraskans.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship announced Tuesday it launched a Water Quality Initiative project to reduce nitrate and other nutrient runoff in the Beaver Creek watershed, which is upstream of Des Moines. 
IDALS joined Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District and several other partners on the initiative, which will install saturated buffers, oxbows, bioreactors and promote the use of cover crops in the watershed over the next three years. 
A press release from IDALS said the project follows the “batch and build” model the department has used to streamline the construction process and complete more projects in a given watershed.

“Iowans expect progress when it comes to water quality, and that’s exactly what this project helps to deliver,” Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement. “This partnership project is a great example of how we can bring farmers, landowners, and public and private partners together to accelerate this important work and be part of the solution.” 


Water Quality Initiative tools: 
— Oxbows: a bow-shaped meander of a stream, separated from the flow of water, that acts as a wetland to prevent flooding, provide habitat for wildlife and filter nutrients.
— Saturated buffers: an area of vegetation between cropland and waterways, usually where a tile line drains, that helps absorb nutrients from water before it drains into a stream.
— Bioreactors: a trench buried on the edge of a field at a tile outlet and typically filled with woodchips that allow microorganisms to remove nitrates from the water and instead release them as nitrogen gas.
— Cover crops: a crop planted between cash crop rotations to help keep nutrients and soil in a field. 


The department has already completed more than 20 water quality initiative projects in the Beaver Creek watershed, which flows into the Des Moines River on the north side of the capital city’s metro. 
In mid June, Central Iowa Water Works, which represents 600,000 central Iowa customers, issued a lawn watering ban due to high nitrate concentrations in the Des Moines River and Raccoon River, which serve as surface water sources.
A two-year water quality study, commissioned by Polk County to investigate water quality issues in the region’s main rivers, was also released in the same time period. The report pointed to agriculture as a main source of nitrate pollution in the rivers. 
A spokesperson for IDALS said the Beaver Creek watershed is an “important watershed” and the project has been “in the works” prior to the recent public awareness of the nitrate issue. 
“We are actively recruiting landowners and locations for practices, and we are also recruiting more public and private partners who want to help us get more practices established,” Don McDowell, the department’s public information officer, said in an email.

Segments of Beaver Creek have been on the Department of Natural Resource’s list of impaired waters since 2016. 
DNR is also a partner in the project, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resource Conservation Service, Polk County Public Works and The Nature Conservancy. 
According to the press release, IDALS allocated $244,100 to the project.
The Beaver Creek project also promotes the use of cover crops, which can help keep nutrients in the soil when cash crops aren’t growing. IDALS’s Water Quality Initiative has a cost-share program for farmers interested in adding cover crops into their rotation.
“By partnering with local farmers and landowners and by investing in proven conservation practices like bioreactors, saturated buffers, oxbows, and cover crops, we’re improving water quality in these communities as well as for those downstream, including the Des Moines metro,” Naig said. 
Jeremy Gustafson, a Boone County farmer, and chair of the Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District, said the partnership between the organizations will “showcase modern approaches to water quality improvements.” 
Farmers and others interested in the project can reach out to the Boone County Soil and Water Conservation District office or contact Justin Grieff at the office.

(Courtesy photo)A retired New Mexico state government worker and game warden and county-level elected official has entered the race for New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands.
Michael Perry enters as the first Republican running in the June 2, 2026 primary election, according to New Mexico Secretary of State data. Three Democrats also will vie in the race: Juan Sanchez, Jonas Montoya and Matthew McQueen. The general election will take place Nov. 3, 2026.
“If you evaluate resume to resume, this isn’t a political issue,” he told Source NM on Tuesday. “It’s not Democrat or Republican, it’s about making our landscapes green and our watersheds beautiful blue. ”
A Roswell High School graduate, Perry serves on the Chaves County Commission as its vice chair, in the third year of his first term. He also sits on the National Association of Counties’ Public Lands Policy Steering Committee.
He said if elected, he wants to emphasize better forest management to prevent catastrophic wildfires and floods.
Perry said forest landscapes are overgrown and need to be thinned out, particularly around New Mexico’s suburban areas. He praised the Mescalero Apache Tribe’s timber management, saying the South Fork and Salt fires could have been much worse without it.
“I would spend more on the fuel reduction on state property,” Perry said. “The flood events aren’t necessarily because we’ve had an increase in rain. It’s just because the forest was in such poor condition that when it’s highly burned … the rain can actually hit the ground and not get caught up in the canopy.”
He said he started thinking about running for land commissioner five years ago. He has never run for statewide office.
“Being retired from state government, I know how it works,” Perry said. “I want to make sure that in our production of money from the land, that we’re doing it in a mindful and prescriptive way that’s going to leave the resources in a good position for future generations.”
Perry also works as a private consultant through his company Wildlife and Habitat Prescriptions, LLC, helping ranchers with watershed management, water catchment systems and reduction of woody vegetation.
He said Public Lands Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, who is term-limited and cannot run for reelection, has done a decent job at putting land remediation projects at the forefront of the land office’s work.
Perry worked on landscape restoration and remediation and habitat management at the State Land Office from 2016 to 2019, first as an assistant commissioner in the field division and then as a district resource manager.
“I’ve done the right-of-ways, and then made the big decisions at the very top,” he said. “The major thing that I worked on when I was there was access issues: trying to get the public the access that they deserve through suitable roads onto large tracts of state land, so that they could actually be utilized instead of landlocked.”
Perry was also a game warden at the New Mexico Game and Fish Department, and eventually oversaw state land easements in coordination with the land office.
“All those locations that are accessible through those permits, those are the gates that are open, I started that program,” he said.
Before that, Perry was a major for southern field operations at the Game and Fish Department. He received a degree in wildlife biology from New Mexico State University.
“I’ve worked all my life outside, in the law enforcement field chasing bad guys or with a chainsaw cutting down trees, so this is new to me,” he said.

May 13, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers on Tuesday announced that his office is suing General Motors for allegedly collecting and selling data on drivers without their consent for at least the past decade.
The 40-page lawsuit, filed Tuesday morning in Lancaster County District Court, alleges that Michigan-based General Motors and associated OnStar products collected driver data and sold it to third-party companies without drivers’ consent since at least 2015. In turn, that data would be sold to insurance companies, sometimes leading to increased rates or canceled insurance. 
Collected data allegedly included how fast someone was driving, how hard stops were, geolocation and whether seat belts were worn.
“We know that you can actually do what these insurance companies and what companies like GM want to do legally, through consent, through notice, through disclosures,” Hilgers told reporters. “It’s not what they did here.”
The lawsuit alleges an “aggressive, concerted effort” to enroll purchasers into GM products, which Hilgers said led to some drivers being opted into the products without their consent in what he termed “emotional blackmail” — that OnStar and other services were necessary for family or personal safety or that the data wouldn’t be shared except in “limited circumstances.”
According to the lawsuit, General Motors has 54 dealerships in Nebraska, does business with 19 Nebraska suppliers and has 16 Nebraska-based employees.

While Hilgers couldn’t say how many Nebraskans were impacted over the past 10 years, the lawsuit says GM delivered nearly 19,000 vehicles to the state in 2023.
General Motors began partnering with car insurance companies in 2005, the lawsuit continues, to allow drivers to opt in for data collection so they could receive a discount for “good” driving.
But Hilgers’ office says such devices became “unnecessary” over time even as the products have been installed by default in almost all new GM vehicles since 2015.
Hilgers said an attorney in his office combed through all of GM’s privacy terms and conditions and found “nothing that we think clears up what we think is very misleading, very deceptive activity.”
The Nebraska Examiner has reached out to General Motors for comment on Hilgers’ lawsuit. The company had no immediate reply.
Asked whether Hilgers’ office had contacted GM or OnStar before Tuesday, Hilgers said: “They’re aware of our investigation.” He said part of the lawsuit seeks to understand the “full scope” of how Nebraskans were harmed to craft a remedy specific to those consumers.
The lawsuit by the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office follows a nearly identical lawsuit by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed in August. The Federal Trade Commission also proposed a settlement against GM in January. The company said it would “go above and beyond existing law” but mirror new protections the company had been rolling out to give customers “more transparency and control.”
FTC Chair Lina Khan in January said GM collected data sometimes as often as every three seconds. The FTC has not yet voted to finalize the settlement order, a spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.
The Nebraska lawsuit alleges “deceptive” and “unconscionable” trade practices by GM and asks for a jury trial with the following requested relief: 

Civil penalties of $2,000 per violation of Nebraska’s Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act or its Consumer Protection Act.
A permanent ban on GM and others engaging in such conduct.
Any money acquired as a result of the violations to be restored to impacted consumers.
State legal fees.
“Any other relief” the court deems “just and equitable.”

In addition to the AG’s Office, Nebraska is working with three attorneys based out of Seattle and Houston from the Susman Godfrey law firm.
“We filed this lawsuit because one large company decided that it wouldn’t honestly tell Nebraskans that their data was going to be used to impact their insurance rates. This is wrong,” Hilgers said. “Our office will hold companies that mislead Nebraskans accountable, no matter how large.”

SHILOH COMMUNITY, Ala.—Pastor Timothy Williams said he’s not giving up his fight for justice.
It’s a battle that has garnered national headlines and brought prominent leaders, including then Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, to the small, historically Black community with the goal of addressing repeated flooding caused by the elevation of US-84, a project overseen by the Alabama Department of Transportation (ALDOT).
Years into that battle, and despite a resolution agreement between state and federal officials meant to stem the flow of stormwater off the highway, little progress has been made to keep the flooding from inundating residents’ homes, according to community members.

Now, Williams and five other Black residents have brought their struggle to the courts, filing suit against ALDOT and John Cooper, its director.
“We got tired of waiting on ALDOT,” Williams said in an interview Monday. “We had high hopes that they were going to come on out and fix this issue in a timely manner. But we’ve seen they are not going to keep their promises, so we filed suit.”
In an e-mailed statement, Dalton Middleton, a communications specialist for ALDOT, said that the agency is aware of the lawsuit and “will be reviewing it.” In the past, the agency has denied that flooding issues in the Shiloh Community are the result of racial discrimination.
The lawsuit, filed July 1 in federal court, alleges that the flooding in Shiloh continues to worsen as rainwater erodes the land around US-84.
“The flooding and erosion continue, and at this time, it is not possible to know when it will stabilize,” the lawsuit said. “As the flooding has gotten worse and worse, Plaintiffs began to search for a way to stem the rising tide of water from every rain event.”
That search included filing complaints in 2021 and 2022 with the Federal Highway Administration, which helped fund the initial highway expansion, completed during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Later, under President Joe Biden, the federal agency announced a voluntary resolution agreement it said would lead to relief for residents.
The rollout of that agreement coincided with Buttigieg’s visit to Shiloh, where the then-cabinet official promised a “whole-of-government” approach to addressing the ongoing flooding.

The voluntary resolution agreement laid out two options for addressing the continued flooding. One option would have involved purchasing additional right-of-way from residents in order to relocate a stormwater discharge point and construct a drainage ditch to divert rainwater away from homes to a “natural outfall point” south of the Shiloh community. If officials were unable to purchase the land needed for that plan, the agreement outlined a second option, involving the deepening of ditches and the construction of an additional detention basin to handle stormwater runoff from US-84.
Despite the voluntary resolution agreement and Buttigieg’s commitment, residents have said the rain-induced floods have continued, putting at risk homes and properties that have been in their families for generations.
“Suffice it to say, little to nothing has been done,” the residents’ lawsuit said.
“We don’t have any trust in ALDOT,” Williams told Inside Climate News. “ALDOT has damaged our community and done nothing to fix that damage.”
Now, residents have asked a federal court to intervene, claiming that the flooding amounts to “a taking without just compensation in violation of the takings clause of the 5th Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the taking of private property for public use by a government entity.”
The flooding constitutes a “taking,” counsel for the residents argued, because “it impairs the use of enjoyment” of their property and homes and has decreased their property values.
The suit asks for the court to award damages to residents to compensate residents for the loss of use and enjoyment of their properties, the diminution of the value of their properties and for damages “for the mental anguish of having the properties flooded.”
In addition, residents have requested that the court order ALDOT to either meet the conditions of the first option outlined in the resolution agreement or begin implementing option two.

Robert Bullard, a Coffee County native who was a member of President Joe Biden’s Environmental Justice Advisory Council, has long said that the continued water woes in Shiloh are intentional, not simply the result of bad engineering.
“Water goes downhill, and it doesn’t take a Ph.D. to understand that,” said Bullard, a distinguished professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University and director of the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice there. “This was done on purpose. This wasn’t an accidental ‘oops.’ ALDOT cared more about not flooding the highway than they did about flooding the community. That is unacceptable.”
Bullard has said that he will continue to return to Shiloh and advocate for a permanent fix for residents who’ve been subjected to stormwater runoff for years.
“We’re going to be like the Terminator,” he said. “We’ll be back, and we have a laser focus. We want justice for Shiloh.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Timothy-Williams-for-July-8-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 13:17:23.402688

(Environment America Research and Policy Center)Nearly two-thirds of Louisiana beaches tested positive for harmful levels of fecal bacteria last year, according to a new report on potential health risks at America’s coastal recreation areas. 
The testing from the Environment America Research and Policy Center focused on 23 beaches in Louisiana out of nearly 3,200 tested nationwide in 2024. Of the 10 Louisiana beaches where tests found the water was “potentially unsafe” most often, eight sites were in Cameron Parish. 
Environment America compared its test samples with the Environmental Protection Agency’s highest water quality metric, which estimates that no more than 32 out of every 1,000 swimmers get sick from the amount of harmful bacteria present. All Louisiana beaches tested had at least one day of sampling that exceeded this threshold. 
“Even as Louisianans are back to enjoying the fresh sea breeze and splash of waves at the beach, pollution is still plaguing too many of the places where we swim,” said John Rumpler, one of the report’s authors and the clean water director for the Environment America Research and Policy Center, in a press release. 
Bacterial water pollution can come from a variety of sources, such as sewage overflows from old and aging sewer systems, and runoff from farms with livestock. 
The combination of increased development and fewer wetlands can also propagate the spread of harmful bacteria throughout waterways. Wetlands act as filters for bacterial pollution, and an overabundance of parking lots, houses and roads funnel runoff into rivers and lakes instead of allowing it to be absorbed into the ground. 
The worst testing results in Louisiana were at Rutherford Beach, where the Mermentau River empties into the Gulf of Mexico in Cameron Parish. Its water was found to be potentially unsafe on 19 of the 28 days tested last year. Fecal bacteria frequency was also high at Martin Beach in Cameron Parish and at five sections of Holly Beach. 
North Beach, on the upper shore of Lake Charles in Calcasieu Parish, saw unsafe test results on 19 of the 30 days sampled. 
Poor water quality was reported at Fontainebleau State Park in St. Tammany Parish on 12 of the 29 days tested, placing it 10th among state beaches with the worst test results.  
The Environment America Research and Policy Center is calling for a deeper commitment to improving water infrastructure as well as protecting wetlands, reworking the way farms handle livestock manure and expanding testing for harmful bacteria at beaches.
“Now is the time to fix our water infrastructure and stop the flow of pathogens to our beaches,” Rumpler said. 
The Gulf Coast had the highest percentage of potentially unsafe sampling days out of any region in the study despite having only 218 of the 1,930 sampling spots. Testing showed 84% of Gulf Coast beaches had at least one potentially unsafe day, followed by the West Coast (79%), Great Lakes (71%), East Coast (54%) and Alaska and Hawaii (10%). 
Nationally, 61% of beaches had at least one day with potentially unsafe bacteria levels.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/output_LA-1024x728.jpg,,,2025-07-08 13:17:23.402688

Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders mobilized 22 soldiers Monday, including pilots and crew chiefs, and six maintenance personnel, according to a press release. Additionally, two soldiers were ordered to state active duty to serve as liaison officers in Arkansas to coordinate direct support to deployed soldiers as needed. 
More than 100 people have died following extraordinary rainfall that led to severe flooding in Central Texas, according to The Texas Tribune.

In response to an Emergency Management Assistance Compact request received from Texas yesterday, the Arkansas National Guard generated a four-helicopter departure Tuesday morning, Bridges said in the release. The compact allows states to send personnel and equipment to help response and recovery efforts in other states.
One Black Hawk crew will be ready to provide medical evacuation support, while the other three crews can provide hoist capability, visual searches, passenger movement and cargo movement.
The orders last through Saturday, but can be adjusted based on mission needs, according to the release.

He was first elected to the Legislature in 2006 at age 22, and has taken on leadership roles in the years since — he was elected House majority leader in 2019, and previously served as assistant leader and speaker pro tempore for the House GOP caucus.
Now, he is looking at a move from the Iowa House to the U.S. House. In a news release announcing his run Tuesday, Windschitl said he would “bring Iowa’s conservative values to Washington” if elected.

“Our freedoms are constantly under attack from the Left — I will continue to fight to secure our borders, and protect our farmers and families who need a strong advocate to fight against bureaucratic red tape and inflation,” Windschitl said in a statement. “I’m ready to join President Trump and fight back.”
He also thanked Feenstra, the current representative for Iowa’s 4th District, for his work in Congress and more recently for “his critical role in helping pass President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill.”
Iowa’s 4th District, covering much of northwest Iowa, is a longtime GOP stronghold, and has been represented by Feenstra since 2021. In the 2020 election season, he won the Republican primary against incumbent U.S. Rep. Steve King, and went on to win the general election against Democrat state Rep. J.D. Scholten — who is now running in 2026 against Republican U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst.
Feenstra is retiring from Congress to run for Iowa governor. Shortly after Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she will not seek reelection in 2026, Feenstra announced an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor.
Though he has not yet officially announced a shift from “exploring” a run for governor to running for the position, Feenstra has received major endorsements from top Iowa Republicans in recent days. U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst endorsed his run for governor Monday and U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks gave an endorsement earlier in July. Lt. Gov. Chris Cournoyer, who is running for state auditor in 2026, gave her endorsement for his gubernatorial run Tuesday, saying she supported him “because I know he delivers for Iowa.”
“In the Iowa Senate, Randy and I both voted for tax cuts, increased government efficiency and accountability which all protect the budgets of hardworking Iowa families and seniors,” Cournoyer said. “I look forward to continuing to work with him as State Auditor to help take Iowa to new heights.”
Aiming to take over for Feenstra in the U.S. House, Windschitl said he would focus on conservative policies in Washington, D.C., such as protecting gun access, securing the U.S. border, “standing for life and protecting the unborn,” and pursuing lower taxes.
Two other Republicans are also looking at runs for the 4th District seat in 2026. Iowa Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, announced an exploratory committee for the congressional race in May, and Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan announced his bid for the seat in June. Democrat Ryan Melton, who ran campaigns against Feenstra and lost in 2022 and 2024, had announced his 2026 4th District campaign earlier in the year, but suspended his run in June.
Windschitl said in campaign launch that he was ready to compete for the seat in 2026.
“I’ve never backed down from a fight — not in the Marines, not in the Iowa Legislature, and not now,” Windschitl said. “I’ll bring that same tenacity to Washington to stand up for the people of Iowa.”
As Windschitl aims to move from the Statehouse to Congress, he plans to step down as House majority leader while serving out the remainder of his term representing House District 15, the Des Moines Register reported.
This means Iowa House Republicans must elect a new majority leader. While House GOP officials did not respond to requests for comment about leadership elections, President Donald Trump referred to Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, as “majority-leader elect” during his remarks at the Iowa State Fairgrounds Thursday, July 3.

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)This article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
Amid all the worries about the perennially elusive youth vote, there’s a promising trend to talk about: In a growing number of towns and cities across the U.S., 16- and 17-year-olds are gaining the right to vote. The numbers are still small, but the momentum is real. Advocates say it’s about nurturing lifelong voters.
Take Newark, New Jersey, which allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in its school board election in April. Teen turnout was only about 3%. But that was better than the adults managed. Besides, as Sam Novey from the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement puts it, the city “started from nothing.”
Indeed, adding younger teens to the voter rolls involves building a lot of things from scratch. After Newark passed its ordinance last year allowing youth voting, officials had to rewire voter registration systems and launch a full-scale education campaign. It was about 14 months before 16- and 17-year-olds could cast their first ballots.
“Comparatively lightning fast,” Novey said.
And there’s a payoff to look forward to.
“Research shows that those who are allowed to register and begin voting at 16 are more likely to vote later in life than their peers,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky. “It’s an important way to increase participation.”
In short: Get ’em young, and they’ll keep coming back. The act of voting becomes normal, even expected. And school, Douglas said, is an ideal environment for that first civic nudge — with teachers and peers available to discuss the issues.
The research Douglas cited looked at Scotland, which allowed 16-year-olds to vote in its 2014 independence referendum. The decision was initially controversial, but “nothing bad happened,” said Jan Eichhorn, a political science professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies youth participation and cowrote the study. “Adults realized teenagers were paying attention, often more than adults.”
Public support for youth voting soared in Scotland after that.
The U.S. has been slower to move. Nationwide, the U.S. Constitution guarantees voting rights only for people 18 and older. But at the local level, things are heating up.
Right now, Maryland leads the way. Several municipalities there have already lowered the voting age for local races, taking advantage of state law that makes it easy for municipalities to accommodate registration and ballots for 16- and 17-year olds. A local council vote is enough to change quite a lot of election rules, including, for example, allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.
Compare that with Oakland, California, where voters approved youth voting back in 2020 — only to have to wait four full years for Alameda County to get around to updating its registration systems, a much longer delay than Newark.
In other words, even when the people say yes, the bureaucracy can say, “We’ll get to it eventually.”
That’s what Novey wants everyone to know: that lowering the voting age isn’t just a matter of changing policy. “It touches on a lot of different systems and issues,” he said. Some cities might be able to handle the transition in-house, but others may need new tech, new training, and a lot of patience and support.
In Newark, one of the biggest forces behind the policy was the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. Attorney Micauri Vargas, the associate counsel for the institute’s Democracy & Justice program who drafted the ordinance, said supporters “knew it wasn’t going to get done statewide,” despite Gov. Phil Murphy mentioning it in his last two State of the State speeches. So they went local, to the state’s largest city, where the mayor and City Council were supportive — and, notably, where the movement had been “started by the students.”
Not everyone was cheering. “People still just don’t feel comfortable with young people having a say in what they think are only money matters, but they aren’t,” Vargas said.
Even some teenagers were skeptical. “But then other young people would ask them if they trusted themselves, and they always said they did,” Vargas said. “They changed their minds.”
This question is about more than voting rules. It’s about trust — not just in systems, but in young people’s ability to shape them. And like Eichhorn said, some adults might just need to spend more time with teenagers to see what they’re capable of.
Of course, there are critics of expanding the franchise this way. Some argue that it’s a slippery slope, or that teenagers are too immature or uninformed to handle voting responsibly. But Douglas points out that we don’t typically take voting rights away from adults on that basis — “even ones who may be legally incompetent. Yet bright, informed 16-year-olds can’t vote.” Fair point.
For now, youth voting in America is a patchwork, enabled by quirks in local laws, driven by ambitious students, and supported by researchers like Novey and his Vote 16 Network, which offers best practices for cities.
And it’s still far from mainstream. But so was same-day registration once. So was voting by mail. So was early voting. All of those ideas sounded radical at some point — until they didn’t.

(Photo: North Carolina Department of Commerce HUD CDBG-DR Helene recovery Action Plan)North Carolina officials have denied a local firm’s request for the state to re-bid a critical hurricane rebuilding contract.
The state held a hearing last month after IEM International, which is based in Morrisville, filed a complaint alleging that it was improperly disqualified from receiving the $81.5 million contract. Horne, another firm based in Mississippi, won the bid. It is tasked with managing a group of contractors and leading the rebuild of western homes after the deadliest and most destructive storm in state history.
IEM’s protest on the decision was denied on June 30, the firm said in a statement. Company officials have 60 days to decide if they want to appeal the ruling through the state’s administrative process.
“IEM was disappointed that the decision letter did not address a significant amount of the substantive evidence we presented to the agency during the protest,” the company said in a statement.
That 20-page decision letter, provided to NC Newsline, outlines the state’s rebuttal to IEM’s complaints. Among those complaints: that the state’s bidding process was biased for Horne, that IEM’s bid was rejected arbitrarily, and that Horne was “not a responsible vendor” and should not have been awarded the contract.
NC Department of Commerce officials rejected IEM’s protest on all counts, providing the most thorough and explicit defense of Horne since the firm was awarded the contract. State lawmakers have separately begun to probe the bid process, questioning Horne’s prior work in and out of state.
“Commerce is focused on delivering results for Helene survivors in western North Carolina who need our help getting back into their homes,” department spokesperson David Rhoades said in a statement. “We’ve received well over 300 applications so far for the Renew NC single-family housing program and we remain hopeful we can start construction work on the first homes later this summer.”
And Horne’s attorneys have issued their own response, accusing IEM of making “desperate attacks” and digging up “misleading” documents about a legal settlement the firm made earlier this year.
“Now that IEM’s meritless bid protest has been rejected by the Department on all grounds, it appears IEM is just continuing to sling mud,” attorney Mitch Armbruster, who represents Horne, wrote in an emailed statement to NC Newsline. “HORNE, however, is already on the ground providing critical services to the areas of western North Carolina impacted by Hurricane Helene.”
How IEM protested the bid — and how the state rejected it
IEM’s bid was disqualified, state officials say, because it did not include enough financial information.
The firm wrote in the bid that its financial statements were not public, but could be provided upon request. But the contract bid “was the request,” state officials responded — so that section was deemed incomplete. IEM’s bid was ruled ineligible and was not graded, according to scoring documents.
IEM has also taken issue with the state’s request, and how it was constructed. The firm argued that North Carolina’s technical specifications “were designed to favor Horne,” according to the state’s decision letter. And it alleged that there was a conflict of interest because a former Horne employee drafted the contract criteria.
Jonathan Krebs, Gov. Josh Stein’s advisor for western North Carolina, was involved in the draft process. He worked for Horne until April 2024. But state officials, in their letter to IEM, said his involvement and role were standard fare.
“It is not unreasonable for the state to utilize someone who has expertise in disaster recovery in the drafting of a [contract request],” they wrote.
“There is no indication that Jonathan Kreb[s] … has a conflict of interest, as defined by law,” they added.
As for IEM’s argument that the contract’s criteria favored Horne, they wrote that the specifications were “more than appropriate and does not demonstrate bias.”
Armbruster, the attorney for Horne, wrote that “IEM proposed the highest cost bid of all bidders, to do less work, and failed to provide basic audited financial reports” as part of their offer.
After IEM attempts to revisit legal settlement and past work, Horne pushes back
IEM’s arguments for a re-bid went beyond disagreements about the state’s process. The company also argued to the state that its competitor should not have been awarded the contract in the first place.
Horne is an “irresponsible vendor,” IEM argued, and should have been ruled ineligible for the contract. IEM cited a previous contract between North Carolina and Horne that ended in 2021; Horne’s involvement in a data breach class action lawsuit; and Horne’s having faced allegations of “incompetence and fraud.”
Attorneys for Horne also sat in on the state hearing and presented counter-arguments.
Horne served as prime contractor during North Carolina’s hurricane recovery efforts in the eastern part of the state, from 2019 to 2022. That homebuilding operation was beset by complaints of poor case management, accounting errors and communications. The contract was not renewed.
State officials wrote that Horne’s Helene recovery bid met all of their qualifications. And they cited the firm’s own rebuttal, in which they said that Horne and the state “jointly agreed to not renew the ReBuild NC contract.”
The state also disputed IEM’s description of both legal matters. A Mississippi court granted Horne’s motion to dismiss the data breach case, officials wrote. The fraud allegations, meanwhile, stem from a case in West Virginia that led to a $1.2 million settlement in April.
State officials wrote that Horne settled “to avoid the time and expense of a legal defense, but that there ‘was no fraud.'”
In that West Virginia case, Horne was tapped to develop the state’s plan to use federal block grant dollars (the same kind that will be used in western North Carolina). West Virginia officials found that a contract originally valued at $900,000 had expanded to $18 million. And a news release from the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development’s watchdog described “problematic” invoices from Horne that included property inspections for vacant lots and fictitious applicant information.
Horne says the company, as part of the settlement, did not admit any wrongdoing. IEM, during its protest, referenced a document from a federal watchdog about the case.
That document is an investigation report from the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development’s inspector general’s office. A copy of the report, obtained by NC Newsline, states that “Horne … supplied the State of West Virginia with a fraudulent invoice for payment.”
“HUD will not pursue suspension or debarment action against Horne related to this matter,” officials wrote in the report, which was dated April 30 and made available to the public in mid-May.
Both Horne’s attorney and state officials point to language in the report noting that it “contains neither recommendations nor conclusions of the Office of the Inspector General.”
“The State of N.C. awarded the contract to Horne on May 9 prior to the release of this document,” said Rhoades, the department spokesperson. “We also conducted due diligence with HUD’s Office of Inspector General ourselves.”
Armbruster, Horne’s attorney, said that IEM did not include the OIG document in its official protest materials — only displaying “a screenshot of the report in a PowerPoint” during the meeting. And Horne did not know the document existed until after that meeting, he said.
“IEM’s protest raises the West Virginia matter and other complaints in its protest for no other reason than to sling mud,” Armbruster wrote. “It has zero legal bearing on the procurement.”
Separately, Horne has also sought to correct the record on how the West Virginia case has been publicly portrayed. Another attorney for Horne sent a letter to Lisa Johnston, the U.S. Attorney for Southern District of West Virginia, in late May.
In the letter, attorney John W. Huber called the department’s press release about the settlement “misleading and improper.”
“Adding language that simply slanders a defendant to make a press release sound more dramatic is entirely inappropriate, and unfortunately too common,” Huber wrote.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Image-4-1024x642.jpeg,,,2025-07-08 13:17:23.402688

S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts and quickly requested the temporary restraining order, which was issued later that day.The suit alleges Planned Parenthood was singled out “in order to punish them for lawful activity, namely advocating for and providing legal abortion access wholly outside the Medicaid program and without using any federal funds.”The filing also says more than 1 million Medicaid enrollees go to Planned Parenthood in a given year and that the organization received more than one-third of its total aggregate revenue from Medicaid reimbursement during fiscal year 2023. District Court Judge Indira Talwani’s brief two-page temporary restraining order called on the Trump administration to file a status update later this week. And she set an in-person hearing later this month to hear from Planned Parenthood and the Trump administration.Talwani was nominated to the bench by former President Barack Obama.The Trump administration has yet to file any documents in the case and the Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom about the judge’s temporary restraining order. Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon that the Department of Justice plans to challenge the temporary restraining order.""Absolutely, yes. We're on it,” Bondi said.  Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts and Planned Parenthood Association of Utah — the three groups that filed the lawsuit — wrote in a statement they were “grateful that the court acted swiftly to block this unconstitutional law attacking Planned Parenthood providers and patients.“Already, in states across the country, providers and health center staff have been forced to turn away patients who use Medicaid to get basic sexual and reproductive health care because President Trump and his backers in Congress passed a law to block them from going to Planned Parenthood. There are no other providers who can fill the gap if the ‘defunding’ of Planned Parenthood is allowed to stand.

The move effectively calls for a carve out for religious organizations from the rarely used IRS rule called the Johnson Amendment, put in place in 1954 and named after then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson.
In a joint court filing intended to end an ongoing case against the IRS, the tax collection agency and the National Religious Broadcasters Association — a Evangelical media consortium — and other plaintiffs have asked a federal court in Texas to stop the government from enforcing the Johnson Amendment against the plaintiffs.
The Johnson Amendment is a 1954 amendment to the U.S. tax code that prohibits tax-exempt organizations, including churches, from endorsing or opposing political candidates.
The Christian media group and others filed suit against the IRS last August, stating that the amendment violates their First Amendment rights to the freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, among other legal protections. On Monday, the IRS and plaintiffs wrote that the Johnson Amendment should be interpreted “so that it does not reach communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith.”
The New York Times was first to report the news of the court filing.
The IRS has generally not enforced the Johnson Amendment against houses of worship for speech related to electoral politics.
President Donald Trump has said he wanted to get rid of the Johnson Amendment and signed an executive order in 2017 directing Treasury to disregard the rule.
“I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” Trump said at a National Prayer Breakfast in 2017, which is a high-profile event bringing together faith leaders, politicians and dignitaries.
Representatives from the IRS and the National Religious Broadcasters Association did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S. After that initial $3.2 million donation, Robison formed Natura Resources and committed to investing another $30.5 million in the project.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
‘The West will lead’: Utah, Idaho, Wyoming team up on nuclear energy development

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
Federal money could supercharge state efforts to preserve nuclear power

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.










We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics


Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Preston Keres/USDA)Not all farmers and ranchers will agree in a discussion about climate change, but it would be difficult to find a Midwest producer who did not value climate-related data addressing drought, precipitation, temperature and frost outlooks.
These are all pieces of data gathered and distributed by the Ames-based Midwest Climate Hub, which along with the other 10 regional climate hubs under the U.S. Department of Agriculture, is slated to be cut from the federal agriculture budget.
The U.S. House appropriations bill that sets the 2026 fiscal year budgets for agriculture, rural development, food and drug administration and related agencies includes “no funds for climate hubs or climate corps.”
The summary of the bill, which closely follows budget requests from President Donald Trump, says it “safeguards American taxpayer dollars and preserves core functions” by eliminating funding for climate hubs, among other changes.
Eleven regional Climate Hubs were established as interagency departments by USDA in 2014 with the goal of coordinating across USDA agencies, and with U.S. producers, on climate resiliency strategies.
 Lowering the information barrier

Laurie Nowatzke was formerly the associate director of the Midwest Climate Hub, before she was terminated in February and then brought back in March briefly before she took the second deferred resignation program offered to federal employees.
Nowatzke said part of her role at the hub was to “bridge” on-the-ground responses and needs of producers to USDA research, and vice versa.
Each climate hub is a little different, depending on the needs of their region, but Nowatzke said climate, in its most basic form relating to weather patterns, was a big focus for the Midwest.
“A huge focus of ours was taking that sort of experienced climate and weather conditions and how that applies or affects agriculture,” Nowatzke said.
This is most seen through the ag-focus climate outlooks the hub put out monthly, and weekly during crop season.
Nowatzke said as of the end of April when she left the office, staff were not allowed to update content on the website and have instead continued to send the outlooks via email to subscribers.
She said the climate outlooks were a “key product” the hub put out that producers and stakeholders said was especially helpful to contextualize the “vast array of climate and weather data” available from outlets like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Rod Pierce, a long-time corn and soybean farmer in central Iowa, said the outlooks help him with both long- and short-term planning in his operation. They help him answer questions such as when is the last frost so he can plant, is it going to be dry, and importantly, what conditions are other Midwestern states facing that he should take into account when marketing his commodities.
“Weather is so important in us making decisions, trying to look at the trend for the year…do I want to grow corn or beans…it just helps put some of that stuff in line,” Pierce said.
He said the hub reports give him a “big picture” of trends in the region, and he feels the information is trustworthy.
“We know the people that are doing it are not just blowing smoke,” Pierce said. “It’s good data, it’s researched data.”
Alli Wenman, the regional climate outreach project manager for the University of Wisconsin–Madison’s  extension, said in interviews with extension office managers and educators throughout the Midwest, she learned access to training and applicable information were the top tools these professionals said they needed to discuss the impacts of climate change with producers in their regions.
“They need to know the climate science … but they also need to know the social science, like, how do I facilitate that conversation around climate,” Wenman said. “The hub has that information and has the capacity to build those tools, the capacity to build those trainings.”
Wenman spoke with these professionals as part of a project, funded by USDA, to forge connections between university extension programs and the climate hubs and work toward greater agricultural resilience in the face of climate change.
She said the partnership with the Midwest Climate Hub was “key” to cut through the “noise” at the research level and give producers the tools and data that matter most to their operations.
Wenman said the ag-focused climate outlooks have become a trustworthy source of information for a lot of producers.
“The information is out there, but it’s maybe not framed for ag,” Wenman said. “There’s too much information, so they help us sort through what information is relevant for ag and put it into ag terms.”
The reports pull information from nearly a dozen agencies and compile it into a four-page report full of climate, crop and soil moisture information and graphics.
A spokesperson for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, who served on the subcommittee that passed the bill, said the hubs are a “duplicative” program and the same research can be conducted through competitive agriculture research programs that are already funded by the federal government and supported by the House’s newest bill.
The bill’s report shows it would terminate the funding for climate hubs and climate corps, which were initiated under former President Joe Biden to train young people for high-demand clean energy jobs.
“The bill maintains critical funding to ensure we have the safest food, drugs, and devices in the world and puts America’s farmers, ranchers, and rural communities first,” the bill report reads.
Hinson, in a statement, said “farmers felt like they were screaming into a void” as the the Biden administration “focused on DEI and radical climate policies” while farmers’ “real needs were ignored.”
“This bill cuts wasteful spending – including for so-called “Climate Hubs” – and champions President Trump’s farmer-first agenda to strengthen longstanding research programs, support rural businesses and infrastructure, and safeguard our food supply,” Hinson said. “I will continue to support farmer-led conservation initiatives to ensure Iowa producers are empowered with conservation tools and have all the resources they need to feed and fuel the world.”
The House appropriations committee also tried to reject funding for the hubs in its FY25 budget bill, though the Senate’s version expanded funding for the program. Because Congress has failed to pass appropriations bills, the government has been operating on continuing spending resolutions based on the fiscal year 2024 budget.
The Senate passed the massive, budget reconciliation package, known as the “one big beautiful bill” Tuesday which sets mandatory spending over a 10-year span. The appropriations bills, like the House-proposed ag bill, are separate budgets that deal with discretionary spending in the agencies.
 Reports form the Hub

While the climate outlook reports are what many Midwest producers might know the hub for, the regional hubs also produced reports on the impacts of climate change, and mitigation strategies, on agriculture, forestry, tribal lands, wetlands and other region-specific areas.
Nowatzke said funding from the Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration helped the hub to “really chip away” at climate mitigation concerns and greenhouse gas emissions.
“So (the hub was) starting to move beyond just dealing with climate change or near-term weather events, but also addressing agriculture’s impact on climate change as well,” Nowatzke said.
The Midwest Climate Hub produced reports like “Climate Change Impacts on Iowa Agriculture” and similar reports for eight Midwestern states. The reports calculated long-term changes in temperature, precipitation, growing season length and the impacts these have had, and are projected to have, on agriculture.
Nowatzke said these reports also employed feedback from on-the-ground folks at extension offices, crop physiologists and farmers to determine the strategies that would be helpful for a farm trying to deal with a changing climate.
The hub also explored, and produced reports on topics like: the relationship between climate change and specialty crops in the Midwest and a guide on managing the risks of field and equipment fires which are exacerbated by drought conditions.
The hub, in collaboration with on Midwestern Regional Climate Center, also reported and developed interactive tools for farmers on soil temperature and frost dates.
Nowatzke said while the Climate Hub sits on a congressional chopping block, and has already dealt with cuts to staff and programs, most of the hub’s collaborating agencies have also been hit by federal cuts.
She said without the hubs, this climate research at other agencies could persist, but she expects USDA would struggle in “delivering the science that they do, to the people that they’re developing the science for.”
“Researchers serve a really important role in developing that work and publishing it, but also we need professionals who are trained and capable and have capacity to actually disseminate that in ways that people can use it,” Nowatzke said.
Wenman said this is what she hears from other extension officers and producers who, while they might not use the term climate change, are seeking tools to help adapt to more extreme weather, drought patterns and other associated effects of a changing climate. Wenman said the hub information is “actionable” and the “stuff that really matters to people.”
“Extension is trying to prepare our staff to better help farmers deal with the effects of changing climate conditions,” Wenman said. “Losing the hub would seriously hinder our ability to continue to do our jobs well within that realm.”

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The group behind the black mass in March at the Kansas Statehouse — which drew thousands of counter-protesters and ended in multiple arrests — was denied a permit to hold another protest this summer.
Michael Stewart, the Satanic Grotto leader, says the denial is religious discrimination. Adam Proffitt, the Kansas secretary of administration, says the permit was denied because of safety concerns and violence at the last protest.
Stewart was planning a “witching hour protest” from 9 p.m. to midnight on Aug. 2 with the same sentiment as the black mass: “to end Christian favoritism within our state government,” as the group’s Facebook post reads.
“This isn’t just a permit denial; it’s an outright cancellation of our right to protest, fueled by what appears to be a deeply biased agenda,” Stewart said in a news release. “The State of Kansas is actively working to silence voices that challenge the status quo, especially those from minority faiths and marginalized communities.”
Stewart told Kansas Reflector that his permit request was “flat out ignored” for a few weeks, and he only got a response after he showed up in person.
In response to a Kansas Reflector request for comment, Department of Administration spokesman Samir Arif pointed to a response Proffitt had given to Stewart.
“The State has increased safety concerns regarding any event occurring on the south steps after sundown, including whether adequate Kansas Highway Patrol resources are available to address these safety concerns after dark,” Proffitt wrote.
In the new release, Stewart said Capitol Police Chief Brandon Bichsel told him he had “no reservations” about the police’s ability to maintain security. Bichsel did not respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment.
“Additionally, I decline to grant a permission to you, on behalf of the organization, due to improper acts that occurred when a previous permit space on the Statehouse grounds was granted to you for an event that occurred in March 2025,” Proffitt wrote, referencing the black mass.
The permit Stewart obtained for the black mass allowed the Satanic Grotto to protest outside of the Statehouse — but not inside — after Gov. Laura Kelly banned any protests inside the building on the planned day. Before the black mass, Stewart told Kansas Reflector he planned to defy Kelly’s directive.

On the day of the black mass, Stewart entered the Statehouse and began a dedication to Satan. Counter-protesters physically intervened, including Marcus Schroeder — a 21-year-old from Wisconsin who had been charged with making a false bomb threat on a Pride parade. After Schroeder attempted to grab Stewart’s copy of “The Satanic Bible” two times, Stewart punched Schroeder in the face twice, which resulted in both of their arrests.
“Your conduct created a risk to public safety, violated the terms of your permit, and caused injury to another person,” Proffitt wrote.
Shawnee County prosecutors decided not to pursue charges against Stewart.
Restrictions didn’t stop Stewart at the last protest. But after his arrest, Stewart said he is hesitant to go forward with his planned “witching hour” event.
“We are going to do everything in our power to ensure the event can take place,” Stewart told Kansas Reflector. “However, after consultation with my criminal lawyer, I’m concerned the state is setting the ground for heavy consequences if we proceed.”
Stewart said he could face 18 months of incarceration if the prosecutors decide to pursue the charges from his black mass arrest. He said that being incarcerated would prevent him from serving the community.
“We aren’t done fighting,” he said. “We stepped up to the plate last time when it came to making a point with our safety and freedom. This time we will find other routes that hopefully illustrate the same points.”
The Department of Administration on July 1 denied Stewart’s request to reconsider its decision.
“Should your organization wish to reserve a space for its event, the ending time cannot go past sundown, and someone other than you must take responsibility for the application and event,” said Pat Doran, chief counsel for the Department of Administration, in an email to Stewart.

Attorneys for the MEDC have until July 11 to determine if they want to appeal a decision issued last week by Oakland District Court Judge James Brady. The judge ruled that Nessel’s office could keep documents it seized in a June 18 raid on the MEDC, the economic development arm of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration.
The Department of Attorney General executed the search warrant after it claimed in court that MEDC stonewalled an ongoing investigation into Global Link International and its owner, businesswoman Fay Beydoun. No charges have been filed against Beydoun, but it is alleged that Beydoun may have misused funds from a legislative grant issued in 2022. The department of attorney general also raided Beydoun’s residence in June, in addition to its search warrant executed on the agency’s offices.
Brady also ruled that if an appeal was not filed by July 11, Nessel’s office could move forward with an independent taint team, which would determine whether documents were privileged or constituted material evidence.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Michigan Advance asked if the MEDC was considering an appeal and if one would be filed by the July 11 deadline. A spokesperson responded by saying the agency had no further comment on the case.
As the investigation waits in limbo, the probe into the $20 million granted to Beydoun in 2022 has caused controversy at all levels of state government.
The grant for Global Link was approved by the Michigan Legislature – which at the time was still under full Republican control – and Whitmer’s office, and Nessel’s probe seeks to learn more about how involved the MEDC might have been in moving the grant along to Beydoun.
The Detroit News was the first to report that Beydoun misused the grant funds for various high priced items, which sparked transparency concerns over Lansing’s earmarks process and has linked Beydoun to Whitmer, who has been described as one of her donors and political appointees.
Court documents show alleged stonewalling from MEDC
According to court documents obtained by the Advance, the attorney general’s office sent an initial documents request to the MEDC in April 2022. The department asked for a copy of the grant application and any other supporting documents, along with a copy of the approved grant.
After some back and forth, the agency provided three documents to the attorney general’s office – the approved grant contract and the application, as well as the budget that approved the grant.
A timeline provided in court documents shows that Beydoun sent a letter to Whitmer that sought to wind down the grant funding in May 2024.
Around that time, the attorney general’s office asked MEDC for additional information and expressed a continuing need for documentation showing the agency’s interactions with Global Link International. The MEDC pledged to continue cooperation.
Still, the department kept asking for more information, including the entirety of the agency’s case file. The MEDC responded but was mum on the request for the case file, but it later sent the department a copy of documents that were requested by The Detroit News.
Meanwhile, investigators in June 2024 received new evidence from a witness unaffiliated with the MEDC. The person allegedly told investigators that the agency had a series of meetings with Beydoun in the summer of 2021 seeking approval for a global business accelerator, which was about a year before the Legislature passed an appropriation for the company.
Michigan House OKs earmark reforms in state budget process

Beydoun was said to have been on the MEDC board that would be in charge of administrating the grant, the witness said. Additionally, the witness provided investigators with documents that were never identified by the MEDC when the attorney general’s office asked for any and all documentation.
One of those documents was an email sent to Trish Foster, the governor’s chief operating officer, in which Beydoun relays that the MEDC approved the appropriation. Both MEDC CEO Quentin Messer and Susan Corbin, director of the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, were aware of the development, Beydoun added.
Most of the communication between the agency and the attorney general’s office in April and May 2024 was between MEDC counsel Brad Heffner and Special Agent Steve Morse. But, having been provided no other documentation, aside from The Detroit News’ Freedom of Information Act request, Assistant Attorney General Matthew Payok got involved on July 9, 2024.
The same day, Heffner responded to answer questions but provided no additional documentation.
Payok requested a meeting with Heffner and the MEDC staff that worked on the Global Link project. Heffner responded but only offered a meeting with himself and another MEDC attorney, court records show.
In March of 2025, the MEDC officially declared Global Link International in breach of the original grant agreement.
On April 24, one year after the first request, Morse asked MEDC for all invoices and receipts related to the Global Link grant to date. A phone conference commenced shortly thereafter, where Payok and Morse again requested the entire case file and an opportunity to interview non-attorney witnesses who approved Global Link expenses.
Heffner in that phone conference assured the attorney general’s office that he would provide the file and the names of witnesses.
A back and forth ensued throughout the month of May, in which court records show Heffner stalled and promised delivery of the documents until May 15. At that point, Heffner stated that the MEDC would not provide a single name or facilitate a meeting with requested witnesses.
Instead, Heffner said he would be able to provide a process document – one that was modified in the middle of the grant’s lifespan.
Invoices and receipts requested by the attorney general’s office were finally turned over on May 21.
Global Link employees were interviewed in late May, as well, stating that Messer was told Beydoun was operating without oversight and misusing the grant funds. The employee told investigators that Beydoun was a friend and ultimately did nothing with the information.
Court documents filed by the attorney general’s office show that the MEDC, despite initially stating that it was unaware anything was amiss with the Global Link grant, hired an independent criminal defense attorney, Gerald Gleeson of the Miller Canfield law firm, for its own witnesses.
Gleeson did not respond to numerous requests for comments on the case or requests for copies of his own filings in the case.
Raid transcript shows MEDC attorney attempted to conceal evidence
The attorney general’s office raided the MEDC’s offices on June 18.
In an affidavit recounting the events of the raid filed by Special Agent Kyle Kolka, the department had lost trust in the MEDC to provide necessary documents and information, which necessitated the execution of a search warrant.
Kolka stated that Linda Asciutto, chief general counsel to MEDC, called outside counsel when officers arrived at the agency’s Lansing office at around 9 a.m. on June 18. The conversation captured on an audio recording device worn by Kolka involved Asciutto telling MEDC’s attorney that officers were not going to take her files and that she supposed that they could “haul her in” for potentially obstructing them.
She then says that she has to get back up to her office, to which Kolka told Asciutto to stay put in the lobby. Asciutto was allegedly defiant, saying she didn’t need to stay anywhere and stated she was going back to her office.
Asciutto asked to speak with her attorney and asked Kolka to step away for a moment, to which the agent obliged. She later asked Morse to leave her office alone, and maintained that it was off limits. The officers executing the search warrant told her that they needed to look in her office, a move that Asciutto asserted to be “outrageous.” Asciutto also asserted that agents weren’t entitled to “her stuff,” and that officers had to take her at her word where all Global Link documents were held.
Morse, in response, said officers would only seize Global Link related documents, but that they did intend to search Asciutto’s office for those materials.
During conversations between a special agent and an assistant attorney general, it was determined that the department and MEDC’s attorney would work on privilege issues before anything was seized. Asciutto claimed that those documents had already been set aside.
Arguments ensued between Asciutto and officers as they continued to bag and seal documents and take boxes that Asciutto claimed were protected by attorney-client privilege. But despite her protestations that officers were being provided all relevant materials, officers found in Asciutto’s office a purple folder sitting on her desk that had “GLI,” the acronym for Global Link, visible on the first page.
Asciutto claimed that was also a privileged document, as was a three-ring binder marked GLI that was sitting on her floor.
The last page of the affidavit submitted by Kolka notes that, given her reluctance to open her office and the fact that she had relevant material within, it was his conclusion that Asciutto acted to conceal evidence during the search.
Morse also filed a supplemental affidavit in court noting the same conclusion regarding Asciutto.
“At no time did Asciutto ever explain how any document she mentioned was attorney-client privileged, who the clients were, whether the communications were confidential, or whether they contained legal advice,” Morse wrote. “She just continued to make blanket statements about large groups of documents. … Even though MEDC had been preparing a subpoena production for the Legislature that had been redacted, Asciutto never mentioned a privilege log, nor did we find such a log.”
The “subpoena” in question was a formal request for documents and records related to Global Link issued in the form of a letter by state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), chair of the Michigan House Oversight Committee, who is now looking into the grant and MEDC’s involvement. DeBoyer’s request was sent June 5, and the letter was also signed by state Rep. Steve Carra (R-Three Rivers), chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments.
In the affidavit filed with the district court, Morse noted that had officers not searched Asciutto’s office over her objections, they would not have found the binder, which he said was certainly within the scope of the search warrant.
“Asciutto’s conduct – including telling us that, as an officer of the court, we had everything related to GLI when in fact more related documents were sitting on her desk and clearly in use – indicates that she directly intended to prevent investigators from accessing evidence that we were there to seize under the warrant,” Morse wrote.
Judge allows Nessel’s office to keep documents – for now
On July 1, lawyers for the Department of Attorney General and Gleeson, representing staff members named as witnesses but not targets in the investigation, attempted to argue for and against quashing the search warrant executed on June 18.
Gleeson maintained that many of the documents seized were privileged, and that its work to provide documents to the House Oversight Committee involved a privilege review, according to The Detroit News. 
Meanwhile, Payok argued that the department had no clear indication of what was privileged and what wasn’t, except for writing on some boxes indicating as such – which was noted in the lengthy transcript of the June raid.
Still, Brady ruled that Nessel’s office could keep the evidence collected in the raid and that if MEDC had not appealed his decision by July 11, the department could proceed as planned with a taint team.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 11:08:10.796827

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The University of Northern Iowa will begin offering in-state tuition to students from Iowa’s six border states this fall, with the university’s foundation finding seed money for the program after Gov. Kim Reynolds removed its funding from the proposed state budget.
The Cedar Falls university announced the launch of its Neighboring State Rate Tuesday — a plan that will allow new students from Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin to pay greatly reduced tuition compared to their out-of-state peers. Tuition for these students, pending Iowa Board of Regents approval at the end of the month, will be set at $10,201 for the fall — a rate matching the one approved for in-state, undergraduate students.
“This is an exciting development for students and their families across the region,” UNI President Mark Nook said in a statement. “We anticipate that UNI’s Neighboring State Rate will attract even more talented students to our campus to take advantage of the wide variety of academic programs we offer, at an even more affordable price.

Funding to the tune of $1.5 million for the new tuition rate program was included in education appropriations legislation passed this spring, but Reynolds line-item vetoed the allocation before signing the bill into law.
In her veto letter, Reynolds cited questions about how current students would fall under the tuition change and the “expectation of ongoing funding” as reasons for striking out the appropriation. UNI originally requested $3 million in one-time funding for the program, she said in the letter, but later changed the ask to $1.5 million with the hope of future state funding.
University spokesperson Pete Moris said in an interview the UNI Foundation, the university’s fundraising branch, will provide $1.5 million to start the program this year, filling the gap left by lowered tuition rates. Students will pay around $12,000 less annually through the new tuition program than they would with traditional nonresident rates, he said.
After the veto, Moris said university staff and leadership believed the program should still get started as soon as possible, as it will take longer than the month and some change before school starts to see its full impact.
“We really need a full recruiting cycle to put this into play and to start spreading that message into those six states and getting the word out,” Moris said.
There are currently 467 students attending UNI from Iowa’s contiguous states, Moris said, with almost 75% of the group hailing from Illinois or Minnesota. South Dakota has the smallest representation of the group, with only six students. South Dakota has a statewide nonresident tuition program of its own with 10 states, Iowa included.
Nonresident undergraduate students who don’t qualify for the UNI program will pay $22,359 for the 2025-2026 academic year, a 3% increase from last year. This rate, as well as rates for all other groups of students at UNI, are the lowest in the state for public universities.
“We really think that this is something that’s going to be a benefit from the state of Iowa in terms of attracting new folks to the state to help meet some of our workforce needs, but also for UNI,” Moris said. “The students from different places we have adds to the vibrancy of our campus and the experience for our students.”

On July 4, Nory Sontay Ramos stepped off a flight from San Antonio into a country she hardly recognized: Guatemala.
The summer wasn’t supposed to start this way. The 17-year-old had plans. In early June, she wrapped up 11th grade on a high note, having made the honor roll and represented her Los Angeles high school in the city finals for track. With track season over, she turned her attention to cross-country, showing up to campus for practice after the school year ended.
Everything changed when she and her mother, Estela Ramos — both undocumented — appeared at what they thought was a standard check-in visit with immigration officials on June 30.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

“ICE took us to a room, and they ended up telling my mom, ‘Your case is over, so we have to take you guys with us,’” Sontay Ramos told The 19th. Over the objections of their attorney, federal agents led them away.
The next day, she and her mother were shipped to Texas. And by July 4, they were on a plane to Guatemala, a country where neither of them have lived for over a decade. On Independence Day — an occasion associated with freedom, with hope — their American dream shattered. Sontay Ramos has no idea what will become of the friends, family members and school community her deportation forced her to leave behind in Los Angeles.
A lawyer hired after she and her mother were detained said Monday that a motion to reopen the case has been filed with the Board of Immigration Appeals but provided no other information to The 19th.
A year shy of becoming a high school graduate in the United States, the teen’s life — and opportunities — completely changed in the span of five days.
“I’m confused,” Sontay Ramos said, her voice breaking. “I don’t know. I’m just really sad about everything.”

President Donald Trump campaigned for a return to office with the promise of mass deportations, characterizing undocumented immigrants as criminals and threats to women and girls. But as his administration has ramped up enforcement of his policy priority, undocumented people with no criminal backgrounds have made up the largest share of immigrants targeted. Those who are pursuing legal status through the proper channels have also become vulnerable — showing up to check-ins, like Sontay Ramos and her mother — only to be detained. These developments, recent polls reveal, have led to public disapproval of the Trump administration’s strategies.
Civil liberties and advocacy groups have raised concerns that undocumented immigrants are being removed so quickly they have been denied the right to due process. With Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act directing $150 billion more toward mass deportations, expedited removals of undocumented immigrants will almost certainly increase — and those immigrants who arrived in the United States as children like Sontay Ramos stand to get caught in the middle.

The Trump administration deported more than 93,800 people from January 20 to June 11, with ICE more than doubling its arrests compared with the same period in 2024, revealed an analysis by the Washington Post based on information from the Deportation Data Project. (The data does not reflect arrest and removal numbers from Customs and Border Protection.) Of those, 61% did not have criminal records and almost 90 percent were men, underscoring how relatively uncommon it is for a mother and daughter to be removed.
The Trump administration has not provided a tally of how many minors have been deported this year, but The 19th’s review of figures from the Deportation Data Project found that only about 3% of removals involved children. When ICE targets juveniles, the incidents often make national headlines, such as when a 9-year-old boy and his father living in Torrance, California, were detained in May and swiftly deported to Honduras. In states including Michigan, Massachusetts and New York, the detainment of teenagers, including those who are technically legal adults, have also garnered widespread media attention this year.
But when Sontay Ramos and her mother exited their Guatemala-bound flight on Friday, they weren’t met with fanfare. None of their family members in the Central American nation knew to expect them. With the help of an internet connection, they managed to contact one of Sontay Ramos’ older sisters, with whom they’re now living. The teenager isn’t sure which part of Guatemala she’s in, though she describes the area as rural.
Just 6 when she left Guatemala, Sontay Ramos struggles to recall what life there was like. But she remembers the emotion she felt as a small child: fear.
“I was scared because there’s gangsters here, and they tried to kill my mom,” she said. A family member involved in a gang threatened her mother, once attacking her so badly she needed to be hospitalized, she said. “My mom was scared.”
A study exploring the root causes of immigration from Guatemala from 2012 to 2019 found violence, poverty, climate change and corruption to be among the driving factors and that many such migrants hail from rural parts of the country.
“The two major reasons, especially if we look at families, have to do with violence and drought,” said David Leblang, a coauthor of that study and politics professor at the University of Virginia.  “It has been drought and then flood, hurricane and then drought that has just decreased the ability for families to put food on the table, so you see a combination of economic insecurity, but more so for families, food insecurity — because when you can’t feed your kids, that’s when families are going to pick up and they’re going to move first to more urban areas and then out of the country.”
About 11 years ago, Sontay Ramos and her mother headed by car to the United States in search of safety and opportunity. There, other family members awaited them and they hoped to be granted asylum, she said.
The transition was not easy. They left behind three of Sontay Ramos’ older siblings who did not want to come to the United States, she said. Her father remained in Guatemala, too. His death from illness shortly after she moved away was devastating.
“Unfortunately, her dad passed away at a young age, just like two weeks after her arrival to the States,” recalled Jennifer Ramos, Sontay Ramos’ 22-year-old cousin who lives in Los Angeles. “She grew up with her dad, so that also hit her at such a young age, just coming to a new country at 6 years old and not knowing the language here and losing her father. It was definitely hard for her.”
Getting accustomed to life in Los Angeles also wasn’t easy. Sontay Ramos and her mother are Indigenous Guatemalans, fluent in K’iché. Few resources in their native tongue made assimilation more challenging in a city where English and Spanish are the primary languages.
Jennifer Ramos helped her little cousin learn to speak English. “She would come over, and I would help her with her homework. When she first came to the States, my younger sister was kind of her only friend in school because she didn’t know anybody and, again, the language barrier. She actually does struggle speaking Spanish.”
In time, Sontay Ramos and her mother adjusted to life in California. Her mother ultimately became a garment worker, employed as a seamstress until physical setbacks — illness and surgery — sidelined her earlier this year. Her deportation has separated her from her life partner, with whom she and her daughter shared an apartment in the Westlake District of Los Angeles, the neighborhood where an ICE raid at a Home Depot close to an elementary school in June panicked families, and days of demonstrations in nearby downtown escalated after Trump deployed 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines.

Los Angeles is a deeply blue city in a liberal state, with the nation’s highest concentration of immigrants — a place that the president has made ground zero for his immigration raids. In November, the city council voted unanimously to make L.A. a sanctuary city, which bars it from using resources for immigration enforcement. Last week, the Trump administration filed suit, challenging the policy. Meanwhile, advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and Public Counsel are suing the Trump administration for what it describes as a pattern of federal violations during immigration raids in Greater Los Angeles.
Before Trump’s immigration policies roiled her neighborhood and upended her life, Sontay Ramos was indistinguishable from her peers born in the United States. She grew up on the Netflix shows “Stranger Things” and “Cobra Kai,” enjoys the music of Lana Del Rey and The Weeknd and dotes on her cat, Max, who turned 1on May 15. He is black — one of her two favorite colors. In her spare time, Sontay Ramos practices taekwondo, which she’s been learning for nearly four years.
“I just liked it,” she said of the martial art. Knowing how to fight, she added, helps her feel protected.
Sontay Ramos never sensed she was in danger before the immigration check-in that would push her out of the United States.
But her cousin Jennifer Ramos worried. The night before, Ramos’ father invited the family over to have Sunday dinner with his wife and three daughters. The evening was largely festive. Her father made shrimp ceviche and was eager for his family to enjoy the tangy, citrusy dish — especially Estela Ramos, who had just celebrated her 45th birthday. But when Estela mentioned that she and her daughter had an immigration check-in scheduled, everyone fell quiet.
“We were kind of scared,” Jennifer Ramos said. “We were like, ‘Are you sure you should go?’”
But her aunt tried to reassure them by letting them know their lawyer said it would be fine. After all, they had shown up for previous check-ins without incident, and if they didn’t appear, immigration officials would just find them at home.
Now, Jennifer Ramos doesn’t know when she’ll see her aunt and cousin again.
“It is unfair that a young student like her has been detained,” she said. “She’s the most deserving person. This should be the least of her worries.”

Sontay Ramos couldn’t help but tear up when she described what she was looking forward to about senior year — graduation, her friends, track-and-field and cross-country.
Although excited to reunite with family members they hadn’t seen in years, she and her mother have been weeping off and on since they arrived in Guatemala.
“I was happy, but I was expecting to see them in another way,” she said of her relatives. “Not like this.”
Sleeping and eating have been tough as has the constant feeling of disorientation. She doesn’t know where she is. In K’iche’, she asked her mother for the name of the town they’re in, but it didn’t register.
She also continues to feel blindsided about why she and her mother were deported at all. She doesn’t understand how or why their case was closed.
Recent polls, particularly those conducted after the immigration raids in Los Angeles, reveal that the Trump’s administration’s immigration crackdowns may be unpopular with the majority of the public. A PBS News/NPR/Marist poll released July 1 found that just 43 percent of Americans support Trump’s tactics.
Sixty-four percent of registered voters support giving most undocumented immigrants in the United States a pathway to legal status, with 31 percent preferring deportation for most of them, according to a Quinnipiac University national poll released June 26. Six months ago, only 55 percent of voters supported giving unauthorized immigrants a path to legal status, while 36 percent backed deportation.
Leblang, the politics professor, said that ultimately the economy will sway the public to take a stand on immigration.
“All of those people who are being deported, they’re consuming goods that are produced by natives,” he said. “So, what the evidence suggests is that’s going to affect native workers’ wages, so across the board, this is going to have a negative effect on the economy.”
For Manuel Guevara — a physical education teacher and coach at the Miguel Contreras Learning Complex, where Sontay Ramos is enrolled as a student — immigration isn’t an economic issue but a personal one. He came to the United States at 11 months old in the mid-1980s during El Salvador’s horrific 12-year civil war, becoming a citizen as a teenager. He fears that more deportations of youth from his school are imminent. He knows some families skipped school graduations in the area due to their concerns over raids. Some are so worried they refuse to let their children attend football practice. He’s heard that other families intend to self deport.


Let us know what you think...


 

“This is not normal,” Guevara said. “Our whole community is beyond vulnerable. A lot of [students’] parents, sad to say, don’t know how to read and write. Their kids need to do that for them. If they’re presented with [immigration] paperwork, they might not even be able to read it because that’s not their primary language.”
He can hardly believe that Sontay Ramos, whom he taught for most of her high school years, is gone.
“She was smiling, happy-go-lucky,” Guevara said. He’s astounded that she was detained and deported in less than a week. “Nory is going into her senior year, which is another thing that’s just killing me. She was going into her senior year with all this momentum.”
Guevara fondly recalled the teen’s high-pitched voice that gets even higher when she’s excited.
“You could tell when she’s coming from down the hallway, for sure,” he said. But her trademark voice is now subdued due to her deportation ordeal. Through tears, she expressed gratitude for how her teachers, classmates and other supporters have donated nearly $7,000 to her GoFundMe campaign.
“I just want to thank everybody for the support and tell them to just be safe out there and be strong no matter what’s going to happen,” she said.
If she can’t return to the United States, she will figure out how to finish her education in Guatemala, Sontay Ramos said.
Guevara is certain she has the aptitude for greatness. Her academics and extracurricular activities are just hints of what she’s capable of, he said.
“She was about to reach cruising altitude,” he said. “Some of our students are capable of reaching the clouds up there and doing some great things. And I really believe that she was on her way.”

The state's highest court says a law enforcement officer can't claim reasonable suspicion a violation of law was occurring simply because a license plate was difficult to read. (Thad Allton for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Supreme Court reversed the drug-trafficking conviction of an Illinois-tagged motorist linked to evidence seized from a vehicle stopped by Geary County law enforcement merely because the frame around a license plate obstructed part of the state’s name.
The unanimous Supreme Court noted Kansas statute didn’t require a state’s name on license plates to be clearly legible. The justices agreed partial obstruction of a word on the out-of-state plate at the center of this case couldn’t provide a Kansas law enforcement officer the opportunity to formulate reasonable suspicion that a crime was or would occur to warrant a traffic stop.
This saga began in March 2021 when Geary County sheriff’s deputy Bradley Rose pulled over motorist Brian Beck on Interstate 70 near Junction City because he noticed half of the word “Illinois” couldn’t be easily read on the tag.
Rose nevertheless called in Beck’s tag to dispatch as “Illinois Charles John 14442” before stepping out of his cruiser, the Supreme Court opinion said. Rose said at trial Beck appeared “extremely nervous,” was breathing deeply during the traffic stop and admitted to being lost. The deputy decided that was enough to detain Beck and call in a drug dog.
During the canine inspection, the animal alerted to possible presence of illegal drugs. The vehicle search revealed a satchel with 2.1 pounds of methamphetamine. At one point, Beck tried to flee the scene but was arrested.
Geary County District Judge Courtney Boehm, an appointee of Republican Gov. Jeff Colyer, rejected the defendant’s motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search. Beck was found guilty of possession with intent to distribute, failure to purchase a drug tax stamp and interference with a law enforcement officer.
Beck, 56, was sentenced to at least 10 years in prison and was at Winfield Correctional Facility when the Supreme Court’s decision was handed down. A Kansas Department of Corrections spokesman said the agency wouldn’t release inmates until a court forwarded necessary paperwork to the prison.
In 2024, a three-judge panel of the Kansas Court of Appeals affirmed Beck’s convictions based on a belief Beck’s license plate wasn’t clearly visible as required.
Beck filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, which concluded the Geary County judge applied an improper legal standard for deciding whether law enforcement had reasonable suspicion to justify a stop and search. The justices likewise concluded the Court of Appeals reached the wrong determination on suppression of evidence.
“We reject the analytic framework adopted by the lower courts and their conclusions of law,” the Supreme Court decision said.
The Supreme Court opinion authored by Justice Eric Rosen wiped Beck’s convictions off the books and sent the case back to district court to determine whether the deputy had “constitutionally valid grounds for making the stop and seizure.”
The high court’s 13-page opinion could serve as a roadmap for Geary County’s reexamination of available evidence in the Beck case.
“No statute requires displaying the Kansas state name anywhere other than on the registration decal, where it may be abbreviated,” said Rosen, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. “It places no such requirement on anything else printed on a license plate, whether it is an ‘I’m Pet Friendly’ logo or a state name.”
The Supreme Court’s decision could offer relief to thousands of drivers in Kansas who installed or left in place brackets on license plates and unwittingly opened themselves to traffic stops, drug-dog searches and seizures by law enforcement.
Supreme Court Justice Dan Biles, who also was appointed by Sebelius, was among members of the Supreme Court perplexed by willingness of the lower courts to broaden license plate regulation in a way that threatened motorists with a fine up to $2,500 or a jail sentence ranging from 30 days to six months.
“There are a lot of frames that cover up half of the word ‘Kansas’ — a lot,” Biles said during oral argument of the case in November. “Anyone driving with that frame is subject to six months in jail? Is that where we’re at with the state’s position on this and this Court of Appeals’ decision?”
“I believe that’s what the statute says,” said Kansas assistant solicitor general Ethan Zipf-Sigler, who unsuccessfully fought to sustain the verdict against Beck.
Biles said the court record in the case was troubling because of assertions license plates in Kansas had to be clearly legible to a law enforcement officer located a safe distance from a targeted vehicle.
“I’m really struck by how arbitrary the enforcement aspect is,” Biles said. “I can’t help but think the state is adding words to a statute that we don’t get to do.”
Attorney Kasper Schirer, senior assistant appellate defender, argued on Beck’s behalf before the Supreme Court and said the traffic stop was unlawful from the outset.
“When no law has been violated, when no traffic law has been violated, the Fourth Amendment does not allow for suspicionless seizures,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Biles-afternoon-1024x708.jpg,,,2025-07-08 10:09:22.281391

Anglers will no longer need reservations to surf fish at most of Delaware’s drive-on beaches starting Saturday, July 12, under a major change announced by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC).
The new policy eliminates weekend and holiday reservation requirements at seven beaches that rarely reach full capacity during peak times.
“As surf tag holders have gotten used to the reservation system, we know from customer feedback that many people like the predictability of knowing they will have a spot and won’t be turned away or have to wait in a long line for someone to leave,” DNREC Secretary Greg Patterson said. “At the same time, DNREC has certainly heard that some anglers, especially locals, like to wake up on a sunny day and decide to get out on the beach. With this change, we will provide different approaches for different types of visitors.”
The affected beaches include Key Box, Conquest, and Faithful Steward at Delaware Seashore State Park; York, Middle, and South beaches at Fenwick Island State Park; and Beach Plum Island north of Lewes.
Altogether, the changes affect nearly 64% of the state’s drive-on surf fishing beach availability.
The reservations are dropped for seven of 12 drive-on beaches.
“Drive-on surf fishing reached record levels in recent years, and our parks have tried different ways to balance what can be overwhelming demand with the recreational experience so many enjoy,” said Matt Ritter, director of the Division of Parks and Recreation. “Reservations have become prevalent at state and national parks across the country, and as we evolve our reservation program in Delaware State Parks, we remain committed to providing a good experience for anglers and all our visitors.”
DNREC officials said the decision follows a two-year review of surf fishing data and visitor feedback.
“After careful consideration, we felt making the change to drop reservation requirements for several surf fishing beaches was the right decision,” Ritter said.
Despite rising interest in drive-on surf fishing in recent years, the affected beaches have typically not reached capacity, except during major holidays like the Fourth of July.
Reservations will still be required on summer weekends and holidays for five high-demand locations: Gordons Pond, Herring Point, Navy Crossing, and Point Crossing at Cape Henlopen State Park, and 3 R’s at Delaware Seashore State Park.
Those reservations will remain in effect between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
The reservation system was introduced in 2023 to reduce crowding and manage traffic flow during peak beach use. While it helped prevent congestion at certain popular sites, many beachgoers expressed frustration—especially locals who prefer spontaneous trips based on weather.
Reservations for the remaining restricted beaches will continue to open each week on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Anglers must hold a valid 1-year or 2-year surf fishing permit and are limited to one reservation per day. Weekday access without a reservation is still available with an off-peak permit.
DNREC said it will monitor how the new system impacts beach usage and may consider temporary reinstatement of reservations around high-demand holidays like the Fourth of July.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SurfFishing.7.7.25.jpg,,,2025-07-08 10:09:22.281391

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Department of Justice is asking an appellate court to let Florida enforce its illegal entry and re-entry law.
At issue is an anti-illegal immigration law Gov. Ron DeSantis signed in February, which prompted the arrest of a U.S. citizen from Georgia and led to a federal judge finding the state’s chief legal officer in civil contempt of court.
The federal government intervened on Monday, filing a brief stating that U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams erred in her temporary block on the enforcement of SB 4C, the law that makes it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person to enter the state as an “unauthorized alien.”
Federal judge holds AG James Uthmeier in contempt of court

“Florida’s law is in harmony, not conflict, with federal law,” the brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit states.
Florida lawmakers passed the law during a special session earlier this year to align the state with President Donald Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration.
Uthmeier already tried to get the appellate court to rescind the bar on the law, but it refused. The Florida Immigrant Coalition, the Farmworker Association of Florida, and two women lacking permanent legal status brought suit against the state in April.
Both Williams in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida and the Eleventh Circuit ruled that federal law likely preempts the state law.
Four months into his appointment by DeSantis as attorney general, Uthmeier faced Williams’ contempt ruling for his disobedience of her order to call off enforcement of SB 4C. Florida Highway Patrol and local police arrested dozens after the court order on April 4, including a 20-year-old U.S. citizen in Leon County.
Two arrests
The first biweekly report of arrests that Williams ordered Uthmeier to submit in her contempt ruling shows that St. Johns County arrested two men on counts of illegal entry on May 29.
Uthmeier, DeSantis’ former chief of staff, has also asked the U.S. Supreme Court to step in, submitting an application to Justice Clarence Thomas on June 17 to remove the bar on SB 4C’s enforcement.
Attorneys representing the plaintiffs wrote to the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the state hadn’t proved that the block on the law caused it irreparable harm.
“Florida of course has a wide range of nonimmigration criminal laws to address violent crime and drug trafficking, as well as myriad other crimes, and nothing in the injunction remotely limits the enforcement of those laws,” the response states. “Indeed, enforcing Florida’s preempted state immigration regime will harm public safety by eroding community trust in law enforcement.”

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)An early education task force appointed by Governor Josh Stein earlier this year called for raising minimum child care subsidies in its initial report issued last month.
The panel, announced in March as the state seeks to rejuvenate a child care industry battered by COVID-19 and the rising cost of living, released its first report on June 30 after three discussions on potential solutions. Members recommended a statewide child care subsidy reimbursement rate floor and also outlined additional avenues for officials to explore, including greater benefits for child care workers — including free or subsidized child care — as well as partnerships with North Carolina public schools and universities and the establishment of a state child care endowment.
“Our state’s child care system faces significant challenges associated with access, early childhood education workforce recruitment and retention, and affordability,” the report reads. “Many of North Carolina’s child care programs struggle to stay in business due to difficulty retaining teachers and staff. With the average cost of infant care for just one child reaching $11,720 and surpassing the cost of in-state tuition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, high-quality child care is financially out of reach for many families.”

Task force members, led by co-chairs Lt. Gov. Rachel Hunt and Sen. Jim Burgin (R-Harnett), noted that despite these high costs, many child care facilities in the state operate on razor-thin margins, with some like a family child care home in Cleveland County running at a loss. Tuition, the task force found, is both inadequate to cover staff wages, supplies, and operating costs and also too expensive for a large portion of families in the state. And that is while pay for child care professionals is too low to maintain a stable work force, with the report placing the average starting salary for early education professionals at just $14 per hour.

These shortfalls translate to a major economic detriment for North Carolina, according to the report. According to an analysis by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the lack of adequate child care in North Carolina costs the state’s economy $5.65 billion per year, in large part due to parents leaving the work force to take on full-time child care responsibilities.
To address these issues, the task force recommended standardizing the minimum amount that child care providers are reimbursed for their care by the state. Currently, state law sets the child care subsidy reimbursement rate at the 75th percentile of a county’s market rate, calculated based on age of the child, star rating of the program, and care setting, yielding more than 3,000 different rates across the state — a formulation that the report finds underfunds care programs in rural counties, providing them thousands less than nearby urban counties.
“All counties that currently receive reimbursement at rates below the floor amount would receive the floor amount instead, while counties that currently receive a rate above the floor would continue to receive child care subsidy reimbursement at their current rates,” the report recommends. “Without an increase in subsidy reimbursement rates for child care centers in rural communities, many are at risk of closing.”
The remainder of the recommendations issued were primarily exploratory in nature, in essence setting an agenda for the task force’s upcoming work. They include researching non-salary benefits that could aid in child care worker retention, looking at partnerships with the University of North Carolina system and other public education institutions in the state, and considering the creation of a public-private child care endowment to help families across the state afford child care, such as those instituted in Nebraska and Connecticut.
Greater support for child care has been a bipartisan priority in North Carolina even amid rising political polarization. House Bill 412, an early education regulatory reform bill that allows for larger class sizes among other measures, passed the Senate unanimously and received opposition from just one House member in June. It was signed into law by Stein on July 1.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IMG_3977-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

(Image provided by Ben Jones/University of Alaska Fairbanks)A lightning-sparked fire that has burned about 2,000 acres of Arctic Alaska tundra is the biggest wildfire on the North Slope in eight years.
The Ikpikpuk Fire, which bears the name of a 195-mile river that flows north into the Arctic Ocean, was discovered on June 22. Though classified as active, it is unstaffed, meaning that there are no efforts underway to fight it. Also burning nearby in the same treeless tundra area is the 618-acre Bronx Fire, along with two small fires of a few acres each.
The North Slope fires were detected by satellite, said Beth Ipsen, a spokesperson for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management’s Alaska Fire Service.
The Ikpikpuk Fire is the biggest North Slope tundra fire since 2017, when the Ketik River fire east of Wainwright burned 2,870 acres, said Rick Thoman, a scientist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. In all, 5,421 acres of North Slope tundra were reported as burned in 2017, Thoman said.
Fires occasionally burn in the North Slope tundra when the weather is hot enough, the plants are dry enough and there is lightning to start them, but they are typically very small, Thoman said.
The Ikpikpuk Fire stands out, he said. “A 2,000-acre fire is non-trivial for the North Slope,” he said.
And conditions have been right for a significant fire in the region, he said. “Certainly, it has been extremely warm on the inland North Slope,” he said.
While most Alaska tundra fires are south of the Brooks Range, in Northwest or Western Alaska, fires north of the Brooks Range are becoming more common and bigger, according to scientists.
The frequency of significant wildfires fires on the North Slope tundra has tripled in recent years, according to a 2023 study by scientists from the BLM and UAF. The study evaluated lightning-sparked fires of at least 10 hectares (24.7 acres) that have burned on the North Slope over half a century, from 1972 to 2022. In the first 37 years of that study period, there was an annual average of 0.89 such fires, but in the last 13 years of the study period, the annual average jumped to 2.5, the study found.
Their increasing frequency is a product of climate change, and tundra fires also contribute to climate change because they hasten the release of old carbon stored in the ground, scientists say.
The biggest North Slope tundra fire on record is the 2007 Anaktuvuk River fire, which burned about 256,000 acres and resulted in significant permafrost thaw and the release into the atmosphere of 50 years’ worth of stored carbon, according to scientists from UAF and other universities.
And the mix of plants that grew back in the decade since that fire is different from that in the unburned area, creating more potential fuel for future wildfires, according to a separate BLM study.
For Alaska wildfire managers, the Ikpikpuk Fire and the others on the North Slope are of scientific interest but of low priority for any action, Ipsen said.
“We’ve got a lot going on throughout the state,” she said.
Wildfires have erupted since the second half of June, when Interior temperatures soared high enough to prompt Alaska’s first-ever National Weather Service heat advisories.
A series of fires have spurred evacuations or evacuation alerts in communities along Alaska’s road system, Ipsen said. She named the area between Nenana and Fairbanks, where two fires grouped together as the Nenana Ridge Complex, have been burning on either side of the Parks Highway. North Star Borough residents are on evacuation alert Monday for a different set of fires. And Healy, Tok and Delta Junction are other communities that have been affected by nearby wildfires, Ipsen said.
“We’re talking about really close to people and properties, and it’s all happening pretty much simultaneously,” she said.
In all, over 581,000 acres have burned in Alaska from 363 fires as of Monday afternoon, with 227 of those fires classified as active, according to the federal-state Alaska Interagency Coordination Center.
That includes four new fires discovered in the Kobuk area of Northwest Alaska, potentially affecting the village of Ambler, Ipsen said.
Thoman said he is not surprised by those Kobuk area fires because the region has been extraordinarily hot in recent days. He cited temperature readings above 90 degrees for three consecutive days at an airstrip north of Kobuk.
“It can get hot there, but three days in a row in the lower 90s — that is really remarkable,” he said.

The end of a temporary exemption to a state law requiring many employers to classify their independent contractors as employees is leading some nail technicians to say they are being targeted by a policy that lawmakers intended to protect them, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
California has over 6,000 nail establishments, and from 1987 to 2023, the number of licensed manicurists in the state tripled to over 125,000. In lieu of being an employee at a salon who earns an hourly wage, nearly a third are independent contractors with flexible hours and rates.
But in 2019, California passed Assembly Bill 5, a sweeping law mandating stricter worker classification rules in an effort to curb unfair labor practices within the gig economy. The law carved out an exemption for nail technicians, which ended this year on Jan. 1. Since then, some nail technicians have found themselves in a legal grey area where doing their job risks violating state labor rules. 
Because other beauty professions, such as hairstylists, have been exempt from AB 5, salon owners and some manicurists say that singling out the nail industry — which in California is predominantly made up of Vietnamese-born women — in the law is discriminatory. 

Emily Micelli, an independent manicurist at a salon in Newport Beach: “I hope the government doesn’t force us to go into something where I have to comply with a salon. I consider myself a nail artist.”

But Lorena Gonzalez, the former San Diego Assemblymember who authored AB 5 and now serves as president of the California Labor Federation, said that lawmakers at the time found “more complaints specifically about misclassification and more findings about misclassification in manicurists than overall cosmetology.”
In 2013, state labor regulators accused one Southern California nail salon chain of misclassifying its workers as independent contractors instead of employees, based on how much control it had over manicurists’ hours and work. The state lost, and the chain is one of several other businesses suing the state over the 2019 law.

What really happens after a worksite immigration raid

As President Donald Trump’s administration carries out what it describes as the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history, federal officials have touted that deporting immigrants who do not have legal status will protect American jobs. 
But what really happens after a workplace immigration raid — such as the one that took place last month at an L.A. garment factory — and does deporting immigrants really help raise wages?
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara and Jeanne explain, in June a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said “worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard … economic stability.” Last year on the campaign trail, Trump also inaccurately told a crowd in North Carolina that “every job produced in this country over the last two years has gone to illegal aliens.”
Studies have found, however, that raids can deflate wages and do little for American workers — many of whom rely on services that stem from low-wage, undocumented labor. Raids also tend to lead to more job turnover, and employers are no more likely to use immigration verification tools during hiring. Losing workers also shrinks the local economy, with one study estimating that mass deportations could cost California’s economy $275 billion.

Does police education bill go too far — or not far enough?


Then-San Francisco Police Chief William Scott addresses recruits in the Police Academy in San Francisco on Oct. 2, 2024. Photo by Jessica Christian, San Francisco Chronicle via AP




With no votes in opposition so far, a bill that would set new education requirements for police officers is breezing through the Legislature — yet the measure continues to draw criticism from both criminal justice reform advocates and some law enforcement groups, report CalMatters’ Cayla Mihalovich and Adam Echelman.
The bill would require incoming officers, with some exceptions, to receive either an associate degree, bachelor’s degree or policing certificate, which can be obtained from an accredited college or university. The degrees would not have to be related to law enforcement. 
Reggie Jones-Sawyer, a former Los Angeles Assemblymember who authored a 2020 law to raise some police education requirements, said the new proposal leaves a big loophole that allows one to sidestep the education requirement with prior military or out-of-state law enforcement experience.
And while many law enforcement agencies back the bill, representatives from some law enforcement unions argue the measure goes too far, and would worsen the reported statewide police shortage. Said the president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association: The new requirements “would be catastrophic to staffing.”

Harold Williams Jr., Retired Chief Master Sergeant of the US Air Force, passed away on his family farm in Vermont at 1000L on March 25th, 2025 at 83 years wise. Sonny was born in Mount Union, PA; he was the first born of the late Harold Williams Sr. and the late Mattie Lee Moore -Williams-Faulkner. Harold chose to spend his youth with his late great-grandmother Stella “Red” Sanders, who raised him from the time he was 10 years old.
Heavily influenced by his first grade teacher Mrs. Rudy, Harold graduated from Captain Jack Joint Senior High School in Mount Union in May of 1959. He was close with Shirley Ruth (Vaughn) Cook and Wallace “Mike” Green.
After working a few odd jobs in town, better than two cents a pound for picking beans, he entered military service in July 1960. He traveled the US from Pittsburgh and Coraopolis, to Baltimore, to DC, to Denver, and New Mexico. He traveled the world from Panama, to Italy, to Vietnam, to Turkey, and Germany. Harold retired in September 1993 with 30 years and 29 days of active service.


After retirement, Harold settled in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, volunteering for the Montessori School on Jonestown Rd. and as a teacher’s aide for the first through third grades in the Paxtonia Elementary School.
In 1995, Harold worked as an expeditor (a glorified stock hand according to him) for Hecht Co. in the Harrisburg East Mall. Starting in January 1998 he was employed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Public Utility Commission, Bureau of Consumer Services, as an Interviewer, Utility Termination Investigator, retiring as a Utility Complaints Investigator in July 2013.
Besides his mother and father, and maternal great-grandmother, Harold was preceded in death by his stepfather, William T. Faulkner, a son, choreographer and dancer Leonard M. Wylliams; three sisters Jean L. Faulkner, JoAnn Faulkner, and Carol Ann Williams (Faulkner); five brothers, George W. “Trot” Faulkner, Oscar “Petey” Faulkner, Edward L. “Eddie” Faulkner, James W. “Jimmy” Williams, and Kenneth L. “Hussel” Faulkner.

Irwin Pensack, 98, passed away on June 23, 2025 at Maple Ridge Memory Care in Essex, Vermont. Up until the time of his passing, his daughter Debbie was by his side, accompanied by family friend Edith. Irwin was born in Newark, NJ on July 8, 1926. He married Judith Fischler on April 11, 1954. They lived in Croton-on-Hudson, NY, and moved to Hartsdale, then Scarsdale, NY as their family grew. Irwin and Judy settled in Florida to enjoy a more relaxing lifestyle but moved back up north to Vermont to be close to family as Irwin’s battle with dementia progressed.
Irwin was a proud patriotic citizen who believed in democracy and preserving civil rights for people of all religions, races and genders. When he was just 17, Irwin enlisted in the army and served in the Army Air Corp until he was honorably discharged. He attended Clarkson University, NYU and Patterson College, achieving a Master’s Degree in Audiology. Throughout his career as an audiologist, Irwin was able to bring the gift of hearing to countless men, women and children, and was continually astounded at the hardships endured by the hard of hearing.
Irwin was the life of the party. He loved a good joke and he was always up for an adventure, enthusiastically jumping in to any escapade. He was a perpetual student, taking wind-surfing lessons, tennis and ski lessons and even music lessons well into his 80s. He had a warm smile for everyone he encountered, whether it was a new acquaintance, an old friend or a family member. He was a kind and approachable man, always ready to listen and try to help plot a path to resolve a problem or offer life guidance.
Irwin is survived by his son Lawrence M. Pensack and his wife, Meredith Pensack of Newton, Massachusetts; his daughter Deborah P. Volk and her husband, Paul S. Volk of Richmond, Vermont; and his son Brian D. Pensack and his wife, Sonia Robles of Petaluma, California. Irwin is survived by his three cherished grandchildren, Amanda Pensack, Danielle Pensack and Ian Volk, as well as many nieces, nephews, grandnieces, grandnephews and cousins, all of whom he enjoyed spending time with and loved deeply. Irwin was a down-to-earth, self-effacing man who was incredulous that people loved him so greatly. Shows of affection would often move him to tears. We will miss him dearly.
The family extends a very special thanks to Edith Wilkerson who made Irwin’s life in Vermont very special.

Research shows worksite immigration raids can depress local economies as people stay home and stop spending money. So far, they aren’t known to free up jobs for citizens.


Carlos was pulled out of a deep sleep by a series of frantic phone calls one Friday morning in June. By the time he arrived at a downtown Los Angeles garment factory sometime after 10 a.m., his brother was in chains. 
Agents from a constellation of federal agencies descended on the Ambiance Apparel factory and storefront on June 6, detaining dozens of people. It was the first salvo of the Trump administration’s prolonged engagement in Southern California, where masked federal agents are filmed daily pulling people off the street as part of the largest deportation program in American history.  
Carlos’ brother, Jose, 35, was shackled at the wrists, waist and ankles. Carlos watched as agents in Immigration and Customs Enforcement vests led Jose and 13 other garment workers into a waiting white Sprinter van. Carlos hasn’t seen his brother since, though he did confirm that Jose is being held at an immigration detention center in Adelanto. 
“We had just lost our other brother, he died,“ said Carlos, whom CalMatters is only identifying by his first name because of his own fears of deportation. “Then, for our family, losing Jose, it was like someone died again.”
Worksite raids like the one at Ambiance are an attention-grabbing component of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, one that it remains committed to despite a brief reversal in mid-June. They’re unfolding across the state, from Los Angeles’s Fashion District to farm fields in the San Joaquin Valley and a restaurant in San Diego.
While one stated purpose of worksite raids is to remove illegal competition from the labor marketplace, the reality is far messier: Studies have found that immigration raids don’t do much to raise wages – and actually deflate them. Even after a raid, employers are no more likely to use federal immigration verification tools like E-Verify during hiring. 
Nevertheless, on the campaign trail, Trump focused on the threat of illegal competition as the political and emotional lynchpin of his deportation plans.
“They’re taking your jobs, they’re taking your jobs,” Trump told a crowd in Wilmington, N.C., on Sept. 21. “ Every job produced in this country over the last two years has gone to illegal aliens, every job, think of it.
“We’re going to save you. We’re going to save you. We’re going to save you.” 
Every new job between 2022-2024 was not, in fact, filled by undocumented immigrants. Studies show actually deporting workers en masse from industries that rely on undocumented labor does little for U.S. workers. Giovanni Peri, a UC Davis economist who has studied the economic impacts of deportations in the 1930s and during the Obama administration, has found doing so actually reduces job opportunities for American-born workers. 
That’s in part because many American workers, even those outside of immigrant-heavy industries, rely on the services generated by low-wage, undocumented labor — the costs of which would rise with mass deportations. 
“Losing some of these workers and jobs that Americans are moving out of, it shrinks the local economy and there’s a reduction in jobs for Americans,” he said.
There is no evidence, Peri said, that in the face of mass deportations, immigrant-heavy industries would raise their wages to hire American workers instead.
“If there is such a world, it has not been the reality in the U.S. in a long time,” he said.
What does tend to happen, according to a study last year by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is that raids lead to more job turnover while showing little net change in the employment rate.
“Actions that target employers – audits, investigations, fines, and criminal charges – have larger effects than raids, which target workers,” the study authors wrote.  
The impact to the families can be long-term and devastating. Absences, suspensions, expulsions and rates of substance abuse and self-harm increased among Latino students in a Tennessee town that was raided, even among students whose families were not directly impacted. Property crime dropped but violent crime increased in a small northeast Iowa meatpacking town after a massive 2008 raid. Infants born to Hispanic mothers in that same Iowa town had a 24% risk of low birth weight compared to the same population one year before the raid.

“Our mom is devastated, and she’s scared for herself, too,” Carlos said. “A lot of us are from the same (Zapotec Indigenous) community in Mexico, a lot of people kidnapped in the raid, so it’s like a whole bunch of families had a death.”
In his first term, Trump’s worksite raids focused on the South and the Midwest, when more than 1,800 people were detained, mostly at manufacturing plants and meat and poultry processing facilities. That’s a tiny segment of the estimated 1.5 million people deported under Trump from 2017 to 2021, but it played a significant role in another of the administration’s goals: To create enough fear and mistrust among undocumented immigrants that they self-deport.  
But this time, Trump’s focus is on California. 
‘There’s no money’ after raid
Employees at Ambiance Apparel told each other that immigration enforcement was likely coming to their garment factory. Employees who did not want to be identified told CalMatters that people in Department of Homeland Security jackets were on site at least twice this year, most recently in April. Those workers say they were told by the company not to worry about a raid. 
Ambiance Apparel, through an attorney, denied that the company had any advance warning or involvement with the raid and the company declined to comment further. 
The garment industry is a logical target for immigration enforcement because so much of the workforce is undocumented. The same is true of agriculture. Estimates vary, but anywhere from one third to more than one half of California farmworkers are undocumented immigrants.  
William Lopez, a University of Michigan public health professor who has written a book on the impact of immigration raids on mixed-status families, said he learned in interviews of people present at six immigration raids in the Midwest and South in 2018 that people “haven’t developed the language” to capture the impact of large-scale immigration raids on a community. 
After a raid, “people don’t drive, there’s no money because everyone’s paying bond, no one’s going to school anymore,” Lopez said. 
He continued, “the comparisons were, there was hurricanes, there was tornadoes, there was war, some people compared it to a public execution. Some people described it like the death of a grandchild.”
Congress made it illegal to knowingly hire workers who don’t have authorization in 1986, as part of an overhaul of the nation’s immigration system. The overhaul also legalized about 2.7 million undocumented immigrants.
Still, false Social Security numbers have been fairly easy to obtain, and employers are largely able to duck liability with only a cursory review of the documents workers present when they’re hired.
Employers have had little incentive to get stricter, even after the high-profile raids of meat and food processing plants during the second term of the George W. Bush administration. Demand for labor has remained high, fines for those caught have been lax and the use of contractors and subcontractors has proliferated, spreading out the risks of hiring.. 
“The number of employers who have been fined or imprisoned under the statute is very low compared to the number of employees who have been rounded up as a result of these (workplace) raids,” said Leticia Saucedo, a professor at the UC Davis School of Law. “The idea behind all of these was, yes, to target the employers, but employees were collateral damage.”
Saucedo said workplace raids and the deportation of workers highlight tensions between two wings of the Republican Party. Nativist groups want to curb immigration because they believe it displaces American workers, while business interests want access to a stable, legal pool of immigrant workers.

California farmer ready to demand a warrant
California farmers are especially sensitive to potential immigration raids. The Border Patrol conducted a sweep in Kern County just before Trump took office in January that previewed its approach in the new administration. In June, agents swept through farms in Ventura County, conducting immigration raids. iIndustry groups implored the administration to reconsider such tactics.
“To ensure stability for our farm families and their communities, we must act with both common sense and compassion,” Bryan Little, policy director at the California Farm Bureau, said in a statement. “The focus of immigration enforcement should be on the removal of bad actors or lawbreakers, not our valuable and essential farm employees.”
In an interview, Little said he hasn’t seen evidence of widespread enforcement at farms. But reports of any ICE sightings or arrests in agricultural areas have spread on social media, spreading fear among the workforce. 
“The way this is all being handled, it’s interfering with food production,” he said. 
In Ventura County, federal agents ultimately arrested more than 30 immigrants in June, said Hazel Davalos, director of the local farmworker advocacy group CAUSE. 
Lisa Tate manages three of her family’s eight ranches in the county, where they grow citrus, avocados and coffee. Depending on the day, anywhere from five to 100 directly hired and contracted workers plant, trim or harvest on the land.
They were not among the farms visited by immigration agents, but Tate said she held a meeting with her workers to communicate a longstanding company policy: if agents ever show up, “nobody’s to be on our farm without proper authorization.”
Tate said the raids have put employers like her in a tough position. She said she has never knowingly hired any undocumented workers. She said she reviews the employment documents her workers present, fills out the I-9 form and follows the rules.
Still, she called it a “well-known secret” that many in the industry don’t have valid work permits.
She’s tried to use the guest worker visa program before, but it comes with costly requirements to provide housing and transportation, and to guarantee the guest workers have enough paid hours for the months they’re here. That was hard to budget for on a smaller farm like hers, she said, so she prefers hiring contracted workers locally as needed.
“We need an immigration program that allows for longer-term workers,” she said. “Until we have a solution in place, we shouldn’t take action because the whole system is built on what it is. And if you start picking it apart, there’s all kinds of fallout.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060625_ICE-Raid-DTLA_JWBH_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

California’s landmark labor law aims to make nail salon workers, predominantly Vietnamese women, full employees rather than contractors in an industry known for labor violations. 


Like thousands of other Vietnamese-American women in California, Emily Micelli started painting nails to support herself. She turned that weekend job into a two-decade-long career as a manicurist, and now offers her own nail art designs at an upscale Newport Beach salon.
This year, she found her livelihood upended by a few words in the state labor code. 
Like other workers in the beauty industry, state-licensed nail technicians were granted an exemption from Assembly Bill 5, the sweeping 2019 law targeting the gig economy that required many employers to classify workers as employees rather than independent contractors. 
For nail salons, the exemption was temporary. When it ended on Jan. 1 this year, thousands of manicurists across the state found themselves in legal limbo over their employment status. Many, like Micelli, value their working conditions as independent contractors where they can choose their clients and set their own schedules and are unwilling to be reclassified as hourly employees of the salons where they work. 
Lawmakers, backed by unions and workers’ advocates, are now rushing to extend the exemption again — but still only temporarily. 
Labor groups say the law targets an industry with an exploited workforce, and they still want to address that. One estimate by UCLA and the California Healthy Nail Salons Collaborative advocacy group says that more than 80% of nail salon workers are immigrants, the overwhelming majority of whom are Vietnamese women. The report’s authors said those workers are vulnerable to worker misclassification, below minimum wages and other labor violations.
Salon owners and some manicurists say that scrutiny is discriminatory. A group of Vietnamese-owned salons and nail technicians, including the Blu Nail Bar where Micelli works, sued the state this year. They claim it is racial discrimination to exempt every beauty profession from stricter employee classification laws except the one made up largely of Vietnamese licensees.
“I feel like they singled us out,” Micelli said. “For hair, they can choose (to be an independent contractor). For nails, they don’t allow us to.”
The debate has exposed two vastly different sides of a ubiquitous industry. Many of the women filing, shaping and painting Californians’ nails in over 6,000 establishments statewide say they deserve to be viewed as independent, professional artists the same as their peers across the beauty industry — even as they acknowledge grueling work conditions in some salons. 
Micelli said other salons that have employed her in the past imposed assembly line-like conditions and rushed her to perform more services. 
As an independent contractor, she buys her own supplies to stay nimble with trending styles, manages her own appointment hours and sets her own prices. She splits the proceeds 50-50 with the salon, giving the salon a higher cut than normal for its upscale environment. 
She most enjoys having a flexible schedule so she can chat with her clients, one at a time. 
“It was 30 minutes for a manicure and then you have to move on to the next one,” she said of other salons. “I hope the government doesn’t force us to go into something where I have to comply with a salon. I consider myself a nail artist.”
‘More complaints specifically’ in nail salons
Manicures, once a luxury service, have exploded in availability over the past half-century to become synonymous with everyday indulgence.
That’s due in part to new tools and acrylic nails, and to the proliferation of immigrant-owned nail salons. Beginning with a group of refugee women in Sacramento who learned how to do nails from Hollywood actress Tippi Hedren’s personal manicurist in the 1970s, nail tech work became a go-to rung on the economic ladder for Vietnamese American workers and entrepreneurs.
The number of licensed manicurists in California has more than tripled since 1987, to more than 125,000 in 2023. Nearly half of those who take the licensure exam each year do so in Vietnamese, said Jaime Schrabeck, a Carmel manicurist and industry advocate who analyzed data from the state Board of Barbering and Cosmetology. 
In 2015, the New York Times drew national attention to workplace abuses. Its investigation, which focused primarily on Korean-owned nail salons in New York City, found workers were underpaid, trafficked and toiled with dangerous chemicals. 
Lawmakers in California took notice, holding a hearing that year on the industry. 
State labor regulators had also tangled with nail salons. In one 2013 suit, the state accused the Southern California chain Happy Nails & Spa of wrongly classifying their workers as independent contractors instead of employees based on how much control the businesses had over manicurists’ hours and work. The state lost. The chain is now among the businesses suing over AB 5.

Employees are more expensive because they are subject to protections like minimum wage, overtime, meal breaks, workers’ compensation and sick days.
“We found out there were more complaints specifically about misclassification and more findings about misclassification in manicurists than overall cosmetology,” said former Assemblymember Lorena Gonzalez, who convened the 2015 hearing. 
When Gonzalez introduced AB 5 in 2019 to apply even stricter worker classification rules, many beauty professionals who rent booths in salons lobbied to keep working independently. 
They were exempted from the law and could remain independent contractors, provided they could prove that they took their own payments, booked their own customers and maintained their own businesses separately from the salons where they worked. 
The exemption was temporary so lawmakers could evaluate efforts to educate the largely immigrant business owners on how to correctly classify workers.  
In 2021, lawmakers extended the temporary nail salon exemption to 2025. But after Gonzalez left the Legislature to lead the California Labor Federation, the issue fell by the wayside. A subsequent bill to grant the exemption permanently died without a hearing, catching manicurists by surprise.
Nail workers scramble to comply
Janice Luper was renting space in a Tehachapi salon where she had her own key and city business license when she found out the law was about to change. 
Gonzalez said such arrangements are clearly independent, and would not be considered employment under AB 5. But Luper, a self-described rule follower, said the law makes it hard to prove she’s not an employee, requiring that a contractor’s work be “outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business.” Because the salon owner also did manicures, Luper worried her own services wouldn’t be considered separate enough. 
So she moved out. By the end of the year, she and a hair stylist opened their own salon — a $30,000 investment Luper is keenly aware many other nail technicians can’t afford. 
Other manicurists and salon owners got the attention of Republican Assemblymember Tri Ta, who is Vietnamese and represents Orange County’s Little Saigon. He introduced a bill this year to permanently exempt nail salons from AB 5. The Assembly Labor Committee never granted it a hearing. 
Instead, the committee, chaired by Hayward Democrat Liz Ortega, in June introduced a different bill to extend the exemption until 2029. The Employment Development Department and Labor Commissioner’s Office would be required to study the rate of labor violations in the nail industry to develop rules that “ensure manicurists enjoy equal rights under California law.”
“​​These are hard-working immigrant women who put in long hours in often toxic environments where their hours and wages are controlled by shop owners, just like any other employees,” Ortega said in a statement.

But the nail salon operators are often immigrants themselves, and in an interview, Ta chafed at the idea that those owners were uniquely violating labor law, saying there are bad actors in any industry. 
“You cannot, because of one bad actor, treat everyone unfairly,” he said.
‘This is how everybody does it’
The UCLA report found a third of nail technicians are independent contractors, three times higher than the rate for all workers. But what some say is a common, legitimate business model, others call widespread misclassification. 
One Southern California manicurist, who spoke to CalMatters on the condition of anonymity to avoid jeopardizing her job, said she learned of the practice 10 years ago when she started working at a salon in the Inland Empire. 
The Chinese-American manicurist said she felt the Vietnamese owners passed her over for the more expensive services, limiting her to basic manicures. She was paid a 40% commission on each service and issued a 1099 form for contractors, even though the owner set her hours and handled payments.
When she asked to be classified as a W-2 employee, her boss refused.
“She said, ‘This is how everybody does it,’” she said. “‘We’re just doing what everyone else is doing.’”
She returned to manicuring in December 2023, and bounced around for a year in several salons with similar arrangements. She now works at a salon in Monrovia, finally as a W-2 employee. But she said she’s still paid a 60% commission. 
“It’s not hourly, which I don’t feel is fair because I’m there over 10 hours” per shift, she said. “Sometimes when customers come late, we have to stay late.”
On an average day, she said she makes about $100 before tips — a rate far below California’s $16.50 minimum hourly wage. 
She recently drove down a boulevard in Rowland Heights, stopping in every nail salon she saw to look for a new job. The responses she heard in a half-dozen businesses were the same: No W-2 jobs, no hourly pay. 
She’s never reported it to state labor officials. 
“I need a job, and this is how they’re doing it everywhere,” she said. 
The costs of employment
Six months after opening her own salon, Luper now finds herself on the other side of the business equation. 
The overhead costs have been much higher than renting a space, and as the only manicurist in the building, she’s too busy with her own clients to handle walk-ins. She wants to bring in another nail technician — ideally a booth renter – to take customers off her hands and offset costs. 
But she’s held off with the legal situation up in the air. She never envisioned being an employer, and said she can’t afford to take on payroll taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and paying an hourly wage regardless of whether there are customers. Besides, she said, she doesn’t think she could pay enough to attract an employee.
“No manicurist is going to work for the minimum wage,” she said. “That’s not why we went to school.”
She wishes the state worked harder to investigate bad actors and enforce existing classification laws rather than complicating a business model that worked for her. In the past year, the state Labor Commissioner’s Office has cited one nail salon for misclassifying workers, spokesperson MariCarmen Estudillo said.
The Monrovia manicurist said she’d love to make the hourly minimum wage. But she, too, is wary about AB 5. Business isn’t busy like it was at her first salon, where customers would crowd in and she would work the whole day without a break. If nail salons had to pay all the costs of formal employment, she doesn’t think they’d survive.
“I want to get paid for the time there,” she said. “At the same time, I don’t know how long I can have this job at this place if this continues.”
And without the job, she can’t build up clientele to work independently, as she dreams. She wants to offer her own nail designs, specializing in the builder gel technique that’s become a popular alternative to acrylics. And she’s studying for an esthetician’s license so she can also do facials. 
Then she wants to rent her own studio in a quiet salon, with just one chair and one client at a time.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050118_Nail-Salon_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

California lawmakers could set new education requirements for police officers, but the bill has critics from all sides — including former Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer, who authored the state’s watershed 2021 police reform bill. 


Amid calls for police reform in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder in 2020, California lawmakers set out to raise education standards for incoming law enforcement officers. Five years later — as California faces a widespread shortage of police officers — those reforms are being debated once again. 
In 2020, former Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer introduced a bill that would have required prospective police officers 18 to 25 years old to earn a bachelor’s degree before entering the police force. A growing body of research shows that college-educated law enforcement officers tend to use less force and exercise better decision making. 
The bill was ultimately revised after it was criticized as too restrictive by law enforcement and labor leaders. In an updated version, which was signed into law the following year, lawmakers agreed to raise the minimum age of a police officer to 21 years old, and they asked local police and school officials to create recommendations for new higher education requirements. 
This year, Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, is proposing a new bill to establish education standards based on those recommendations, but some law enforcement and criminal justice reform advocates are skeptical — albeit for different reasons. 
Starting in 2031, Irwin’s new law would require incoming officers to get a policing certificate, associate degree or bachelor’s degree, although there are some exceptions within 36 months of graduating from a police academy. It also creates a law enforcement recruitment task force to identify and recruit candidates for law enforcement agencies throughout the state.
In an interview with CalMatters, Jones-Sawyer said the current bill by Irwin undermines the original intent behind his 2021 law by allowing a loophole for incoming officers to satisfy the education requirement through a certificate, prior military experience or out-of-state law enforcement experience. 
Some policing experts, such as former justice department official Arif Alikhan, echoed those concerns and said the exceptions swallow the whole. “It completely obviates the need to have any educational background,” said Alikhan. “Officers who have a college education tend to perform better.”
Representatives from some law enforcement unions, by contrast, think the bill still goes too far. Dustin Smith, president of the Sacramento Police Officers Association, said the new requirements “would be catastrophic to staffing statewide,” limiting the supply of incoming officers. 
Those concerns haven’t stopped the bill from sailing through the Legislature, where it has received widespread support from many law enforcement agencies. It’s supported by all of California’s statewide law enforcement advocacy groups, including the California Police Chiefs Association, the California State Sheriff’s Association, the California Association of Highway Patrolmen and the umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions, the Peace Officers Research Association of California. It has received no formal opposition.
Democratic lawmakers at odds with one another over new standards
In introducing his bill, Jones-Sawyer viewed a college education as paramount to law enforcement training because it would expose incoming officers to new perspectives, healthy debate and critical thinking skills.
“We keep looking at law enforcement as if anybody can do it,” said Jones-Sawyer. “No. You need a certain type of person to have the skills and ability to deal with modern-day policing.” 
Instead of requiring an associate degree in modern policing, as Jones-Sawyer said he intended, the new bill allows incoming police officers to meet the education standards with four years of military or out-of-state law enforcement experience. While Jones-Sawyer intended to carve out certain exceptions for people with prior specialized military or law enforcement experience, they would have only been given some credit – not all. 
New officers also have the option of attaining a “professional policing certificate” from an accredited college or university, although that curriculum has not yet been developed. 
The new bill “does not make policing better, it makes it devolve back into what it used to be,” said Jones-Sawyer. Irwin maintained that the bill advances his efforts and will help police officers improve themselves as they rise through the ranks.
Many police chiefs and sheriffs view the bill as a meaningful way to raise education standards while affording incoming officers the flexibility to meet them. 
In May, Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna wrote a letter to Sen. Jesse Arreguín, an Oakland Democrat and chair of the Senate’s public safety committee, arguing in favor of Irwin’s bill. The sheriff’s office once required all applicants to have a bachelor’s degree, wrote Luna, but the requirement was “short-lived” because the office saw “an immediate decline in applicants by about 50 percent.”
Luna said Irwin’s bill is a “more workable, more inclusive path forward” because it includes exceptions for those with non-academic experience.  
Although the vast majority of local law enforcement agencies nationwide only require a high school diploma, having a college degree can often create more opportunities for better pay and promotions.
Police officer shortage: truth or myth?
All across the state, law enforcement officials say staffing is an ongoing problem, which more education requirements might exacerbate. The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Office is short roughly 1,500 officers as of June 1, according to spokesperson Miesha McClendon. The office was able to respond to recent protests through the support of staff from other areas of law enforcement, including its jails and detective division, McClendon said.
In rural areas, such as Plumas County in the northeast corner of the state, Undersheriff Chad Hermann said a single officer is sometimes responsible for covering communities that are as far as 70 miles apart. If that officer needs to make an arrest and drive a suspect to jail, a town could spend hours without any nearby police on duty, he said. 
Sheriffs and police officers say the shortage is due to several factors, including low wages in some communities, an aging workforce and negative perceptions of police following high-profile instances of misconduct. Departments are offering starting bonuses and other incentives, such as better benefits, as a way to recruit new officers. 
Some agencies gave record-breaking raises to officers coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some places, including the California Highway Patrol, entry-level officers can expect six-figure salaries and top notch benefits.
But not all agencies can offer those perks.
“We’re not a rich county — we can’t offer the big hiring stipends,” said Hermann. “By adding a requirement like an associate degree, it’s going to make it harder to get people from our hiring pool.” He said even exceptions for those with military service may not help the recruiting problem since the hiring pool is so small in a county with just under 19,000 residents.
While the new law enforcement recruitment task force in Irwin’s bill is designed to ease some of those staffing challenges, Christy Lopez, a law professor at Georgetown University said it’s troubling to see that it would only comprise people from law enforcement. 
“We need to be moving towards a recruiting approach that seeks to screen in the right people, not just screen out the worst people,” she said. “And to make sure that we develop that sort of approach to recruiting, you need perspectives broader than just law enforcement.”
She said the police recruiting crisis is a myth. “The idea that there’s a crisis in recruiting presupposes that we know what the right number of police officers is and that we’re not there,” she said. “And we don’t know that.” 
What it takes to become a police officer
Devin Nisbet grew up in Calaveras County and as a kid, he had a positive experience with one of the officers when he prank-called 9-1-1. Instead of just disciplining Nisbet, who was around 6 years old, the officer gave him a tour of the police cruiser and handed  him a patch with the sheriff’s office logo. “It made me want to be part of it,” said Nisbet in an interview with CalMatters.
After dropping out of college, Nisbet was working for a grocery store in Calaveras County when that same sheriff’s office held a recruiting event in a nearby parking lot. The agency promises a $10,000 bonus, spread out over three years, for new recruits. At the time, he said he thought to himself, “Why not try to do this?” 
It took Nisbet roughly seven months to pass the county’s background checks and exams, which include a written test, a psychological exam and a medical exam. He then received a tentative job offer from the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office, contingent on completing a police academy. 
In January, he enrolled in the police academy at San Joaquin Delta College in Stockton. Police academy training in California typically takes a minimum of six months, but some police departments require far more training. Nisbet is paid by the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Office for the entirety of this training, just under $34 an hour.
The college program requires students to learn CPR, first aid, and various laws about use of force, search and seizure and firearms. They’re tested in scenarios that can include chases or combat. In one timed exam, they must pull a 165 lb dummy, cross a 25 yard obstacle course, run 500 yards and scale a 6-foot fence.
Some students fail to pass the academy’s courses. Others never get hired because they fail the police department’s background checks or have low scores.
Nisbet is set to graduate on July 2, at which point he’ll begin working, but his training won’t be over. New officers must complete weeks of field training and a year of probation. 
“I believe that people, if they want to do this job, they need to get evaluated first,” said Nisbet, though he said an associate degree shouldn’t be required. He said many of his classmates don’t have a college degree.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/062725-Police-Academy-JC-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)Senate Minority Leader Robin Titus on Monday said the Republican caucus will not file a lawsuit challenging the legality of two resolutions passed by Democrats last month during the waning moments of the 2025 Legislative Session.
Titus, a Republican from Wellington, said there is legal standing to challenge one of the resolutions, but that the second resolution, which is the primary source of the party’s ire, would not likely be invalidated because “the judiciary is unlikely to intervene in internal legislative process and procedures.”
“We will prosecute our case in the public opinion,” she added.
The Legislative Commission, which meets during the interim period between Nevada’s biennial legislative sessions to approve regulations and handle other legislative matters, consists of 12 members, six from each chamber. Senate Concurrent Resolution 8 changed the guidelines for determining the partisan split of the commission, resulting in Democrats strengthening their majority on the powerful interim board.
Specifically, Senate representation on the commission moved from an even split (three Democrats, three Republicans) to favoring Democrats 4 to 2. The Assembly side was already divided 4-to-2 in favor of Democrats and remains so under the new formula.
That brings the overall makeup of the Legislative Commission to eight Democrats and four Republicans. It had been expected, based on a resolution passed in the first days of this year’s session and resolutions from prior sessions, to be seven Democrats and five Republicans.
Senate Resolution 9 appointed specific lawmakers to the newly restructured commission.
https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/06/03/nevada-legislature-11th-hour-sprint-on-final-day-not-enough-for-film-studio-two-lombardo-bills/
SCR8 was introduced in the literal final hour of the final day of this year’s legislative session, which the state constitution required to end on June 2. Titus, reading prepared comments Monday at this interim session’s first meeting of the Legislative Commission, noted that the resolution was voted on in the Assembly before the Senate, “a procedural irregularity that denied minority memberships adequate review and deliberation.”
Titus called the actions “unacceptable in a body committed to fairness, that legislates for an even partisan state.”
Once SCR8 was brought up for a vote in the Senate, Democrats used parliamentary rules to cut off debate and force a floor vote, which led to a series of motions and outcry from Republicans. The resolution passed on party lines. Resolutions are not subject to gubernatorial vetoes, leaving no recourse for Republicans.
The flurry of motions and heated comments on SCR8 amounted to a filibuster for SR9, which appointed specific lawmakers to the commission and was up for vote in the Senate after SCR8. SR9 was not voted on until after midnight — 12:18 a.m. on June 3, according to Titus.
The timing of the SR9 vote makes “a strong legal case to invalidate,” read a Senate Republican Caucus press release recapping Titus’s statements, but “judicial intervention is unlikely on SCR8 due to longstanding precedent against courts intervening in internal legislative matters.”
Under SR9, Titus and fellow Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen were appointed to the 2025-27 Legislative Commission. The four Democrats appointed were Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and state Sens. Skip Daly, Rochelle Nguyen, and Melanie Scheible.
Cannizzaro, who was running Monday’s commission meeting when Titus made her comments, did not respond to the broader criticism of the 11th hour passage of SCR8. Instead, she said the meeting was an inappropriate venue for a debate on legislative matters and that the commission has rules of decorum that do not allow the “calling out” of other members.
Cannizzaro refuted only one allegation made by Titus: that Republican Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony was “locked out” of the chamber and not able to fulfill his constitutional duty of presiding over the Senate.
“That is 100% untrue,” she said.
Titus, Anthony and other Republicans have publicly claimed that the lieutenant governor was blocked from entering the chamber. Senate President Pro Tempore Marilyn Dondero Loop, a Democrat, presided over the Senate during the stretch of the 11 p.m. floor session where SCR8 was voted on.
At Monday’s Legislative Commission meeting, Hansen briefly spoke during the public comment period about the incident.
“He may not have been locked out,” said Hansen of the lieutenant governor, “but I stood there and witnessed him trying to get into … the chamber and saw the sergeant-in-arms blocking him from entering the chamber.”
Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, who earlier in the meeting was selected chair of the Legislative Commission, cut Hansen off after three minutes. Public comment is typically limited to three minutes per speaker.
Partisan power grab?
In the first few days of the 2025 Legislative Session, state lawmakers passed an Assembly concurrent resolution that, among other things, included rules for establishing the partisan split of the Legislative Commission. That resolution mirrored language used in prior sessions and specified that if the minority party controlled at least one-third of seats in a chamber, the commission would be evenly divided between the parties. If the minority party controlled between one-fifth and one-third of seats, the party would have two of the six seats for their chamber.
SCR8 changed those guidelines. Now, the minority party only gets two of six seats if they control at least a third but not half of their chamber’s seats, and the commission is only evenly divided if the chamber is evenly divided.
The Senate Democratic Caucus has not publicly commented on why they sponsored the 11th hour resolution to change the makeup of the commission. The caucus did not respond to the Nevada Current’s request for comment Monday.
Republicans have characterized it as a partisan power grab.
The Legislative Commission gives final approval to regulations established by state agencies. Those can have major impacts across the state, and they can be controversial. For example, onerous regulations drafted by the Secretary of State’s Office and approved by the Legislative Commission were cited as the reason why at least one rural county opted not to attempt to hand-count ballots in the 2024 elections.
The Legislative Commission’s makeup now more closely resembles the makeup of the state’s other powerful interim body, the Interim Finance Committee, which handles money matters while the full Legislature is not in session. The IFC is composed of the members of the Senate Finance and Assembly Ways and Means committees, whose makeup is determined by the partisan split of each chamber.
IFC has 23 members — 17 Democrats and six Republicans. The Legislative Commission, with 12 members, now has eight Democrats and four Republicans.
For comparison, the Nevada State Assembly’s 43 seats are split 27 Democrats, 15 Republicans. The Nevada State Senate’s 21 seats are split 13 Democrats, eight Republicans.
The Legislative Commission has been the source of partisan-driven drama before. In 2017, Democrats appointed to the commission Patricia Farley, a Republican turned nonpartisan who during that session had mostly voted with Democrats. The move drew sharp criticism from the minority party. That year, Democrats also did not appoint the senate minority leader as a commission member, a break of tradition.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Robin-Titus-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

Jim Pillen. (Courtesy of Todd campaign)LINCOLN — A grassroots advocate for medical cannabis who is at the center of some Nebraska state officials’ efforts against the use of the drug voters approved is running for governor in 2026.
Jacy Todd of York, 54, who runs a CBD health and wellness retail store in central Nebraska, says he is running to be a “voice of the people.” In part, he said he wants to show it’s not the “richest” people who get into office, that a middle-class family man can as well. 
Todd is the first Republican to challenge incumbent Gov. Jim Pillen ahead of the May 2026 primary. The winner advances to the November 2026 election.
“I want to provide that hope for everybody and let them know that there is an out,” Todd told the Nebraska Examiner. “We can stand together. We can push back.”

Todd is no stranger around the Nebraska State Capitol or in the public eye. In October, Hall County Attorney Marty Klein, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and their prosecutors charged Todd with 24 counts of improper notarizations, or “official misconduct” — Class II misdemeanors — on the most recent medical cannabis ballot measure. 
Each count refers to a different date that prosecutors allege Todd notarized a specific circulator’s petitions outside of the circulator’s presence. 
Todd has repeatedly denied those allegations and again told the Examiner he is innocent and that his integrity remains “fully intact.”
‘Grassroot this all the way’
Todd said he probably would have been scared if the state had come after him 10 years ago,. But he says people are tired and frustrated and want change. He plans to travel the state and meet Nebraskans to learn what’s bothering them and see how he can help.
Pillen already had about $3.7 million in campaign cash on hand as of January. But Todd said he will “out voice” Pillen and challenge Pillen to debates. During Pillen’s 2022 campaign, he declined debates but did participate in some candidate forums.

Todd said grassroots Nebraskans are charging forward for change.
“I think that Nebraska is a powerful enough state that we could grassroot this all the way to the Capitol and clean house up there,” Todd said.
Part of Todd’s intention to run is also to root out resistance to the people’s will. He started thinking about running for governor as he saw politicians resist the will of more than 71% of Nebraska voters to legalize medical cannabis and 67% of voters to regulate it.
“I didn’t go fight a war and I didn’t go defend the United States for a select few people to turn back the voice of the 70%,” Todd said.
Medical cannabis focus
A combat medic in Operation Desert Storm in his 20s who later joined the Nebraska National Guard, Todd said he began to question the medical expertise of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, which suggested he “try” one medication after another to treat his post-traumatic stress disorder, which he said drove him at one point to consider taking his own life.
But when Todd tried cannabis to deal with his pain, he said it led to a “best night’s sleep.” Todd said he continued to research cannabis, which continued to help him.
At one point, Todd said he met cannabis doctors in Colorado and started doing some studies with them. One doctor told Todd that cannabis had saved his life because of interactions with the CB-1 receptors in his brain and endocannabinoid system, so he created his business Herban Pulse to help other Nebraskans find some relief.

As a cannabis user for almost 30 years, Todd said he’s told lawmakers he’s “living proof” of being a functional member of society, going on to run Little League Baseball program and be a scoutmaster. He added he can challenge any lawmaker who argues cannabis hurts intelligence.
“If you guys want to have an IQ test with a pothead, let’s have it. I’ll embarrass you guys to no end,” Todd said with a laugh.
Todd said one of his goals as governor is to advance Nebraska’s cannabis industry to be the best in the nation, including with more research.
He said that while Hilgers and others in the state rule by “visions” of what hemp or cannabis should have been legalized, he sees hypocrisy in trying to outlaw “synthetic” marijuana on one hand while trying to forbid, through regulations, the in-state sale of raw marijuana plant flower on the other.
Notary criminal allegations
Todd said he got a call from the Hall County Sheriff’s Office last August or September and immediately knew it was a coordinated, hyper-focused look into the campaign that he had been a volunteer for the past four years.
He expected the pushback but didn’t expect to be a target. Todd said he told an investigator bluntly that he got his notary license to help with medical cannabis and followed all applicable rules, including witnessing the circulator signature of another campaign volunteer who was criminally targeted last fall.
The investigator asked Todd specifically about that Grand Island man, Michael Egbert, who would go on to plead guilty to illegally adding voters to the medical cannabis petitions, including by using a phone book. None of the Egbert-collected signatures were counted.
Todd said Egbert would come into his store on Mondays, where he would witness Egbert’s signature. That’s the detail Egbert and prosecutors alleged Todd did not do on 24 dates.
Todd said he recalls telling the investigator, “You picked the right guy,” of Egbert. At a separate civil trial against the medical cannabis organizers last fall, Egbert said he has a medical condition that impairs his memory, which some of the products from Todd’s shop sought to help.

The civil trial seeking to disqualify the petitions from reaching the November 2024 ballot ultimately failed, and Todd said he told his attorney as he prepared to be a witness in that case: “I tell the truth. I have nothing to hide. Set us up for a deposition.”
“I’ll do depositions as long as they want to keep on doing depositions. I’ll talk to anybody about it. I didn’t do anything wrong,” Todd said. “If you speak of truth, you don’t have to worry about getting caught up in anything.”
Todd said he didn’t plead his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination and answered every question. He was slated to testify at the civil trial, but he was injured just days before after falling through a roof. He has been recovering since.
When investigators reached out to him, Todd said he was angry. But he was also determined to win.
“It brought me probably closer to the situation as far as looking at the corruption in the Capitol, and it’s a select few,” Todd said. “My goal is this: I think if I could cut the puppet strings coming from D.C. into Nebraska, I think that’s a start.”
Headed to trial
The criminal case against Todd was initially dismissed, with his county judge deciding notaries could not be charged in the manner that Todd was. Todd is believed to be the first notary charged with criminal malfeasance for notarial duties in the state, if not the nation, according to Todd’s attorney and multiple court observers.
A Hall County District Court judge reversed that ruling, sending the case back down to trial. The district judge likewise questioned the resources being used to pursue Todd “when looking at the …voice of its residents.”
Todd said he and his attorney plan to “roll the dice” on 12 jurors, instead of one judge, with Todd adding: “I don’t think it’s going to take long at all and that they’re going to find me not guilty.”
Todd’s criminal case heads to trial this September. He retains his notary license.
‘I will fight’
Legal observers see Todd’s charges as a possible test case for criminally scrutinizing notaries involved in petition campaigns or other efforts that government officials might disagree with in Nebraska or other states.
Todd said he plans to win the governor’s race and change the state’s course immediately, including by upholding honesty and transparency. 
  The Nebraska Governor’s Mansion on Tuesday, Jan. 18, 2022, in Lincoln. (Rebecca S. Gratz for Nebraska Examiner)
He said that includes no closed-door meetings and advocating for the elimination of secret ballots for legislative leadership every two years, a long-held goal by many in the GOP.
Todd said he would continue to address property taxes and end a “pyramid scheme” of shifting taxes between property and sales taxes. He wants to pay for tax relief and reduce government spending by implementing an independent audit team, starting at the Capitol, at the “bread and butter of things,” to find millions upon millions of state spending dollars that he says could be saved.
Pillen has sought to reduce the annual $5.3 billion in property taxes, most to local K-12 schools, since taking office in 2023 by broadening the state’s sales tax base. Lawmakers have balked multiple times.
Todd also plans to meet with governors and state leaders of other states to see what solutions might work in the Cornhusker State.
Of Todd’s message to Nebraskans, he said he wants to work for the people and that “four more years of Pillen will be a bitter pill for all of Nebraskans to swallow,” a dig at Pillen’s comments this spring that he would carry out medical cannabis but make sure the medicine would be a “bitter pill to swallow” so it would not trickle over to recreational marijuana.
“I will fight for what is right for all of us, all of Nebraska,” Todd said. “I don’t pick and choose sides.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.












Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University




Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Almost 37,000 students applied for the CHOOSE Act, funded by the state’s Education Trust Fund (ETF), which funds public schools, for the 2025-26 school year. Most of the applicants came from students already enrolled in private schools, according to data released in April. Those intending to use the ESA for public and private school, they received a $7,000 tax credit and those intending to use the funds for home schooling received $2,000.
Of the 37,000 applicants, about 24,000 (64%) were awarded ESAs, according to data from the Alabama Department of Revenue (ALDOR). Nearly 14,000 (60%) of those who received CHOOSE Act money plan to enroll in private school for the 2025-26 school year. Of those 14,000, about 10,000 (71%) were already attending a private school. 
Only 26 of the students in private school intend to use the ESA for public school, according to the ALDOR’s data.

“Our CHOOSE Act education saving accounts are officially ready to support thousands of Alabama families and students with their unique educational needs,” Gov. Kay Ivey wrote in a statement. “In just the first year, our state’s ESA program is incredibly popular, providing opportunity, flexibility and choice when it comes to our children’s education. I am excited to see the program in action this year.”
The Legislature initially appropriated $100 million for the 2025-26 school year, but increased the appropriation to $180 million in the FY26 ETF. The total awarded amount for this school year is nearly $124 million, according to the governor’s office. 
The Council for Leaders in Alabama Schools (CLAS), an organization that provides professional development, networking opportunities, communications, legal support, legislative monitoring and recognition programs for its members, has been opposed to the legislation since its conception. Whitney Miller-Nichols, director of governmental relations for CLAS, said in an interview Thursday that the CHOOSE Act is frustrating because, for the most part, families are making the same school choice, just with a tax credit.

“This is opening up new avenues for families, but the data doesn’t show that. Most kids are going to be educated in the same mode they were before they had the ESA,” Miller-Nichols said. “A different choice hasn’t been made. The choice is just more affordable now.”
This is true for students currently in private school and home school. Nearly 7,000 home-schooled students were awarded funds, and most of them received the $2,000 credit to continue their education at home. About 700 students will get the $7,000 credit and go to private school and about 30 will go to public school with the same credit, according to the data. 
However, about 3,000 (58.6%) public-educated students will switch to private school with the $7,000 credit, according to the data. About 700 (13.6%) will get a $2,000 credit to start a home education program, according to the data.
The ESAs can be used for education-related expenses, including private school tuition and textbooks, according to ALDOR’s parent guide on the ESAs. According to the Education Data Initiative, the average private school tuition in Alabama is $8,289 per student per year.
The recipients for the next two school years are limited to families whose income is 300% or less of the federal poverty level, about $79,950 a year for a family of three. In 2027, it expands to any family.
“I believe it will be one of the most successful school choice programs in the country. I am proud we established it, and I am proud to continue offering my strong support for it going forward, all while championing our public schools,” Ivey wrote in an op-ed to Alabama Daily News last week.
Democrats and a handful of Republicans from rural areas opposed the law last year, expressing concerns that it could drain the ETF and exacerbate de facto segregation in the state’s public schools.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_5161-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-08 09:09:45.267552

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
When Lama Ali Ahmad became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2021, she was eager to become a voter, too.
In Lebanon, where she’s from, elections were often derailed by crises. But here, she had faith in the process. She registered and voted in a municipal election the same day. That night, she gathered her family at her Dearborn home for a special dinner of steak, chicken, and tabbouleh, and told them how good it felt to finally be heard.
“That was the moment where I really felt that I am an American citizen,” she said.
Last year, she celebrated another civic triumph: Voting on a ballot printed in Arabic, her first language.
The experience wasn’t perfect, said Ali Ahmad, who also speaks English and French. The Arabic translation of instructions and ballot questions was more formal than familiar and even awkward in places. But the impact on her was profound.
“I felt like I was at home when I voted in Arabic,” she said.
The translated ballot was available because of a local measure passed in Dearborn, a Detroit suburb with a high concentration of Arabic speakers. Hamtramck, another Detroit-area city with a large Arab-American community, has a similar local law requiring voting materials in Arabic.
But while Arabic is spoken all over Michigan, and is one of the most commonly spoken non-English languages in the U.S., there’s no Michigan or federal law that requires ballot translation into Arabic for people who would benefit from it. Federal voting rights laws do require ballot translations for many other languages, but they emerged at a time when Arabic wasn’t yet widely spoken in the U.S., and they were written restrictively to include only a narrow list of language groups.
That means that in communities across the state and country, Arabic speakers are excluded from the kind of voting access that people of other language groups are entitled to. In Michigan — where Arabic is the third most common language after English and Spanish, spoken by more than 171,000 people (with more than 80,000 of those who report speaking English less than “very well”) — it’s up to individual municipalities to decide whether to require Arabic translations, and then they have to figure out how to arrange them. Translations are costly and difficult to produce, especially in a way that’s familiar enough for everyday speakers to understand.
Dearborn Deputy Clerk Megan Lizbinski said the city has seen voters ask for an Arabic ballot, only to return and request the English version instead because the text in Arabic proves too confusing.
Experts say that if more cities begin doing the translation work together — sharing resources, translators, and templates under state leadership — the process could become cheaper, better, and more accessible for everyone.
 Section 203: Voting rights law leaves Arabic out

The federal laws on ballot translations are contained in Section 203 of the Voting Rights Act, a part added in 1975. The section aimed to protect millions of people considered to have been “effectively excluded from participation in the electoral process” because of language, and initially covered a finite set of language groups: Spanish, Asian languages, Native American languages, and Alaskan Native languages.
Section 203 was a breakthrough for a country where many states had long used literacy tests to bar certain groups from voting. But over its 50 years, the law has retained its narrow eligibility criteria, and hasn’t always kept pace with demographic changes.
For a community of non-English language speakers in a particular area to qualify for a translation requirement under Section 203, they must be below certain thresholds for English proficiency and educational attainment, based on U.S. Census data. The list is updated every five years — the next revision comes in 2026 — and most communities don’t make the cut.
In Michigan, just four areas are subject to federally required translations: Clyde Township near Port Huron, and Fennville and Covert Township in the southwest, must translate into Spanish. Hamtramck is required to translate its materials into Bengali.
There’s little political will to broaden the federal criteria, experts say. But state and local governments have more room to act — and more recent success. Experts and advocates hope that will be the path forward for Michigan to adopt a translation policy that better reflects its current voter base.
 Michigan Voting Rights Act called for expanded translations

State lawmakers have tried. Last year, Democratic legislators introduced the Michigan Voting Rights Act, a package of bills aimed at expanding ballot access. Among other things, it would have changed the criteria for a guaranteed translation, requiring many more communities to provide election materials in additional languages.
Coldwater, for instance, a city of around 14,000 in south central Michigan’s Branch County, would have had to offer its election materials in three languages, clerks testified at a House hearing. The city currently provides no non-English materials.
Local election officials didn’t oppose the idea of more translation. But they worried about the potential cost. State officials said the Department of State would pick up most of the tab, but there was no funding guarantee in the bills.
Coldwater budgeted around $33,000 for elections this fiscal year. Printing in two additional languages would have cost thousands more — and that’s before paying translators, running security tests on each version of the ballot, and other related expenses.
But the legislation ultimately died when Democrats failed to pass the package before the session — and their control of both chambers of the legislature — ended. The conversation about expanded language access largely died with it. Rep. Rachelle Smit, the Martin Republican who now chairs the House Election Integrity Committee has made it clear she has no interest in reviving the legislation.
Michigan does provide other language support for voters. The Secretary of State’s website offers information on voting in 19 different languages — the voter registration form alone is available in Spanish, French, Somali, Vietnamese, Russian, Dari, Arabic, Pashto, Bengali, Amharic, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean. Voters are allowed to bring support (including translators) into the voting booth with them, and some communities use phone hotlines for live language help. Others rely on bilingual poll workers, often hired with state assistance.
But other states go further. California, for instance, requires translated ballots for any precinct where more than 3% of voting-age residents are of the same non-English language, compared with the federal standard of 5%.
In Los Angeles County, the largest voting jurisdiction in the country, that includes the languages covered by the federal requirement — Cambodian, Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Filipino and Vietnamese — as well as Armenian, Bengali, Burmese, Farsi, Gujarati, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Khmer, Mongolian, Persian, Russian, Telugu, and Thai for certain precincts under state requirements. Other communities across the state are translating election materials into Urdu, Syriac, and Arabic.
A new poll finds that most Californians want the state to go even further, with 87% of respondents who spoke limited English saying they would be more likely to vote if they had a ballot available in their preferred language.
In Hawaii, where all elections are conducted by mail, mail ballots must include instructions on how to access translation services in Hawaiian and at least five other non-English languages.
Minnesota state law requires voting instructions at all polling places to be translated into the three most commonly spoken non-English languages: Spanish, Hmong, and Somali. The state also requires translators at precincts with significant language minorities, meaning voters can get assistance in German, Russian, and other languages.
“As I see it, it’s not about English proficiency really,” Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon told Votebeat, explaining that his mother, who was from Austria, spoke English fluently but still preferred to read complicated material in her native language.
“I think most humans are that way. It’s not that she lacked English knowledge, and it’s not as if Hmong speakers or Spanish speakers or Somali speakers or Russian speakers can’t read English. The opposite is often true,” he said. “But when it comes to technical instructions, you want to convey information in a language that best connects with a person.”
People don’t always immediately know that information is available in another language or even think to ask. But when those materials are consistently offered, they help drive civic participation. The translations bring voters closer to truly understanding what they’re weighing in on.
It’s why Lizbinski, the deputy clerk in Dearborn, believes the benefits of offering translation into Arabic “far outweighs the costs.” Those costs are significant: typically around $32,000 for a general election, and closer to $87,000 for a presidential primary, where there are three distinct ballot types. (Those costs, officials say, are likely to rise in future elections.)
 How a statewide model could help in Michigan

Between 1980 and 2021, the number of people in the U.S. who speak Arabic at home grew nearly sevenfold — outpacing most other language groups — according to Pew Research Center, and the community continues to grow rapidly in Michigan, beyond the major hubs like Dearborn, said demographer Kurt Metzger.
As long as that pace continues, local election officials will have a tough time meeting the language needs of Arabic-speaking voters. Shams Al-Badry, civic engagement manager at the Dearborn-based Arab Community Center for Economic and Social Services, said that history shows that clerks are willing to make the changes but hesitant to shoulder the cost alone.
But experts agree that if the state served as a kind of linguistic clearinghouse, offering ballot translation through a statewide system, rather than relying on individual communities, that problem could be eased.
And if the state covered the expense, Al-Badry said, local officials could focus on delivery: getting translated ballots into the hands of the voters who would benefit the most.
Even native English speakers may have a hard time understanding complex ballot measures. “Now bring in someone who doesn’t fully understand the language … and expect them to vote their conscience,” she said. “That’s really difficult.”
That’s what motivates Ali Ahmad, the Dearborn resident, who is still navigating what it means to be an American citizen. She jokes that she’s not 100% sure what a county treasurer does all day, or why she has to vote on one.
But she’s helping others navigate the system as lead community organizer for the National Network for Arab American Communities. She translates voter guides, educates new citizens, and urges her eligible family members to vote as well.
She appreciates the state’s recent changes to expand voting rights, such as early voting and less restrictive absentee voting.
And “this seems like the next good step in making voting accessible,” she said, “making sure everyone can vote in their language.”

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
13,000 South Dakotans would lose Medicaid if ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ passes, research group says

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Concerns raised over unintentional coverage losses at final Medicaid work requirements hearing

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

,California,2025-07-08 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Valadao and other California GOP members of Congress might regret backing Trump’s megabill,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/valadao-congress-republican-regret-bill/,"Congressional Republicans in California are facing attacks over their support for Trump's controversial megabill. What happens in three targeted districts next year could easily determine which party controls the House, with potentially major consequences for the remainder of Trump’s presidency.","Last Thursday, just minutes after the House of Representatives passed President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” to overhaul federal taxes and health care spending, the National Republican Campaign Committee issued a statement touting Rep. David Valadao’s vote for the controversial measure.
“In a major win for Californians, David Valadao just voted to pass landmark legislation that lowers taxes, boosts economic growth, strengthens essential benefits, and restores law and order in California,” the NRCC declared.
“Congressman David Valadao is doing exactly what he promised: delivering real results, restoring fiscal sanity, and fighting for California families,” NRCC spokesman Christian Martinez said. “His vote is proof that strong leadership and commonsense still matter in Washington.”
A couple of hours later, Protect Our Care California, a health care advocacy organization with close ties to Democratic Party leaders, announced that it will air video ads criticizing Valadao and nine other Republican congressional members for their votes.
“Representative David Valadao just voted for the largest health care cuts in history in order to fund tax breaks for billionaires and big corporations, and we’re going to make sure that every single one of their constituents knows it,” said Matthew Herdman, director of Protect Our Care California.
The ads are aimed at Valadao and other members of California’s Republican congressional delegation, including Young Kim and Ken Calvert, because they are considered to be the most vulnerable incumbents as the two major parties battle over control over the House in next year’s elections.
Republicans have a paper-thin House majority — as demonstrated by the 218-214 final vote on Trump’s high priority bill — and Valadao, Kim and Calvert barely survived past challenges. Valadao first won a congressional seat in 2012, lost it in 2018 and regained it in 2020. He successfully fended off Democrat Rudy Salas in 2022 and 2024.
What happens in the three targeted districts next year could easily determine which party will prevail, with potentially major consequences for the final two years of Trump’s presidency.
Valadao’s vote for the bill is especially noteworthy because Democratic voters outnumber Republicans by 12 percentage points in the San Joaquin Valley’s 22nd Congressional District, two-thirds of his constituents rely on Medi-Cal (California’s version of Medicaid) for their health care, and he had repeatedly promised not to vote for any reductions in the program.
The Fresno Bee’s editorial page quickly excoriated him for seemingly abandoning that pledge under pressure from Trump.
“At a height of 6-feet-4, Rep. David Valadao can cast a giant presence in Washington, D.C.,” The Bee’s editorial board wrote. “Unfortunately, he doesn’t measure up when it comes to looking out for the best interests of his community.”
The editorial continued, “The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency, estimated that the Senate version of the bill, which was eventually passed, reduces federal Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over 10 years and increases the number of uninsured people by 11.8 million. 
“What happened to Valadao in five days to change his mind? For one thing, he visited the White House on Wednesday. His office didn’t provide details of that reunion, but Trump has used such meetings to pressure reluctant lawmakers to do his bidding over that of the people.”
Valadao insists that he received assurances from the White House that the Medicaid cuts will “be structured in a way that benefits our providers and keeps our hospitals and communities running.”
Aware of his precarious hold on the seat, Valadao has continuously stressed his independence, even being one of only 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump during his first presidential reign.
However, Valadao’s vote for Trump’s bill undermines that independent image and will almost certainly be weaponized as Democrats try again to capture his seat next year.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092222-DAVID-VALADAO-REUTERS-GS-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-08 08:02:15.502194

Debbie Wood, R-Valley, will resign from the Alabama House of Representatives at the end of July.
Wood, serving her second term in the chamber, is moving from her east Alabama district, which includes Chambers and Lee counties, near the Florida panhandle due to her husband’s new job in Pensacola. Alabama law requires lawmakers to live in the district they represent. 
“I own property in Chambers County, so I could have completed my term, but my heart and body would have been somewhere else,” Wood said in an interview on Monday. “I could have done it, but it just wasn’t right. The people deserve a full-time representative.”
House Speaker Nathaniel Ledbetter, R-Rainesville, wished Wood the best in a statement Monday.
“Rep. Wood has been a great member during her time in the House, and we will certainly miss her leadership,” Ledbetter said. 
Wood was first elected to the House from her east Alabama district in 2018 when she won 70% of the vote, according to election results. She got 88% of votes in 2022 against Charles Temm, a Libertarian, according to election results.  
The representative served on the House Education Policy Committee, working on paid parental leave for teachers and the RAISE Act, which allocates additional money to schools based on the presence of certain groups of students, like children in poverty and English Language Learners.
“We don’t always get our name on it, we had to work together,” she said of the paid parental leave law. “The new way that we fund education is a game changer.”
Wood said that she is most proud of legislation she worked on in 2023 with Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, that allows patients access to loved ones during a pandemic.
“I think that’s one of the things I will look back on, and I will be proud that I had a part in patients seeing their loved ones,” she said.
The Legislature passed a law in 2018 that requires a special election in the third year of a four year term if the seat is left vacant by Oct. 1. Gov. Kay Ivey has yet to call a special election for seat Wood is vacating. A message seeking comment from Ivey was left Monday morning.

Leslie got the job through a workforce development program for older adults that could see its funding eliminated by Congress. (Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program.
For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible.
In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding in fiscal year 2025, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
The program’s participants include more than 500 older South Carolinians, according to the state Department on Aging.
In 16 counties, the state agency partners with Goodwill Industries of the Upstate/Midlands to enroll 112 people annually. Statewide, Goodwill Industries International has a federal contract to oversee the program for an additional 436 people, said Department on Aging spokesman Michael Christopher.
Participants work an average of 20 hours a week. In South Carolina, they’re paid the federal minimum wage for the duration of the program’s on-the-job training: $7.25 an hour.

 Isolated and unsure

Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities.
As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
 ‘Lost in D.C.’

On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Last month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.
But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million, and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” said Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years.
While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
 Congressional chaos

The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
As Republicans add work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
The mega-bill signed by Trump on July Fourth requires nondisabled adults who don’t meet an exception, such as caring for young children, to show they’re working, volunteering or going to school at least 80 hours a month to continue their Medicaid coverage. Those new requirements apply to the 40 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, which don’t include South Carolina.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program.
In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress couldn’t cut or eliminate them in the mega-bill signed into law last week.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program — as he did unsuccessfully during his first term — but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20.
The Senate’s plans are less certain. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
 Future possibilities

Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”

He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.

The annual NRA meeting and exhibit runs through Sunday.  (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.












Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University




Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

On Aug. 21, Vermont’s agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement comes to an end. This is a perfect opportunity for us to stop participating in the illegal rounding up of immigrants and the use of our prisons to warehouse detained people.
Not only would it end our complicity in ICE abductions, but it would also unburden our Department of Corrections staff and facilities.

According to the VTDigger story of June 28, prison staff are called on to provide medical information, clothing and prepared meals for detainees being transferred at all hours of the day and night, which is difficult and disruptive for both staff and the regular prison population as well.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Will Patten: RIP Gardener’s Supply.","This commentary is by Will Patten of Hinesburg. He is a retired business executive and author of the book, “Saving Capitalism, Vermont Shows a Way.”


Gardener’s Supply is bankrupt and a star has fallen from Vermont’s universe of socially responsible, employee-owned, B-certified companies. These businesses invest in the health of their people, communities and environment with as much fervor as they invest in their financial welfare. Vermont has more of these businesses than any other state on a per capita basis.
Gardener’s Supply was born of Will Raap’s Intervale miracle that transformed a dump into acres of lush vegetable gardens and helped scores of “agripreneurs” start their own businesses. Will taught us the joy of working in the warm spring soils and eating our own fresh produce.
But businesses and corporations are just assemblages of people with a single focus and they are as organic as the people comprising them. They take seed, struggle, blossom and eventually die. Their life span is determined by how well they adapt to an ever-changing world.

Socially responsible, employee-owned, B-certified companies are not immune from competition and market changes. As a retailer, Gardener’s Supply had to compete with behemoths like Amazon, eBay and Walmart. As a values-led company, it had strengths and weaknesses. 
Socially responsible companies enjoy stronger customer loyalty. We like and support companies that care about more than profits. And that loyalty usually guarantees longevity, if not profits, to those companies. But Gardener’s sold high-end products to a niche consumer that could afford them. That’s what we call skinny economics.
Employee ownership has proven to increase the financial health of employees but not necessarily the company. Some companies that are owned through employee stock option plans engage the employees in strategic decisions.
A well-known local brewery decided against growth into regional markets with the counsel of employee-owners. Gardener’s Supply chose aggressive growth.
B certification is a rigorous audit of a company’s investment in financial, human and natural assets. It is designed to inform management of weakness in any of the three areas. It enforces what we used to say at Ben & Jerry’s about our economic and social missions: “No Margin; No Mission.” You can’t save the people and planet without profits.
There is a sign that hangs on our garden shed at home with a quote from Audrey Hepburn: “To garden is to believe in tomorrow.” We prepare the soil, plant the seeds, and hope they can survive the weather, weeds and predators.
That sentiment just as easily describes capitalist enterprises large and small that invest today in hopes they can survive the competition, turbulence, and uncertainty to provide a return tomorrow. 
Gardener’s Supply made decisions that involved risks and failed to provide a return. It happens to businesses every day. I will miss them.

(Getty Images)Gross assessed values for commercial, industrial and residential properties throughout Indiana collectively rose 12% from 2024 to 2025, according to a statewide comparison chart assembled by the Department of Local Government Finance for property taxes due and payable in 2026.
The data is sourced from ratio studies performed annually by the state’s 92 county assessors.
“It is essentially a test of each assessor: how well are you doing? Are you doing this right?” said Larry DeBoer, a retired Purdue University agricultural economics professor and tax expert.
“Not very many … elected officials actually face a test like that. They’re being held accountable.”
Agricultural land, meanwhile, will be assessed at a lower base rate than the previous year, thanks to a provision in the behemoth tax plan Indiana lawmakers approved in April.
That’ll likely shift property tax burden toward other property types, DeBoer noted. That’s not the only shift, however.
The legislation also saves homeowners a collective $1.2 billion in property taxes over three calendar years, from 2026 through 2028, according to a fiscal analysis. It does so largely by creating a credit for 10% off every homestead’s bill, up to $300 each.
Local residential trends reemerge

Commercial assessed value grew 16.07% in total, according to the study, ahead of industrial assessed value, which increased 15.59%.
Values for Hoosier houses collectively rose by less: 10.42%.
Lawmakers have, for years, promised cash-strapped homeowners that high assessed values and resulting skyrocketing property tax bills would naturally come down.
“I think we’re seeing some evidence” that values are growing more slowly, DeBoer said.
Relief could be on the horizon at last.
Gross assessed values don’t translate perfectly to property tax bills, however. County auditors will apply all deductions and credits to certify net assessed values, according to DLGF spokeswoman Jenny Banks.
DeBoer also observed a bigger variety in residential value growth than in recent years.
“Covid was a nationwide trend that affected every place — so maybe we’re not seeing a big nationwide or even statewide trend affecting home values now,” he posited.
“We’re back to: assessed value is a local issue,” DeBoer added. “And a local economy, and the local assessing practice, is what seems to be influencing the changes.”
Tax bill eases pressure on farmland
Indiana’s farmland is assessed differently.
DLGF calculates a rolling average using six years of capitalized net operating income and net cash rent. The highest value of the six is dropped from the formula, and the remaining five years are averaged to determine a base rate.
Another increase was in the cards for the base rate, to $2,390 per acre.
That would’ve come after several straight years of big jumps: from $1,500 in assessment year 2022 to $1,900 in 2023 and $2,280 in 2024.
Lawmakers intervened via Senate Enrolled Act 1, increasing the capitalization rate in the formula’s denominator to lower the base rate. Now, it’ll be $2,120 per acre, according to a DLGF memo.
“Yep, that was a victory for the (Indiana) Farm Bureau,” DeBoer quipped.
The formula averages six years to “iron out the blips,” he said, but it also can create a delay where assessed values may keep rising even as farm incomes and commodity prices are falling. The last high pandemic-era value, for example, won’t drop out of the formula until the end of the decade.
The average price of top-quality farmland was $14,392 per acre in 2024, according to a Purdue University Farmland Values survey. Average- and poor-quality farmland prices averaged $11,630 and $9,071, respectively.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman was taken from us by the kind of political violence that is becoming all too common — violence that doesn’t just hurt families, but threatens the integrity of our institutions and the safety of public leadership. Her loss is profound. But her impact didn’t end with her passing. It continues in the work she led, the people she stood with, and the values she fought for.
Melissa was not just a legislator. She was a builder of futures. She built bridges across ideologies, across communities, and through difficult moments. She believed in progress not as rhetoric, but as responsibility; as a promise we make to one another, especially when it’s hard. And, she made that promise real through consequential work for working families — expanding access to paid leave, improving education, and fighting for economic dignity across the state.
At Unidos MN, we know that promise because we’ve lived inside it.
Our leaders — everyday community members who chose to take responsibility for our conditions — stood beside her as she treated undocumented Minnesotans not as outsiders to power but as partners in shaping it. The meatpacking workers, the agricultural workers, the nannies and service workers, the undocumented leaders all walked with her through policy fights, through backlash, and through the fragile yet sacred work of creating space for immigrant families at the heart of Minnesota’s future.
The work and vision we accomplished together in 2024 through our coordinated Future Fund PAC was not just strategy. It was the kind of faith you place in people when the stakes are everything. It was a vision of a Minnesota where no one’s humanity is up for debate. Not the immigrant mother. Not the queer student. Not the undocumented essential worker who held up this state through a pandemic but still lives without health care.
Relationships forged through the struggle of confronting hard issues are profoundly unique. They are built not on convenience or comfort, but on shared purpose, sacrifice and survival. In those moments, trust is not theoretical; it is tested. People see each other in raw, unfiltered ways: in fear, in courage, in failure and in grit. These bonds go deeper than casual friendships because they are rooted in mutual reliance and the knowledge that the other person chose to show up when it mattered most. Melissa showed up when it mattered most, without pretense, unafraid to ask the hard questions, and never dodging the truth. She gave us real answers and met us with respect, treating us not as outsiders, but as full stakeholders, worthy of dignity, voice and power. 
And that’s why I want to speak clearly to one thing today:
One of her final votes — to strip health insurance from undocumented adults — was not a vote against immigrants.
It was a wrenching, complicated compromise. One she took not with pride, but with deep reflection, because she believed it was the only way, in that moment, to protect Minnesota from further harm. She believed it would preserve the fragile groundwork we had built together for future protections, future wins and future hope. And we are a testament to that hope.
Because Melissa Hortman never treated politics as a purity test — she treated it as an act of care. A practice of courage. A long, unglamorous labor toward justice. Even when the cameras were off, even when the hashtags faded, she was still there pushing for the undocumented worker, the student in crisis, the single mom who needed one more reason not to give up. She didn’t show up for the headlines, she showed up for the people. And she was determined to be an instrument to reinstate health care for undocumented adults in the future.
Melissa was taken from us, but her legacy lives on in the generations of Minnesotans impacted by her policies. Let us honor her by continuing the work to improve the lives of all working families, to advance climate justice, protect reproductive rights, strengthen public education, and build a health care system that upholds human dignity. Let us continue the work for a Minnesota that embodies the inclusive and just democracy our nation so urgently needs.
So let us mourn with full hearts, without apology. But let it be a courageous mourning. The kind that refuses to turn away. The kind that holds sorrow in one hand and determination in the other. Because Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman did not live a small life, and we will not offer her a small grief. 
We will grieve by building. We will cry, and still organize. We will honor her not only in silence, but in the noise of collective demand. The chants at the Capitol. The organizing in church basements. The policies reshaped by those she believed in most — the workers, the immigrants, the people too often told to wait their turn. That is the Minnesota she saw. That is the future she helped make possible.
Let us not return to business as usual. Let us rise with the courage she carried, with the clarity she led with, and with the compassion she never abandoned. Let us finish what she started — and begin what she dreamed.
Rest in power, Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman.
Rest in love, Mark Hortman and sweet Gilbert. 
Your legacy is not behind us. It is with us — and ahead of us.
Let us be brave enough to carry it all the way home.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_9225-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-08 07:08:30.482550

Glacier Park, like many national parks, charges $35 per car for a week’s entry. (Photo by Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall.
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.
The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some NPS sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
Last year was the busiest on record for the NPS, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 NPS units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the NPS charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30. 
Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using NPS data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries. 
The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position. 
“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)The number of students paddled in Florida schools may decrease now that parents are included in a new state law.
Starting this school year, the state requires parents to approve use of corporal punishment before school districts may administer it.
According to Florida Department of Education data, schools inflicted corporal punishment in 516 instances during the 2023-24 school year. 
“It’s quite honestly amazing that this hasn’t previously been in place in Florida, in a state that really prides itself for its work protecting parental rights,” Jacob Kaplan,  president of the Florida Student Policy Forum, based at the University of Florida, which lobbied for the new law, told the Phoenix. 
Nineteen public school districts in Florida allow corporal punishment, defined as “the moderate use of physical force or physical contact by a teacher or principal as may be necessary to maintain discipline or to enforce school rule.”
Some counties that administer corporal punishment request parental consent, while others just require notification that the punishment could be administered. 
According to the National Education Association, 17 states allow corporal punishment. 
Kaplan, a sophomore, was part of the group that, with the help of Moms for Liberty, navigated the legislative process to get lawmakers on board with the idea.
The process started before Kaplan entered UF. Four years in the making, the proposal started as an outright ban of corporal punishment but switched to requiring parental consent after running into roadblocks inside the Capitol.
Graham Bernstein, former director for political affairs for the Policy Forum and a May University of Florida graduate, said the idea really came to his attention after he read a 2021 article about a six-year-old in Hendry County who was paddled after scratching a computer screen.
According to news reports, the girl’s mother asked administrators to help her discipline the child, and watched and recorded the paddling. Prosecutors did not press criminal charges against the principal.
“Sunlight is the best disinfectant. There is now going to be, whether it’s a paper trail of evidence, or an electronic trail of evidence, guaranteed by state law so that parents can make it clear what they want and what they don’t want, and so that quite frankly teachers and principals are more protected, as well,” Bernstein said.
Discrimination
HB 1255, passed this spring, requires parents to consent to corporal punishment either for the school year or before each instance the punishment is used in traditional public and charter schools.
Many of the districts that permit corporal punishment are northern, rural counties, like Suwannee, Holmes, Columbia, Jackson, Dixie, Hardee, Levy, Franklin, and Liberty.
Kim Winker, the Moms for Liberty Florida legislative chair for the 2025 session, told the Phoenix the law is “the right way to go” and benefits schools, teachers, administrators, parents, and students — and that she, too, was surprised to learn that corporal punishment was still occurring in Florida.
“We were concerned that parents were not given the right to opt in to student corporal punishment, and the fact that it was being disproportionately used on disabled students was concerning to us, as well. We wanted to advocate for allowing parents to decide the discipline decisions being made on their children at school,” Winker said — adding that she is “definitely for” an outright ban on corporal punishment.
According to data compiled by the Policy Forum, while students with disabilities comprise around 20% of school enrollment, in 2023-2024 they accounted for around 40% of corporal punishment inflictions. In Gilchrist County, that number was 59%.
The U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights wrote in 2022 that students with disabilities may face heightened discipline “because they are not receiving the support, services, interventions, strategies, and modifications to school or district policies that they need to manage their disability-based behavior.”
The department found students with disabilities may be “subjected to discrimination based on their disability when being disciplined, such as when students with disabilities are unnecessarily disciplined more severely than students without disabilities for the same or similar behavior.”
“The parents need to have the guardrails in place so they can choose what is right for their student, and the schools need to follow the parents’ wishes and have the parents more involved with that,” Winker said. 
Other instances of corporal punishment in Florida schools have drawn media attention, such as in Lake County, which prohibits corporal punishment, when a bus monitor was accused of abusing a student with special needs in 2018; in 2019 in Broward County, which also prohibits corporal punishment, the Miami Herald wrote about a group of parents alleging students with autism bore bruises from a teacher; and an 18-year-old who told The74 that she felt like her teacher in Liberty County “got off by” paddling her.

The process
In addition to Kaplan and Graham Bernstein, Policy Forum members Adam Bernstein (no relation), and Konstantin contributed to the campaign. The organization works toward nonpartisan public policy, such as the initiative to give prisoners free phone calls if they demonstrate good behavior. That $1 million initiative was part of the final legislative budget, but Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed the line item.
“You kind of come to understand that the people making our laws are people just like you and me, with imperfect information access, and that kind of bridging that gap more than anything can really be impactful in changing the lives of people across the state,” Adam Bernstein, a recent UF graduate, said. 
A limit on the number of bills representatives may introduce and opposition from some lawmakers and legislative staff stood in the way of passing corporal punishment legislation in previous years, they said. 
“I don’t know that I’ve ever encountered a more meaningful way of spending my time in terms of learning about public policy issues,” Graham Bernstein said.
Lawmakers, who completed the legislative session last month, will return to Tallahassee for committee meetings in October. 
“Devoting yourself and volunteering to do this is the only way that average citizens get to have a say, because the only other people that get the opportunity to do this are paid lobbyists,” Adam Bernstein said.

Medicaid was their salvation. (Photo courtesy Keith Runyon)The front-page headlines in the last few days have been jarring: “Medicaid Cuts May Force Retirees out of Nursing Homes.”
While much of the battle over Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful” tax bill for billionaires is theoretical to many of us who’ve always had health insurance and coverage for things like rehab and even nursing homes, this information hit home for me.
In 1999, over Labor Day weekend, my mother had a paralytic stroke that left her entire right side lifeless. Although her mind was unimpaired, most of what she cared about in life was deeply affected. Since early childhood she had been a pianist, eventually a very fine one trained at the University of Louisville. Her days at the keyboard were ended. So was her ability to walk, to take care of basic chores, even to bathe. So was her ability to spend time with her grandchildren, and to entertain the family for holidays.
Yet her heart, at age 75, was still strong and her will to live was, at least for a time, unflinching. But within six months or so, after long treatment in a rehab center, Medicare required that she go home or go on full pay.
My parents lived the American dream in the postwar era. They were comfortably off, owned their own home, and educated their two sons — with no student loans. But even in 1999, they couldn’t afford, for very long, the steep prices that nursing homes charged. So Mother came home in a wheelchair, where she remained under my aged father’s care until he could bear it no longer. The family housekeeper, who had cared for my grandmother until she died, was as old as Mother, so she wasn’t up to the task either.
One night in April 2000 the call came from my brother that my father was so ill that he was unable to rise from the living room sofa. Within an hour, he was in an emergency room, dying of congestive heart failure.
He was brought back to life by one of Louisville’s great cardiac surgeons, Morris Weiss, but for the rest of his life he was frail and dependent on medicine, walked with a cane, and was unable to take my mother back home. Alas, nursing home care was the only option for her,
My father was always very private about his finances, so I never quite knew when, but his savings (and Mother’s) dried up and she was transferred to Medicaid. He was even reluctant to speak of it. We all thought Medicaid was for indigents, or the terribly disabled.
Turns out, Medicaid was for us. I learned that a lot of nursing homes welcomed Medicaid residents. An attorney who specialized in issues involving the aged advised our family. Then an elderly aunt died and left Mother some money. Immediately she went back onto private pay until those dollars were gobbled up. So back on Medicaid she went.
Meanwhile Daddy sold our family home, which gave him some money for emergencies but very few pleasures. He moved into a nice senior citizens’ complex, designed for independent living, with group meals and activities. He made friends and played cards and was close enough to Mother’s nursing home to pay daily visits. Then, his health began to fail.
For a time there was a very real prospect that both of them would be in nursing homes at the same time. Then, in the spring of 2008, each began a further decline. Mother decided that enough was enough. She told me and my Aunt Rose, “I want to die.” And so she did, by declining food and medication. She ended her days in a palliative care unit in St. Matthews, only a few blocks from where she had lived the happiest days of her life. In retrospect, I think she died of a broken heart.
A month later, her older sister Lucille died at the ripe old age of 91, in her own home surrounded by loved ones. And then, just after July 4, my father joined them, passing from life in the very same corridor as my mother, attended by the same nurses. It was a blessing.
It is too painful for me to imagine what would have happened if Mother had been thrown out of the nursing home for inability to pay. “Tax reform” – Donald Trump-style – might well make that happen. It is despicable legislation, the product of a time when lowering taxes for the rich “trumps” caring for the people who made this country great through hard work and patriotism. I don’t think my father went to fight in World War II to save a nation where the super-rich call the shots.
If this is a “big, beautiful bill” in the eyes of some, to me, it is a cancer in the American soul.

One million employees have no access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.,"RetireReady NJ is targeted at closing the retirement savings gap. One million employees have no access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)One year after the launch of a state-run retirement savings program aimed at private sector workers, more than 18,000 New Jerseyans have signed up and the program has surpassed more than $8.1 million in assets, state officials announced this week.
RetireReady NJ, established by a law Gov. Phil Murphy signed in March 2019, is intended to provice workers at small businesses with an easy way to save for retirement. Todd Hassler, executive director of the program, formally known as the New Jersey Secure Choice Savings Program, said in a statement that it provides a model for other states looking to give workers accessible ways to save.
“These accomplishments demonstrate New Jersey’s commitment to improving the retirement outcomes of our citizens. The RetireReady NJ team is very proud of the difference we are making in the financial security of the citizens here in New Jersey,” Hassler said.
RetireReady NJ is targeted at closing the retirement savings gap. One million full-time workers statewide are working without access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the American Retirement Association says.
At least 20 states have implemented their own retirement savings programs, according to Georgetown University.
Under RetireReady, New Jersey businesses that have been operating for at least two years and have at least 25 employees are required to register if they do not offer qualified retirement plans. The program is free for all employers to implement. So far, more than 1,200 employers have joined the program.
Workers who don’t opt out can contribute to a Roth or traditional IRA through payroll deductions.
The program was set to be implemented in 2021, but was repeatedly delayed due to the pandemic.
“The staff deserves credit for positioning New Jersey as a model for how states can offer accessible retirement savings programs,” State Treasurer Liz Muoio said in a statement.

,WyoFile,2025-07-08 10:35:00+00:00,WyoFile,Wyoming landed one of crypto’s biggest names. Here’s what that means for the state.,CJ Baker,,,,,https://wyofile.com/wyoming-landed-one-of-cryptos-biggest-names-heres-what-that-means-for-the-state/,"

Country’s second-largest crypto exchange names Cheyenne its home base. Wyoming leaders believe their pursuit of digital assets is paying off.
The post Wyoming landed one of crypto’s biggest names. Here’s what that means for the state. appeared first on WyoFile .","After years wooing the cryptocurrency and digital asset industry, Wyoming’s efforts were rewarded last month by one of the biggest players in the space.
Kraken — a multi-billion-dollar crypto company with over 2,200 employees and 15 million customers around the globe — announced it had officially moved its headquarters to Cheyenne.
“Wyoming may feel like one small town with really long streets,” Trevor Rutar, the Cheyenne-based head of Kraken’s banking venture, wrote on LinkedIn, “but it continues to punch above its weight in the future of finance.”
In a lengthy post on X, Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi praised the state for building the “most comprehensive and technically coherent legal framework for digital assets” in the country.
“This decision wasn’t about headlines or optics,” Sethi said. “It was about alignment.”
The company, which allows customers to securely trade cryptocurrencies and more traditional assets, opened a Cheyenne office over four years ago and has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the University of Wyoming’s blockchain program. But the formal establishment of a Wyoming headquarters makes the company’s ties to the state “permanent,” Sethi said.

For the lawmakers and others who’ve led Wyoming’s yearslong effort to become a crypto hub, Kraken’s announcement is a big deal — particularly at a time when other states are beginning to vie for the industry’s business.
“For them [Kraken] to make this step now and kind of recognize and come to Wyoming, I just think it’s a really cool sort of validation of all the work that Wyoming has done,” said Matt Kaufman, a Cheyenne attorney and longtime member of the state’s blockchain committee.
Long-running pursuit
The digital asset space is best known for its volatile cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, and the massive gains and losses that can result from buying and selling them. But advocates, including those in Wyoming, see much broader potential in the underlying blockchain technology.
Blockchains are shared ledgers that allow transactions to be readily verified by all participants and, in theory, make it nearly impossible for the data to be tampered with or altered. Beyond tracking the transfers of digital tokens, supporters see a variety of potential uses ranging from supply chains, to electronic voting to making secure payments at a fraction of the cost of credit cards.
Believing that the technology would bring new jobs and other economic development, Wyoming lawmakers set out to become the home base for the digital asset industry in the same way that South Dakota became the hub for credit card companies. Over the past eight years, state lawmakers dove into the topic and passed over 30 laws related to blockchain technology and digital assets — from setting up a framework for crypto-banks to making clear what happens to customers’ digital assets if a crypto custodian goes bankrupt. 
“When we started, the large financial institutions were shunning digital assets with every fiber of their being. They loathed them,” recalled Wyoming Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie, who co-chairs the Legislature’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation.

But traditional players have since come around: juggernauts like Fidelity and Blackrock now hold billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of their clients; Amazon and Walmart are reportedly mulling the possibility of launching dollar-like cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins in an attempt to save “billions of dollars” in payment fees; and the state of Texas is preparing to buy $10 million worth of bitcoin as an investment.
“A bunch” of the top 10 players in the traditional financial services space are looking to get into crypto, Kraken’s other co-CEO, David Ripley, recently told CNBC. “And we’re having a lot of discussions with them on how we can help them pull that off.”
Incorporating versus arriving
With crypto having its moment in the spotlight, Wyoming leaders are hoping the state’s time has come as well. Steve Lupien, the director of UW’s Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation, noted the state has been working to pave the way for the digital asset industry for a “long time” — since 2017.
“… Sometimes we’ve kind of said, ‘Gee, it shouldn’t be this hard. I wish it would happen faster,’” Lupien said. “But it’s starting to happen now.”
He said “thousands” of entities in the digital asset space have domiciled in Wyoming in recent years. Some, like Cardano blockchain founder Charles Hoskinson, have also built deep connections in the state. Other firms aren’t based here, but have people living and working remotely in the state.
However, in many cases, the only thing “Wyoming” LLCs and more crypto-focused decentralized autonomous organizations, commonly referred to as DAOs, do here is hire a registered agent to serve as their public face and pay the Secretary of State’s Office an initial $100 fee and then $60 annually.
Kaufman has spent 18 years helping people form companies in Wyoming, and he acknowledged that new filings don’t always mean new business in the state.
“But what I would say, in my experience, is one follows the other,” he said.

Many times, Kaufman said, a company that forms some Wyoming LLCs decides to do more, such as make a deal or open an office here. Between the state’s status as a leader for incorporations, a new chancery court dedicated to expeditiously handling business disputes and the ongoing work on digital assets, “it starts to move the needle to where people say, ‘OK, this makes more and more sense, and we’re going to go ahead and move,’” Kaufman said.
“Over time,” he said, “that momentum continues to build.”
What’s in a move?
Digital asset companies tend to be “decentralized,” and Kraken, which has employees in over 70 countries, doesn’t appear to be bringing a huge swath of new workers to Cheyenne.
“In accordance with our remote-first operating model Kraken has historically eschewed large, physical offices,” a company spokesperson told WyoFile.
Kraken, which has significantly reduced its workforce over the past couple of years, had 45 open jobs around the time of the announcement; 42 were fully remote while two were based in Washington, D.C., and one in San Francisco.
A Kraken spokesperson said the company doesn’t disclose how many people it employs in Wyoming, “to protect their privacy and the security of our business.”
However, co-CEO Sethi described the establishment of the headquarters as a “long-term investment” in Wyoming and said he’ll personally be “looking for a place in the Jackson area, because proximity matters.”
Rothfuss said the digital asset industry isn’t one that brings, say, 1,000 manufacturing jobs to one place, but he believes Kraken’s move will mean an increased in-person presence.
“We do know that as that ecosystem builds out, it does create more and more businesses and more and more opportunities that generate real jobs and real work in Wyoming,” Rothfuss added, “and we’ve seen that.”

Kraken is a big fish in the crypto world, ranking as the second-largest exchange in the United States. It generated $1.5 billion in revenue last year and is reportedly taking steps toward going public.
Beyond facilitating the sales of scores of crypto tokens, the company secures digital assets for institutional customers, and began offering traditional stock and ETF trading earlier this year. More recently, Kraken acquired NinjaTrader to offer futures trading and launched a new global payments app.
“We’re building a platform that goes beyond crypto trading — it powers the next era of global finance,” Sethi wrote earlier this year.
Founded in 2011, Kraken is one of the oldest digital asset companies around, and “they’ve just developed an incredibly impressive reputation in the industry,” said Kaufman.
Rothfuss believes Kraken could now be the most valuable company based in Wyoming.
Krakenite culture
Like many tech firms, Kraken was previously based in San Francisco. However, the business shuttered its headquarters there in 2022, citing not only its remote-first approach but also the city’s “out of control” crime, mental illness and drug abuse.
“San Francisco is not safe and will not be safe until we have a [District Attorney] who puts the rights of law abiding citizens above those of the street criminals he so ingloriously protects,” Kraken’s founder and then-CEO, Jesse Powell, said in a statement at the time. 
The DA in question, Chesa Boudin, was later recalled by voters.
Powell is known for his libertarian views, drawing headlines for his sharp criticism of what he sees as “woke” concepts. Amid some internal disagreements over the company’s culture in 2022, he and Kraken released a document outlining its philosophy. It includes a commitment to liberty, due process, personal property rights and limited government.

For instance, Kraken says it: honors workers’ rights to “bodily autonomy,” such as by rejecting vaccine mandates; leaves it up to employees as to whether they want to use their coworkers’ preferred pronouns; hires strictly on merit rather than through “stereotypical team diversity measurements”; and may offer firearm and self-defense training at its corporate retreats.
Kraken cautions prospective employees that its culture may not be the right fit for every potential job applicant, but also emphasizes that “crypto is for everyone.”
“All are welcome to join the revolution,” the document says.
Politics move on-chain
Crypto was born out of a kind of libertarian ethos and a distrust of institutions, from governments to traditional banks. That’s reflected in the very design of blockchains — ledgers that are intended to be “transparent, immutable and resistant to tampering,” as Investopedia puts it.
Those in the space have generally kept politicians and partisan politics at arms’ length. But the conversation about crypto has become more partisan in recent years, following a regulatory “crackdown” by the Biden administration that the industry viewed as unfair and Donald Trump’s pivot from crypto critic to cheerleader and participant.
The industry responded to Trump’s embrace with a flood of campaign contributions. Kraken co-founder Powell gave the president $1 million worth of crypto last summer and the company itself chipped in $1 million to his inaugural committee, alongside other crypto firms and traditional corporate giants like Pfizer, Verizon and Toyota.

Since taking office, Trump has followed through on his promises to make the federal government more crypto-friendly, with his Securities and Exchange Commission dropping suits against and probes of numerous exchanges, including Kraken.
Under the new administration, Kraken also relaunched a staking service, which is a way for customers to receive passive income on their crypto holdings. Biden’s SEC had shut down the service and imposed a $30 million penalty on the company in 2023 — actions that Kraken viewed as “politically motivated.” In March, co-CEO Sethi said he believed Trump had helped “shift crypto from a partisan debate to a shared national interest.”
A polarizing president
But not everyone sees it that way.
Beyond backing the industry, Trump and his family members have launched — and profited from — various crypto ventures over the past year. Trump recently disclosed that he’s earned over $57 million from one of those endeavors. And in May, he hosted a private VIP reception and dinner for those who bought the largest quantities of his $TRUMP memecoin — a move that gave “pause” to even supporters like U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., who’s a leading voice on digital assets.
Concerns about the president’s involvement with crypto were apparently one factor behind Senate Democrats’ early May vote to oppose the GENIUS Act, a Lummis-backed measure that aims to create a regulatory framework for asset-backed cryptocurrencies known as stablecoins. The bill was backed by members from both parties up until the 48-49 vote, largely along party lines.
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat and one of the industry’s harshest critics, told reporters that the bill would put both national security and the broader economy at risk and “supercharge Donald Trump’s corruption.”
Rothfuss compliments the administration’s work to loosen some of the regulations on the industry, but said Trump’s personal projects are “just utterly poisoning the well.”
“It’s now becoming harder for national-level Democrats to support digital assets,” Rothfuss said, “because their constituents are seeing the fraudulent actions of the president, and associating that not just with the president, but with digital assets.”

He’s even been hearing more concerns among Wyoming Democrats about the space. “That’s a headwind that is disappointing to have to deal with.”
(The White House has said the president attended the dinner on his personal time, isn’t involved in the management of his assets and is following federal ethics rules.)
Seeking bipartisanship
Despite the initial setback, the GENIUS Act ultimately cleared the Senate by a 68-30 vote, winning the support of 18 Democrats.
During a late June subcommittee hearing to discuss an overarching market structure for digital assets, Lummis emphasized that she wants to “make sure that we continue to have a bipartisan discussion.”
The veteran lawmaker also said she was unsure why the topic has become more partisan.
“Maybe this is about concern that certain people that have family members in the [Trump] administration are going to be advantaged in some way by what we’re doing,” Lummis said, but “I don’t want that to be the case. I want everybody to be advantaged.”

The Wyoming Legislature has also prided itself on a bipartisan approach. Rothfuss, who’s one of only eight Democrats in the body, and Rep. Daniel Singh, a Cheyenne Republican and member of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, underscored that cooperation in a May op-ed.
“Our collaborative efforts in the Wyoming Legislature, alongside Lummis’ leadership in Washington, show that Republicans and Democrats can navigate complex issues together,” the co-chairs of the state blockchain committee wrote, “crafting policies that protect consumers, foster innovation and strengthen America’s position in the global digital economy.”
Internal and external headwinds
Of course, not everyone is on board. Wyoming’s pursuit of the crypto and digital asset industry has drawn skepticism from all ends of the political spectrum, and some question the whole thing. At a recent blockchain committee meeting, retired geoscientist Kerry Aggen of Buffalo told the panel that, “the term digital asset is an oxymoron: Anything digital does not actually exist in real life.”
The complicated nature of the technology and esoteric nature of some of the legislation are also hurdles. At the same committee meeting, Rep. Lee Filer, R-Cheyenne, said it was tough to explain a set of proposed changes to the state’s crypto-focused banks — Special Purpose Deposition Institutions that are abbreviated as SPDIs or “speedies” — to his colleagues in the House.
“There’s many that just don’t understand it,” said Filer, who runs a bitcoin mining operation. “Eyes were glazed over.”

The industry has also received several black eyes from bad actors, hacks and exploits.
Crypto tends to run in boom-and-bust cycles, and a hyperbolic rise in token prices in 2020 and 2021 was followed by a massive crash — and subsequent implosion of several multi-billion dollar enterprises. That included the crypto exchange FTX and lending platform Celsius, which were revealed to have treated their customers’ deposits like their own play money; the leaders of both platforms are now serving federal prison sentences for fraud.
Rothfuss argues that an outfit like FTX “couldn’t have gotten away with it” here, noting the safeguards in place for SPDIs. Wyoming’s regulations attract good actors and keep bad ones out, he said — unlike other states where companies “can just do as they see fit.”
More crypto competition
The increased interest in digital assets across the country has brought Wyoming more competition for the industry’s attention.
Robert Slater, a director of an SPDI called Commercium Financial, told lawmakers in May that the shift in sentiment has led some potential investors and customers to explore other options in Texas, New York and South Dakota. 
Barriers are also being lifted at the federal level: While Slater expressed continued optimism, he said new FDIC guidance allowing traditional banks to get involved with digital assets — potentially with fewer requirements than a SPDI — makes it “harder to champion the story of ‘why Wyoming.’”
Rothfuss said he and other state leaders long expected that large institutions would resist digital assets “right up until they wanted to make money,” at which point they would try to shut out Wyoming and its SPDIs.
“So nothing we’re seeing is surprising,” he said, “and we’ll keep trying to position ourselves in a leadership role.”
Both Rothfuss and Kaufman believe the state remains ahead of the pack, thanks to its years of work on the nitty-gritty details. In Kraken’s announcement of its new Cheyenne headquarters, Lummis said the move reinforced Wyoming’s position as “America’s premier crypto hub.”
Cody Carbone, the CEO of The Digital Chamber, indicated there are similar opinions among the more than 200 blockchain companies that his D.C.-based organization represents.
“Yes, everyone is very bullish on Wyoming,” Carbone said in an email. “It’s still viewed as the foundational jurisdiction for crypto regulation.”

That could change, he said, but Wyoming is “very attractive” to crypto companies that rely on remote work and want to leverage the state’s reputation, regulatory framework and tax incentives.
“I think Wyoming will always be successful,” Carbone said, “because the State is nimble enough to continuously innovate.”
The limits of small multitudes
Wyoming does, however, remain limited in its ability to recruit businesses by having the smallest population in the union.
The country’s largest crypto exchange, Coinbase, also nixed its San Francisco headquarters in 2021. However, as Kraken decided to anchor itself in Cheyenne, Coinbase reestablished itself in the Bay Area city by leasing a massive, 150,000-square-foot office space.
Asked why the company would set up shop in tax-heavy California, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said many of their employees live there.
“We go to where the talent is,” Armstrong wrote on X.
His comment would seem to fit with Wyoming Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell’s experience — that companies care more about a vibrant workforce than low taxes.
“I have worked with and for countless companies that have very seriously looked at wanting to come to Wyoming, and they want to be here,” Kaufman said, “but when the rubber meets the road, it’s like, ‘Gosh, there’s not a good option for a place to put 100 people — and we don’t know that the labor force is there for us to hire 100 people as quickly as we need.’” 
While frustrating, “it is what it is,” he said, “and that’s why … I think we have to expect wins over time.”
Lupien, however, is quick to argue that Wyoming has a lot to offer to the digital asset industry, even when it comes to the workforce. UW is one of the only Division I universities in the country offering a minor in blockchain — about 120 students go through the program each year — and he burnished the programs offered by the College of Engineering and School of Computing.
Lupien also heralded Wyoming’s quality of life, saying the more time people spend in the state, the more they come to appreciate it.

When George Ochenski warns that conservation groups sometimes trade their spines for a seat at the table, he taps into a frustration every public-lands hunter knows: Deals can slide from compromise to concession in a hurry. Yet his July 4 column paints Backcountry Hunters & Anglers with a brush so broad it obscures the facts.
One week before the column ran, the U.S. Department of Agriculture erased the 2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule and exposed 58 million acres of undeveloped forest to new roads and logging. Within hours BHA blasted the decision as “a blatant rejection of 24 years of bipartisan stewardship,” urged Congress to restore the rule, and asked its 40,000 members to mobilize during the public-comment period. That is not silence; it is the opening salvo of a fight that will last well beyond this news cycle.
Nor is the rollback an isolated case.
In 2022 BHA’s Montana chapter sued the Forest Service when the agency tried to cede public-access easements in the Crazy Mountains—litigation funded largely by small donors and squarely opposed by local timber interests. Idaho members recently flooded congressional offices with calls that helped stall a bill to sell public land to private developers. Grass-roots lawyering and lobbying are hard to square with the notion of a compromised collaborator.
So what about “collaboration?”
After catastrophic fire seasons, some cross-boundary thinning is biologically defensible; some is not. The difference lies in the details, which is why BHA publishes comment guides that prod hunters and anglers to demand site-specific science, cumulative-effects analysis, and intact wildlife-security zones before a chainsaw or dozer fires up. That posture forces both agencies and industry to earn public consent.
Ochenski also resurrects a 2011 congressional rider that delisted wolves in the Northern Rockies. BHA had no national staff in 2011. Today its wildlife policy states that management decisions must be grounded in science and executed through administrative processes, not legislative shortcuts. In practice that stance has meant opposing Idaho’s wolf-bounty program, challenging predator-killing bills in Alaska, and supporting balanced harvest quotas in Colorado.
Claims that BHA is driven by “foundation millions” likewise miss the mark. Audited financials show that 78 percent of its $9.2 million Fiscal Year 2023 budget went directly to program work; individual memberships and grass-roots events, not foundation grants, generated the largest share of revenue. Transparency doesn’t guarantee perfect decisions, but it makes it hard to hide a sell-out.
None of this is to deny that collaboration can be abused. When process becomes product, industry actors can dilute conservation outcomes. But collaboration can also lock in gains otherwise stalled by litigation or partisanship—the Rocky Mountain Front Heritage Act and the North Fork Protection Act both moved because unlikely allies hammered out durable terms. BHA backed each deal because it expanded habitat and public access, not because it was fashionable in philanthropic circles.
The lesson is simple: Conservation victories require coalitions that stretch beyond any single demographic—hunters, anglers, Tribal communities, recreationists, and even commodity producers willing to meet halfway. The alternative is fractured interest groups firing from ideological redoubts while intact habitat erodes in real time.
Ochenski’s anger at backsliding agencies is justified; his broadside against fellow conservationists is not. Backcountry Hunters & Anglers stands ready to fight for roadless areas, science-based wildlife management, and transparent public processes—precisely the values he champions. By all means hold the group accountable, but let’s argue on evidence, not assumption. The stakes—clean water, healthy wildlife populations, and the freedom to roam Montana’s wildest country—are too high for friendly fire.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
Indiana stands to lose about $100 million. The Indiana Department of Education has been mum except for saying in a weekly newsletter that additional information “will be shared with schools as we know more about these allocations.”
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

In a statement announcing the pause to states, the U.S. Department of Education said “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.

“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Photo courtesy Wisconsin State Senate Democratic Committee)With the Wisconsin state budget completed just last week, Senate Democrats are gearing up for 2026 elections and their shot at a majority. Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon), surrounded by a group of current Democratic senators, launched her campaign Monday for Senate District 17, currently represented by one of the Senate Republicans central to shaping Wisconsin’s budget. 
There are about 16 months until November 2026 when half of the state Senate, the entire state Assembly and the governor’s seat will all be up for election. This will be the first time the new legislative maps adopted in 2024 will be in place for the 17 odd-numbered Senate seats.
Democrats gained four seats in the Senate in 2024 — breaking the GOP supermajority and leaving Senate Republicans with a margin of 18-15 majority. They will need to win at least three seats if they are to win the majority for the first time in more than 15 years.
Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), the co-chair of the powerful budget committee, is the incumbent, having first been elected to the seat in 2014 after serving two terms in the Assembly. 
Lisa White, a Democrat who runs an interior painting business, is also running for the seat.
Jacobson, who is serving her second term in the Assembly, told the Wisconsin Examiner that she is challenging Marklein in part because he hasn’t been listening. 
Marklein won the district with 60% of the vote in 2022, but Senate District 17 changed considerably under the new maps. According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the district leaned Democrat by 1 percentage point in the 2024 presidential election and by over 4 percentage points in the 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
“The biggest thing that I see about this district is that people really want somebody who’s going to represent what they’re fighting for, what they need and listen to them, and even listen to them when they don’t necessarily agree,” Jacobson said. “They’ve been not receiving that in their current state senator.” 
Jacobson cited a report in the Monroe Times of a Marklein listening session in Belleville in January — coincidentally on the same day that Jacobson was holding one there. 
“There was a list of rules of what would and will not be happening in that listening session,” Jacobson said. “That, to me, is the starkest example of what it means to listen to your community, because I was inviting anybody… there are no rules. I’m open to having a conversation with anybody at any time.”
Marklein’s notice told residents that it was “designed for the senator to receive input and ideas about issues facing residents in the 17th Senate District” and he didn’t “plan to answer questions, debate ideas, challenge the ideas, or otherwise comment because he is seeking to hear every point-of-view equally.” The notice said that “the goal is for every attendee to feel comfortable sharing their input.” It also advised those attending that  their comments might be subject to a time limit. 
Jacobson launched her campaign outside an elementary school in Ridgeway that was closed after the Dodgeville school district combined two elementary schools into one. She called Marklein a “classic politician” who she said has “failed” the Senate district. 
“Our district has time and again been forced into referenda to fund our schools because Howard Marklein has chosen power over people,” Jacobson said. “He has chosen ideology over voting for the needs of the district. That is irresponsible governing.” 
Jacobson first ran for the state Assembly for an open seat in 2021 and said her service on the Oregon village board showed her how local government intersects with state government and why it’s important to shape the latter.
Her announcement came less than a week after lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers completed the state budget. The Republicans’ narrower Senate majority led to a new dynamic during the budget process. With Democratic votes necessary to pass the bill, Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton) became involved in budget negotiations.
Hesselbein joined Jacobson at her campaign announcement Monday, along with Sens. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit), Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee) and Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska). 
Jacobson has been fighting for public school funding, Hesselbein said. “In the Senate, she will dedicate herself to lowering costs for your families, to creating a bright future for your children, and making our state stronger every day,” Hesselbein said. “We are excited and proud to be standing behind her in this campaign and we look forward to her joining us and helping us win a Democratic majority.”
Jacobson voted against the budget, joining 37 other Assembly Democrats.
Democrats credited the new maps and the Senate’s closer margins for the budget agreement, which included an increase in funding for special education, the University of Wisconsin system and child care. The bill passed thanks to five Senate Democratic votes, although a recurring theme among Democrats whether they voted for or against the budget, including Jacobson, was that it wasn’t perfect. 
Jacobson said that was part of the reason she launched her campaign. 
“I was hoping under these new maps — with even more voices talking so loudly about the fact that they need state assistance when it comes to affording child care, they need more funding for our schools, they need real help on the everyday costs that are facing Wisconsinites — that under this new more competitive district that would be represented in the state budget,” she said. “What we’re seeing is that the cycle of referendums is not going to end under this budget… and that was a missed opportunity in this budget.” 
During the final discussions over the budget, Marklein emphasized that the document was a “compromise” between Republicans and Democrats while highlighting items affecting his district, such as funding for the UW system that would help the Platteville campus. Marklein did not respond to an email from the Wisconsin Examiner on Monday asking about his 2026 plans and his response to Democrats targeting SD 17.
Jacobson said she doesn’t view Marklein’s long tenure as a state lawmaker as a challenge. She said she is more concerned with the size of the Southwest Wisconsin Senate district, which encompasses Iowa, Lafayette, Green, Crawford and Grant counties as well as parts of Dane County.
“It’s a big district, but the benefit of that is that it’s filled with these amazing rural communities that when people think about Wisconsin that’s what they think of…,” Jacobson said. “Sure [Sen. Marklein has] been an incumbent for a while, but has he been out? How much is he doing outside of walking a parade to really listen to the district?” 
Jacobson, a mother of three children, said public education funding will be one of her top issues, though she is also more concerned about hearing from others. She said she has been traveling the district over the last few weeks and hearing an array of concerns from residents.
“They’re concerned that they’re going to have to have more referenda because of the lack of school funding to increase their property taxes even more,” Jacobson said. “They’re concerned that without meaningful work or support from the state — our health care system in that area… seven hospitals… multiple clinics — those are going to potentially be in jeopardy.”

As Southwest District Health plans buildings and finance needs for the future, the regional public health district is asking the public to weigh in.
An anonymous survey, available online in English and Spanish, is open throughout the summer to people who live in the district. The public health district includes six counties in southwestern Idaho: Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties.
But more public input opportunities are expected throughout the planning process.
“We want to ensure our services, facilities and financial planning reflect the needs of our communities,” Southwest District Health Director Nikole Zogg said in a statement. “This process is about making strategic decisions that are informed and supported by the communities we serve and shaping the future of public health services in Southwest Idaho.”
The health district expects to present the new master facility plan in early 2026, which will include evaluations of the district’s existing facilities, utilization and areas for improvement, Southwest District Health announced in a news release on Monday. That plan will consider potentially relocating or expanding facilities, and how to address barriers to accessing services, such as from transportation or technology. 
Find more information about Southwest District Health’s planning process online, at swdh.id.gov/about/master-facilities-plan. The health district is working with Clearwater Financial as a planning partner.

Faith Howard’s literacy lab classes helped older students make huge comprehension gains. Now she is working to spread the teaching method across Wyoming, where literacy has been a concern for years.
The post This Pinedale teacher’s approach is helping high school students fill reading gaps appeared first on WyoFile .","In her Pinedale High School literacy lab classroom, Faith Howard prompted her students to decipher an excerpt from the criminal justice memoir “Just Mercy.”
Howard, blonde and energetic in that caffeinated way of teachers, encouraged them to decode words by breaking them into segments and blending the sounds. She had them search for instances of the “bossy R” or “vowel teams,” focus on what prefixes and suffixes could tell them about the words and keep an eye out for other morphemes — like Greek or Latin roots — that could hint at meaning. 
Howard identified one particularly tricky word for them to study. One of her students, a freshman girl with a thick braid who is on an individualized education plan for special learning needs, examined it before attempting to pronounce it. She was quiet and hesitant, but correct.
“Is it coerced?” another student called out loudly.
“Yes,” Howard responded. “Coerced. Repeat it after me.” 
They all did so, this time without hesitation. 
Later, they read the text aloud, confidently pronouncing words like “incarcerated,” “redacted,” and, once again, “coerced.”
A casual observer wouldn’t pin the students as struggling readers — and that’s evidence Howard’s approach to literacy is working. 
When Howard was hired to help improve literacy in Pinedale high schools three years ago, she said, the nut she had to crack was this: How could she help struggling older readers without insulting their intelligence with literacy material designed for 5-year-olds?
Howard started from scratch. She developed her own curriculum based on the science of reading — an evidence-based body of knowledge on effective literacy instruction — and called her class “literacy lab.”
She incorporated fluency, comprehension, vocabulary and writing — but in the context of current events, more complicated language and the kinds of topics that engage high schoolers.

And in just two years, Pinedale High School saw a 79% drop in students reading below basic, and a 55% increase in those reaching proficient or advanced.
“It is proving to be really valuable,” Howard said. 
In a state with nagging literacy concerns as proficiency scores tick downward, Howard hopes to share her insights with other Wyoming educators. 
“I’ve kind of made it my mission,” she said, “really trying to crack the code on: What can we do so that we’re not graduating kids from high school who really don’t have the tools to be successful, even if they don’t go to college?”
A second teaching education 
Howard spent 16 years as a high school English teacher, assigning reading texts, grading essays and instructing on writing skills. Her family moved to Wyoming from  Colorado six years ago when she took a teaching job in Big Piney. Three years later, she was hired as a literacy specialist in Pinedale, where Sublette County School District 1 obtained federal grant money through the state to improve literacy scores. 
Pinedale High School students had historically tested well in reading compared to the rest of the state, she said. But in 2021, nearly 30% of 9th graders were reading below basic proficiency in standardized testing. Howard was enlisted to help turn that trend around. 
And that is where her second education began. As an English teacher, she said, she specialized in general classroom instruction, rather than the skills needed to teach students how to read.
“Secondary education teaching programs and teachers in general, for older students, are not taught any of this,” she said. 
At first, she worked with individual students who struggled. She realized, however, it wasn’t enough to just help students complete writing homework or study for English tests. 
“If I’m just helping them pass classes to graduate, we haven’t actually addressed the underlying issue,” Howard said. “So that’s when I said, ‘I need more training.’”

That included several sessions with the Institute for Multi-Sensory Education, which offers instruction on the science of reading through courses like morphology — the study of word structure — and phonological awareness, which has to do with spoken sentences.
Howard leaned into training, and learned the intricacies of literacy. She also realized that she faced a challenge. While literacy instruction for struggling readers is generally aimed at young children, many kids, she said, mask their problems and slip through the cracks.
To present older kids with rudimentary instruction designed for small children, Howard knew, wouldn’t work.
So she started working with small student groups and marrying morphology and reading fluency. “And immediately saw an uptick and success,” she said. “And that was only a piece of the pie.”
Howard expanded that with comprehension, writing and discussion. Her literacy lab class was born. 
Opting in 
“I’m basically doing targeted instruction to fill in the gaps of what students missed from elementary school without putting them in front of like, baby books,” Howard said in summarizing the class. As the students gain foundational tools, they also talk about current events, learn the meaning of complicated words and examine age-appropriate texts. 
The class is an elective. Students who qualify for literacy services or who have other indicators of reading challenges are invited. It can be a hard sell, she said, particularly as kids have to be willing to give up something like art or PE to take it. 
But within a year of the lab’s launch, the data began to confirm its success; today, the school’s “below basic” scores have plummeted to single digits. That has helped sway students and parents. Some kids, she said, even choose to remain in the literacy lab after they meet the exit criteria. 
Sublette County School District 1 Curriculum Director Greg Legerski oversaw the literacy grant and worked closely with Howard. The district had to pivot significantly to address literacy, he said. “Faith really embraced that challenge.”
Howard’s receptivity to learning and adapting is unique, Legerski said. 
“She really had an immense thirst for professional growth,” he said. “She was continually seeking out opportunities and refining her craft. She always wanted to grow as an educator.”

When she learned something new, Legerski said, she would seek feedback to check her work, and happily share her knowledge with others. The impact has been remarkable, he said.
“She took that current research and really transformed it into something that’s practical, impactful and really changing the lives of students within the classroom,” he said. “She’s done an outstanding job.”
Literacy landscape 
It’s not news that Wyoming reading scores have ticked down in recent years. In 2024, 36% of fourth graders and 29% of eighth graders performed at or above the proficient level in reading on national standardized NAEP tests, lower than the previous five years. 
Some 32% of Wyoming fourth graders performed below basic, which was a slight increase from 29% in 2022. For eighth graders, 30% scored below basic in 2024, up one percentage point from 2022. 
Wyoming’s scores hovered above the rest of the country; the state has long ranked comparatively high in national testing. But literacy challenges are widespread, Howard noted. 
“People across the country have been struggling with the same things,” she said. “We’re getting kids in middle and high schools that really do not know how to read very well, and they’re missing all of these core components from elementary school, those foundational reading skills.”

Thanks to reporting from journalists like Emily Hanford, awareness of widespread reading instruction failures has also grown. Hanford’s podcast “Sold a Story” exposed how educators across the country believed they were teaching a best-practice approach to reading that was later disproven.
The results Howard has seen in Pinedale, she said, are evidence that with the right method, even those students who slipped through for years can gain the crucial skills. Educational band-aids will just fail kids, she said. 
“If you don’t address the underlying issue, it’s always going to be there, and the gap is just going to widen even more because the text levels get more and more difficult,” she said. 
“It’s a good time to be in this work,” she said, “because you can have such a huge impact if you’re able to find something that works.”
More alarm bells 
The Legislature’s Joint Education Committee has made K-3 literacy a priority topic for the interim, or off-season, for six years running. 
In May, a group of mothers attended the committee’s Casper meeting to urge it to act in a meaningful way. Their testimonies illuminated how kids here end up lacking literacy tools well into their school years. 
Annie McGlothlin’s son went through nearly three years of school before his dyslexia was identified, she said, and it’s been an ongoing struggle to fight for the right interventions. It’s time for Wyoming to overhaul literacy to reflect the science of reading in a way that’s uniform and rigorous, she said.
Chandel Pine’s son, Paul, struggled in school starting from day one, she testified. He repeated kindergarten, received reading interventions and was diagnosed with ADHD, and was behind his peers for most of his life, she said. Despite the challenges, her son presented as an OK reader and passed subsequent grades.
It wasn’t until fifth grade that the scope of his reading deficiency was identified, she said, and that was after she specifically requested an IEP. 
“He was in the third percentile in reading for his age,” she said. Paul committed suicide that year in school. 
The women urged lawmakers to mandate early and ongoing dyslexia screening for grades K-12 and strengthen teacher training and certifications for literacy interventions, among other things.

A challenge, committee members said, is trying to impose a statewide system on Wyoming districts, which have broad local autonomy. 
Still, Sen. Charles Scott, R-Casper, proposed a bill to amend Wyoming statute provisions related to identifying and addressing struggling students. His bill would sharpen definitions, mandate better tracking and create an avenue for parents to appeal to the Wyoming superintendent of public instruction. The bill would also create a small statewide team of staff to focus on literacy needs. The committee voted to advance the draft.
Organic expansion
Howard will expand her labs into the Pinedale Middle School next year. She is also intent on sharing what she’s learned with other educators. 
“It’s just a total passion project for me, and something that I’m trying to get the word out about because I do think that there are other districts and other states that are looking for answers,” Howard said. “I don’t have all the answers, but I think I’ve figured out a few things that could really help kids in other places too.”
She has presented at Wyoming’s literacy conference for three years, led virtual trainings and sits on the leadership committee for a group of Wyoming educators who are looking to learn more about literacy. She also welcomes educators to visit and observe her labs.
For other districts looking to pursue a similar program, Curriculum Director Legerski said, it’s doable. It just takes prioritizing literacy by hiring specialists or finding the right teacher who is willing to receive additional training. 
“It’s really scalable, across many schools,” he said.

Wyoming doesn’t need more voter registration laws just because the secretary of state claims our system is in need of a fix, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Can we stop pretending that ‘election integrity’ was ever a real problem?   appeared first on WyoFile .","Restoring “election integrity” is the issue that keeps on winning for Wyoming Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the Republican Party.

Opinion

It’s a cynical political game that exists not to solve a real problem, but serves to stir up Gray’s base of extremist voters and boost his overall popularity for his long-rumored run for the governor’s office next year.
Now, the U.S. Department of Justice and red states that want to intervene on Gray’s behalf in a federal lawsuit are playing into that scenario by supposedly confirming that Wyomingites are justified in thinking the state’s election system is vulnerable to voter fraud and noncitizens voting.
The Equality State Policy Center, a voting-rights group, sued Gray and the state’s 23 county clerks in May over the constitutionality of that new law requiring proof from those registering to vote that they are United States citizens who have lived in Wyoming for at least 30 days.
U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl has since ruled that county officials are nominal parties who will technically remain a part of the case but have no responsibilities.
Wyoming’s county clerks do a remarkably effective job running our elections and are not responsible for the potentially harmful changes Gray and the GOP-led Legislature made to the state’s election statutes. 


County clerks try to ensure every qualified voter can participate in federal, state and local elections. Republican Party officials across the country have done just the opposite, because the higher the vote totals, the less likely their party will win. 
In its filing, the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said the federal court should “maintain the long-held position that preventing voter fraud and safeguarding voter confidence are legitimate state interests.”
Of course, it should. But Wyoming had election integrity long before Gray and the far-right Freedom Caucus proposed the new voter registration requirements.
According to the conservative think-tank Heritage Foundation’s database, Wyoming has had only four voter fraud convictions in the past quarter century — and the criminals were all Republicans. Gray has repeatedly charged voter fraud here is more of an issue than the numbers show, which should damage his credibility. Unfortunately, what he claims is accepted as the truth by many voters. 
No restoration of Wyoming’s election integrity is needed, especially from ideologues trying to win favor from President Donald Trump, who still claims he was the victim of a “rigged” 2020 election despite mountains of evidence to the contrary.
In a University of Wyoming survey conducted before the November 2024 election, nearly 90% of Wyoming adults said they expected their county’s tally of ballots for president to be very or somewhat reliable. Voter confidence in our elections is not a problem state law needs to address.
There is little evidence that non-citizens are attempting to vote in Wyoming elections, which was already a crime. This is a textbook case of a solution in search of a problem.
Gray indicated in many instances, but not all, a valid driver’s license will suffice for proof of identity, residency and U.S. citizenship as long as they list a Wyoming address. 
But the suit identifies subsets of the population — including young, low-income, already underrepresented voters, domestic abuse and sexual assault survivors, and women who changed their names after marriage — who will likely discover that obtaining the proper documentation means navigating “a labyrinth of bureaucracy,” all with costs and delays as election day nears. 
If people who want to vote begin their search too late, or become frustrated with the amount of time and money it takes, they may scrap the whole process and be disenfranchised altogether. That’s hardly the desired outcome in a democratic republic that values individual voter rights.

A huge chunk of the MAGA universe wants to help defend the handiwork of Gray and the bill’s Freedom Caucus sponsor, Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, against the liberal elites and “Republicans in name only” who want it thrown out.
The Republican National Committee maintained in its filing that as elected officials Gray and the county clerks represent the public interest, but don’t adequately represent the GOP’s “inherently partisan” interests. Therefore, the party argues, it should be allowed to intervene in the suit.
Why? Because if the court rules against the new law the party “would need to divert resources from other mission-critical activities towards get-out-the-vote activities to reinsure Republican voter trust in Wyoming’s electoral system.”
Sure, federal courts always prioritize keeping a political party’s “mission-critical activities” on course. How can the RNC keep its budget straight if it first spends money to scare the bejesus out of voters telling them noncitizens are stealing elections, and then has to waste even more dough trying to convince its own members that it really is safe to vote?
Meanwhile, 25 red states and Guam, a U.S. territory, have filed an amicus brief that urges the court to deny the plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The brief claims the ESPC hasn’t identified “an actual, real-life individual who is eligible and wishes to become a Wyoming voter but cannot feasibly prove his or her citizenship.”
The cold is pushing most to huddle inside, but hasn’t kept away voters from Spring Creek School in Laramie where wait times to vote have held steady at around an hour. (Mike Vanata/WyoFile)
I find the ESPC’s response to the brief more compelling: “[While] all states may posture during legislative sessions (or in amicus briefs) about the specter of non-citizen voting, the fact remains that there is no evidence that it is an actual problem — in Wyoming or anywhere else — and the amici tellingly point to none.”
I think the court should take into consideration Gov. Mark Gordon’s reasoning in letting the Gray/Bear collaboration become law without his signature. The governor didn’t use this phrase, but it’s what he probably meant: It’s downright goofy.
Gordon wrote that the law instructs county clerks to accept a prospective voter’s proof of citizenship so long as it doesn’t contain “any indication” that the person isn’t a U.S. citizen.
“This standard may be difficult for clerks to administer, as it is unclear and perhaps awkward for our county clerks to consistently apply with any degree of certainty,” he concluded.
The lawsuit said the law should be “void for vagueness” because it “both fails to allow persons of ordinary intelligence to anticipate how the law will be enforced and invites arbitrary enforcement.”
All true. Gray and Bear obviously had many months to produce a bill that would pass constitutional muster. If this ambiguous concoction is the best they can do to solve a supposedly major problem, why shouldn’t a judge tell them it’s a failure?

Tucked away in the back of the Hayden Super 1 Shopping Center is The Village Bakery. Its four-year presence has been a rock of strength and acceptance for the special needs community, providing meaningful employment and hands-on training.
“We are more of a school and teaching, not only baking skills, but also life skills that our special needs workers will be able to take with them on their journey,” Dana Bellefeuille said. She and her husband, Todd, a Spokane Valley firefighter, own the North Idaho business, which is much more than a place to buy eats and treats.
“It’s not just a bakery. It’s a bakery with a purpose,” Todd Bellefeuille said.
And that purpose hits close to home and touches their hearts deeply. Dana Bellefeuille herself struggled with dyslexia growing up. She and her husband raised a son and daughter with special needs who are living well in the area.
 Navigating the real world 

The Village Bakery’s mission of “transforming lives by empowering the special needs community” is a critical one for the success of this population, which often faces barriers entering the workforce and then significant hurdles retaining jobs.

According to 2024 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over 70 million U.S. adults across the country have a disability, which is approximately one in four adults.
“We are talking about humans here, and a lot of them are on the autism spectrum,” Dana Bellefeuille explained. “We find out what do they want to do in life, what skills they want to work on and what they are drawn to in the bakery. Basically, what really lights their fire! It’s fun.”
 Keeping the doors open

When asked how she got into the bakery business, Dana Bellefeuille smiled.
“It’s Todd’s fault. He got this brilliant idea when our babies were little that we could make a wedding cake for his sister,” she said. “I was hooked from that moment.” The rest is history.
The Village Bakery is surviving financially and thriving in its mission, but it “hasn’t been an easy journey” since they were handed the keys, they said. Neither of them takes a salary.
“The bakery industry is one of the hardest to keep open. Most of them fail in the first few years,” Todd Bellefeuille said.
His wife agreed and shared their challenges.
“Being open for four years now is stellar, [and] we have been able to pay all the bills, but [we’re] barely skating by,” Dana Bellefeuille added.
 Creating a culture of care and value

Dana Bellefeuille oversees the daily operations and keeps the storefront doors open with 25 paid employees and countless volunteers by her side. She said approximately 90% of her workers have special needs and disabilities.
Six days a week The Village Bakery welcomes employees, volunteers and customers to its doors for a dose of humanity, kindness and lots of smiles — acceptance and inclusion are its pillars of pride.
“I want people to be who they are here. Explore, not be afraid, feel welcomed,” she said. “There are not a lot of places in the world like this, but I’m hoping we can change that.”
She also wants to inspire and offer opportunities.
“We want to be that example of what can be. We have over 50,000 TikTok followers,” Dana Bellefeuille said. “We want to show parents what is possible — that there are places across the United States that will love and honor your child for who they are, and they will be part of something.”
 Saving a life

Abigail Foster, a full-time volunteer at the bakery, can be described as Dana Bellefeuille’s key person. Foster has been by her side for about eight years now.
“I’ve worked here since the beginning,” Foster said. “I have been with Dana before the name was even chosen. I took her classes (in Dana Bellefeuille’s home), and that is how I really got to know her.”

“I lured her in with cupcakes,” Dana Bellefeuille said.
Foster is a veteran and was medically discharged due to spine injuries. Meeting Dana Bellefeuille saved her life, Foster said.
“My life wasn’t going the way I wanted it to go. My spine is fusing into one piece. This mentally destroyed me. I was in a super, super dark place. It was just somewhere I didn’t want to be,” Foster said. “I was ready to jump off wherever I needed to jump off to go away. But I didn’t because of her.”
Foster continues to struggle with her depression, but Dana Bellefeuille is there each day with support.
“She always tells me, ‘You just need to come to work. It melts away the worries. Come here for the smell, laughs and smiles.’”
 Her heart goes beyond the bakery

Dana Bellefeuille shared a story of a young man that came to her looking for a job.
“I was completely booked with people and didn’t have a job for him. But we sat down and had a meal and had a human-to-human conversation,” she said. “I thanked him for coming in. I told him I would let him know if anything opened up.”
A week later his grandparents stopped by, and they were crying. She asked how she could help. They thanked her for not hiring their grandson, explaining, however, that her talk with him had helped him feel valued and built up his courage. So the following week he went out and got a job at a pizza restaurant that he loves.
“That is what I want to do for everybody here — show them that they are valued, they are loved and they are needed in this world. And they have a place in society,” Dana Bellefeuille said.
 Keeping positive momentum

As the story of The Village Bakery unfolds, the lives it continues to touch keep stacking up, much like the layers on one of her client-ordered cakes with its ornate designs, decorative frosting and mouth-pleasing flavors.
“Having the storefront here has saved multiple lives,” Dana Bellefeuille said.
She shared she firmly believes in the power of God and is a Christian.
“It has been incredible to watch people saved either physically from a physical problem or their emotional state by helping them find Jesus and peace through that process,” she said.
Dana Bellefeuille knows where she belongs, and it feeds her soul as well as others. She is grateful and humbled.
“It is incredible being in this space. I don’t want to be anywhere else,” she said. “I get a front row seat to watch miracles happen every day.”

In small-town Wyoming, more people are taking to Pine Street to wave American flags and signs in support of constitutional rights and shared wide open spaces, Joy Ufford explains. 
The post Pinedale’s grassroots grow along with opposition to selling public lands  appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—A dozen “Honk for Public Lands” signs brought almost 300 enthusiastic responses from drivers (and bikers) traveling through and around Pinedale, including a number of license plates with the 23 prefix for Sublette County. Signs also telegraphed fears that Wyoming’s Congressional Delegation — Rep. Harriet Hageman and U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis — would “sell out” their constituents.

Opinion

After my unexpected retirement from Wyoming Newspapers 16 months ago, I was eventually invited to participate in local rallies to advocate for constitutional rights — freedom of speech and freedom of the press — and veterans, seniors and families. My journalistic ethics required me to remain on the sidelines, uninvolved (yet free to ask questions). So when I made the decision to participate in speaking out as a private citizen, I did not make it lightly.
After decades as a Sublette County and Wyoming journalist, I still report occasionally for the Pinedale Roundup. I absorbed and melded journalistic ethics with my personal morals, a tendency to question authority and the Golden Rule. 
So being a journalist will likely always shape my eye, heart and mind as a private citizen. I want to ask questions to better understand how my community, friends, neighbors and family (and I) will be affected by policy decisions, at any level of government. I also want to chronicle events with photographs.
On June 28, I didn’t pick up a sign to carry at the rally. Instead, I put on my Wyoming Press Association pass, carried my camera, notebook and pen and identified myself as a reporter. Reporters are scarce in small-town Wyoming. I wanted to capture people’s thoughts at my grass-roots level amid the national uproar over Utah Sen. Mike Lee’s plan to sell off public lands to offset the costs of tax cuts. Here’s what I learned during that June 28 rally from the 50-plus rally goers crowding Pinedale’s main street — Pine Street — waving flags and signs with slogans demanding public lands stay public.

Many described directly contacting Hageman, Barrasso and Lummis to call on them to oppose public land sales and receiving responses benignly accepting Lee’s proposal.
Which public lands are most important to them? “All of them.”
The lack of details, maps and a path for public inclusion bothered Pinedale activist Karla Bird enough to make a presentation to Sublette County elected officials, who sent a letter to the congressional delegation.
Bird first started rallying in February on Pinedale’s main street to register her concerns about the Trump administration. The small weekly gatherings grew, from sometimes drawing just two people to bigger crowds like the 50-plus who showed up June 28. By then, Lee’s proposal had been scaled back, calling for selling off public lands overseen by the Bureau of Land Management within five miles of population centers. 
“Even if Lee only targets the BLM, there are migration corridors that we should have a say in,” Bird said at that rally.
Lee withdrew his plan later that same night, a surrender attributed to widespread, grassroots and bipartisan opposition.
At the June 28 rally, a car pulled up to the sidewalk and a small, fragile woman emerged from the passenger’s seat. Juanita Bertoncelj held out her “sign,” a notebook page with the message that Wyoming’s wild horses, which could be removed soon in BLM roundups, live on public lands.

Likewise, other rally goers worried selling off public lands could harm Sublette County’s wildlife migration corridors and habitat, recreation, solitude, future access and Wyoming way of life.
Sublette County resident Dan Stroud spent much of his career, including three decades with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, working to preserve wildlife habitat. 
“Public lands are imperative for our wildlife’s future,” said Stroud, who has come to the public lands rallies. “They provide summer range, winter range, migration corridors, at least here.”
Summer interns Hannah Peters from Massachusetts and Chloe Smith from Colorado are working on a wildlife research project on BLM land.
“So we have a very personal interest in wildlife,” said Peters, holding a sign that said “Protect Our Public Lands.” 
Smith added: “We wouldn’t want to see public lands privatized and lose access for the people who live here and vacation here.” 
Eric Jahn-Clough, of Maine, came to the rally with a local friend. 
“I’ve come out here to go hiking and fishing for more than 20 years,” Jahn-Clough said. “I’ve spent over 600 nights in the Wind Rivers. I was just in Dinosaur National Monument hiking extensively there and in the Wind Rivers, and I fish in public sections of all these rivers.”
His next camping destination — the Big Sandy.
A Forest Service employee, who asked that his name not be used for fear of retaliation, stressed that Pinedale, Sublette County and Wyoming would not have as much of a draw without public lands, mountains, forests and rivers. 
“Most of the really big things that have happened to me and changed my life were not sitting in my apartment,” he said. “They were experiences I had on the public lands.”
With the fate of 7,000 Forest Service jobs in judicial limbo, fellow employees are cautious, he said. “They’re probably not going to come out and hold a sign on the street, but they are here,” he said.

The June 28 public lands rally was the first in a series of weekly gatherings in Pinedale to be publicly advertised with flyers. (Joy Ufford)
This grassroots rally was the first to be publicly advertised with flyers printed up and posted by activists Bird and Jocelyn Slack with the Women’s Advocacy Group. They and others started DOGE protests, now termed “rallies.” Citizens, federal employees and students — worried about what policies and changes from the Trump administration, Elon Musk and DOGE would affect them — began asking how to participate.
A larger local group coalesced from the initial smaller protests. However, fears of confrontations and retribution from Trump supporters kept publicity at a simmer. Until June, word of mouth and Pinedale activist Kelly Ravner’s growing email list of supporters kept the group feeling safe, but constrained. 
For “No Kings Day” on June 14, social media messaging brought 63 people, young and old, new and usual, to carry American flags and signs. Although hecklers interrupted the event, there were no hints of violence. Ravner congratulated supporters, writing: “Wow! Pinedale really knocked it out of the park on Saturday [June 14]. I was hoping for a good turnout but you exceeded all expectations!”
She noted “no specific plans for the next rally.”
Then the national furor erupted over the proposed public land sales and the Pinedale group decided to make that issue its primary focus for June 21 and again on June 28.
Almost 80 people attended the June 21 rally.
Ravner uses clicker-counters to estimate vehicles traveling in both directions with another person clicking waves, thumbs up and horn honks. On June 21, the positive “approval rating” roughly averaged out to 4 to 10%, of all passing vehicles with plenty of County 23 plates. On June 28, the “approval rating” hovered around 30%.
Karl Kuhn and Jennifer Hockenbery, visiting from eastern Wisconsin, were thrilled to see the June 28 flyer posted in a Pinedale restaurant. They spent five days fishing and camping in the Wyoming Range and hiked from the Pole Creek trailhead. After the rally they planned to explore Half Moon Lake. All on public lands. 
So Kuhn borrowed an extra handmade sign and Hockenbery scrawled her own message to protect public lands on a brown paper bag and joined the long line of people facing the traffic.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening state legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

His official resignation comes days after he voted in favor of Trump’s domestic policy bill to cut Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy programs to partially pay for an extension and expansion of tax cuts.
By state law, the special election to replace Green must occur later this year. A primary election is likely to take place in September, and the general election in late October or early November. 
State Rep. Jody Barrett, a Dickson Republican, announced in a statement Monday he will run for the seat. Barrett, who voted against Gov. Bill Lee’s private school voucher program, positioned himself in the statement as an outsider. 
“I’ve taken on the elites in my own party and stood up for you,” Barrett said. “And like President Trump, they came after me to get to you.”

Barrett joins four other Republicans who have announced they are running to replace Green:

Jason Knight, a Montgomery County Commissioner
Matt Van Epps, a former Tennessee General Services Commissioner
State Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin
Jonathan Thorp, a U.S. Army veteran

A sixth Republican, Franklin state Rep. Lee Reeves, filed a statement of organization with the Federal Election Commission on Monday. 
On the Democratic side, Bo Mitchell, a state representative from Nashville, announced his candidacy for the seat.
“Now more than ever, Tennessee needs leaders in Congress who will have the courage to fight for us, not just cave to political pressure,” Mitchell said in a statement. “I am disgusted by the passage of this big, ugly bill; it will decimate rural health care and close rural hospitals.”
Rep. Aftyn Behn, another Nashville Democrat, filed a statement of candidacy with the FEC on Monday. 
Down the line, a race for District 6
Green’s resignation follows U.S. Rep. John Rose, a Cookeville Republican, who announced in March he will make a bid for governor in 2026, opening up the 6th Congressional seat. The 6th district includes the eastern part of Nashville, parts of Wilson County and about a dozen counties in Middle and East Tennessee.

Candidates for the 6th district have more time to declare, as Rose appears likely to finish his term. The 6th district election will fall on the traditional 2026 midterm election dates. 
Van Hilleary, who represented Tennessee Congressional District 4 from 1995 to 2003,  and serves as Rose’s chief of staff, filed his statement of candidacy with the FEC on July 1 to run to replace Rose. Hilleary last ran for office in 2002, when he lost a race for Tennessee governor to Democrat Phil Bredesen.
Other candidates to announce so far are Republican Dale Braden and Democrat Mike Croley.

(Photo by Leigh Vogel/Getty Images)We find ourselves in an environment where The Big Lie has become a phrase applied to voter fraud, the 2020 presidential election and numerous other real and perceived political lies and disinformation. It is ubiquitous in modern American politics. 
As we watched the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act (H.R.1) move back and forth between the U.S. House and Senate, another phrase Republican politicians used frequently to justify their support for a bill that is going to cut Medicaid by nearly a trillion dollars over 10 years was waste, fraud and abuse. (Example: “The legislation also achieves significant savings by […] targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,” U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, said in a June 16 news release.)
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Recently, I listened to a representative of the organization Medicare Sisters and Me answer a question posed by an Idaho Medicaid participant about whether she should be concerned about the proposed Medicaid cuts in the budget bill. She responded that unless participants were committing any sort of waste, fraud or abuse, they had nothing to worry about. 
This was someone supposedly educated in the system’s workings. The questioner made clear that she was a Medicaid participant through the expansion of the program for low-income Idahoans. Will the cuts affect low-income Idahoans on Medicaid? There is little doubt, yet the lie we keep being told is that the only cuts to Medicaid will result from reining in waste, fraud and abuse. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) defines waste as ordering more tests than are necessary and then asking for reimbursement. It is also ordering unnecessary medical equipment. Does this happen? Occasionally, but more due to a lack of care coordination or hurried health care providers with ballooning caseloads. 
You know where there is also waste, fraud and abuse? Medicare. And private insurance. We are not robots working under the spell of an algorithm. We are complex human beings with needs, needs that are treated by human doctors who will have different views of treatment. Where one provider might say that a statin is necessary, another might encourage avoiding it for as long as possible. Where one provider might prescribe two medications for an illness another might only prescribe one. It’s the nature of health care.
I am not so idealistic that I deny that Medicaid fraud happens. However, as someone who receives their health care through Medicare and Medicaid, I can confirm that the process of getting Medicaid is complex and thorough. And your Medicaid card isn’t for keeps. Every year you have to go through recertification just as you do for other means-tested programs.
You know who does commit Medicaid fraud? Providers. Nursing home executives. People who make their living off the care for those who rightfully receive Medicaid. 
Medicare and Medicaid fraud are criminal acts. Trying to get reimbursed for services you didn’t actually provide? Fraud. This is already a focus of the CMS. 
Would it surprise you that Trump has demonstrated that he doesn’t actually care about the biggest crimes against these programs? He granted clemency to one such fraudster, Lawrence Duran, a Florida health care executive who was found guilty of a scheme to defraud Medicare to the tune of $205 million. At the very same time Republicans began this charade of supposedly protecting Medicaid from waste, fraud and abuse, Trump quietly commuted Duran’s sentence. Republicans did not condemn Trump’s action.
The Republicans would have you believe that people are gaming the system. That they are improperly receiving benefits (i.e. abuse). 
They clearly haven’t ever had to apply for life-saving benefits like Medicaid, SNAP or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP): having to line up bank statements, determine the worth of your home or vehicle, outline every cost associated with dependents, determine the overall out-of-pocket pharmaceutical costs, calculate all medical costs that fell outside of what Medicaid covered — a never-ending cost for people with disabilities, especially — for a given year. Having to determine annual income including income verification from the Social Security Administration — whose office you can no longer walk into without an appointment — and tally up any money gifted to you by friends or family is a process that does not scream “gaming the system.” 
If anything, it deters people in need from receiving necessary services they deserve because the process is so onerous.
Waste, fraud and abuse rarely come at the hands of recipients. Fraud is a criminal act, but waste and abuse are rarely malicious. When the cuts go into effect, the price will be paid by recipients who most need these programs.
The ongoing anti-immigrant fervor in this country has seeped into Trump’s bill as well with respect to Medicaid and SNAP. As part of this so-called war on waste, fraud and abuse, they seek to eliminate the chance of unauthorized immigrants receiving assistance. What they fail to tell you, again, is how difficult it is for authorized immigrants to apply for and receive Medicaid or SNAP. 
Immigrants in this country legally who are establishing a life here and are getting their feet under them are judged harshly by the immigration system if they so much as apply for assistance programs. They don’t always enter this country with an immediate job or health care and, believe me, plans do fall apart. If a person has the terrible misfortune of becoming ill before attaining the lofty goal of American health care, the system fails them. Many can’t apply for Medicaid or American Care Act (ACA) subsidies, but they also can’t work. 
The cost of their care, should they not be able to pay, ends up falling to the hospitals and clinics that treat them. This will continue to be a cost that hospitals will pass on to patients regardless of what type of insurance they have. This will again become an issue for states and counties as it was before the ACA.  
In the coming years, conveniently the years after the 2026 midterms, when the debt ceiling has been raised by $5 trillion, an additional $3 trillion is added to the national debt, the child poverty rate has increased, up to 11 million Americans are kicked off of Medicaid, more lose ACA subsidies, states lose as much as a quarter of the federal matching funds that they receive to administer their Medicaid programs and rural hospitals, clinics and nursing homes experiencing immense pain from less Medicaid money close their doors, I wonder what the Big Lie will be then.

Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn is running against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterms. 
After launching an exploratory committee in April, Osborn made it official Tuesday, choosing the Senate race over potential bids for governor and the U.S. House, because, he said, “there are not enough seats at the table” for working people.
“I’m unapologetically for the workers and their issues,” Osborn told Nebraska Examiner. 
Osborn boiled down his race to “the billionaire versus the mechanic,” citing the wealth of the Ricketts family. 
Ricketts himself appears more likely to be a millionaire, based on his Senate financial disclosure forms. But he is part of a family that built the company that became TD Amertrade and owns Major League Baseball’s Chicago Cubs. 
Osborn said he would approach legislation “based on principles” and not “on any kind of monetary [gain].” He pointed to Trump’s “big beautiful bill” as a piece of legislation with tax breaks that would make Ricketts richer “off the backs of people” who are at risk of losing benefits from Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps. 
“If I had been elected in 2024, that ‘big beautiful bill’ would not have gotten passed,” Osborn said. 
The GOP mega-bill made the tax cuts from the first Trump administration permanent, cementing most of its benefits for higher earners while also introducing some new temporary tax breaks for workers earning less. It was a central piece of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda. 
To offset the costs of the bill, the law reduces spending on the social safety net by adding work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps. It also lowers provider taxes that nearly every state uses to help fund Medicaid health insurance programs for low-income residents. 
Ricketts and the rest of Nebraska’s federal delegation voted in lockstep for the legislation. Ricketts called the bill a “once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver for Nebraska.” 
“This legislation will result in increased security, strength and prosperity for the American people,” Ricketts said in a statement. “The bill restores critical pro-growth business provisions and makes them permanent, benefiting Nebraska farming, ranching and small business.” 
The delegation and pro-business and anti-tax lobbying groups, including Americans for Prosperity, are touting the benefits of the bill to Nebraskans, as multiple polls indicate that Trump’s signature piece of legislation is unpopular among Americans who are aware of it. 
Ricketts, who served two terms as Nebraska governor before being appointed to the Senate by his successor, faced some pushback from constituents in April about the bill and other issues. He won a special election to hold the Senate seat in November.
This is Osborn’s second Senate bid. His populist run against U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., in 2024 made national headlines for turning an expected safe race for Republicans into a potential upset. He attracted an extraordinary fundraising haul of $14 million for a federal candidate in Nebraska without direct ties to a major party, including some late money from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee once they saw his momentum.

He lost by about six percentage points. Fischer, during and after the race, described him as a “Democrat in sheep’s clothing” and said the campaign finance reports confirmed her belief. State voting records show Osborn as a registered nonpartisan since at least 2004, as the Nebraska Examiner reported.
Osborn said he is at a “stronger” starting point now than in 2024 because more people in the state know him. 
“We were learning how to build the plane as we were learning how to fly it last time,” Osborn told the Examiner. “Now it’s built. We know how to fly it.”
Republicans have almost completely dominated America’s heartland, a region once known for its prairie progressivism. If Osborn were able to unseat Ricketts, it would be the first time a non-Republican had represented Nebraska in Congress since Democratic U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford upset Republican U.S. Rep. Lee Terry in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District in 2014. 
Osborn could benefit from a bump in Democratic turnout in the Omaha area after the announced retirement of five-term Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon led the nonpartisan Center for Politics, the home of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball to shift the 2nd District U.S. House race to leaning Democrat from toss-up. 
Ricketts has a significant political war chest and has used his own money to influence Nebraska politics. But populism, whether Osborn’s approach or Trump’s, is the driving force in modern politics, as voters lose faith in institutions and seek alternatives. Some political observers believe the same working-class-focused rhetoric that drove President Donald Trump’s victory could give someone like Osborn an opening. 
Ricketts faced similar populism in 2022, when a leadership team loyal to him leading the Nebraska Republican Party was ousted in favor of a team more loyal to Trump. But the former governor retains the dominant political operation in the state. Some Republicans who crossed him in the Legislature lost seats, and his endorsement holds weight. 
His endorsed candidate for governor, Pillen, defeated a Trump-endorsed candidate in 2022, Charles Herbster. Ricketts already has received the endorsement of Trump. The nod came after an internal poll showed Osborn statistically tied with Ricketts, although people familiar with the endorsement process said it had been in the works for weeks and that Trump decided the timing.
Ricketts gets early ads from group tied to Senate GOP in potential Osborn race

Will Coup, a Ricketts campaign spokesperson, said, “Senator Ricketts has consistently worked for and voted to secure the border and cut taxes for Nebraska workers, families and seniors. Dan Osborn is bought and paid for by his liberal, out-of-state, coastal donors.”
Osborn during the last race did not say whom he would caucus with if elected. His campaign had no immediate response to a similar question Monday.
Osborn had been eyeing multiple potential races before narrowing it down to Ricketts’ seat in April. One of the races he considered, for the state’s 2nd Congressional District, has garnered significant interest from Democratic candidates. Osborn has said he didn’t want to play “spoiler” for that seat.
It’s unclear whether Democrats will run a candidate in the Senate race, but Osborn said it doesn’t matter to him. He said both parties are “going to do what they do.” 
Osborn and his supporters drew criticism in 2024 for trying to minimize the number of names on his Senate race’s general election ballot other than his and Fischer’s. Some Democrats grumbled that he flirted with seeking Democratic support until it was too late for them to run their own candidate, and leaders in the Legal Marijuana Now Party complained that Osborn supporters took over the party’s nominating process to help clear a path for him. 
The Nebraska Democratic Party, in a statement, seemed to hint at support for Osborn’s effort, saying, “Breaking up the one-party stranglehold on our state is going to take an unlikely alliance of Democrats, Republicans and Independents coming together to fix a very broken Washington, D.C.” 
Osborn said he feels like he’s set to win. 
“I want to show the country, and I want to show Nebraska that we could do it differently here,” Osborn said.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser’s office will consider joining a lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s declaration in January of a national energy emergency, he told Newsline in an exclusive interview on Saturday.
Last week, the Trump administration’s Bureau of Land Management invoked the emergency declaration to complete an accelerated environmental review of a permit to expand a loading facility near Price, Utah for oil coming out of the nearby Uinta Basin. The expansion could increase oil capacity on the main rail line through Colorado by up to 80,000 barrels a day.
It’s anticipated that the expansion of what’s known as the Wildcat Loadout facility — located on publicly owned federal lands — and other nearby facilities will allow the trucking and transfer to rail of up to 75% of the oil proposed for transport in the Uinta Basin Railway project. Eagle County and state officials have long opposed increased oil trains along the Colorado River.

In a June 27 letter to Jerry Davis, acting Utah state director for the BLM, Weiser wrote that an expedited environmental assessment for the proposed Wildcat right-of-way expansion would be a “violation of applicable laws and regulations” that would block proper public input and “subject Colorado communities to significant economic, environmental, and health and safety risks.”
Weiser argued there is no national energy emergency given the United States produced more oil last year than any nation in history, and he urged the BLM to follow standard, legally required procedures in reviewing the project. An attorney for Eagle County and an environmental group that successfully sued the federal government to delay the rail project, also sent letters.
But late Thursday, the BLM issued its approval, finding “no significant impact” related to the expansion, which Colorado opposes due to increased derailment, wildfire and oil-spill risks, and the agency directly cited its authority under Trump’s January executive order declaring a national energy emergency, allowing for the fast-tracking of fossil fuel projects.
On Saturday, before a fundraiser here for his 2026 gubernatorial campaign, Weiser said he had not heard about the expedited approval of the Wildcat Loadout or had time to debrief the ruling.
“I am sorry to hear that. I’m not shocked, but it’s a sign of the times we’re in — the lack of stewardship to protect our land, air, and water is appalling,” Weiser said. “We’re going to have to be creative to find every way we can to make sure that these decisions aren’t being made hastily with long-term, harmful consequences.”
In May, 15 states — led by the attorneys general in Washington and California — filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of Trump’s energy emergency executive order. Calling it a “fake” emergency designed to line the pockets of Big Oil, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown pointed to the order’s exclusion of clean energy projects as it strips away vital environmental protections.
The May lawsuit claims Trump’s declaration of a national energy emergency is a violation of the National Emergencies Act itself, which is designed to prevent frivolous or partisan declarations.
“We don’t think it is a real emergency,” Weiser said Saturday. “Up until now, this national energy emergency order hasn’t affected Colorado. But given these dynamics (of the expedited BLM approval), we’re going to be looking at that to make sure that we can do all we can to protect Colorado.”
Brown and California Attorney General Rob Bonta cited what they deemed illegal fast-tracking of environmental reviews by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation in violation of the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, among other key environmental laws.
“The only ‘emergency’ is that the president disagrees with policies to address climate change in Washington state and elsewhere,” Brown wrote in May. “He is illegally using emergency authorities to keep the nation reliant on energy sources like coal, oil and gas.”
Weiser has previously said he will keep all of his options open in opposing the Uinta Basin oil expansion as it seeks to vastly expand oil-train traffic along the headwaters of the endangered Colorado River, which supplies water to more than 40 million people. The BLM approval in a two-week window now has him questioning Trump’s national energy emergency rules.
“So we didn’t have an ability to make this case [back in May], but we at the time said that we would be looking closely at whether and when it would affect Colorado and we’d be ready to file,” Weiser said Saturday. “And with this, now we have to look at it.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline.
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

(Aidan Cornue | West Virginia University)In rural Wyoming County, West Virginia, Ann Reed is the sheriff’s department’s only social worker. 
Funded through a temporary grant from a local mental health center, Reed provides resources and care to individuals who experience substance use disorder on a daily basis. 
She assists the Wyoming County Sheriff’s Department by monitoring a local mental health agency’s 911 calls and checking if any are drug-related. If they are, Reed then responds to individuals at their homes, taking them to treatment facilities — and sometimes, witnessing their arrests. 
“We pick up, we arrest, we send off,” Reed said. 
Usually, the place they send them off to is jail.

Wyoming County is one of the state’s most rural. It’s home to about 20,000 residents, but no hospital and zero certified treatment beds, according to the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy. As the nation’s opioid overdose epidemic raged, Wyoming County had a prescription overdose death rate of 54.6 per 100,000 people from 1999 to 2014 — the highest in the nation. 
The county still battles the lasting effects of the opioid crisis. It has 12 certified female beds and one comprehensive behavioral health care provider to help them do it. But like communities across the country, Wyoming County is getting hundreds of thousands of dollars through opioid lawsuit settlements to spend on law enforcement, prevention education, treatment, recovery and harm reduction services.
West Virginia will receive an estimated $980 billion over the next 17 years from a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic. 
Wyoming is one of at least 9 counties in West Virginia that have used their opioid settlement funds to pay off at least a portion of their regional jail bill, an analysis of Freedom of Information Act requested documents by students from West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media from 50 of the state’s 55 counties shows. In total, those nine counties have spent more than $3.5 million on bills to house West Virginians in its 10 regional jails.
“In small counties, we unfortunately are limited financially,” Grant County Commissioner Kevin Hagerty said in an email. His county spent half of their settlement funds — $115,528 — on their regional jail bill. “The jail bill has been a pretty significant expense for us over several years. We used a portion of the funds to help ease the burden on resources.” 
As part of an investigation into these practices, Reed School of Media journalism students reached out to county commissioners in all nine counties that reported spending opioid settlement funds on jail bills. Representatives from four counties responded, and all said spending the opioid settlement funds in this way aligns with what is allowed in state rules for spending, written by the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office. 
But experts say there is a difference between how the funds can legally be spent and the intent behind the global settlement that was the result of hundreds of thousands of overdose deaths across the country. 
A crisis-fueled debt
Jail fees pose a significant burden on counties in West Virginia, where taxpayers are ultimately on the hook for the bill. Documents from the state’s Department of Homeland Security show several counties owe millions of dollars in jail fees. 
As of April 4, 2025, the 55 counties in West Virginia owe a total of $15,020,710.48 on their regional jail bills. Clay, McDowell and Webster counties owe the most — and, according to a source familiar with the state’s jail payment processes, have for the past decade. 
How state, county and city leaders can spend their opioid settlement funds is guided by an MOU that former Attorney General Patrick Morrisey — now governor — helped to establish in 2022. The MOU outlines that funds can be spent in several areas: prevention, treatment, recovery, law enforcement and EMS. 
Under law enforcement, the MOU specifically says funds can be used for evidence-based programs for individuals who are incarcerated or are exiting incarceration, education and training programs for law enforcement personnel, mental health and support resources, equipment, tools and manpower for first-responder agencies. 
The MOU acknowledges regional jail fees as an approved use of opioid lawsuit settlement funding, saying it provides “restitution for monies that were previously expended on opioid abatement activities.”
And several counties have decided putting money toward these overdue bills is a priority. In Wyoming County, Commissioner Jason Mullins said many people in the regional jail are incarcerated for opioid-related offenses, so it’s a logical use for the funds.

Logan County is spending nearly a million of its $3.9 million fund on its jail bill. In Boone County, officials are putting $452,766 of opioid settlement funds toward that use. 
“If a Madison police officer makes an arrest inside city limits, Boone County is still responsible for the jail bill,” Boone County Commissioner Brett Kuhn said. “So that’s a very difficult thing when you’re in the economic condition we find ourselves in today to come up with.” 
Kuhn says Boone County usually owes $60,000-$70,000 per month on their jail bill, and uses the county’s portion of the coal severance tax revenues to pay it off. He says using opioid settlement funds instead of the coal severance tax to pay the jail bill will allow them to redirect severance funds to other economic development opportunities in the county.
“I think one of the most important ways to combat the situation we find ourselves in now is to create good, high-paying jobs,” Kuhn said. 
Several county officials say the decision to pay off their jail bills first stems from a lack of funding to pay down what they owe. Commissioner Kevin Hagerty said the Grant County Commission also has plans to use its funding to assist in opening a nonprofit sober living house.
“Before we commit to funding, there are various things that we must consider, such as liability issues, operational structure, who would oversee different mechanics of the house, etc.,” he said. “We are pretty early in the process; however, it is something that we see as very positive if it were to come to fruition.” 
The commission has already approved the building of a Safe Haven Baby Box with the settlement funds.

Laura Lander, addiction therapist and associate professor at West Virginia University’s School of Medicine, says there are other ways the funds could be spent that would offer long-term support for people affected by substance use. 
Lander, a past opioid settlement grant review panelist for the West Virginia First Foundation, said that things like child advocacy centers, youth prevention and workforce development would be more effective spending. 
Lander said that using the money on “short-sighted” areas like the jail bill are not going to help people who are struggling.
“It’s not going to address the problem, it’s just going to pay a bill,” she said. “I’m sure everybody has regional jail bills, but it’s not actually addressing the problem. It sounds like it’s addressing a shortfall in the county’s budget or planning.” 
Some county officials agree. In Mercer County, Commissioner Greg Puckett says other counties’ use of their settlement funds on the jail bill is understandable — but that doesn’t make it the best use of the money. 
“I think it’s kind of a faulty philosophy,” Puckett said. “There are identified strategies that are a lot more effective in ways to deal with the opioid problems that we’ve seen in the past. Those come from building for future solutions, not looking in reverse.” 
Instead of paying their jail bill — which was $163,000 for the month of May — Puckett said Mercer County wants to use their funds to improve infrastructure, including a new sheriff’s department building and parks for “engagement in positive activities.” 
“When you pay the jail bill, that’s essentially a reverse thinking philosophy of just getting out from under it. You’re never going to be able to get out completely from under it because of the way the costs are,” he said. 
Unlike Wyoming or Boone counties, Mercer County also plans to create a task force to help delegate funds that would include mental health experts and people in long-term recovery. 
Frank Kearl is an attorney with Popular Democracy. He said he has been developing strategies to ensure transparency and accountability in opioid settlement fund spending alongside organizers and community activists in New York, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Kearl said using the settlement funds to pay for regional jail bills is legal in his read of the West Virginia MOU and his understanding of the rules outlined by the global settlement, but said the legality of using the funds in a certain way and whether that’s the best use for them are different questions. 
“Someone would need to be paying attention to where that money was going to ensure that two years from now, when they want to spend the money on something else that’s not related, there’s someone there to be like, ‘wait a second, you already spent all of this money in this other way, so you don’t have that remaining funds,’” Kearl said. “And that’s just not happening.” 
“That’s not happening in West Virginia. That’s not happening anywhere. No one is paying close enough attention to where this money is going.” 
Plus, Kearl said, this is West Virginia’s only shot — just like it is for every state. These funds will only come once. If they’re misspent from the start, government leaders cannot go back to the corporations that are part of the global settlement and sue for more.
And in the current MOU and settlement structure, there is no federal oversight. State, local and city governments have full control of the processes. 
“The way that the settlements are set up prevents any subsequent liability for these corporations and individuals for the harm that they caused. So someone living in West Virginia, in one of these counties where this money is being spent on something that’s completely unrelated, they don’t have another bite at the apple,” Kearl said. 
“This is their one opportunity to see meaningful justice served resolution,” he said. “Money spent in a way that is helping resolve the harms that they have suffered and continue to suffer, and so when that money is wasted, to me, it’s less even about the legality or illegality and more about the justice of it.” 
What experts, communities say they actually need
Despite the MOU allowing the payment of regional jail fees, some activists say they’d like to see the money used in other ways.
Brittney Garrett is a representative of Police Assisted Addiction & Recovery Initiative, a national nonprofit organization that encourages people struggling with substance use disorder to go to a local police station to receive drug screenings and other recovery services without being arrested. Garrett helps individuals find pathways to treatment and provides guidance for law enforcement when they interact with people struggling with substance use disorder. 
Garrett said allocating funding to law enforcement can be an effective measure, as long as the money is spent on programs specifically designed to benefit the community in accessing treatment and recovery services.
“We really need to make sure that it’s opioid-specific and that we are helping individuals who are struggling with substance use and connecting them to treatment and recovery to not continue this,” she said. 
She encouraged county commissions to use other funding pools for treatment and recovery services. 
Reporting in West Virginia shows some counties are spending their funds on a shooting range in Jackson County or a UTV for the police department in Ohio County. 
“I think that there is other funding for things like shooting ranges or police vehicles,” Garrett said in response to the reporting. 
Lander also said the counties need to look at long-term treatment solutions. She said purchasing new vehicles or new buildings is not sustainable, and if counties want to support infrastructure, the settlement money should go towards recovery housing. 
“We have an affordable housing crisis in this state, that is, in my opinion, directly connected to the substance use disorder problem. And one of the reasons why it’s so difficult for people to get well is that they don’t have stable housing,” Lander said. “It’s very hard to be in recovery and not have a stable place to live.”
Kearl said county leaders need more guidance to ensure funds are distributed to areas outside of law enforcement or jail bills. 
“Dropping $3 million in a county-level account and expecting them to use it in a way to resolve harms from a crisis that they didn’t create in the first place and that they were not actively participating in the settlement process at all is irresponsible by the state,” he said.
One county’s lingering struggle
In Wyoming County, Sheriff Bradley Ellison — who social worker Ann Reed works with directly — said there is a lack of resources for residents who have been affected by the opioid crisis and for emergency personnel like him who have responded to opioid-related emergencies for nearly two decades.  
Ellison has worked at the county’s sheriff’s department for more than 30 years, responding to the opioid crisis on the front lines. His department consists of 18 officers, and Ellison said it’s understaffed and underfunded. And while he said he wasn’t sure what the Wyoming County Commission should spend its funding on, he said he needs things that will help his department continue to do their jobs, like new cruisers and an increase in personnel.

Ellison believes the county is unlikely to continue funding recovery, prevention, or treatment services once settlement funding runs out. He also said he was not against the use of opioid settlement funds to pay their jail bill. 
“Like if you wanted a facility and it cost a million dollars, you’re blowing through your money. Are you helping anything? Because once this money’s gone, the county ain’t gonna pick it up and take it out of their coffers because it ain’t there,” Ellison said. “You got to try to hit the best way to make the biggest impact that you can with what you got.” 
Despite current efforts to combat substance use disorders in the county, he said financial support came long after Wyoming County residents were experiencing the worst of the opioid crisis. 
“They was 10 years too late on the opioid problem. We was crying and screaming in the early 2000s, ‘Help. Gosh, help.’ Nobody would listen,” Ellison said. “Nobody would listen.”
Ellison said he’s worried that they’re still too late to help the people who need it most.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Vanderbilt University Medical Center laid off the staff of its LGBTQ Health Program in late June, effectively shuttering a resource that helped LGBTQ+ people access and navigate healthcare for the last decade.
Members of the institution’s LGBTQ Health Community Advisory Board and a former member of the program’s office staff say VUMC quietly eliminated the office and its Trans Buddy program on June 24 with no notice to the community or the patients served by the program’s resources.
Instead, the Community Advisory Board learned of the layoffs from affected employees and shared the information along with an open letter to VUMC administrators on social media. 
The layoffs did not impact medical staff at VUMC’s Vivid Health Clinic, which continues to offer medical care, according to Community Advisory Board Chair Ray Holloman and Dahron Johnson, the board’s immediate past chair.
Spokespeople for VUMC did not respond to multiple requests for comment or detailed questions about the staff terminations. VUMC previously issued a statement on June 30 confirming that it expects to lay off 650 research, administrative and support employees due to grant and funding cuts made by the Trump Administration.

The news spurred the Metro Council of Nashville’s LGBTQ Caucus to publish a letter to the health organization on July 1, expressing its “deep disappointment” in VUMC’s “pattern of decisions — both actions and inactions — that have left a once-loyal community feeling misled, abandoned, and deeply betrayed.”
Caucus members cited VUMC’s 2022 pause of gender-affirming surgeries for minors, 2023 release of transgender patients’ medical records to the Tennessee Attorney General, April 2025 elimination of its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programs and the institution’s withdrawal of medical support from the 2025 Nashville Pride Festival as reasons for the caucus’ statement of no confidence in VUMC leadership.
“This is not about red tape or resources. This is about values. Each of these moments was a chance to show conviction. Instead, you revealed where your priorities lie,” the caucus letter states. “You failed us. You stood on our backs as we lifted you up. You benefitted from our trust, our pride, and our presence. And when we needed you most, you betrayed us. We will not forget.”
Johnson, a transgender woman who graduated from Vanderbilt Divinity School in 2008 and has gone on to become a chaplain and serve on multiple community boards, described the LGBTQ Health Program’s abrupt closure as a betrayal of VUMC’s clinical promises to put patients’ needs first.
“There is no hiding the fact that (the LGBTQ+ community) have been targeted in the ways we’ve been targeted,” Johnson said. “When you offer care, we as patients, as a community, are looking for you to stand by the thing that you have willingly, openly committed yourself to. This type of last-second, in-the-middle-of-the-night closure is just absolutely reprehensible and an utter dereliction of the basics of care, whether that’s (for) trans folks or any other type of person.”

Trans Buddy program axed
Quinn Bacon was preparing to train her replacement as coordinator for VUMC’s Trans Buddy program when she was told the position was eliminated, effective June 30 – the last day of Pride Month. 
Bacon, a transgender woman, started in the role in January 2023, ensuring that the program’s phone line was staffed 12 hours each day to answer questions about resources, community, safety, and more. People could also call the line to request a “Trans Buddy” — one of the volunteers trained by Bacon — to accompany them to any appointment at any VUMC location for support.
“There were times that patients were put in unsafe situations or were experiencing medical neglect, and by having a Trans Buddy there to provide community support while also advocating for them to be treated fairly in the hospital, we were able to help people get what they needed and feel humanized at the same time,” Bacon said.
She planned to leave in August upon completing graduate school. Bacon, her boss and her predecessors believed the role was a part-time federal work study position, she said. While she could not continue work study, she planned to keep volunteering with the program.
During a call with VUMC Human Resources staff in late June, Bacon found out she’d lost her job, and she wouldn’t be offered any severance because the role was classified as temporary, she said. (VUMC’s June 30 statement said it would provide severance and other assistance to affected employees). 










It’s become very hard to have a lot of trust in this mammoth institution that has been kind of a pillar in the community for forever, and now just kind of see them say, ‘You know what? We are going to back away from everything. We’re not going to try to fight.


– Don't forget to add author


The HR team was at first unaware that she still worked at VUMC, and didn’t know she was still a student, despite her work badge identifying her as a student worker, she said.
They also told her the position was not, in fact, paid through work study. Bacon said she thought of the opportunities she’d passed on in order to stay eligible for the coordinator position — a fellowship she turned down when she found out it was funded through federal work study, and her library job she had to quit “because I was told that the Trans Buddy program maxes out my hours.”
VUMC representatives did not respond to questions about Bacon’s termination.
The end of the Trans Buddy program is also personal for Johnson, who called the program’s number in early 2020 after having her own “now or never” moment, Johnson said. The person she spoke with helped her connect with clinical providers and informed her on routes to set up a visit. That person was one of the people who lost their job in June, Johnson said. 
A call to the Trans Buddy phone number Monday rang through to an error message after multiple rings.
Johnson said the LGBTQ Health Program office and the Trans Buddy program also served as a sort of clearinghouse for LGBTQ resources at VUMC, an entry point and navigator for patients seeking care and a source of education for hospital services and providers.
Holloman said the office staff provided awareness training to “ensure that if trans or queer people are interacting with these staff, they don’t get misgendered, they’re looking at their records, they push to get gender identity and sexual orientation and legal sex and all of these things into the health record so that people would feel comfortable coming there.”
Bacon said patients planning to go to VUMC now “should plan to bring people with them that they want to protect them. They should not expect that the hospital will provide people that will do that sort of advocacy work.”
Community Advisory Board Chair says VUMC actions have eroded trust
The Trans Buddy program and gender-affirming care were part of the Tennessee Office of the Attorney General’s demand for documents in 2023 for what it said was an investigation into possible violations of the Tennessee Medicaid False Claims Act. 
The demand included volunteer resumes, emails sent by members of the general public to an LGBTQ+ health questions portal and communications with outside therapists, in addition to the names of people who were referred to Vanderbilt for transgender care but opted not to pursue it. Any medical records reviewed under investigations into billing are kept confidential, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti’s office stated in 2023.
A VUMC spokesperson at the time stated the institution did not comply with every demand for records, without elaboration.
Patients sue Vanderbilt for releasing transgender clinic records to Tennessee AG

Several patients sued VUMC in Davidson County Chancery Court following the disclosure of their medical records. The case went into mediation on May 30 and was settled as of June 11, according to court records that do not specify the terms of the settlement.
A representative for Skrmetti’s office could not be immediately reached for comment on the result of the office’s investigation into VUMC’s billing practices for gender-related treatment.
Holloman, a transgender man who has received care through the Vivid Clinic, said administrative decisions have eroded trust in VUMC in recent years. The Community Advisory Board for the LGBTQ Health Program anticipated the program would be dismantled given “the way Vanderbilt has been trending over the last few years.”
“It’s become very hard to have a lot of trust in this mammoth institution that has been kind of a pillar in the community for forever, and now just kind of see them say, ‘You know what? We are going to back away from everything. We’re not going to try to fight,’” Holloman said.
If Holloman had a “magic wand,” rebuilding trust in the community would start with bringing back the terminated positions and the employees who filled them, but it would be a “long road,” he said.
“Trans buddy and all of the other programs that they had made it so people could access healthcare,” Holloman said. “They are a healthcare organization … with the moves that they’ve just made, they are discouraging people now from accessing health care until it becomes an emergency.”

ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Commissioners’ duties include adopting ethics rules, investigating alleged violations and issuing advisory opinions to help public officials navigate ethical issues. They are paid a stipend for every day they meet, plus reimbursement for travel. Applicants don’t need a background in government, law or ethics.
“Civic leaders, farmers, ranchers, local business owners, health care professionals, parents, educators, legal professionals, problem solvers and community advocates can make a positive impact on our state by serving on the Ethics Commission,” the board said in a Monday news release announcing the vacancies.
Some people are barred under state law from serving on the Ethics Commission. These include:

elected or appointed state officials, lobbyists and political party officials
candidates for statewide office
legislative employees

Those interested in serving on the commission can learn more on the governor’s office’s website. The deadline to apply is Aug. 8.
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

Commissioners are appointed by a consensus vote of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader.
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen’s term also expires Aug. 31, though he is seeking reappointment. Sagsveen joined the commission last year following former Ethics Commission Chair Paul Richard’s retirement. 
The Ethics Commission asked the governor’s office, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Kathy Hogan to approve Sagsveen’s reappointment. 
The Ethics Commission was created through a constitutional amendment approved by voters in 2018. It’s tasked with enforcing ethical behavior in the areas of elections, lobbying, corruption and transparency.

In a new report the Housing Collective, a housing reform nonprofit, examined 105 land-use boards across the two southern Connecticut counties. In both counties, just under half of the general population is male, but 70% of planning and zoning board members are men. 
Nearly 60% of Fairfield County is white, but white individuals make up over 90% of land-use board members there. In New London county, over 70% of the county’s population is white, but white people make up nearly 100% of land-use board members. 
Most board members are also older. The median age of board members in the two counties was between 60 and 65, while the overall median age was 20 years younger than that. While only about 70% of residents, across both counties, owned their homes, the study found more than 90% of board members were homeowners.
“It’s the thing that we all know in our hearts,” said Melissa Kaplan-Macey, chief initiative officer of Centers for Housing Opportunities, which is part of the collective. “But then when you do the research and you look at the data, it’s still shocking at the same time.”
Advocates for denser housing development and zoning reform say this disproportionate representation could affect the way land-use decisions are made.
“If you had local land-use boards that were representative of the communities that they serve,”  said Kaplan-Macey, land-use boards would then be “responding to the full needs of a local community — not just a small subset.”
But others say representation that doesn’t exactly align with the demographics of a community isn’t necessarily a problem — as long as the work is done responsibly. 
Land-use boards are required to follow local laws and town ordinances, said Betsy Gara, Executive Director of the Connecticut Council of Small Towns. So overrepresentation of any one demographic, “shouldn’t make a big difference,” she said. 
Still, Gara added, “I think it would certainly be valuable to have more diversity on local boards and commissions,” though she noted it can be difficult to fill board seats, especially in small towns. Many municipalities make efforts to recruit people to participate in local government, she said. 
Filling seats
Volunteer led and locally rooted, land-use boards help form what communities look like, how much green space they have, and even how much space there is between the front of a home and the road. 
Filling seats on these boards is not so simple. There are two primary ways the seats get filled. Depending on a town’s bylaws, board members are either elected or appointed. Both options present challenges. 
Nick Kantor, program director at Desegregate CT and a board member on Norwalk’s Planning & Zoning Commission, said there tends to be a bias against new housing development among voters who show up for municipal elections.  
Nationally, voter turnout for renters has lagged behind homeowners for congressional elections in recent years. More broadly, renters are significantly underrepresented in government offices across the United States. 
“That’s pretty well documented,” Kantor said. “And that could be challenging for folks to break through.”
Appointments, while technically easier than elections, still require a level of community engagement and awareness from participants. This means municipalities and towns have to do more outreach to draw broader interest in open positions on land-use boards.
Once a candidate is elected or appointed, they must undergo a state-mandated four hours of training within their first year. 
Once seated on a land-use board, the job — which is unpaid — can be a significant commitment, Kaplan-Macey said. That can make it harder for people who have kids, more than one job, or those who attend night school to join the boards. 
Kaplan-Macey said she’d like to see land-use board members be paid for their work. “I think it would be a whole different scenario, honestly, if we had stipends available that could cover child care or cost of transportation or [the] cost of people’s time,” she said. “If it was actually treated as a second job, I think we’d have a much larger pool of applicants.”
Kantor said while there are excellent examples of younger people on planning and zoning boards who are excited to serve, it’s also true that younger people tend to rent or move around, and aren’t as likely to put down roots, which could explain the underrepresentation of young people on land-use boards. 
It’s also no easy job serving on one of these boards, said Joseph DeLong, director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities. Members must deal with complaints and grievances often, he said. 
“Many of these planning and zoning boards, at times become villainized for what hasn’t happened without being recognized for some of the incredible work that they have done,” he said. 
All of these factors can result in certain segments of the population more frequently serving on land-use boards, he said. “What you often end up with are people who are at a stage in life where they don’t have as many responsibilities,” DeLong said. 
“But it also can lead to some boards and commissions that are very heavily weighted by people who are no longer in the workforce, [or] that are no longer raising their children, or are no longer facing some of the economic challenges that maybe the majority within the community are.” 
‘A real opportunity’
DeLong said that disproportionate representation isn’t only prevalent in land-use boards — it persists broadly across local government structures. 
“So I think it’s a very important, very real issue,” DeLong said. “And I say that as an old white man.”
In 2021, CCM started a two-day program in partnership with Yale University called Representation Matters, which trains people of color to run for government and community leadership offices, including land-use board seats. 
The Center for Land Use and Education (CLEAR) at the University of Connecticut, which offers training for land-use board members, has long operated Land Use Academy, a training program that works with students in emerging demographics who are interested in land-use training. 
Renata Bertotti, assistant land use planning educator at CLEAR, said she’s heard from students that making weekly meetings more flexible for board members could broaden access and incentivize involvement of younger demographics. 
“That may be that switch that ends up happening at some point, because we are seeing some younger bodies in our training as well,” Bertotti said. 
DeLong agreed. “We have to recognize that we are living in a new world, post-COVID.” DeLong said, adding that local ordinances and statutes can more easily be adjusted for remote and hybrid meetings now. “Frankly, you probably get stronger participation from the commissioners if you create that flexibility. But more importantly, you get stronger engagement and viewing from the general public as well.”
That type of community engagement is also key, advocates say, to widening participation. 
The Lower Connecticut River Valley Council of Governments, or RiverCOG, recently received a state grant to train board members in public engagement and to build more comprehensive approaches to land-use planning among members.
“We ended up surveying our members of the regional housing committee to ask them what they needed help most with,” said Megan Jouflas, Deputy Director of RiverCOG. “And the number one response was public engagement.”
RiverCOG is working with interns to improve their social media presence as a form of broadened outreach.
The Housing Collective’s report also recommended communities practice broader public engagement and outreach. 
In its study, the Housing Collective reported that an average 10% of board members across both counties are serving on expired terms, with an additional average of 10% vacant seats in New London and Fairfield Counties. 
Kaplan-Macey said she sees that as an opportunity. “So then you have a full 20%. There’s a real opportunity there of addressing that imbalance in terms of representation,” said Kaplan-Macey.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ezgif.com-webp-to-jpg-1-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 07:08:30.482550
,Mississippi Today,2025-07-08 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi’s court system is now fully online. Here’s how it happened,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/08/mississippis-court-online-electronic-records/,"The achievement means that attorneys can electronically file legal briefs in every state court, and the public can view court documents through the Mississippi Electronic Court system by subscribing to the system and paying a 20-cents per-page viewing fee.","Every circuit, chancery and county court across Mississippi’s 82 counties is finally part of the statewide electronic court system, completing a nearly two-decade-long mission to have a uniform digital court system. 
Nathan Evans, the director of the Mississippi Electronic Courts, said in a news release from the Administrative Office of the Courts, that the successful statewide implementation of the system marks a historic milestone for the judiciary. 
“With both appellate courts and all 188 Chancery, Circuit and County Courts now operating on a single, centralized case management and e-filing system, we have taken a significant leap in efficiency, transparency, and access to justice for the public we serve,” Evans said. 
Electronic court implementation was voluntary in trial courts until the Legislature passed HB 25 in 2020, which Gov. Tate Reeves signed into law, requiring local trial courts to be fully integrated with the electronic system by July 2, 2021. 
But court leaders at the time notified state officials that it would be impossible to meet the statutory deadline and asked the Legislature to appropriate more money for the court to integrate all trial courts into the electronic system more quickly. 
The Legislature did not provide more money for court officials to complete the job of training local chancery and circuit clerk employees in every corner of the state on how to use the system, but court officials proceeded with the Herculean task. 
Still, the achievement means that attorneys can electronically file legal briefs in every state court, and the public can view court documents through the Mississippi Electronic Court system by subscribing to the system and paying a 20-cents per-page viewing fee. 
If citizens still want to view court documents without paying the MEC viewing fee, they can go to the proper courthouse and look at the legal filings on the public court terminal. 
“Now, our judges, district attorneys, public defenders, and attorneys can access and file documents instantly,” Rankin County Circuit Clerk Michelle Adcock said in the news release. “It’s a game changer for courtroom efficiency and transparency. This just streamlines justice and increases public access to court records.”
But before the court’s recent announcement, it took a performance storm almost 20 years ago that involved a whiteboard in Canton, the U.S. Senate’s seniority system and a gift from the federal court for Mississippi’s electronic court system to get off the ground.  
When then-Supreme Court Justice Bill Waller Jr. read an article in a newspaper around 2005 saying that Hinds County would start allowing attorneys to partially “e-file” court documents, he knew the state’ Supreme Court’s high court should get involved.
Waller, an associate justice of the court at the time, realized that if the state’s highest court didn’t step in and provide some guidance on an electronic system, then the state could eventually have a patchwork of different programs. So, he encouraged Chief Justice James Smith to create a task force exploring electronic courts. 
Justice Smith followed Waller’s advice and formed a committee of judges, court clerks and attorneys. Soon, the task force began meeting and listened to a presentation from J.T. Noblin, the clerk of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi. 
Noblin walked the task force members through how attorneys and judges used the federal electronic filing system that was in place across federal district courts in the country. After the presentation, Arthur Johnston, the Madison County chancery clerk who served on the committee, had an epiphany. 
“A light went on in my head that said we have so many lawyers in the state who are familiar with that federal system,” Johnston said. “I wondered if that could be the system that we adopt. Justice Waller thought that was a splendid idea.” 
Members of the task force traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran, Mississippi’s senior senator, who served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, to discuss the federal electronic court system. 
Cochran used his position as chairman of the committee to slip a provision into the federal judiciary’s appropriation bill that required the federal courts to give the Mississippi court system its federal electronic software and code for free, saving state taxpayers a large sum of money.
After the legislation passed, the wonky and technical work of actually creating a Mississippi version of the federal system began. 
Madison County Chancery Court was the first to attempt to roll out an electronic court, but there was one main snag in trying to copy the federal judiciary’s electronic system: the Chancery Court system dealt with different types of cases than federal court. 
Federal courts typically deal with criminal and civil cases, similar to Mississippi’s Circuit Court system. But the Chancery Court deals with estates, adoption, custody, divorce and questions about the Mississippi Constitution. 
To iron out the issues, Johnston and his deputy clerks — Kim Seivers, Lakisha Jones-Clay and Stacey Toten — worked out of a room in the local WIN Job Center and converted it into a “war room.” 
Each afternoon, the employees would look through Chancery Court cases and create a corresponding description in the database to create its electronic system. The work eventually paid off because Madison County accepted the first electronic case in 2008. 
“We would make notes on a dry-erase board on the problems we ran into,” Johnston said.
The work in the war room eventually created a template that other courts across the state, with the help of the Administrative Office of the Courts, would replicate. 
While the work took decades to complete, Waller hopes that ultimately the openness that comes with an electronic court can improve the public’s image of the judiciary, and make attorneys’ jobs easier. 
“It’s a beautiful success story for the state,” Waller said. “There’s no doubt about it.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/06081932/HB-1020-appeal1.jpg,,,2025-07-08 07:08:30.482550

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘They’ll get over it,’ McConnell reportedly assures GOP colleagues about Medicaid cuts

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Kentucky, Arizona and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
The Kentucky Hospital Association has warned the legislation would eliminate 33,000 jobs in the state as Medicaid underfunding forces hospitals to reduce services or even close.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
Kentucky Republicans in Congress hail passage of bill the state’s hospitals call ‘devastating’

In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

That was the cap to this past holiday weekend in central North Carolina. An early season tropical storm/depression that seemed initially like no particular big deal suddenly exploded to dump as much as 10 inches of rain in some areas, causing the Eno River to experience a record rise of more than 22 feet in four hours – a rise that beat even the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Fran in 1996 – and massive damage ensued.
Dozens of people had to be rescued, and scores of homes and businesses were damaged. Many major roads and highways were closed, damaged or both. At least one person died.
And, of course, the disastrous flooding here was just small potatoes compared to the horror that occurred in the Texas hill country just days before. At last count, the death toll there from a spate of summer thunderstorms had already surpassed 100, with many people still missing.
Meanwhile, this year’s Atlantic hurricane season has only just begun and, as the people of western North Carolina who saw their region devastated last fall by Hurricane Helene are painfully aware, won’t ramp up to full song until mid-August through late September.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s season promises to be another active one, with a range of 13 to 19 total named storms (winds of 39 mph or higher), 6-10 hurricanes (winds of 74 mph or higher), including 3-5 major hurricanes (category 3, 4 or 5; with winds of 111 mph or higher).
So, what gives? Tropical weather and flooding rains have always been fact of life in the eastern half of the United States. Are we just having a run of bad luck?
Unfortunately, the answer to the latter question is almost assuredly a loud and clear “no.”
While it’s true that there’s nothing new about bad weather, as scientists have been telling us for decades, the frequency and severity of modern storms is being greatly worsened by climate change.
As reporter Raymond Zhong of the New York Times reported on July 5:

        “Colossal bursts of rain like the ones that caused the deadly flooding in Texas are becoming more frequent and intense around the globe as the burning of fossil fuels heats the planet, scientists say.
Warm air holds more moisture than cool air, and as temperatures rise, storms can produce bigger downpours. When met on the ground with outdated infrastructure or inadequate warning systems, the results can be catastrophic.”    
At the same time, quite perversely, climate-change-driven drought and desertification continue to spread in other parts of the planet. The situation is especially acute in parts of Africa where they are contributing to widespread hunger and mass migration.
And tragically, these are situations that are only going to get worse and soon – especially if the planet’s rapidly growing human population continues to do little-to-nothing to curb its fossil fuel addiction, while simultaneously developing more and more open land with housing and other infrastructure in which speed and short-term profits trump sustainability.
In other words, this past weekend’s weather in our state was yet another wake-up call to the terrifying fact that we are in the midst of a global emergency that cries out for an urgent, all-hands-on-deck response from government, private industry, academia, and average people. While complete healing of the planet would take centuries, we can still minimize the damage in the decades to come by acting with speed, determination, urgency and creativity.
Quite amazingly and inexcusably, however, this is not the path our leaders are following. To the contrary, the Trump administration – abetted by Republicans in Congress and state legislatures like North Carolina’s – are doing the precise opposite of what is so urgently necessary.
As AP reported, the massive mega-bill signed into law by Trump last Friday “supports mining, drilling and production of the oil, coal and gas that are largely driving Earth’s warming and the increasingly deadly and costly extreme weather that comes with it,” while at the same time slashing “tax credits for clean technologies including wind and solar energy.”
Meanwhile, the bill’s answer to the migration crisis – a phenomenon fueled in part by climate change – is to ramp up the creation of a “show us your papers” police state that conjures up some of the worst imagery from authoritarian regimes Americans once considered the enemies of freedom.
And here in North Carolina, it’s expected that Republican legislative leaders will seek later this month to override Gov. Josh Stein’s veto of a bill that would roll back the state’s commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and spur the construction of more fossil fuel-fired power plants.
All in all, it’s a remarkable and maddening state of affairs. At a time of urgent environmental and human crises, our elected leaders have adopted a policy of not just fiddling while Rome burns and floods, but of conducting an entire symphony orchestra of delusional actions designed to expedite and worsen the destruction.
And the need for all Americans to rise up and demand an immediate reversal of this disastrous malfeasance could not be more urgent.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Texas-flooding-Getty2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 05:59:15.738250

(Screenshot by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Disclosure pop-ups about the “cookies,” or other aggregate bits of data websites collect and store aren’t an uncommon experience while shopping online. What’s less common: when a pop-up indicates that your potential purchase of condoms, birth control medication or menstrual hygiene products is being noted digitally, a message Virginians have started seeing when they shop virtually for such products. 
Since July 1, a new state law outlines that people’s personally identifiable reproductive or sexual health information cannot be obtained, disclosed, disseminated or sold without consumer consent. As new laws took effect in Virginia on July 1, Walmart has begun alerting customers about certain product or service searches and purchases.
“By viewing, searching for, or buying these products or services on our site, or using related features such as the Baby Registry, you consent to our use of this information to complete your purchase, provide the requested feature, and for general analytics, operations and fraud prevention,” a pop-up disclaimer now notifies people who visit Walmart’s website from within Virginia. 
If consumers don’t want their data connected to their sexual or reproductive health to be stored, the disclaimer suggests they “avoid viewing, searching for, using or purchasing these products, services, or features.”
But not all pop-ups are new or specifically focused on reproductive-related information. Other retailers like CVS have more broad disclaimers about data collection. Its site explains that information collected about consumer behaviors is used “to provide our products and services recommendations, understand how you engage with our site, and improve the services we offer you.”
It also warns that it may share data with “trusted third parties” that include marketing, analytics and research “partners.” 
This sort of data collection is a common practice in e-commerce and is a catalyst for targeted advertisements that people experience elsewhere on the internet, like their social media feeds or when using search engines. 
As the national reproductive health legal landscape shifts, including contraception and abortion access, some state and federal lawmakers have pressed for strengthened consumer protection laws surrounding reproductive health data. 
Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax and Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, have introduced and supported legislation to shore up these protections.
Surovell said the U.S. Congress’ “My Body, My Data Act,” a measure to protect menstrual health data introduced by Democratic lawmakers, inspired him to bring a similar effort to Virginia.  
“I don’t think a lot of people realize the information that private industry buys and sells about them,” he said in a recent call. 
He then worried about how law enforcement and government officials could use consumer data in the private sector. 
“I was concerned that attorneys generals in some other states who want to be more aggressive about prosecuting women or other people for helping women cross state lines to obtain either contraception or abortion services might use information that the private sector has in order to reverse engineer women and other people to prosecute,” Surovell said. 
Surrovell and Favola also worked on bills to prevent menstrual data from being subject to search warrants, which Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed into law.  Last year, Youngkin was lambasted by many, including former President Joe Biden and talk show host Stephen Colbert, for opposing the same bill in a previous legislative session. 
“It should go without saying that when a woman has her period or visits a doctor, it is nobody’s business but her own,” Favola said earlier this year. 
As more pregnant people travel to get abortions outside states where the medical procedure is banned or restricted, some states — including Alabama and Texas — have threatened legal repercussions for people who leave the state for an abortion, and for those who aid them.  
This year Favola’s Senate Bill 754 passed the Democrat-controlled legislature and Youngkin signed it. The law protects reproductive health data, often collected in period tracking digital apps, and allows consumers to sue if their data is sold or released without their consent. 
Walmart’s interpretation of the law prompted the pop-up disclaimer, and other companies will find their own way to follow suit.
“The companies are trying to figure out how to implement the bill,” Favola said in a text message. 
Next, Favola wants to explore how to further refine the bill to ensure people’s identifiable information is protected. 
“I made it clear that the law is focused on individually-identifiable data — not aggregate data,” she explained. “I expect to make some revisions next session.” 
Further details will be discussed in a workgroup later this summer, she said.

Heat-addled brains might explain the thinking of many Virginia lawmakers that what we need to do right now is burn more fossil fuels. 
Scientists have documented the way high temperatures affect the brain, impairing cognition and causing impulsivity and trouble concentrating. And this summer is already starting out hot, which is saying something given that 2024 was the hottest year on record, bumping 2023 off its baking pedestal. Scientists say this global fever is the natural result of burning fossil fuels and driving CO2 levels to their highest in millions of years.
Since burning more fossil fuels will drive more global warming, it’s exactly the reverse of what we should be doing.  Yes, but, these state leaders respond, how else are we going to power ever more data centers? 
Northern Virginia is the data center capital of the world, and data centers are notoriously power-hungry. Without them, Virginia electricity demand would be flat, and we could easily meet our electricity needs while gradually decarbonizing along the pathway laid out in the Virginia Clean Economy Act (VCEA).
Energy demands, regulations and federal funding challenge Virginia Clean Economy Act

Instead, Virginia taxpayers subsidize some of the richest corporations in America to the tune of almost a billion dollars every year to entice them to rip up land in Loudoun, Prince William and other Virginia counties instead of Atlanta or Dallas. In return, the tech companies keep construction workers busy, underwrite their host counties’ finances, make life miserable for nearby residents, raise everyone’s power bills, drain our rivers and aquifers and pollute our air with enough diesel generators to light up a major city.  
Virginia legislators obviously consider this a fair deal, because that’s what they keep voting for. Whether their constituents agree is another question; the evidence says they don’t.
For anyone just getting up to speed on data center issues, the Virginia Sierra Club’s new report, “Unconstrained Demand: Virginia’s Data Center Expansion and Its Impacts” (to which I contributed), covers the current state of data center development in Virginia and the problems that come with it. Fun fact: More than half of all the nation’s energy consumption attributed to data centers occurs in Virginia. 
That puts a special burden of leadership on our lawmakers. If we allow data centers to undermine our sustainability efforts here, we can only expect a race to the bottom in other states. As Virginia goes, so goes the nation. 
And yet we haven’t heard much outcry from Virginia leaders against the plans of our largest utility to build new generating plants powered by fracked gas. Dominion Energy laid out its plans in its 2024 integrated resource plan as well as a proposal for a 944 megawatts of gas combustion turbines in Chesterfield now pending before the State Corporation Commission. 
Dominion and its allies say more gas is needed for reliability, which could make it allowable under the VCEA. Indeed, “reliability” is a word that fossil fuel advocates frequently toss down like a trump card (in the unpresidential sense but with the same lack of thoughtful analysis). The claim is suspect. Fussing about reliability when your state ranks 24th in the nation for renewable energy is like worrying about the taxes you’ll owe if you win the lottery: we should be so lucky. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Republican legislators are explicit in wanting to see the VCEA repealed and more gas plants built. Democrats defend the VCEA’s goals, but worry about the challenges of implementation and the effect on electricity rates. They all cite data center demand as the reason they contemplate backsliding on clean energy.
I wish I could say that our rich and powerful tech companies were aggressively championing carbon-free energy for their data centers in Virginia, but they are not. I attended a meeting of the Commission on Electric Utility Regulation where legislators were hashing out the problems of too much demand and too little supply. Representatives from the Data Center Coalition stood in the back of the room, observing but refusing to engage. Out of sight, they successfully lobbied against any bills that would slow the data center boom, force them to absorb more of its costs, or require them to source their own clean energy. 
Publicly, many tech companies tout their commitments to decarbonization. Amazon says it even met its goal to run its operations entirely on renewable energy. Yes, and I’m the Queen of Sheba. In fact, these companies are in a fierce competition to develop artificial intelligence as fast as possible. They’d like carbon-free power, but really, they’ll take whatever energy they can get wherever they can get it, and even among the industry’s best actors, climate now takes a back seat. 
Yet the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos would not be significantly worse off if forced to meet their climate commitments. Virginia leaders know – or at any rate, they have been exposed to the information, which I realize is not the same thing – that building new fossil gas generating plants is not just bad for the planet but more expensive than pursuing carbon-free alternatives.
Renewables face setback under sweeping federal spending bill

Oh, I know, Congress just yanked back the federal tax incentives that helped make wind and solar as cheap as it is, one of the myriad ill-considered elements of the big beautiful debt bomb Republicans adopted against everyone’s better judgment. (Apparently heat affects spines as well as brains.) With passage of that bill, developers will need to have begun construction on new facilities by this time next year in order to qualify for the existing tax credits. 
There will be a mad rush to get construction underway immediately for facilities in the development pipeline. Thereafter, projects on the margin won’t get built. But others will, because even the loss of federal subsidies won’t destroy solar’s competitive edge against most new-build gas. 
Even so, utilities and their customers will pay higher prices for unsubsidized new renewable energy – as well as for existing fossil fuel generation that will command higher prices in the coming supply crunch. The Clean Energy Buyers Association estimates that commercial electricity costs in Virginia will be about 10% higher after the phase-out of federal incentives. 
A years-long backlog for orders of gas turbines will further squeeze energy supply and drive up prices for fossil power. On the plus side, the lack of available turbines will make fast-to-deploy solar not just the better option, but sometimes the only option.
I’ve never understood the conservative love affair with fossil fuels, when today’s clean technology is cleaner, cheaper and quicker to deploy. Trump would like to crush wind and solar altogether, which would eliminate 90% of the power capacity waiting to be connected to the grid and catapult the U.S into a serious energy crisis. In addition to much higher power prices, observers warn we would likely see a loss of data centers and other energy-intensive industries to parts of the world that are not on a mission to kill low-cost clean energy. 
Well, that would be one way to rid Virginia of the data center scourge.
Fortunately, the worst attacks on solar in Trump’s budget bomb did not survive, but the bill should nonetheless serve as a wake-up call for Virginia leaders. With little time left to secure federal clean energy incentives, our utilities need to acquire all the solar and storage they can right now. With or without data centers, locking in as much fuel-free generation as possible while it’s available at a discount is a prudent move to avoid the coming shortages and escalating costs of energy.
As for the tech companies, lawmakers should embrace the simplest approach to this problem, which happens also to be the one that spares ordinary Virginians from bearing the costs of the data center buildout: shifting responsibility for sourcing electricity onto the companies themselves, and requiring that they live up to their climate claims by making the power they buy carbon-free. 
It’s an approach other states can follow, holding Big Tech to the same responsibility no matter where they put their data centers. Certainly the tech titans can afford it; they just won big with massive tax cuts that our poorest residents will pay for. 
No doubt they will complain. Everyone would like somebody else to pay for what benefits them. But Virginians can’t afford to subsidize Big Tech, and we don’t want to. 
As for those legislators who think we should continue to do it anyway – well, all I can think is, it’s got to be the heat.

The Richmond resident has been to Amsterdam, Paris and Berlin — places widely considered some of the most bicycle friendly cities in the world.
“Every time I travel somewhere, I try to check out the transit and the biking if I can,” he said.
When PeopleForBikes’ national report highlighting the best places to bike debuted in late June, Virginia cities ranked low on the list. The news comes after the state has beefed up bike infrastructure to improve access and safety for cyclists. According to a bicycle inventory map released in April, the Commonwealth boasts roughly 1,600 miles of shared-use paths, which include 967 miles of bicycle lanes — many of them buffered. 
Richmond is ranked 37th in the state, just below the cities of Norfolk (35th) and well below Arlington, which came in third in the state. All three are considered midsize cities. The rankings consider if bike infrastructure is close to where people live, if they can bike to jobs, schools, grocery and retail stories, and if they can access public transportation.
Virginia Safe Routes to School programs see future funding in jeopardy

“This is a data driven process,” said Grace Stonecipher, infrastructure analytics and research manager for PeopleForBikes, which has released the report for eight years. “We’re using the same data on every single city all around the world. And we’re using the best available data.”
Stonecipher said they take in information on roads and bike infrastructure and rate every street as high stress or low stress, which includes things like speed limits, number of lanes and what the impact that bike infrastructure is having on the street.
For Allen and some officials in the state’s capital city, the report triggered both surprise and skepticism.
“I think any sort of huge aggregate rankings like that, you have to take with a grain of salt,” he said. 
 Despite recent infrastructure improvements, Richmond ranks low

Richmond’s low ranking strikes Allen as odd, considering biking infrastructure improvements he’s witnessed over the past 10 years. 
“The infrastructure has gotten much better. Back when I first came here, I don’t think there was any,” Allen said. “There might have been a few striped bike lanes, but as far as something really safe and dedicated, there was nothing, and now there is a decent amount.”
The ranking also doesn’t sit well with Richmond city officials. In an email to the Virginia Mercury, they said even though PeopleForBikes appears to “have an up-to-date inventory of bike infrastructure, including recent trail projects, the methodology used for rating stress levels, while interesting, does not make sense.”
The report includes streets that are not in the city and are not owned by the city, officials cited. Cities like Richmond and counties are in charge of most of their streets, while the Virginia Department of Transportation manages the rest, such as Broad Street, as well as state highways.  
Richmond touts more than 80 miles of bike lanes and that they’ve been globally recognized by the “Dutch Cycling Embassy,” also pointed out, “and the National Association of City Transportation Officials have been praising Richmond’s approach to city building.”
New bike bill hopes to make streets safer for cyclists

Stonecipher said part of the reasons some cities’ ranking may be low is because of a lack of information provided by city officials. 
“All of our infrastructure data comes from OpenStreetMap, a platform where folks can go in and update their data themselves,” she said. “Every year before we do the city ratings, we send out a big email that says, ‘All right, everybody get in there and update your data. Show us all the cool things that you’ve done this year.’ And so we are reliant on public involvement.”
She said that because they’re rating so many cities around the world, they can’t go into every single city themselves, but “we love to work with local advocates, partners, (and) city planners to make sure that that data is as accurate as possible.”
Allen does say that the rankings are a good reminder that even though the city has come far over the past decade, there’s still a lot of work to do. 
“I think the takeaway is that, yes, this may not be the most perfect rating system, but I think it does highlight the places where we still need to make some improvements,” he said.
 So what’s the best biking city in Virginia? 

Cape Charles ranked as the number one biking spot in the commonwealth and also ranks 51st in the nation. Cape Charles is a small, Eastern Shore beach town in Northampton County with just under 1,300 residents. 
But is it fair to compare Cape Charles to larger cities? 
“One thing I noticed right off the bat is that all the rankings favor small cities,” said Allen. “Cape Charles, which I’ve been to, I wouldn’t say it’s like a biking paradise. It’s basically a town of three streets next to the bay.”
This is why PeopleForBikes allows users to use filters, such as by population, when selecting the best places to bike. The tool works best when people use it keeping context in mind.
“I would encourage folks to dig into the maps and try to understand why,” she said. “Roads that have bike infrastructure might still be high stress. Maybe you have bike lanes on two streets, but getting across the street is really difficult because the bike infrastructure stops 20 feet before the intersection.”
If residents of any locality are unsatisfied with their city or county’s ranking, they can put PeopleForBikes’ SPRINT principles into action to improve their score. The principles — which include safe speeds, protected bike lanes, reallocated space, intersection treatments, network connections and trusted data —  and their framework “enable your city to change high-stress streets into low-stress streets, providing safe and comfortable routes for bicyclists of all ages and abilities,” PeopleForBikes website reads.

(Photo courtesy of NBC12)After tragic flooding in Texas claimed dozens of lives and wreaked havoc in several communities, Virginia weather and emergency officials are pitching in to the Lone Star State’s recovery efforts and sharing how they prepare for major weather events here at home..
Gov. Glenn Youngkin on Sunday announced two of the state’s swift water rescue teams have been deployed to assist with rescue operations in Texas, as the state braces for more rain after flash flooding devastated its central region. The rescue teams are equipped with gear that is meant for traversing treacherous waters.
“Our hearts go out to the families and communities in Texas who have been devastated by these historic floods,” Youngkin said in a statement. “We stand in solidarity with the people of Texas, and we are committed to offering any and all support requested during this critical time.”
Before a weather event occurs, meteorologists from the National Weather Service’s regional offices provide critical forecasts. They are able, in most situations, to project how a weather system could move through the area and the best and worst case scenarios for storms. That information is relayed to state and local agencies who determine how to warn the public, stage supplies or possibly enact evacuation plans.
“Giving them that information so they can prepare and get assets to where they need to be situated is critical, well ahead of the storm,” said Michael Dutter, science and operations officers for the National Weather Service in Wakefield, one of three NWS offices in Virginia. “And then giving them frequent updates and any changes.”
The General Assembly invested over $102 million into the Department of Emergency Management for the current fiscal year. Those funds go towards emergency preparedness initiatives, recovery efforts, information systems and other related expenses.
Dutter said with some weather systems it can be hard to predict the exact rainfall amounts or a gauge of how the waterways will react to certain storms. For example, Tropical Storm Chantal, which developed off the coast of the Carolinas over the weekend, was disorganized last week, leading to a more challenging forecast for NWS scientists. In those cases, they have to work closely with agencies to give updates when their models update.
“We can give some good ideas about what could happen and other times we can’t. So I think that’s one of the harder things to really convey. People need to know information as soon as we know so they can make decisions. But sometimes we don’t know either, until the event gets closer,” Dutter said.
The Virginia Department of Emergency Management prompts the Virginia Emergency Support Team (VEST) to communicate with municipalities and first responders in disaster situations. Since the state is no stranger to severe water events, VDEM has a flood intel unit that focuses on flood impacts and makes risk-based decisions. They also use data from the gauge system to help predict how a storm may impact communities downstream.
“Our gauge network is important because it affords us to observe near real-time data to influence better prediction of downstream effects. These predictions and early warnings help keep Virginians safe – especially in underserved communities that may lack observational data to support residents and public safety officials,” a VDEM spokesperson said.
The department provides numerous resources to help communities plan for flood events and be able to monitor the rain gauges themselves so businesses can make informed decisions during a weather event.
Virginia has diverse geography that creates unique challenges in weather events. VDEM maps out its focus areas for each region of the commonwealth. 
“In the western regions of Virginia, steep terrain and deep valleys alternate to produce numerous micro-climates, each potentially different from the broader regional picture. The central Virginia urban corridor encompasses higher population density which can make a small shift of location in a forecasted rainfall event affect a significant amount of people and higher amounts of critical infrastructure,” the agency stated. Eastern and coastal Virginia possess thousands of miles of coastline and numerous small towns, all uniquely at risk of tidal flooding, flash flooding, and storm surge.”

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

Ryan Braunberger first introduced a slate of tenant protection bills this year, he knew the odds of passage weren’t in his favor. Braunberger, a Democratic lawmaker in a Republican-controlled legislature who represents a renter-heavy district in Fargo, spent years as a housing advocate — walking tenants through eviction court, helping them navigate late fees and lease violations.
But inside the statehouse, he was an outlier: one of the only legislators who rents his home.
By the end of the legislative session, just one of his five proposals passed. But that one might prove to be a major overhaul of the state’s eviction process.
The bill came together thanks to an unlikely lawmaking alliance: a renter and housing advocate with deep policy knowledge, and a Republican who hadn’t previously focused on eviction law but quickly saw its impact in his district.
Co-sponsored by Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta, the legislation allows tenants to petition to have eviction records sealed after seven years, if they’ve resolved any outstanding rent or damages and stayed eviction-free during that time.
“I didn’t know much about this process, but when Sen. Braunberger reached out to me, I looked into just how much an eviction from years ago was possibly affecting renters and constituents in my district,” said Barta. “As a new lawmaker, you’re still getting settled in, so it was good to dive into an issue that hits home to my district.”
Nationally, North Dakota has joined a slow but steady stream of states that seal or expunge eviction records.
Eviction filings are public and often lack case outcomes or context, yet they’re widely used by screening companies, creating barriers even when tenants win or cases are dismissed. A 2020 study of 3.6 million eviction records across a dozen states by Princeton University’s Eviction Lab found that 22% of the records were ambiguous or falsely represented a tenant’s past.
Black women, especially those with children, are disproportionately affected by evictions. Young children and infants are affected more than any other age group.
Barta noted that many North Dakotans are evicted for financial reasons or may be fleeing domestic violence, and that holding old evictions against tenants prevents them from rebuilding stability.
“That’s really what caught my eye,” Barta said. “I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. They were fleeing violence or hit by one bad break.”
Grand Forks, which is in Barta’s district, is more than 50% renter-occupied, making it one of the most tenant-heavy in the state, thanks in part to its proximity to the University of North Dakota. Grand Forks has also seen rents climb and vacancy rates tighten, while evictions — sometimes stemming from as little as a few hundred dollars of unpaid rent — can leave permanent marks on a tenant’s record.
“Most landlords wouldn’t even give people a second chance once they saw an eviction on someone’s record,” Braunberger said. “It didn’t matter if the case was from a decade ago or if it had been resolved. That record stuck to them like glue.”










If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate. That’s almost a given here. 


– North Dakota Democratic state Sen. Ryan Braunberger


The North Dakota Apartment Association opposed the measure, citing concerns that it could allow sealing of eviction records even when the eviction stemmed from issues beyond domestic violence, such as nonpayment or other lease violations. Lobbyist Jeremy Petron testified that the bill could undermine property managers’ ability to assess tenant risk through background checks.
“Property owners and property managers rely on background checks for decisions on prospective tenant approvals for the safety of neighbors and the property, and the business investment risk,” Petron testified.
Compromises
Passage of North Dakota’s law required not only bipartisanship but also key compromises outside the legislature. Early drafts proposed full expungement, a term that drew sharp criticism from the North Dakota judiciary, which warned the language implied a permanent erasure of legal history without proper oversight.
In response, lawmakers worked with the state Supreme Court and housing groups to shift toward sealing records instead, a more limited measure than expungement.
Most states tend to seal records rather than expunge them.
North Dakota’s Administrative Rule 41, which governs access to court records, is now being updated to reflect the new law. Sealed eviction records will be categorized as confidential, but they won’t be deleted outright. And not all evictions will qualify: Tenants must have no further evictions within seven years, and must resolve any unpaid rent or damages related to the original filing.
“After talking with the Supreme Court and apartment associations, we landed on a compromise: sealing,” Braunberger said. “It preserves judicial records while still giving tenants a fair shot at moving on.”
Sara Behrens, a staff attorney with the State Court Administrator’s Office, said the final version addressed the court’s concerns.
“Without these amendments, any eviction could be sealed following seven years regardless of further evictions or outstanding judgments,” she said. “That was a serious flaw we were able to correct.”
Despite North Dakota’s Republican supermajority, the legislation passed with overwhelming support: 35-12 in the Senate and 88-5 in the House. Both Barta and Braunberger attributed the success to North Dakota’s relatively open political culture.
“Even though we have a supermajority, there’s not a ton of separation,” Barta said. “We talk. We listen.”
Braunberger echoed that sentiment. “If I want any policy to move, I have to collaborate,” he said. “That’s almost a given here.”
Yet the sealing law was only a partial win in a broader tenant rights agenda for Braunberger. Three other bills — ranging from caps landlords can impose on late rent fees to investigations into tenant-landlord matters — died in committee or failed to gain traction. Braunberger said he plans to reintroduce some of them next session.
“It’s a civil matter, so people don’t have a right to counsel,” Braunberger said of tenant legal proceedings. “That’s something I’d love to change. No one should lose their home without legal help.”
Both lawmakers pointed to next steps beyond legislation. Barta emphasized the need for better communication and education to help tenants understand leases, rights and processes. Braunberger wants more incentives for mediation, saying it can reduce financial losses for both landlords and renters and keep disputes out of court.
Elsewhere
Last year, Idaho, Maryland and Massachusetts enacted laws to seal certain eviction records from public scrutiny and from tenant screening companies. Massachusetts’ law just went into effect in May, while Maryland’s law is scheduled for October.
In Indiana, a new law allows courts to seal eviction filings automatically in three circumstances: dismissal of the case, judgment in favor of a tenant or reversal on appeal. The automatic sealing reduces the burden on tenants to petition on their own.
Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and South Carolina are among states that introduced eviction-sealing laws this year. Those bills, which still await passage in both legislative chambers, vary on the conditions of sealing.










I need to be aware of what my constituents are facing. Some people weren’t evicted for being irresponsible. 


– North Dakota Republican state Sen. Jeff Barta


This June, Nevada Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed two high-profile tenant protection bills. One would have automatically sealed certain eviction records, and another sought to slow the state’s fast-track summary eviction process.
In his veto of the eviction sealing bill, Lombardo said it was “lopsided, red-tape laden, and would have disastrous consequences on Nevada’s housing market.”
He argued the bill would overburden courts, eliminate judicial discretion and “risks punishing” property owners by shifting procedural responsibilities onto them.
Lack of eviction data obscures extent of the affordable housing crisis

Pennsylvania’s proposal, which would keep fault-based eviction records public for seven years, would limit access to records of no-fault evictions, in which a landlord asks a tenant to move out for reasons such as wanting occupancy or to sell the property. It passed the House by 105-98, thanks to a few Republican votes.
Kansas’ proposal would offer automatic expungement after two years unless debts remain, and South Carolina’s bill would seal all eviction records in circumstances in which an eviction case is filed but doesn’t lead to an actual eviction order within 30 days, or six years after a case was closed.
North Dakota’s bipartisan success with its new sealing law positions the state as one with lawmakers finding common ground on housing problems.
“We have a housing crisis,” Braunberger said. “Some areas can’t even attract employers because there’s no place for workers to live. Until we fix that, housing policy isn’t just social policy, it’s economic policy.”

(Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)As Maine faces strain from cuts under the federal budget signed into law last week, some are eyeing tax increases on the wealthy as a mitigation strategy. 
In a letter to Maine’s congressional delegation last week, Gov. Janet Mills warned that the state can’t bear the loss of federal funding from several different avenues.
Currently, one out of every $5 in Maine’s economy comes from the federal government, which means the state relies heavily on federal resources, according to Garrett Martin, president and CEO of the progressive Maine Center for Economic Policy. The loss of federal funding could somewhat be cushioned by raising taxes on the highest earners, he said, but the governor has been resistant to such a change.
“We are still leaving money on the table that could make a difference in terms of our ability to not only absorb these cuts,” Martin said, “but also to expand and continue to provide the kinds of services that we know help position people to be in a better place, to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.”
Federal changes to tax code
Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine attempted to raise taxes on the ultra-wealthy with an amendment — which the Senate rejected — to the GOP budget bill. 
Maine’s entire congressional delegation ultimately voted against the budget that President Donald Trump signed into law on the Fourth of July, though Collins earlier cast a procedural vote to advance it. The budget extends the tax cuts predominantly benefitting high-income earners from Trump’s first term that were set to expire at the end of the year and adds additional tax breaks, but it also includes dozens of other provisions spanning border security, defense, health care and more. 
In her amendment, Collins proposed creating a new top marginal tax rate for the nation’s wealthiest income earners and using that revenue to double the size of a proposed rural hospital relief fund from $25 billion to $50 billion. 
“Rural providers, especially our rural hospitals and nursing homes, are under great financial strain right now, with many having recently closed and others being at risk of closing,” Collins said on the floor before the amendment vote. “This amendment would help keep them open and caring for those who live in rural communities.”
Susan Collins has reached a pinnacle of authority. How will she use it?

Millions of Americans are expected to lose access to Medicaid, the state-federal health program for lower income people and some people with disabilities, through the budget’s slashed spending and new requirements. Collins described some of the cuts to Medicaid as “problematic” but said she supported adding work requirements to the health program, which constituted the largest cut.
In a statement to Politico after her addition failed, Collins criticized most Democrats for voting against it. “They’ve complained repeatedly about the distribution in this bill, of Medicaid cuts hurting individuals, rural hospitals, and tax cuts being extended for people who are wealthy,” Collins told Politico, “and yet when I tried to fix both those problems, they took a very hypocritical approach.”
U.S. Sen. Angus King of Maine was one of the few who voted for the amendment.
Meanwhile, Democrats argued it would be more logical to not cut $1 trillion from Medicaid in the first place, with Democratic U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon characterizing Collins’ amendment as a “Band-Aid on an amputation.” 
Maine still weighing a “millionaire’s tax” 
This session, the Maine Legislature considered raising taxes on the wealthy but opted to postpone deciding on the proposal until next year.  
Referred to as a “millionaire’s tax,” LD 1089 would place a tax surcharge of 2% on the portion of a resident’s taxable income beyond $1 million for single filers to be used to fund public K-12 education. 
After both chambers rejected the bill in initial votes, the Maine Senate later reversed its stance but the Maine House of Representatives did not take it up again before the Legislature adjourned last month. Instead, lawmakers included LD 1089 in a joint order carrying over the legislation into 2026, the second year of the 132nd session. 
Maine’s tax system does more to address income inequality than many other states’ structures, but only up until a point. While the share of income Maine’s poorest residents pay in taxes is lower than that paid by the wealthiest in the state, the richest actually pay a lower share of their earnings in taxes than middle income people.
“The bill before you today simply asks for our richest to share a slice of bread with those who turned the dough and made the loaf for them to eat,” bill sponsor Rep. Cheryl Golek (D-Harpswell) testified before the Taxation Committee when presenting her plan. “Our economy shouldn’t be balanced on the backs of the working class, yet it is.”  
While a millionaire’s tax could still be considered by the Legislature next year, it faces a steep path to passage. Mills is opposed to any income-based tax reform and her administration testified against LD 1089. 
Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy in Maine’s Department of Administrative and Financial Services, warned the Taxation Committee that the surcharge would apply to a small population of taxpayers who have considerable control over when, where and whether to spend and often rely on volatile income sources, such as capital gains. 
“These factors mean this surcharge would be a volatile source of income for the state, which would increase the challenge of managing the state’s fiscal position and would likely increase the size of a revenue shortfall during an economic downturn,” Allen said.
During debate in the chambers, some lawmakers raised concern that wealthy people will leave if their taxes increase, but overall out migration has shown to be minimal in other states that have imposed similar tax increases. 
Originally, LD 1089 sought to tax income over $1 million by a higher amount — an additional 4% — which would have mirrored a law passed in Massachusetts two years ago. The number of ultra wealthy residents in Massachusetts has grown since then, according to a study released this spring from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive research group. 
A pro-business coalition has pushed back, pointing out that the data used to determine income also included investments, which the surcharge does not apply to, and that the Massachusetts Society of CPAs has raised concern about the number of high-income clients changing their primary state of residence. However, the authors of the IPS report argued that while some may be motivated to leave because of the surcharge, it has been a small minority so far. 
Martin pointed to such findings when arguing that the state is still capable of mitigating the cuts likely coming from the federal level. The budget’s tax breaks for the wealthy will also in turn reduce government revenue.
“Part of what we can do is, at a minimum, make sure that the wealthy people, who are benefiting the most from the federal changes, pay their fair share at the state level,” Martin said. 
The Maine Legislature also carried over a bill, LD 229, which would increase the base of the state’s tax brackets. It would do this by both increasing the number of tax brackets and by adding a top tax bracket for high income earners.
LD 1879, which would raise the tax rate on corporations to support the agricultural economy, has also been carried over. Mills has already publicly opposed both bills.

Kelly Ayotte signed a bill last month that establishes a study committee for housing investment trusts. (Getty Images)For developers of affordable housing, one problem often towers over the others: finding funding.
By pledging to keep rents low, property owners may be providing needed opportunities. But that lower rent can mean lower returns, and a slimmer chance that lenders will approve financing. 
The result is that successful affordable housing projects are often cobbled together with a mix of funding mechanisms, from private financing to state and federal affordable housing dollars, many of which are competitive to obtain. 
This year, some lawmakers are exploring establishing a new type of funding option to add to the mix: the housing investment trust. 
Proponents are pushing for a law allowing for a trust that could operate as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, accept donations and other funds, and develop or restore buildings for housing development. And last month, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation, House Bill 633, to study the issue.
The proposal has been championed by Michael Dell Orfano, an Amherst real estate developer, and Rep. Gary Daniels, a Milford Republican. As originally introduced, HB 633 would have created a new form of investment trust in New Hampshire law known as the housing investment trust, and require that trust to be a charitable organization.
The original bill would have also required that there be three trustees to oversee that trust, which could be a resident, a different charitable organization, a bank, or a credit union. 
After that, the original bill is silent on how the trust might carry out charitable activity to support housing. Dell Orfano says the trust could buy land or properties, renovate buildings, develop units, and create arrangements allowing those units to be rented affordably. 
The trust would have to be either a qualifying tax-exempt organization under 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, or be recognized as charitable under the state’s definition.
Funding for the trust, according to Dell Orfano, could come from a revolving loan fund that could accept investments from outside funds or individuals and re-invest the returns on those investments into the fund.
Dell Orfano has proposed three investment classes within the fund: a debt class, a capital gains class, and a class for self-directed investments. 
“The important takeaway here is that that is entirely independent,” said Dell Orfano, speaking about the revolving fund. “You think of Fidelity, Wellington Management, or New Hampshire’s own Pax World funds. These are the financial institutions that we’ll eventually be dealing with.” 
In total, the mechanism could allow developers to access financing aside from state, federal, or other private funds, supporters say.
“What we are bringing to you is something unique, something we haven’t really seen in this legislature before, and that’s a private sector solution that can be added to the toolbox,” said Daniels, speaking to the Senate Commerce Committee. “We see plenty of bills coming in that look to do different things with the public sector funds.”
That tool could create the possibility of innovative housing developments, supporters say.
New Hampshire continues to experience a severe housing crisis, as median home prices have hit record levels and as rents rise faster than median income levels. Housing trusts, supporters say, could allow for arrangements such as traditional rental units, cooperative housing, supportive housing, and others, and could make those arrangements short term or long term.
But lawmakers say they need more time to understand the trusts before moving ahead with creating them, and by the time the bill left the House Judiciary Committee in March, the committee had proposed amending it to be a study committee.
“Although establishing another study committee is not ideal, the Judiciary Committee believes this is an important enough issue given the housing crisis that the House should investigate in collaboration with the (Senate),” wrote Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican who is also the chairman of the House Housing Committee, in March. 
That version, which Ayotte signed in June, will create a committee of three house members and one senator, who will work to produce a report by Nov. 1.
The investment trust proposal has received the endorsement of Housing Action New Hampshire, which supports affordable housing developments; New Hampshire Housing, the state agency that operates the affordable housing fund; and NeighborWorks, a nonprofit developer of affordable homes.
And it models arrangements in other states, such as Arizona, which allows counties to establish housing trust funds to make similar investments. 
In testimony to lawmakers this year, Robert Tourigny, executive director of NeighborWorks Southern New Hampshire, said the trusts could allow for both preservation of historical homes and buildings and the creation of new supply. 
“One of the challenges associated with preserving affordability has been the limited financing mechanisms available to consumers outside of conventional long-term financing,” Tourigny said. “A housing investment trust will provide an opportunity to leverage private capital while maintaining affordability for the homebuyer.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/housingmarket-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 05:59:15.738250

The newly established legal procedure gives defendants a tool to dismiss frivolous lawsuits filed suppress their protected speech.
According to the Institute for Free Speech, 38 states have now passed laws protecting against strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP.
The lawsuit concerns a divorced couple. The ex-wife, Maegin George, works as a nurse while the ex-husband, Jonathan George, is president of Conn’s Potato Chips.

Jonathan George filed a defamation suit alleging that after he began a new relationship, Maegin George falsely accused him of pedophilia, incest, and attempting to pay for sex.
Maegin George argues she has not said many of the things her ex-husband claims, and what she has said is not defamatory and protected by the First Amendment.
She’s asking the court to conduct an anti-SLAPP review and dismiss the case.
Ohio’s law
State lawmakers approved Ohio’s anti-SLAPP statute, Senate Bill 237, in the final days of the last legislative session. In both chambers, the measure passed without a single ‘no’ vote.
The bill’s co-sponsors, state Sens. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville, and Theresa Gavarone, R-Bowling Green, explained SLAPP suits can take several different forms, including defamation or nuisance lawsuits. What holds them together, though, is their aim — to “silence or intimidate an individual for exercising their rights to free speech.”
“Such lawsuits,” Gavarone explained in committee, “send a message to potential critics that those who speak out will face stress, time commitments, and expensive legal bills over a period of months or even years that many defendants cannot endure.”
The proposal had the backing of a wide array of interest groups, from the ACLU and news organizations to domestic violence groups and the state bar. Ohio’s measure adopts language drafted by the Uniform Law Commission, a non-partisan group of lawyers, judges and professors who develop draft legislation that states can adopt.
The law establishes a fast-track review process, where defendants can argue the lawsuit is frivolous or related to their protected speech. Filing that motion halts other proceedings like discovery, which limits costs and so-called fishing expedition tactics. Both parties have opportunities to appeal along the way, but if the judge determines the lawsuit is meant to stifle speech, it gets dismissed.
The engine driving SLAPP suits, ACLU chief lobbyist Gary Daniels explained, is a power or financial imbalance between the two parties.
“A well-known scenario is grassroots activists speaking out about environmental, safety, or other concerns only to be sued or countersued for their advocacy,” Daniels said. The person filing a SLAPP suit against them doesn’t care if they win or lose in court. “Instead, they know the massive costs of litigation and legal defense act as a barrier against those without adequate financial resources to fight back and defend themselves.”
Monica Nieporte from the Ohio News Media Association explained news outlets are a frequent target of the SLAPP playbook.
“Newspapers in Ohio have been sued for defamation simply for running an article, editorial, or even a political cartoon,” she told state lawmakers. “The goal of these suits is not to prevail and receive damages, but to stifle and suppress protected expression.”
More troubling, Bridget Mahoney explained, without anti-SLAPP legislation on the books, abusers can turn the court system against their victims. Mahoney is the former board chair of the Ohio Domestic Violence Network. Divorcing her abusive ex-husband started a 20-year court battle. When Mahoney and her daughter began advocating for other survivors, Mahoney’s ex-husband filed a defamation case. She described depositions and discovery stretching on for years, forcing her to relive some of her worst experiences and costing her more than $100,000.
“Anyone in Ohio who comes forward to tell their story or report a sexual assault are vulnerable to the same debilitating frivolous lawsuit that we endured,” Mahoney said. She stressed that the law wouldn’t limit her ex-husband or anyone else’s right to sue. “What it will do is give us and others like us a tool so that we are safer to exercise our freedom of speech.”
The case in Cambridge
Maegin George sees something similar in the case Jonathan George filed against her. She filed sworn statements from the people referenced in ex-husband’s complaint stating she never alleged he “committed any sexual misconduct, incest, or pedophilia.” She acknowledged telling one individual that he was friends with a minor on Snapchat but made no accusation of incest.
She goes on to argue her “communications, to the extent they occurred, addressed issues of public concern — particularly the safety and propriety of Mr. George’s interactions with minors — and thus are shielded by the First Amendment.”
That point is key to the new anti-SLAPP case analysis. The process plays out in three steps. First, the judge must determine if the allegations arise from protected speech. Next, the court has to weigh whether those initial allegations are legitimate on their face. Finally, the judge considers if the underlying case is legally viable.
In short, the process asks the court to take a long hard look at what’s being alleged before submitting both parties to a potentially arduous and costly ordeal.
Maegin George’s attorney Austin Warehime argues the case against her is often vague and poorly supported by the evidence.
“Ohio finally has a powerful shield for everyday people who speak out,” he argued, noting the case is one of the first anti-SLAPP motions in the state. “We’re asking the court to apply that shield exactly as the legislature intended — swiftly and decisively.”
Sam Shamansky, the attorney representing Jonathan George dismissed those claims out of hand.
“The notion that our client is trying to suppress protected free speech is literally nonsensical,” he said.
Shamansky called the contention that George is a public figure because he heads up a prominent local business “utter bulls—.”
“Does that mean anybody that owns a business is a public figure? It’s absurd,” he said, adding they’re looking forward to their day in court.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border, and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky, and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses, and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Kevin Hardy/Stateline)Kansans now confront a “big, beautiful bill” approved by 218 Republican puppets in the U.S. House, and then signed into law by a convicted felon who was found guilty of sexual abuse, and who has faced multiple criminal cases over the past few years. Many of his indictments went to the core principles of our democracy. Unlike the average American, he has been given free pass after free pass by a Supreme Court that exists primarily to do his bidding — never mind right and wrong.
Is all of this part of a bad dream? If only that were the case.
We are bombarded by distortions perpetuated by hundreds of millions of dollars of “dark money” used via social media. Our reliance on that device in the palm of our hands has become a seductive tool to manipulate the masses. It’s how our president was bought and sold. Those devices supposedly foster connections, but the reality seems to be that they fuel isolation, especially at a time when we need to talk to each other.
How to make sense of the absurd? How to square any of this with the founding principles of this country, or with the role that the United States has come to play in an increasingly troubled world? I am not certain that Camus and Kafka, working in collaboration, could put all of this madness into words.
We now confront darkness.
For those of us old enough to remember, words from one of the most memorable Simon and Garfunkel songs come to mind: “Hello, darkness, my old friend, I’ve come to talk to you again.” Darkness leads to isolation, and that leads to lack of communication, along with feelings of hopelessness. There is much darkness now among a large segment of the population as we see actions, and hear words, that we know reveal a lack of morality, of decency, among many of our elected officials.


How to cope with these feelings? How to figure out how to make a difference?
For me, strength comes from being in a place that brings good memories, comfort and perspective. That place is in the midst of an ocean of wheat on one of our farms. I stand alone with my thoughts, in the presence of earth and sky as far as my eyes can see. I realize that I am but a speck in the universe, but I gain strength in knowing that, by my actions, I can make a difference.
Darkness is countered by light. By speaking out, and speaking the truth, we can begin to bring about change. There is fear among the populace about speaking out, because we have already seen some actions from this administration that are eerily reminiscent of tactics used by prior and current fascist regimes.
A student whom I am mentoring asked me about taking a summer job with a law firm that had caved into demands from the Trump administration.
She asked: “How do I decide?”
I said the answer is simple — look in the mirror and ask yourself if you are doing the right thing. Your conscience will be your guide. That basic idea applies here, too. My mirror is my wheat field. For others, it may be an actual mirror, or it could be some other place, another person or a certain event in your life.
Just remember that, in these dark times, silence in the midst of what you know is wrong will lead only to more darkness. Remember that we have a limited number of days. Why speak out? Because it matters.

When North Carolinians elected Gov. Josh Stein last fall by a wide margin over former Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, they made clear they wanted to put a check on GOP lawmakers’ ambitions to take the state down extreme right-wing paths.
And in recent days, to his great credit, Stein has validated the trust that voters placed in him by vetoing a series of extreme and ill-conceived bills.
As the governor made clear in rejecting bills that would, among other things, roll back environmental protections and raise residential electric bills, invest new and unprecedented powers in the state auditor, effectively deregulate charter schools, and enact a virtually incoherent ban on diversity, equity and inclusion in state government, Republican lawmakers have lost their way.
The bottom line: At a time when teachers, law enforcement, and state employees need pay raises and people need shorter lines at the DMV, Stein observed, the legislature needs to get to work and pass a budget and stop wasting time with divisive culture war bills.
And the voters said: Amen.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)“As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.” The old adage used to apply to the state when Ohio was regarded as a perfect microcosm of America (with its regional, socioeconomic, and political diversity) and thus an influential bellwether in presidential elections. 
But that was before extreme gerrymandering carved up state voting districts to engineer failsafe Republican supermajorities in the legislature — which cemented the statewide GOP trifecta of executive and judicial overlords who rule Ohio as a partisan fiefdom that passes for representative government.   
The phrase that once signified Ohio’s status as a major swing state, whose character and composition mirrored the country’s, has been turned on its head. Today it would read, “As the nation goes, under Trump-genuflecting lemmings on Capitol Hill, so goes Ohio.” It is a reliably red state in lockstep with MAGA extremism writ large. In 2025, it is a perfect microcosm of the right-wing autocracies that have overtaken other bygone battleground states. 
Statehouse Republicans spin the same culture war nonsense as their MAGA counterparts do in over half of the state legislatures they control nationwide. They advance the same Big Money interests of the same Big Campaign Donors, codify the same heartless indifference to the suffering of the powerless, and worship the same convicted felon, convicted sexual abuser, convicted fraudster, and attempted coup-plotter who got away with fomenting an insurrection against the U.S. government to disrupt constitutional business and try to overthrow the results of a free and fair election. 
Both GOP lawmakers in Columbus and in Congress just passed objectively regressive, and oppressive budgets that will both take food from the hungry, cut health care insurance for tens of millions of working-class poor, and force Medicaid-dependent nursing homes and already struggling rural hospitals to close or contract. 
Why? To partially offset huge transfers of wealth to the ultra-rich from the poorest Americans on the state and federal level. The hungriest and neediest among us are throwaway line items in GOP state and federal budgets crafted for the rich and powerful.

JD Vance, the former Ohio senator and unrecognizable author of Hillbilly Elegy, even suggested the suffering of many (from devastating federal cuts to Medicaid and food stamps) was worth it to give Immigration and Enforcement its single largest funding increase in history.  
Tell that to the estimated 17 million people being kicked off Medicaid nationwide or seniors being pushed out of nursing homes without medical coverage or children going hungry with the deepest cuts ever to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, (SNAP). 
The veep, who cast the tie-breaking vote for Trump’s Billionaire First Budget in the Senate, essentially said their pain was beside the point. 
What Vance values is super-charging ICE’s nationwide terrorism campaign against illegal and legal immigrants (many without any criminal record) with a fortified police state of masked thugs in unmarked vehicles who disappear human beings off the streets. 
He was euphoric about the federal budget’s giant infusion of cash (around $170 billion) for the agency. 
“Everything else — the CBO [Congressional Budget Office] score, the proper baseline, the minutiae (italics, mine) of the Medicaid policy — is immaterial compared to the ICE money and immigration enforcement provisions.”  
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
To Vance apparently, the unforced hardships on Ohioans and citizens across America are irrelevant compared to boosting ICE’s capacity to detain and deport racially profiled day laborers in Home Depot parking lots or those doing backbreaking work in farm fields, restaurants, hotels, landscaping, etc. 
The massive influx in ICE funding allows Trump’s secretive army, without IDs, warrants, or due process, to become what a prominent immigration attorney called “the highest-funded federal law enforcement agency in history.”  
Vance is on a futile odyssey to stop non-white demographic change in America at any cost. 
His message to Ohioans who will lose health insurance for medical care and life-saving treatment, or the 1 in 9 low-income, elderly, and disabled residents in the state who will lose federal food assistance — is suck it up because detention camps are expensive. 
Tell that to the 62% of Ohio households that participate in SNAP in families with children.  
Every Ohio Republican on Capitol Hill voted for the fiscally irresponsible, debt-exploding, Medicaid-slashing Trump bill so billionaires and corporate conglomerates could get a $3.4 trillion tax cut on the backs of poor and working-class Americans. 
Likewise, nearly every Ohio Republican in the Statehouse voted for the Big Jimmy and Dee Haslam Private Welfare Bill, blessed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, that rewards the wealthy with tax cuts, gives lavish handouts to NFL billionaires and allocates nearly $2.5 billion for private school vouchers to affluent families. 
Yet the same GOP budget forces public schools, public libraries, state-funded child care, food banks, pediatric cancer research, and more to make do with less.
At least the Haslams can walk away with a cool $600 million to take the Browns out of Cleveland and Trump’s Mar a Lago pals can pocket another windfall in tax cuts they don’t need. 
As Ohio’s MAGA conformists in Congress go, transferring resources from the poor and middle class to the rich, so goes Ohio’s Republican supermajority in Columbus.
 But the rest of us still have agency to demand better than gutted safety net programs, cancelled health insurance and defunded public education to subsidize opulent lifestyles and domed stadiums. As Ohio goes is ultimately up to Ohioans who give a damn.

The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect.

It was a significant day for me, having grown up around the world among soldiers, sailors, airmen and their families.
  The author’s father in his dorm room at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. (Submitted photo)
My father, George Wees, was born in Omaha to second-generation Polish immigrants. His father, Francis Wees, built houses in South Omaha, including the house he, my grandmother, and their nine children called home near 38th and G Streets. Dad attended Creighton Prep and graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1958.
I was born a few years later, in Heidelberg, in then-West Germany. Young Lt. Wees was on one of his early assignments working with the newly established West German military, via a NATO attachment, to establish secure government communications networks just miles away from Soviet-allied East Germany.
In 1966, dad received orders for Vietnam. He was to advise a South Vietnamese Army unit in the burgeoning conflict between the communist North and the democratic South. He parked my mother and us kids in a little duplex in East Omaha, and oﬀ he went to spend a year on the other side of the globe.
Communicating with us
I remember he furnished us with a little tape recorder and microphone, and he and my mother exchanged tapes, in addition to near-daily letters, during his deployment. She still has the tapes.
In some of his messages, you hear the gunfire in the distance. And at those times, you hear a bit of unsteadiness in the young lieutenant’s voice.
When Dad returned in 1967, he was stationed at the Pentagon, now a Captain. We lived in a little house across from a park in Vienna, Virginia, where I attended kindergarten and first grade.
It was there that I really got to know him. He set up a darkroom in the basement to pursue his photography hobby, bought a Mustang for the Pentagon commute and patiently hosted siblings from Omaha who wanted to come visit Washington.
But by 1969, it was time for his second tour in Vietnam. Back we came to Omaha, to another little house on 43rd and Center, a rental owned by friends. There my mother, sister and I would wait out another year of war. That is, if dad survived.
By this time, things were less taut, less military, and problems extended from the front to the rear. In command of American troops near Nha Trang, dad survived at least one attempt on his life—from his own troops.
Because by this point, many of the young draftees were convinced the war was pointless.
Lives of service
Eventually, after resisting the notion for years, Col. Wees agreed with me that the war, through Democratic and Republican administrations, was ill-conceived and badly executed. In other words, pointless.
But we should remember that rank and file soldiers like my dad only served. None of it was their idea, nor did they make the big decisions. That was the province of civilian leadership in Washington — folks who would soon be ousted, many imprisoned, with a president resigning in disgrace.

Our current civilian leader, who has already been disgraced by multiple felony convictions and a civil sexual abuse judgment against him, used the occasion of the Army’s birthday to throw a party and have a parade.
The Army, as always, followed the commander-in-chief’s orders and rolled the tanks down Constitution Avenue in a light rain as the president attempted a few salutes. Nearby, at Arlington National Cemetery, my father rested.
Though drafted, the president never served (bone spurs), and according to witnesses, he has labeled as “suckers and losers” some rank-and-file soldiers who make up the service. His campaign-style speech to West Point’s 2025 graduating class — complete with MAGA hat — was thin on talk of duty or honor.
But those cadets did what cadets do. They listened to the president troll and dismiss his predecessor, threaten his political “enemies”, invent “facts”, and brag about himself, without visibly reacting, except to politely applaud as they shared their achievement with the commander-in-chief.
That’s what it looks like when doing one’s duty, honorably, for one’s country. It looks like discipline, because that’s what is required to lead. Happy 250th to the United States Army. May you continue to serve and protect the Constitution, and to quietly obey the lawful orders of whatever civilian leadership the voters place above you, for centuries to come.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters.)A late June heat wave led to skyrocketing emergency room visits and boosted the number of heat deaths this year from one to eight in a single week, according to the latest state numbers.
The data from the Maryland Department of Health showed that 472 people had to go to urgent care or the emergency room for heat-related illnesses from June 22 through June 28, a week in which the National Weather Service said parts of Maryland would see a heat index of up to 110 degrees during the hottest parts of the day.
That’s a significant increase from the previous week, when 93 people landed in emergency departments across the state, and trends higher than previous heat-related illness data from recent years.
High temperatures that week also resulted in seven deaths, raising the total number of heat-related deaths so far this heat season to eight, with months left to go in the season. State health officials and county emergency workers are warning residents to take caution in similar conditions in the days ahead.

“We are very saddened to report these heat-related deaths in Maryland,” said David McCallister, a communications official with the health department, in a written statement Monday. “As we experience more hot days this summer, these tragedies remind us to take the necessary steps to avoid overheating.
“Be sure to always check on family, friends, and neighbors who may be particularly vulnerable to heat, including young children, senior citizens and people with chronic diseases,” his statement said.
The data is part of weekly reporting on heat-related illnesses during the annual heat season, which runs roughly from the end of April through September.
“Demographic patterns remain consistent with previous years: ED [emergency department] visits are highest among males (63%), individuals aged 18-44 (43%), and white individuals (53%),” McCallister’s statement said. “Of the eight deaths reported so far, 88% were among males and 63% were among white individuals. Most notably, 75% of deaths occurred in individuals aged 65 and older.”
He said that there have been a total of 729 recorded heat-related emergency department visits so far, “making up over 60% of the total number of visits reported during the entire 2024 heat season.”
“It is also important to note that 65% of visits have occurred in Health Regions 3 and 5, which encompass the Baltimore City area and the National Capital Region,” he said.


Danielle Knatz, bureau chief for the Baltimore County Fire Department’s Emergency Medical Services, said the heat wave during the last week of June led to a greater demand in emergency response services.
“We did see a slight increase in our heat-related responses, and most of them appear to be incidents that occurred outside of the home. So parking lots, restaurants, streets, highways — likely people working outside,” Knatz said. “A couple related to swimming pools or water, but not too many.”
She said that most of the emergency room visits in Baltimore County were connected to heat exhaustion from physical activity, though other people who ended up in Baltimore County emergency rooms faced different challenges.
“We had several that were elderly. Elderly and younger patients don’t respond well to changes in the climate,” she said. “(There) could be underlying conditions that are causing those people to have difficulties, or certain medications that they’re taking. That was pretty much what we were seeing that week.”
She said the EMS agency uses the heat-related illness data to track trends across the county and help crews be prepared to the next heat wave.
“For example, for this week, we front-loaded our units with extra cold packs to be able to handle these types of incidents,” she said. “Because obviously, there are times when we want to aggressively cool patients, so we want to make sure that we have cold packs to be able to do that.”
Maryland heads into summer with new workplace protections following deadly 2024 heat season

The National Weather Service issued heat advisories Monday for parts of central Maryland the Eastern Shore through Tuesday. The agency said to expect heat index values up to 105 degrees, with “up to 107 degrees closer to the Chesapeake Bay.”
Under those conditions, workplaces in high temperature environments are expected to implement additional heat safety measures under new state labor regulations that launched this year. That includes more frequent and longer breaks for workers and additional cooling measures on worksites.
Knatz urges families to take caution for the remainder of the heat season.
“It’s important for people to just monitor the weather and be prepared,” she said. “By taking appropriate rests, by drinking plenty of fluids.”
The state health department also reminds Marylanders to avoid alcohol, caffeine and overly sweetened beverages during high temperatures. It suggests that people wear loose-fitting, lightweight and light-colored clothing, along with sunscreen.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_july7_annap_sun2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 03:58:46.746514

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Harford County Public Schools Superintendent Sean Bulson knows that school administrators “should be thrilled that parents want to be involved” in their children’s education.
Bulson also knows that there can be a point when parents get too involved, acknowledging the potential administrative burden of trying to anticipate everything that a parent might find objectionable in the classroom.
His comments were in response to the recent Supreme Court ruling that said Montgomery County schools need to notify parents when LGBTQ-themed books are used in the classroom, and give parents the chance to opt their children out.
“If parents do find something objectionable, we need to be willing to discuss it.,” Bulson said. “I really think at the center of this, is the willingness to listen to families, communicate with them, and frankly, be open to the fact that parents make these [opt out] decisions for many reasons.”
Bulson’s not the only one grappling with the fallout of the court’s June 27 ruling — which merely granted a preliminary injunction in the case and ordered it back to lower courts, which have yet to hold a hearing on the merits of the case, only on motions.
Attorneys for both the parents and the school system told a federal district judge Monday that, pending paperwork from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, they hope to sit down to see if they can work out an agreement on a preliminary injunction while the case proceeds.
The court’s 6-3 ruling in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor said that while the case is being heard, the Montgomery County School Board “should be ordered to notify them [parents] in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction.”
The ruling came in response to county’s inclusion, in 2022, of LGBTQ-themed books in all grade levels in county schools. After initially allowing parents to opt their children out, the county reversed itself in 2023.
  One of the books highlighted in U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling June 27 entitled “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding.” Screenshot.
That eventually led to a lawsuit by parents, who said that picture books like “Uncle Bobby’s Wedding,” “Prince & Knight” and “Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope” were not appropriate for their children in lower grades and that, in some instances, the books’ messages contradicted the families’ religious beliefs.
Suzie Scott of Harford County said the court’s decision represents “a huge win” for parental rights.
“It’s crazy that the Supreme Court had to weigh in on something so common sense,” said Scott, who serves as chair of Moms for Liberty Maryland Legislative Committee. “The parents that brought this case are not trying to tell the school what they can and can’t teach. They’re just saying, ‘I don’t want my child to be exposed to certain literature that is opposed to my moral viewpoint.’”
But Phillip Westry, executive director with the LGBTQ advocacy group FreeState Justice in Baltimore, said the ruling could eventually led to removing aspects of certain historical figures. He points to the late Harvey Milk, a Navy veteran and one of the first openly gay elected officials when he was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977: On the day of the court’s ruling, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced on his social media page that the Navy would the USNS Harvey Milk to the USNS Oscar V. Peterson.
“There is a concern from FreeState Justice that this ruling will create an erasure of LGBTQ people from areas in history, in government, in literature, in science,” said Westry, who’s also an attorney. “It makes for a messy situation to educate our kids in a public setting.”
Justice Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority opinion for the court, said the school board’s “introduction of the LGBTQ+-inclusive” storybooks into the literature curriculum, along with its decision to deny opt-outs as it does for other topics, “places an unconstitutional burden on the parents’ rights to the free exercise of their religion.” He said the parents have “shown that they are very likely to succeed in their free exercise” of religion claims, and ordered the preliminary injunction.
In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor — joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson — wrote the majority’s ruling would create “chaos” for the nation’s public schools, which will be required to “provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent’s religious beliefs.”
The case will eventually go back to the U.S. District Court of Maryland in Greenbelt for a full hearing.
“Now that the court issue has been decided [and] the parents are entitled to a preliminary injunction, our hope and expectation is that the parties and the District Court can work to implement the court’s decision and finally resolve the case,” said Michael O’Brien, one of the attorneys for the parents.

A Montgomery County schools spokesperson said in an email Wednesday that the county would not comment beyond the joint status report that was filed Monday with the district court.
‘Parents have sovereignty’
State law allows parents to opt their children out of instruction that deals with “family life and human sexuality instruction.” But Montgomery County officials eventually ruled that the policy did not apply to the LGBTQ books and materials that were part of the school’s literature program, which they called part of an inclusive curriculum that also helps teach civility and respect.
So a group of county Muslim, Jewish and Catholic parents filed a suit that to challenge use of the books that feature some same-sex or transgender characters in classes as early as prekindergarten.
Lindsey Smith, who isn’t part of the suit, is credited as one of the first people to speak out against the Montgomery County school board’s decision more than two years ago to incorporate the books into classroom instruction.
Smith, who had two elementary-school aged children in the school system during that time, founded the county’s Moms for Liberty chapter established in January 2023. She’s no longer a part of the organization.
In an interview, she recalled how some parents who complained were called “bigots” and told to “shut up and be silent.”
“My kids were not mature enough to handle some of the books,” said Smith, whose children now attend private school. “The parents have the sovereignty and the right to have their voices heard and to be able to have their voice used in the public school education. We’re the ones that pay for it.”
But educators worry that the ruling “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,” as Sotomayor put it.
David Stein, president of the Montgomery County Education Association, agrees with Sotomayor’s opinion on how the ruling “will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools.”

“If one child needs to opt out on Monday for this book, but another child needs to opt out on Wednesday for another book, it’s unworkable and it’s just an incredible burden on that teacher,” said David Stein, president of the Montgomery County Education Association.
“I’m worried about what happens in high school biology class,” said Stein, who taught high school biology for 30 years. “We want to talk about evolution, or we want to talk about vaccines. Teachers are going to have to keep track of all these different these objections that various families may have.”
Bulson said it’s impossible for school systems to anticipate everything that’s objectionable. He said one of his main focuses is to simply communicate with parents in his district, which he said has experienced few opt-out requests from parents.
“I do have a pretty firm line, which is I’ll talk to you about what affects your children, but I would equally defend the importance of sustaining a line where individual parents don’t get to speak for other families’ children,” Bulson said. “I still think schools have an important role to play in ensuring all students feel included.”
Montgomery County mom Taylor Tuckerman said she and her husband read various books to their son, who turns 3 this month, including those that include LGBTQ+ themes. One her son has become engaged with is “Plenty of Hugs,” which features a family with two mothers.
“It’s just really upsetting to me to think that in two years, he and his friends are going to go into kindergarten and not have these same books available to them,” said Tuckerman, a vice president of finance and shared services with Catholics for Choice.
“The Supreme Court decided that it’s OK for other parents to teach their children to discriminate and judge people who are different from them and to force that same judgement into my son’s public classrooms,” she said. “We believe people of all faiths should feel welcomed and included and that includes LGBTQ families of faith.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC03677-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-08 03:58:46.746514

(Photo courtesy AmeriCorps)A second federal district judge in Maryland has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate AmeriCorps workers who were laid off without notice in April and to restore $400 million in funding and grants to nonprofit organizations.
The preliminary injunction handed down Monday by District Judge Matthew Maddox comes a month and two days after a similar ruling in a separate AmeriCorps case in Maryland by U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman — whose ruling is quoted heavily by Maddox.
Both judges blocked moves by the Trump administration and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to shut down AmeriCorps programs, including the National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC), Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) and various state and private grant programs.
Boardman ruled in favor of 24 states and the District of Columbia that sued to block the DOGE cuts. Maddox ruled in favor of a number of nonprofits from around the country, members of an AmeriCorps labor union and three AmeriCorps service members.
Both cases were a response to DOGE moves in mid-April to immediately terminate all NCCC projects, along with 2,000 NCCC participants, and to put more than 600 AmeriCorps staffers — about 85% of the agency’s staff — on administrative leave, to be laid off less than two weeks later. Workers were ordered to immediately stop working and were locked out of AmeriCorps offices, email and other systems.

Maddox said the workers and nonprofits that sued the Corporation for National and Community Service, which runs AmeriCorps, were likely to win on their claims that the abrupt government cuts were made without authority, failed to follow appropriate procedures and were likely to cause irreparable harm to the plaintiffs.
Maddox wrote that the government “cancelled approximately $400 million in AmeriCorps grants and terminated funding to both direct grantees and subgrantees of State Service Commission…. These actions have led to significant disruptions in the delivery of services that were previously funded by AmeriCorps and provided by the Nonprofit Plaintiffs.”
“This disruption has included the termination or suspension of assistance with college applications, provision of teachers to Indigenous school districts, housing assistance for low-income families, childhood literacy programs, summer and afterschool learning programs, and neighborhood revitalization programs, among other services,” he wrote.
Maddox ordered the return of roughly $400 million in funding to 14 nonprofits that had grants to do AmeriCorps work, the reinstatement of hundreds of AmeriCorps Employees Union Local 2027 members who were put on administrative leave on April 15 and subsequently laid off, and the return of three AmeriCorps members who lost their positions as a result of the cuts.
Boardman had ordered much of the same in her June 5 order.
Besides Maryland and Washington, D.C., other states that sued, and are subject to Boardman’s preliminary injunction, are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.

Maddox’s order affects three unnamed AmeriCorps members as well as about 400 members of AmeriCorps Employees Union, AFSCME Local 2027.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-08 04:02:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Why Connecticut needs wildlife funding now more than ever,Viewpoints Contributor,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/08/why-connecticut-needs-wildlife-funding-now-more-than-ever/,"Without the renewal of essential federal grants, projects protecting vital Connecticut wildlife will stall or vanish.","A quiet stream in northwest Connecticut, hidden beneath a forest canopy and shielded from development, holds more than scenic charm. In these protected waters—part of a watershed that ultimately supplies drinking water to the City of Waterbury—rare freshwater mussels cling to the cobble bottom. Their presence isn’t just a curiosity; it indicates that the water is clean, the ecosystem is functioning, and a community of native species is benefiting in these waters and along the riverbanks.
In recent years, I had the opportunity to conduct mussel surveys at this site alongside staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s (DEEP) Wildlife Diversity Unit and researchers from the University of Massachusetts. The work was supported by a federal program that most people have never heard of—the State and Tribal Wildlife Grants program. It’s one of the most important, yet underappreciated, funding sources for wildlife conservation in the country.
And it’s currently in jeopardy.

James Fischer
These grants fund science-driven work to conserve Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN), with an emphasis on those that are under-surveyed, declining, or critical to ecosystem health. In Connecticut, these efforts not only help ensure wildlife survival, but also protect public health, drinking water, pollinator services, and sustainable recreation. Yet the Trump administration did not renew funding for the program—a decision that could have ripple effects for decades across our state and region.
These grants supported, for example, the Biodiversity of Bees in Connecticut, authored by Tracy Zarrillo and Dr. Kimberly Stoner at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. This pioneering project catalogs the extraordinary diversity of bees in our state. Connecticut’s agriculture, native plant communities, and ecosystem stability all rely on pollinators, yet bees face widespread decline due to habitat loss, climate change, and pesticide overuse.
Zarrillo and Stoner’s ‘Biodiversity of bees’ is both a scientific achievement and a tool for recovery. It will help landowners, farmers, educators, and municipalities make informed decisions about planting, land use, and pesticide management. It also serves as a warning. The disappearance of invertebrates—described by scientists as “death by a thousand cuts”—threatens the pollination systems that sustain our crops, gardens, and wild spaces. Without continued monitoring and restoration efforts like those outlined in the Bee Atlas, we risk losing these species before we even know they’re gone.
Amphibians and reptiles, too, are benefiting from State and Tribal Wildlife Grant-funded work. Conservationists in Connecticut are collaborating with regional partners to monitor a newly emerging fungal pathogen that poses a dire threat to salamanders. If this disease takes hold, it could devastate populations of red-backed salamanders, one of the most abundant vertebrates in our northeastern forests. In most forests, they outnumber white-footed mice and even white-tailed deer.
These salamanders are small but mighty. They serve as prey for birds and mammals and help regulate invertebrate populations on the forest floor. Their disappearance would trigger cascading effects throughout the ecosystem. We’ve seen what happens when a deadly fungus goes unchecked: the white-nose syndrome that decimated bat populations across the Northeast is a cautionary tale. The damage it inflicted will take generations to undo.
What ties all of these stories together—mussels, bees, salamanders—is that they are not charismatic megafauna. They don’t appear on bumper stickers or spark multi-million dollar fundraising campaigns. But they are essential. They are ecological cogs and wheels, quietly keeping systems in balance and signaling the health of the environments we all share.
As Aldo Leopold, the father of wildlife ecology, wrote: “To keep every cog and wheel is the first precaution of intelligent tinkering.” These grants allow us to do just that—study, monitor, and safeguard the less visible but deeply consequential components of our natural world.
The work supported by State and Tribal Wildlife Grants also fosters collaboration across jurisdictions. Scientists, wildlife agencies, nonprofit organizations, and academic institutions are able to coordinate efforts, share data, and respond to emerging threats more effectively. In a small state like Connecticut, where watersheds cross town lines and migratory species traverse hundreds of miles, this kind of cooperation is indispensable.
Importantly, the public also has a role to play. Connecticut’s State Wildlife Action Plan (SWAP)—the foundational document that guides how these grant funds are used—is currently under revision and will soon be available for public comment. This is the moment for Connecticut residents to engage.
The SWAP identifies at-risk species, outlines conservation goals, and informs local planning efforts. It’s a practical tool that connects wildlife conservation to broader concerns—clean air and water, healthy soils, sustainable land use, and resilience to climate change. A well-informed and engaged citizenry can ensure that the plan reflects both scientific priorities and community values. When residents speak up, decision-makers listen.
Yet all of this depends on reliable funding. Without the renewal of State and Tribal Wildlife Grants, these vital projects will stall or vanish. Agencies and researchers will be left scrambling to piece together alternative sources. The long-term consequences won’t be immediate or dramatic, but they will be real. We’ll see more species quietly disappear. More ecosystem functions will falter. More opportunities to act early will be lost. Connecticut’s congressional delegates are on board with maintaining support. I urge you to contact all your friends and family in other states to reach out to their representatives, as this issue affects every state and all wildlife populations throughout the country.
And it doesn’t have to be this way.
We have the knowledge. We have the tools. What we need now is the political will and public awareness to protect the programs that protect our wildlife—and, by extension, our water, air, food systems, and future.
From mussels in forested headwaters to bees in backyard gardens and salamanders under rotting logs, these species tell us when the world is working—and when it’s not. Their survival is our survival, too.
Let’s not lose the forest for the trees. Let’s not wait until it’s too late.
Let’s keep every cog and wheel.

By requiring these reports, Connecticut continues to lead the way in judicial nominations transparency and providing policymakers with the information they need to ensure that people’s champions have a path to the state bench. 

Steve Kennedy
Today, lawyers who have represented actual people rather than powerful entities, like corporations or the state, are much less likely to be tapped for judicial nominations than their corporate and prosecutorial peers. In a way, bias in judicial nominations is not a new problem. Until relatively recently, it was common for Connecticut governors to nominate slates of dozens of state court judges without any racial minorities and very few women. 
Now however, the gender ratio of state court judges is approximately equal to that of the population, and Connecticut has one of the most racially diverse benches in the nation. So what changed, and how can we apply the lessons of this turnaround to other shortcomings of the state judiciary? Commitments to diversity from governors and other stakeholders were important, but a key –and often overlooked– component was increasing the transparency of the judicial selection process.
While some portion of the increase in demographic diversity among judges may reflect a slight shift in that direction nationwide, law still remains one of the least diverse professions in the country. Rather, in Connecticut, the last two administrations have made explicit efforts to increase the demographic diversity of their judicial nominees, assisted by the strongest judicial selection demographics reporting requirements in the country.
Judicial applicant confidentiality is important, but not long after forming the JSC to screen judicial applicants for selection by the governor, the General Assembly recognized that without some kind of window into the JSC’s decisions, there would be significant opportunity for bias to prevent candidates from certain backgrounds from making it through the system.
Now, every year, the JSC is required to report anonymized demographic data on judicial applicants, including race, gender, religion, and time in legal practice. In addition to providing these data for applicants, the Commission must also report the same for approved applicants. Seeing an overwhelming white and male bench in the 1980s, the legislature set up a system where comparing the demographics of these two groups can identify whether a lack of diversity is due to a lack of diversity in applicants or if there is a systemic issue keeping them from passing through the JSC.
This system is not perfect, and significant effort is still needed to increase the transparency of the selection process and allow for greater public participation, but the JSC’s reporting requirements have allowed the government and advocates to analyze its work and address systemic issues. Today, further transparency is needed–not around demographic but professional diversity. 
Connecticut’s bench is currently dominated by former prosecutors and corporate attorneys. Empirical studies, including one of the Connecticut judiciary, have found that these are the very backgrounds that more often side with powerful entities like corporations and the state over ordinary people. From housing court to discrimination claims to criminal sentencing, people facing off against a corporation or the state are significantly more likely to lose their cases if they appear before a former prosecutor or corporate attorney.
Unlike former prosecutors and corporate attorneys, public interest attorneys with backgrounds representing the people rather than the powerful are significantly underrepresented among Connecticut judges. While there has been some improvement on this front over the last two years, encouraged particularly by the CT Pro-People Judiciary Coalition, public interest attorneys like public defenders, legal aid, civil rights, and labor lawyers remain a small minority on the state bench. For example, the Connecticut Supreme Court only has one justice who regularly represented people before becoming a judge (and he is the justice who sides most often with people compared with his peers who side more often with their own former corporate and state employers). Aside from the short-term appointment of Justice Christine Keller, who spent part of her career in legal aid, all of Gov. Ned Lamont’s high court nominees have had corporate and/or prosecutorial backgrounds.
So what is the cause of this problem? According to the Governor’s Office, the main reason is that not enough public interest lawyers apply to be judges in the first place. This may be true to at least some extent, but the Pro-People Judiciary Coalition is aware of a number of public interest attorneys who have been on the approved candidate list for years without being nominated. Other public interest attorneys report being accused by some JSC members of a lack of objectivity because of their chosen fields. To address these discrepancies and help determine effective methods of increasing the representation of lawyers for the people on the bench, the coalition proposed a simple addition to the JSC’s reporting requirements: the professional backgrounds of all applicants and approved candidates.
This proposal was included in this session’s H.B. 7041, which contained several other changes to the JSC, some of which we supported and some we did not. But the JSC reporting amendment included in H.B. 7041 represents a modest but meaningful step toward a judiciary that better reflects the full range of legal experience in Connecticut—and, by extension, improves the outcomes for ordinary people appearing in our courts.
Just as demographic transparency helped open the door for more diverse candidates to reach the bench, transparency around professional background can ensure that those who have spent their careers representing everyday people, not just the powerful, are given a fair shot. This bill will not only strengthen public confidence in the judicial system but also affirm Connecticut’s commitment to a fairer, more inclusive judiciary.
Connecticut is leading the way on a more open judicial selection process, and all states with judicial nominations should take a close look at following Connecticut’s lead.

(Getty Images)The Louisiana Public Defender Oversight Board voted 5-4 Monday to uphold the ousting of five attorneys who lead local public defender offices. The decision follows the replacement of more than half of the board’s members over the past six weeks.
The vote means the attorneys won’t be returning to their jobs anytime soon, but it won’t end their dispute with Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration. 
“This wasn’t so much the board’s decision as it was the governor’s decision in my opinion,” Rick Schroeder, a New Orleans area lawyer representing the dismissed attorneys, said in an interview. 
The ousted attorneys appear to be gearing up to sue the Landry administration and their former boss, State Public Defender Rémy Starns. 
Starns became state public defender in 2020 when former Gov. John Bel Edwards in office and was reappointed last year by Landry. The lawyers allege he took away their jobs because they spoke out against him in front of the public defender board and state lawmakers. They’ve also accused him of targeting women for retribution. 
They include Michelle AndrePont of Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson of Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller of Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward of Evangeline Parish and John Hogue, who worked in Madison, Tensas and East Carroll parishes. 
“I’ve opposed every one of his efforts to seize power because I believe in independence, accountability and justice,” AndrePont told the board Monday. “I have lost my job, but I will not lose my voice, and I will not lose my integrity.” 
In June, Starns denied allegations of gender discrimination, though he hasn’t offered an explanation as to why he dismissed the attorneys. He has said he is not legally required to share his reasons for not renewing the attorneys’ annual contracts, which expired July 1. 
None of the terminated lawyers received negative performance reviews or problematic office audits while in their jobs. It is rare for chief public defenders contracts to not be renewed.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jean Faria, who was state public defender from 2008-13 and continued to work with the office through 2020, testified Monday before the board. During her time with the agency, no lead local public defenders had their contract renewals rejected without cause, she said.    
For weeks, Starns’ decision to remove the attorneys has given rise to consternation within the public defender board. Six of its nine members have resigned since the end of May, as the board’s vote over whether to intervene in the dismissals became unavoidable. 
The board was forced to reschedule its vote on the terminations three times in the past three weeks. Until Monday, not enough board members were showing up to legally take a vote. 
The five members who voted to uphold Starns’ decision to fire the attorneys have only joined the board in the last month. Three had never attended a board meeting before Monday, and the other two had only been to one previous meeting on June 16. 
The four board members who voted against Starns’ decision have been with the board for over a year. 
Starns didn’t attend the board meeting in person Monday, even though he was out in the hallway yards away from the meeting room entrance as it convened. When the board members took a recess, Starns walked by and looked through a door window into the meeting room but didn’t enter. 
When a reporter asked him in the hallway why he wasn’t attending meeting, Starns said he was watching it remotely. 

As a result of the recent board resignations, its makeup changed. A few weeks ago, the board included three Black members. Now, eight of its nine members are white, though a third of Louisiana’s population is Black and many of the people who rely on public defense in the court system are not white. 

Its only Black member, Baton Rouge attorney Adrejia Boutte, was one of three nominees submitted to Landry for selection last year by the public defender board and state criminal defense attorney association. She had also served on a previous public defender board during the Edwards administration.
The board also went from having five retired state judges as members, to just three.
Its newest members include: 

 Mary Devereux, a retired district court judge who worked in St. Tammany and Washington parishes and was appointed to the board by the Supreme Court; 
 Kevin Landreneau, a Baton Rouge attorney appointed by Louisiana Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie

(Janet Neilson photos/National Park Service)Officials with the National Park Service are asking for the public’s help as they try to figure out how a humpback whale was injured by a boat in June.
Pictures published by the park on July 1 show a humpback whale with a large gash behind its dorsal fin. The whale was photographed uninjured on June 16, and the injury took place sometime between then and June 27, when a photo of the injury was taken by a biologist near Willoughby Island.
“They swim around all over the place. We don’t know exactly where it would have been. We do know that it had been spotted in a similar area to where it was seen only seven days before that. So we’re quite sure it’s been feeding in this area and then it had that fresh injury on the 27th, so we are expecting that someone quite close was in this area and interacted with that whale and ran into it,” said Matthew Cahill, public information officer for Glacier Bay National Park.
Two cruise ships and 25 private vessels are allowed per day into Glacier Bay. 
Last year, several whales were struck by boats and ships in nearby waters, and at least two whales died as a result.
“We do know that whales are getting hit by boats in the area. I can’t tell you how many, though,” Cahill said, explaining that not all injuries are seen or reported, and data is anecdotal.
From his perspective, “we have a couple of identified photos of individual (whales) with fresh prop marks this year.”
Whale injuries are notable because humpbacks, gray whales and other species are protected by federal law. All vessels in the park are prohibited from coming within one quarter of a nautical mile of a humpback, and if they come inside that radius by accident, they must immediately reduce speed to 10 knots.
Cahill said that the Glacier Bay area is one of the more protected parts of Southeast Alaska for humpback whales, and staff at the park want to protect the marine environment while still providing a good visitor experience.
Anyone with information about the stricken whale has been asked to contact the park at 907-697-2230.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)On July 1, Alaska’s new sick-leave and minimum wage increase law took effect.
Approved by voters in November, it states that someone working at a business with 15 or more employees will earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 30 hours worked, up to a maximum of 56 per year, unless the employer voluntarily increases that limit.
Someone working at a business with fewer than 15 employees earns sick leave at the same rate, but the maximum per year is 40 hours.
The law also raised the state’s minimum wage to $13 per hour. The minimum wage rises to $14 per hour next year and $15 per hour in 2027. It will rise with the rate of inflation for each year after that.
The law also forbids bosses from forcing their employees to attend meetings about religious or political issues, including whether or not to join a labor union, political group or church.
There are exemptions for religious organizations. 
Under the law, sick leave can be used for an employee’s illness or to take care of a family member who needs care. It can also be used in cases of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking. 
While workers can access the benefits now, it will be a few weeks before the state formalizes some of the details of how employers must implement the law. On June 25, the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development proposed new regulations. Those won’t take effect until August at the earliest, but they would add some new rules to the sick leave law.
In the meantime, the department has published an informal Q&A about how the law works.
Under those regulations, all of the state’s employers “shall notify each employee in writing” about its sick leave policy.
Those policies may include the amount of advance notice required when using sick leave for a prescheduled medical appointment or “other forseeable absence.”
An employer can’t require more than 10 days’ notice in that case.
If someone is unexpectedly sick, the proposed regulations would require the sick employee to “notify the employer before the start of the employee’s shift or as soon as is possible.”
If someone uses sick leave for more than three consecutive days, their boss may require them to show proof of their need for sick leave, if that requirement is included in the written policy.
Someone who needs to take sick leave because of domestic violence, sexual assault, harassment or stalking, cannot be required to verify that explanation.
Under the law, someone can carry over unused sick leave from one year to the next, but they can’t exceed the maximum, unless their employer voluntarily allows them to do so.
Employers are forbidden from retaliating against employees who use their sick leave, and nothing prevents an employer from “front-loading” sick leave by giving them the hours in advance instead of accruing them over time.
The Department of Labor’s new regulations are subject to public comment through July 31. Anyone with questions may email dol.lss.regulations@alaska.gov.

(Courtesy of the City of Kearney)  LINCOLN — Nebraska’s fifth and final “good life district” designation goes to the City of Kearney, city leaders announced on Monday.
Kearney joins four other geographical areas designated as good life districts by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in or around the cities of Omaha, Gretna, Bellevue and Grand Island.
Applicants from Kearney and Papillion had been competing for the fifth and final designation allowed under the Good Life Transformational Projects Act of 2023.
Such districts were established under the law, which has been revised in the past two regular legislative sessions, as a tool to help create unique tourist-oriented campuses expected to generate jobs and economic activity.
Under the law, the state gives up half of the state sales tax generated within the boundaries of a good life district for up to 30 years, and that revenue is steered toward eligible costs of developing the district.
Leveraging those state sales dollars would allow the community to attract “large-scale development projects” that will boost economic activity and enhance Kearney, the city’s statement said.
Such districts in the long run are expected to be a boon to the state in the form of increased tax revenue, tourism dollars and growth.
Kearney voters will be asked for approval. According to the city website, the City Council is to schedule an election to ask Kearney voters to authorize a good life district economic development program. If approved, that program shapes how the district functions.
The statement did not identify or describe a specific “large-scale development” project. But it said the Kearney Good Life District would cover 200 acres of vacant land surrounding the city’s SportsPlex and is to include retail, restaurant and destination attractions led by a private developer.
“Kearney has long been a hub of progress and opportunity, and receiving this final good life district designation reinforces our community’s role as a leader in Nebraska’s future,” Mayor Jonathan Nikkila said. “We look forward to leveraging these resources to drive growth, create jobs and enhance the vibrant quality of life that makes Kearney unique.”
The city website says the designation should accelerate development around Interstate 80 and the SportsPlex and increase visits to Kearney.
City leaders said they would work with state officials and local business leaders to ensure the benefits extend to all residents and contribute to the prosperity of Kearney and Nebraska.

The massive package of tax and spending cuts President Trump signed into law on July 4 contains a provision that eliminates a federal transportation grant program that set aside $335 million last year for the nearly $2 billion I-90 Allston highway project in Boston. 
The post Federal funding for I-90 Allston project in jeopardy appeared first on CommonWealt[...]","THE MASSIVE PACKAGE of tax and spending cuts President Trump signed into law on July 4 contains a provision that eliminates a federal transportation grant program that set aside $335 million last year for the nearly $2 billion I-90 Allston highway project in Boston. 
The provision rescinds “the unobligated balances” of the roughly $3 billion Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant program, which included funding for a project that aims to straightening and lowering to ground level the Massachusetts Turnpike as it passes between Boston University and the Charles River. The Massachusetts project, complete with a new MBTA station, would pave the way for Harvard University to construct a new neighborhood on its holdings in the area and help knit together a portion of Boston that had been severed by construction of the tTurnpike in the 1950s and 1960s. 
State transportation officials issued a statement confirming the federal funding program is being eliminated but said they are still awaiting clarification on what exactly that will mean for the I-90 Allston initiative. 
“Every single American relies on transportation. It is essential for quality of life and for the success of our economy. That is why it makes no sense that President Trump and Congressional Republicans just cut billions of dollars in transportation funding, including the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program,” said the statement, issued by a spokesperson for the Massachusetts Department  of Transportation. “MassDOT is awaiting clarification from the US Department of Transportation and assessing what impact this will have on the $335 million grant we received for the Allston Multimodal Project.” 
The statement went on to say that the state “project team will continue its work on the environmental documents and design for the project.  MassDOT will stay in communication with project partners and stakeholders as we learn more.” 
The federal grant represents about 17 percent of the total project’s cost. Under the federal program, the funds would only be “obligated” once environmental and regulatory hurdles are cleared. A deadline of September 30, 2026 was set for those approvals. 
Officials at the Federal Highway Administration could also not be reached for comment. 
Tom Ryan, senior advisor on policy, government, and community affairs at A Better City, a business-backed organization that has lobbied aggressively for the project, said the federal setback isn’t a death knell for the project. 
“It’s a piece of the puzzle. It’s not the entire funding,” he said of the federal grant. 
But the federal funding was widely considered a key piece of the I-90 Allston puzzle and state and local officials lobbied the Biden administration aggressively for the money. Even after it was awarded, state officials, worried about what a Trump victory could mean for the funding, tried without success to convince federal officials to let them spend a good portion of the money immediately. 
The change in administration and the Republican takeover of Congress changed the political equation dramatically. Funding for the Neighborhood Access and Equity Grant Program was provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, which became a target of the Trump administrationbudget cutters. The grant program also had two other strikes against it – equity, a taboo word in the Trump administration, was included in the program’s title, and the I-90 Allston project was a high priority of both Boston Mayor Michelle Wu’s administration and Harvard University, both of which have come under fire from the president and his administration. 
The I-90 Allston project has been talked about for more than a decade and gained significant traction with the federal award in March 2024 and a total of $300 million in funding commitments from the city of Boston, Harvard, and Boston University.  
Officials at Harvard and the city of Boston did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Officials at the Federal Highway Administration could also not be reached for comment.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)With the next state budget a week overdue and the new school year fast approaching, education advocates rallied Monday in Harrisburg with an urgent message for lawmakers.
The legislature must follow through on its 2024 commitment to close the spending gap between the state’s wealthiest and poorest school districts, they said.
“While we recognize the significant financial challenges … many Pennsylvania school districts simply cannot begin the academic year without a fully approved state budget in place,” Indiana Area School District Superintendent Robert Heinrich said.
But even the wealthier school districts need lawmakers to do more to help them make the most of their taxpayers’ money, school board members and educators said.
They called on the General Assembly to pass legislation to limit what taxpayers must pay to cyber charter schools, block efforts to establish new private school voucher programs, establish accountability requirements for the educational tax credit programs that already exist, and provide more support for student teachers to ease the teacher shortage.
“We must pass the complete education funding proposal,” said Brian Waite, superintendent of the Shenandoah Valley School District in Schuylkill County, which was one of six districts that won a lawsuit against the state over its reliance on property taxes to fund public education. “Anything less continues the very inequalities the court found unconstitutional.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
After the Commonwealth Court declared Pennsylvania’s education funding system unconstitutional in 2023, the legislature determined that it needed to increase funding by $4.5 billion over the next nine years to close what it called “the adequacy gap.”
The 2024-2025 budget contained $500 million to be distributed under a new fair funding formula to about 370 school districts with inadequate resources.
In his proposed 2025-2026 budget, Gov. Josh Shapiro called for another $526 million in adequacy funding, plus $75 million more in basic education funding and a $40 million increase for special education that would be divided among all districts.
Heinrich said even if the legislature approves Shapiro’s budget, it will provide a fraction of what his district needs to keep up with skyrocketing costs.
“Despite our district’s efforts to cut costs and increase efficiency, we are still struggling to make ends meet,” he said. “The unfortunate result will be an increase in our local taxes and staff cuts — a higher cost for a more strained system in our community.”
Foremost on the list of legislative actions that would help public schools is a measure to cap cyber charter school tuition at $8,000 per student per year. Cyber charters are taxpayer-funded online schools. When a family chooses to send a child to a cyber charter, their home school district pays the tuition.
Critics argue that the tuition districts must pay bears little relation to the actual cost of providing an online education. As a result, the state’s largest charter schools amassed budget surpluses totaling $619 million between 2020 and 2023, according to a report by Republican state Auditor General Timothy DeFoor earlier this year.
The House has passed a bill to cap cyber charter tuition and it is now before the Senate.
The Senate Education Committee, meanwhile, advanced a bill to create a taxpayer-funded private school tuition voucher program. 
Holly Arnold, president of the Tunkhannock Area School Board in Wyoming County, said vouchers are favored by those who would rather abandon public schools than give them the resources they need to address societal problems such as poverty, housing insecurity, hunger, mental health, and community violence. 
“These are not just educational issues. They are societal issues that land on the desk of teachers, staff and administrators every single day across the state,” Arnold said, adding, “Creating yet another voucher program here in Pennsylvania doesn’t address these issues. It simply gives wealthy families a subsidy for attending private schools.”
Arnold noted that, according to the state Independent Fiscal Office, the existing Education Incentive Tax Credit and Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit programs, which allow businesses and individuals to obtain tax credits for contributing to private school scholarship funds lack accountability.

Shapiro’s budget also includes an increase in the state’s student teacher stipend program, which is designed to lower economic barriers to becoming a teacher by helping college students with their expenses while gaining classroom experience. 
The program began last year with $10 million in funding. While thousands applied, only hundreds were able to receive funding. Later, during budget negotiations, the program received an additional $20 million, though it was still not enough to cover many applicants. 
“Far too many promising future educators are forced to walk away because they simply cannot afford to work for free while also paying tuition,” said Samantha McNally, president of the Manheim Township Education Association in Lancaster County. “If we are serious about equity, not just for students, but for the future of the education profession, we must invest in student teacher stipends.” 
Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, a senior attorney at the Public Interest Law Center, said he’s hopeful the legislature will agree on educational adequacy funding without controversy this year after laying the groundwork with strong bipartisan support last year. Cyber charter reform is a critical next step, but the scope of the adequacy gap is well beyond any single aspect of the education budget.
“I want to be realistic that the solution to underfunded schools is a lot more funding,” Urevick-Ackelsberg said. “That’s just the reality of it. We’re billions of dollars in a hole. We’ve got to climb out of it.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4539-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-07 21:03:01.803699

However, increased participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) could improve maternal and infant health in a state where these groups face among the highest mortality rates nationwide, according to a Monday news release from the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
The Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance has been working to increase WIC enrollment with the same goal, said Cathy May, the organization’s director of WIC outreach. She added that federal cuts to health insurance and food assistance programs for low-income people, which President Donald Trump signed into law Friday, will likely lead to more people “looking for ways to help with their grocery budgets.”
“Some of [the cuts] are slated to roll out in a little bit of time, but I think we’re already going to start seeing ripple effects in our charitable food network and other areas,” May said.
Only 35% of WIC-eligible Arkansans participate in the assistance program, compared to the national average of 51%, according to the CDC.
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

Arkansas has the nation’s highest rate of food insecurity, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in September 2024. Additionally, the state has one of the nation’s highest maternal mortality rates and the third highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
WIC usage “carries less stigma for participants than other government assistance programs,” according to the UAMS news release, but community health workers told UAMS researchers during a 2023 study that “many of their clients have experienced confusion when it comes to eligibility criteria and the availability of WIC-approved foods.”
Low-income Arkansans might be under the impression that being ineligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) means they are also ineligible for WIC, but this is not true, “because the income guidelines are far looser for WIC than they are for SNAP,” May said.
SNAP-eligible Arkansans currently must have a gross income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines — currently $19,578 for an individual and $40,560 for a family of four — and a net income below 100% of this threshold.
However, WIC-eligible Arkansans’ income must be below 185% of the federal poverty line, which is $27,861 for an individual and $57,720 for a family of four.
Additionally, U.S. citizenship is not a requirement to receive WIC benefits while it is for SNAP benefits.
Arkansas is home to the largest Marshallese community in the country, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. They are considered lawful non-immigrant U.S. residents and eligible for many programs open to citizens. They have not always been eligible for SNAP, though their eligibility was restored last year after federal law cut it in 1996.
While Marshallese people can apply for WIC if eligible, most of them only use it for infant formula, said Philmar Mendoza-Kabua, a Marshallese project manager and nurse educator at the UAMS Institute for Community Health Innovation, in Monday’s news release.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
UAMS research in 2023 showed that 80% of Marshallese women and 81% of other Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander women in Arkansas reported needing assistance applying for WIC. Nationally, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women experience the lowest rates of WIC enrollment, according to the CDC.
May and Mendoza-Kabua agreed that WIC-accessible food products should align with the dietary preferences and traditions of minority groups such as Marshallese people.
UAMS includes “improvements in culturally appropriate food options and flexibility for individual preferences of food” among its recommendations for ways to encourage WIC participation. Other recommendations include focusing outreach efforts on underserved areas and addressing “logistical challenges such as language and transportation barriers.”
Insufficient transportation can be the main thing preventing a household from enrolling in WIC, May said, because an assessment by an Arkansas Health Department dietitian is necessary to determine WIC eligibility. Rural families might not have the means to travel to a dietitian’s clinic during its hours of operation.
Telehealth for Arkansas WIC could help reduce food insecurity, advocates say

The Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance has discussed ways to bridge this gap in services with the Health Department, May said.
“If there could be satellite [department] locations where a family may be already going in a rural area, which most of the time doesn’t have public transportation, that would be a way for people that are eligible to be able to go through the assessment without having so many barriers,” she said.
As of last year, at least half of Arkansas WIC recipients are considered “high-risk” and are required to meet with a registered dietitian within 45 days of enrollment, but the Health Department had only 13 dietitians serving the entire state, agency officials told lawmakers in September.

(Pool photo by Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune)Attorneys for Ralph Menzies are requesting another review to determine whether the 67-year-old death row inmate with dementia is competent enough to be executed, arguing that his cognitive decline has worsened in the year since he was last evaluated. 
The petition, filed in Utah’s 3rd District Court on Monday, comes as the Utah Attorney General’s Office is gearing up to submit an execution warrant for Menzies, and will discuss the application during a hearing Wednesday. He has been sentenced to die by firing squad. 
Menzies, who has spent the last 40 years on death row for the 1986 murder of Maurine Hunsaker, was found competent to be executed by a judge in early June, capping off a review that began in November and included testimony from a number of medical professionals.

Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed. While all medical professionals found that Menzies’ dementia impaired him in some way, whether he still understands why the state is pursuing the death penalty was debated — doctors hired by Menzies’ legal team say he isn’t competent and doctors hired by the state say he is. 
Ultimately, 3rd District Judge Matthew Bates wrote that Menzies does have dementia, but it’s not enough to prevent him from understanding why he’s being punished. In the year since his initial evaluation, Menzies’ attorneys say his cognitive decline has gotten so bad that another review is necessary. 
According to court documents, a competency revaluation can happen if the inmate has experienced “a substantial change in circumstances” since the first evaluation. Menzies’ attorneys are requesting a doctor from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services who evaluated Menzies last year to revisit the inmate in a “limited revaluation.” 
“We are asking the court to take a second look because Ralph Menzies has significantly declined. He has advanced vascular disease resulting in terminal dementia, and cannot remember why he is being punished, or even that he is under a sentence of death. He now needs help to eat, clean, and breathe — and he no longer meets the legal standard for execution. The Constitution does not allow the government to execute someone who lacks even a basic understanding of what is happening to them. This petition is about upholding that principle,” said Lindsey Layer, one of Menzies’ attorneys, in a statement. 
As state moves toward execution, Ralph Menzies’ attorneys appeal to Utah Supreme Court

Menzies was evaluated by two different doctors in the last week who both found the inmate “has undergone significant physical and cognitive decline,” according to court documents. 
“Not only does he not understand the link between his crime and punishment, but there is a significant question as to whether he is aware of the punishment he is about to suffer or why he is to suffer it,” reads the petition filed on Monday. 
Menzies struggles to get out of bed and dress himself, and is unable to retrieve his meal tray or clean his cell, according to the petition. His attorneys say he’s lost his ability to “engage in relatively coherent and adult conversations,” and now speaks in “simplistic and immature terms.” 
During the most recent evaluations, Menzies would say things like, “they don’t tell me all the details” and “they can only lock you up or kill you,” when asked why he was sentenced to death, per court documents. He believes the judge’s June decision declaring him competent to be executed “means they tell me bye-bye,” according to the petition. 
His mental state is made worse by a recent, “severe hypoxic event,” where the brain is deprived of oxygen, according to his attorneys. 
Menzies was convicted of murder in 1988 after he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed.
Menzies spent decades on death row, and in recent years his health has deteriorated. After falling several times in prison he was diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony. An MRI exam showed Menzies’ brain tissue is deteriorating. 
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection or firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced in 1988, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court last week declined a petition from the State of Montana that sought to revive a 2013 law requiring minors to get consent from a parent to obtain an abortion.
Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen had argued that a decision by the Montana Supreme Court last year declaring the law unconstitutional “threatens parents’ longstanding fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment of the federal Constitution to direct the care and custody of their minor children.”
The nation’s highest court opted against reviewing the decision, but in a two-page decision, Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote that their conclusion came from technicalities in the case, not “as a rejection of the argument that the petition asks us to decide.”
Montana’s petition asked the court to determine “[w]hether a parent’s fundamental right to direct the care and custody of his or her children includes a right to know and participate in decisions concerning their minor child’s medical care, including a minor’s decision to seek an abortion.” The justices wrote that “because of the way this case was litigated below, it provides a poor vehicle for deciding that question.”
The original case, Planned Parenthood vs. Montana, concerned a bill passed by the Montana Legislature during the 2013 session. A district court judge temporarily blocked the law from going into effect — but the law ended up enjoined for 11 years.
A new administration in the Attorney General’s Office in 2021 came with renewed interest in that law, and the legal battle resumed under Knudsen.
When the Montana Supreme Court finally took up the case last year, it agreed with a district court ruling that struck down the law, finding it violated the Montana Constitution and the Supreme Court’s prior holdings in Armstrong vs. State of Montana and Weems vs. State of Montana.
The unanimous state supreme court ruling from August 2024 stated that minors’ privacy rights makes the law unconstitutional.
“A minor’s right to dignity, autonomy, and the right to choose are embedded in the liberties found in the Montana Constitution,” wrote Justice Laurie McKinnon. “Because a minor’s right to control her reproductive decisions is among the most fundamental of the rights she possesses, and because the State has failed to demonstrate a real and significant relationship between the statutory classification and the ends asserted, we hold that the Consent Act violates the Constitution of the State of Montana.”
But Knudsen said the state court “elevated a minor’s state constitutional rights over parents’ federal constitutional rights,” and sought federal intervention.
Representatives from the attorney general’s office did not respond to the Daily Montanan’s requests for comment, but did issue statements to multiple news outlets, saying the AG’s office was “disappointed” in the decision not to hear the case.
“However, as Justices Thomas and Alito made clear today, this issue has not been settled by the courts and the legal battle is far from over,” spokesperson Emilee Cantrell told MTN News. “Attorney General Knudsen will not waver in his support of parents’ longstanding and fundamental right to direct the care and upbringing of their children.”
In a statement, Martha Fuller, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Montanan, praised the decision by the nation’s highest court.
“Every Montanan has a fundamental right to privacy and deserves the ability to control their own bodies and futures,” Fuller said. “Montana courts, including the State Supreme Court, have affirmed the constitutional right to privacy, and Planned Parenthood of Montana will always do whatever we can to ensure that medical privacy and safe abortion access remain protected for Montanans and families.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_4224-2048x1536-1-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-07 20:04:55.617309

This story by Steve Taylor was first published in the Valley News on July 7.
It was a half century ago that Eastman and Quechee Lakes got off the ground, becoming what were the biggest housing developments ever to hit the Upper Valley, a status they still hold in 2025. Each has its own founding story, but in many aspects they share great similarities in how they evolved and where they are today.
Initially, they were pitched as meccas for well-to-do down country people wanting a second home up north amid the leafy hills and lush green meadows. The developments would be property tax bonanzas for the host towns, with virtually no burden from public services like schools.
Both were conceived to be examples of how development ought to be carried out at a time when Vermont and New Hampshire were witnessing a wave of shoddy developments on mountainsides and lakeshores. Planning and strategy would flow from two similar, colorful and controversial figures who were adept at gaining political support but who soon engendered prickly relations with the press and authorities in towns adjacent to their sprawling projects.
Eastman and Quechee Lakes both involved creation of large new water bodies, golf courses and ski runs, establishment of rigid site and architectural requirements and offered lucrative work for a legion of excavation and building contractors for decades.
Of greatest importance, however, is how the two developments would evolve from being purely leisure venues to the Upper Valley’s largest resources of primary housing for workers at the region’s Goliath employers, Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center and Dartmouth College, along with the myriad businesses and services that have pushed the area away from an Appalachian-style economy.
Quechee Lakes was first out of the gate when L. John Davidson, the head of a new corporation, laid out ambitious plans to “make Quechee the most beautiful village in Vermont” to a group of officials that included Gov. Deane C. Davis. The September 1969 presentation called for a golf course, restaurant, country club, family ski resort, specialty shops, an inn, a game preserve and recreational bodies of water.

Rumors had already been circulating about this out-of-state corporation buying up farms and woodland along the Ottauquechee River, with people speculating it was everything from a stalking horse for Laurance Rockefeller to a mafia operation. Davidson went to great lengths to assure his listeners that his enterprise was legit, backed by Kane Financial, a major Boston investment firm.
Harvard-educated Davidson came from the family that owned the ultra-preppy Andover Shops in Cambridge and Andover, Mass. He had made his chops as a developer in the booming Bay State real estate market and was taken by the potential of a resort community built in what was a tired little mill village and its surrounding classic rural Vermont countryside. So he set to work lining up support from local bigwigs like Norman “Joe” Reed, chairman of the Hartford Selectboard.
Gov. Davis said he “liked what he saw” in Davidson’s slideshow presentation and soon planning and economic development officials from both Windsor County and the state were falling in line behind Reed supporting Davidson’s ambitious plans. By 1974, Davidson’s Quechee Lakes Corp. had purchased almost 6,000 acres of land, about a quarter of all the ground in the town of Hartford. Gone were five dairy and fruit farms and a number of smaller holdings. One farmer, Henri Dupuis, thought he’d a made hell of a deal when he sold 100 acres for $100,000.

John Davidson during an inspection tour by state officials of huge land holdings the firm has in the Hartford township on Sept. 5, 1969. “So far, I like what I see,” Davis said after viewing a presentation, which includes plans for a golf course, restaurant, country club, family ski resort, specialty shops, an inn, a game reserve and recreational bodies of water.

But not everybody was on board, and the Quechee Lakes project began picking up criticism from some in the public and garnering aggressive coverage in state newspapers. There were holdouts who were refusing to sell. While Hartford was giving it velvet-glove regulatory treatment, it was encountering determined opposition in adjacent Pomfret, where part of its land lay.
But Davidson and his team forged ahead with sales of lots for single-family houses and condominiums, even while construction of roads, recreational facilities and the signature “lake” were proceeding. Davidson became well-known for both his charm and his volcanic temper. Along the way he had marriages with women from prominent Hanover and Quechee families.
Twenty-five miles to the southeast in the town of Grantham a similarly ambitious real estate project was taking shape in the early 1970s. Like Quechee, it was conceived as a way to show what carefully planned and executed development ought to look like. Behind this initiative were four bastions of old New Hampshire money and influence: Dartmouth College, the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, Chubb Life Insurance and the Manchester Bank.
They began by buying 3,500 acres of forest land from Rockwell International, which had acquired it through real estate deals that traced back to the Draper Corporation, a manufacturer of wooden bobbins for textile mills in the early 20th century. The property was in a town with a population of scarcely 300 and, most important, no planning, zoning or subdivision regulations.
A months-long search for someone to ramrod this initiative yielded Emil Hanslin, who had earned great acclaim for his work on a posh Cape Cod development called New Seabury. A fawning 1973 Time magazine profile of Hanslin laid out the owners’ goals: “… somebody to resolve their almost contradictory requirements … a high quality development that also would include some low-priced housing while conserving as much land as possible — and all to be sold at a profit. If anyone could deliver that, they decided, it would be Emil Hanslin.”

The development was named “Eastman” by the owners after a family that had once lived on the land. This then required convincing state and federal agencies to put the name on all official maps and highway signs going forward. Hanslin and a platoon of planners set to work, aiming to lay out 1,647 house sites of one to five acres, plus 400 clustered units. To achieve a land conservation goal, lot buyers were required to deed back to the development a portion of their land as permanent open space.
Hanslin quickly grasped New Hampshire politics and began staging lavish parties for movers and shakers at his residence in nearby New London. It probably didn’t matter, for as long as it was okay in the town, it was fine with the state bigwigs. But it wasn’t too long before Eastman was getting buffeted by the press, notably the now defunct alt-weekly, the New Hampshire Times, which frequently raised issues over things like destruction of deer yards and erection of a large dam to create a 340-acre pond.
The next-door towns of Springfield and Enfield would become thorns in Eastman’s side as its holdings lapped over town boundaries. Springfield was tough on lot layouts; Enfield, after decades of wrangling, adopted land use regulation in response to Eastman’s strategies in Grantham.
Eastman sales started off briskly, but gradually the four sponsors began having second thoughts about their participation and eventually they all divested. As with Quechee Lakes, the founding principle of building a demonstration development of second homes would morph gradually over the ensuing decades, and there would be numerous struggles over ownership, governance, management and finances.

Relative stability would eventually come in the form of landowners’ associations that essentially control operations for things such as snowplowing and facilities maintenance and oversee adherence to standards for architecture and property appearance. These entities are funded by fees. Eastman’s association gets $7,000 upfront and then about $4,400 per home annually. Owners of vacant lots get charged, too, and additional levies support water and sewer utilities.
Quechee Lakes today has 1,289 properties, including 711 single-family housing units and 578 condominiums, plus permitted unsold lots now in the hands of a company that markets them and handles all building construction. Eastman has 1,000 houses and 335 condominium units with about 40 vacant lots available for sale.
John Davidson and Emil Hanslin both would be replaced in the late 1970s. Davidson later moved on to oversee a luxury shorefront development in the Winnipesaukee area, lead a failed effort to raise a sunken treasure ship and dabbled in a venture to develop a process to pasteurize eggs in the shell. He died last year. Hanslin stuck around the Grantham area, partnering with his son Tony in a land development project on another parcel of Rockwell land near Eastman that became known as Olde Farms. He also founded and operated Yankee Barn Homes, which designs and fabricates contemporary homes using a blend of vintage barn timbers and modern materials. He died in 1987.
Although developed to tap the market for leisure time homes just off the region’s I-89/ I-91 sinews, Quechee Lakes and Eastman today are vital pieces of the housing puzzle in the Upper Valley. Reliable estimates put the percentage of the residents in both developments who are full time workers in the locality’s institutions and businesses at around 60%. That number is slowly growing, while retirees who reside full time in the developments make up the bulk of the balance, with the segment of full-time residents over age 70 slowly expanding.
Promised to have no new public service burdens, both host communities have had to expand school facilities to handle children that nobody foresaw coming to their doorsteps 50 years ago. Grantham’s school census today is almost half again larger than that of the whole town population back in 1975. Expanded fire, police and other municipal services have had to be funded to deal with the needs of a larger and quite different population.
Some old-timers still mourn all that has been displaced or lost, but, for the economic and social health of the Upper Valley, a good argument can be made that these two huge developments have had a positive impact.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Corn and soybean crops continue to progress well throughout Iowa, with 15% of corn silking and 36% of soybeans blooming amid another week of above-average temperatures and precipitation, according to the latest crop progress and condition report. 
This statistic puts corn two days ahead of the five-year average, and the report, generated from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service, said there were several accounts of corn reaching the dough stage across the state.
Iowa’s main crops rated overall good to excellent during the reporting period of June 30 through July 6. Corn rated 86% good to excellent and soybeans rated 79%. 
Oats, which are almost entirely headed across the state and are coloring on more than half of acres in the state, rated 88% good or excellent. Farmers are finished with the second cutting of 53% of alfalfa hay acres in the state, which overall rated 84% good or excellent.

Across crops, acres in central regions of the state are the furthest along, according to the report. Thirty-three percent of soybean acres in east central Iowa are setting pods, and in central Iowa, 17% are setting pods. Southeast Iowa, at 15%, is the only other region with more than 10% of soybean acres setting pods. 
Rod Pierce, a soybean and corn farmer in Boone County, said in a call last week the big rains from the week prior had slowed down his spraying schedule and created “some wetness in his fields.” 
Besides that, he said his beans were “blooming good — very good” and his corn was “a couple of leaves out from tasseling.” 
Climate outlooks, posted on the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship website, show more precipitation and warm temperatures are expected this week.
“Outlooks for the next few weeks indicate that warm weather is likely to stick around as we enter the peak of county fair season and an important period for corn and soybean development,” Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said in a statement. 
Justin Glisan, the state climatologist, said Iowa had an average precipitation of 1.36 inches across the state during the reporting period, which was several tenths of an inch above the normal. Some areas of the state, according to the report, got as much as 5 inches during the period. 
Glisan said the week had “unseasonably warm and wet” conditions. The statewide average temperature of 76.4 degrees was 3.2 degrees above normal, though the state’s highest temperature, logged in Ames, was 11 degrees above the normal.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University


Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

The death of a woman whose body was found on the side of a road in Woodbury on June 19 has been ruled a homicide, authorities said. 
Tina Daigle, 38, was assaulted and fatally strangled, according to a Monday afternoon brief from the Vermont State Police. The autopsy was conducted by the Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington.
Daigle was born, raised and lived in Hardwick and had five children, according to an obituary. She was a nurse’s assistant in several facilities across the Northeast Kingdom and worked at the ReSource thrift store in Morrisville. She was also an amateur collector, and particularly enjoyed items related to “highland cows, native American culture and apples.”

BURLINGTON — A Hyde Park man accused of helping conceal the fatal shooting of two Massachusetts men in northern Vermont where their alleged killer faces a possible death sentence has reached a plea agreement with prosecutors. 
Dilan Jiron, 29, entered guilty pleas Monday to two federal charges: conspiracy to possess a firearm in a drug trafficking crime and helping Theodore Bland, 30, formerly of Stowe, to cover up the fatal shootings. 
As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, Jiron faces up to 23 years in prison on the two charges. 
A sentencing date has been set for Oct. 20.  
In U.S. District Court in Burlington on Monday, Jiron told Judge William K. Sessions III that he understood that by pleading guilty to the two charges he was giving up his right to a trial.
Bland and Jiron have both been charged in connection with the deaths of Jahim Solomon, of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and Eric White, of Chicopee, Massachusetts.

On Oct. 25, 2023, Vermont State Police officers found the bodies of Solomon and White, both 21, in a wooded area of Eden, about a mile apart from each other, and reported that the men had been fatally shot. 
The families of two Massachusetts men had notified authorities days earlier the two men had disappeared while in Vermont, according to police. 
Court records stated that the killings occurred on Oct. 12, 2023, when Bland allegedly shot  Solomon and White in Vermont in a drug-dealing dispute. 
Bland “induced” others to help him move the bodies of White and Solomon to the wooded area in Eden, where they were later found by police, according to the court filings. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont announced in February that it was bringing charges against Bland that carry the possibility of the death penalty. Those charges included one for using and carrying “a firearm in relation to a drug trafficking crime causing the deaths of Jahim Solomon and Eric White in circumstances that constitute murder under federal law.”
However, the office has not filed a motion confirming it will seek the death penalty for Bland, should he be convicted. 
Jiron’s plea agreement filed last week stated he admitted to assisting “Theodore Bland in transporting the body of Jahim Solomon to a wooded area and attempted to hide it from detection of investigating authorities.” 
The plea agreement stated that, Jiron provided false information to authorities investigating the double homicide. 
Bland and Jiron remain incarcerated without bail as the cases against them proceed.

CoreCivic reveló en documentos […]","Miembros de Kansas Interfaith Action participaron en una manifestación el 20 de mayo de 2025 frente al juzgado federal de Topeka, donde protestaron contra Core Civic y la detención de inmigrantes con fines de lucro. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — El Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos usó el pretexto de una emergencia nacional para justificar un contrato secreto, sin licitación, con CoreCivic que pagaría a la compañía 4.2 millones de dólares por mes para alojar a inmigrantes detenidos en su prisión vacante de Leavenworth.
CoreCivic reveló en documentos judiciales la cantidad de dinero que podría perder si la ciudad de Leavenworth prevalece en los procedimientos legales que buscan impedir que la empresa reabra su prisión. Sin embargo, los detalles del contrato siguen sin revelarse.
El ICE presentó documentación interna que describe la justificación de la agencia para otorgar contratos a empresas privadas sin pasar por el proceso de licitación habitual ni revelar el costo, citando la declaración del presidente Donald Trump de una “emergencia nacional en la frontera sur”. La agencia afirmó que la situación “representa importantes riesgos para la seguridad pública”.
El secretismo, el costo y la justificación del contrato indignaron a los defensores de la inmigración que se oponen a los planes de CoreCivic de reabrir las instalaciones de Leavenworth, debido al historial de la compañía de abuso y negligencia hacía los prisioneros y la represión a nivel nacional por parte de agentes enmascarados del ICE que muestran poco respeto por los derechos civiles o el estatus de las personas que detienen.
“Solo queremos decir que podemos pagar de más a multimillonarios para que alberguen a seres humanos por violaciones del derecho civil”, dijo Michael Sharma-Crawford, abogado de inmigración de Kansas City. “Ni siquiera sé qué hacer a partir de ahora. Simplemente no lo sé. Es decir, todo está orientado a que los multimillonarios ganen más miles de millones y a seguir aplastando a los disidentes y a los derechos humanos en el camino”.
Sharma-Crawford dijo que los residentes merecen saber cómo se gastan sus dólares de impuestos.
“Esto no es una emergencia nacional. Están firmando un contrato para el alojamiento de detenidos civiles”, dijo. “No hay ningún secreto en eso. No hay conocimiento científico. No hay conocimiento táctico. No hay ningún secreto sobre lo que están pagando para alojar a la gente”.
 
La justificación
El ICE publicó su documento de justificación el 7 de abril bajo la categoría de “urgencia inusual y apremiante”. El documento menciona un compromiso de cinco años para pagar a empresas anónimas para operar nueve instalaciones que, en conjunto, contarían con 10,312 camas, incluyendo 1,000 en Kansas. El costo de los contratos secretos está omitido.
El documento señala que muchas jurisdicciones se han negado a colaborar con el ICE en los últimos años, lo que ha hecho que la agencia dependa cada vez más de empresas privadas. Una competencia abierta de ofertas tardaría un año en completarse, según el documento.
“El ICE no tiene tiempo para completar el proceso competitivo para adquirir más camas”, indica el documento. “Se necesita aumentar la capacidad de detención de inmediato para evitar que el ICE libere a un número significativo de extranjeros en Estados Unidos”.
CoreCivic operó una prisión federal preventiva en Leavenworth durante más de dos décadas. En 2021, la jueza federal de distrito Julie Robinson describió el centro, con su violencia habitual y sus prolongados confinamientos, como “un auténtico infierno”. El centro cerró el 1 de enero de 2022, cuando el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden rescindió los contratos con prisiones privadas.
La ciudad de Leavenworth presentó una demanda para impedir que CoreCivic reabriera las instalaciones como centro de detención de inmigrantes. La ciudad argumenta que la empresa debería solicitar un permiso, lo que podría exigirle mantener ciertas normas en las instalaciones. Un juez de distrito estatal emitió una orden judicial temporal que impide a CoreCivic reabrir las instalaciones mientras se litiga el asunto.
La compañía solicitó al juez en una presentación judicial del 13 de junio que reconsiderara la orden judicial temporal.
“CoreCivic tiene un contrato con ICE según el cual podría perder aproximadamente 4.2 millones de dólares en ingresos mensuales si el Tribunal mantiene la orden judicial temporal”, señala el expediente judicial.
Ryan Gustin, portavoz de CoreCivic, dijo que la compañía está “explorando todas las vías para llegar a una conclusión exitosa a este asunto”.
“CoreCivic ha estado promocionando activamente nuestras instalaciones de Leavenworth durante años”, dijo. “Nos mantenemos en contacto regular con el ICE y todos nuestros socios gubernamentales para comprender sus necesidades cambiantes, y trabajamos dentro de sus procesos de adquisición establecidos. Cualquier pregunta sobre nuestra relación contractual con el ICE debe dirigirse a Asuntos Públicos del ICE”.
El Departamento de Asuntos Públicos de ICE no respondió a una consulta del Kansas Reflector.
 
Beneficiarse del dolor
Micah Kubic, director ejecutivo de la Unión Estadounidense por las Libertades Civiles de Kansas, dijo que el acuerdo entre ICE y CoreCivic “refleja un patrón más amplio de colusión entre corporaciones privadas y sus facilitadores en esta administración presidencial”.
Al eludir sus propios requisitos de licitación, el ICE se ha asegurado de que sus favoritos obtengan cuantiosos contratos federales financiados con el dinero de los contribuyentes para llenar sus cárceles. Hemos visto cómo este robo de dinero se traduce en una conducta imprudente, a veces aterradora, por parte de agentes anónimos y enmascarados en nuestros barrios.
Sharma-Crawford, el abogado de inmigración, dijo que tiene clientes que fueron detenidos por el ICE tras ingresar al país con una visa o solicitar asilo inmediatamente y se encontraban legalmente en el país. Añadió que los agentes del ICE estaban tratando desesperadamente de completar los números.
Ashley Hernández, coordinadora de organización y políticas de la Oficina de Justicia, Paz e Integridad de la Creación de las Hermanas de la Caridad de Leavenworth, dijo que la supuesta emergencia nacional sólo está “en la cabeza de la gente”.
“Hemos visto mucha propaganda y mucho discurso de odio que, de alguna manera, impulsa eso”, dijo Hernández. “Creo que la emergencia nacional, si es que la hay, es que hay personas que vienen a nuestro país buscando ayuda, buscando una vida mejor, y huyen de las verdaderas emergencias nacionales que existen en sus países. Huyen de la muerte. Huyen de la enfermedad. Huyen del dolor”.
Ella dijo que era “una locura” permitir que cualquier empresa “se lucre a costa del dolor humano”.
“Como católicos, como personas de fe, estamos llamados a tratar a todos con dignidad”, dijo Hernández. “Estamos llamados a ayudar a los pobres, a los enfermos, a acompañar a los marginados y a ser sus voces. Por eso, nuestra fe nos llama a asegurarnos de que la apertura de este centro de detención no suceda”.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200573-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-07 19:06:27.218409

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Sen. Herman Quirmbach, a Democrat from Ames, announced Monday he submitted a request to Senate leadership, calling for a special session to override the governor’s veto of a bill pertaining to eminent domain and carbon dioxide pipelines. 
Quirmbach joins 70 members of the House, from both parties, who signed a petition in June, calling for a special session to override the veto. Two-thirds of senators would have to agree with Quirmbach for a special session to be called. 
Quirmbach said he’s not sure if his request, submitted July 3 to Senate President Amy Sinclair, R-Allerton, will be effective in mobilizing enough senators for a special session, but said he “personally felt it was important to make (his) opposition clear.” 
“I think we should do something about eminent domain this year,” Quirmbach said in a call with Iowa Capital Dispatch. 
The bill, House File 639, was highly controversial during session, resulting in hours of floor and closed-door debates before eventually passing the Senate 27-22. 
This followed several years of bills aimed at eminent domain reform, and limiting the abilities of carbon sequestration pipelines, that passed the House but were not taken up by the Senate. 
HF 639 was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds, who said the bill included “sweeping mandates that reach far beyond their intended targets.” 

About the bill
House File 639 would have increased insurance requirements for hazardous liquid pipelines, limited carbon pipeline permits to one 25-year term and changed the definition of a common carrier for pipelines, making it more difficult for the projects to use eminent domain. It also included several provisions related to the Iowa Utilities Commission. In her explanation of her decision to veto the bill, Reynolds instructed the IUC to follow a provision in the bill requiring commissioner attendance at  hearings and meetings.

The bill would have affected the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would stretch close to 1,000 miles through Iowa to connect to biofuel facilities and transport their captured carbon dioxide to underground storage in North Dakota. The project would allow the biofuels industries, and the associated feedstock industries, to enter the ultra-low carbon fuel market.  
Quirmbach, in a statement, said he’s not opposed to the pipeline project, nor the ethanol industry, but said the project would need to clear certain “hurdles” related to safety and land acquisition. 
“If the pipeline would generate such large financial gains to Summit, it should offer landowners prices generous enough to secure voluntary sales,” Quirmbach said. “Use the voluntary market, not government force.”
Summit Carbon Solutions has said in previous statements it has secured voluntary easements for 75% of its first-phase route through Iowa, which equates to $175 million in contracts with more than 1,300 Iowans. 
Quirmbach said he submitted the request as a “personal desire” and said he had not spoken with any of his Democratic colleagues. 
Iowa Senate Democrats did not respond to requests for comment on their willingness to support a petition for special session. 
Sen. Sinclair and Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver did not respond to requests for comment, but have previously expressed they agreed with the governor’s decision to veto the bill. Whitver has said Senate Republicans “would not be interested” in a special session for a veto override.
House Republicans, who led the charge on the bill and on the House’s call for special session, did not respond to requests for comment.

John Hoeven, left, speaks during a press conference next to Sen. Kevin Cramer and U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak at the North Dakota Petroleum Council in Bismarck on July 7, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota’s congressional delegation emphasized the elimination of tax credits for solar and wind projects as part of the federal reconciliation package will be a huge win for coal, gas and oil producers.
The bill was signed into law by President Donald Trump during a White House ceremony on July 4.
During a Monday press conference touting the “big, beautiful” bill at North Dakota Petroleum Council offices in Bismarck, North Dakota Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer, and U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, all Republicans, took turns at the microphone praising the Republican tax bill and how it will help North Dakotans, the energy grid and the country.
“It’s baseload for the good of the grid, for the stability of the grid. We need 24/7 and that means big, beautiful coal,” Hoeven said. “Here in North Dakota, we’re a big, big part of it. We’re an energy powerhouse for this country and we intend to do more.”
Cramer said the U.S. needed to change its energy policy otherwise artificial intelligence data centers, crypto mining and other quantum computing industries would find homes in other countries.
He also said the country has been subsidizing wind and solar energy sources for about 35 years and those sources are still not able to “stand on its own merit.”
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

“We’ve actually diminished the reliability of our grid by putting intermittent … electricity on that grid,” Cramer said. “You have to have generation and generation that is available 15% of the time isn’t going to build you many server farms.”
Fedorchak, a former utility regulator, said about 95% of the new power generation hooked into the energy grid recently was from wind and solar projects.
“I wonder why? It’s because we’re telling them that’s what we want with our production tax credits,” she said. “They have to go away. It’s absolutely essential for the reliability of our grid.”
The reconciliation package also expands an existing 45Q tax credit used for carbon sequestration to include enhanced oil recovery.
“Now the incentive is not to put CO2 down a hole just for storage. Now the incentive is to produce oil and gas with it,” Hoeven said. “We can lengthen the lives of our coal plants and work with oil and gas to maybe double what we’ve produced in the Bakken.”
US House passes massive tax break and spending cut bill, sending it to Trump

The bill is also expected to cut $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Hoeven said the program will now incentivize states to keep their SNAP error-payment rates below 6% to avoid paying for a portion of the program themselves.
“If you are a state that is 6% or less, you don’t pick up any of the cost share,” Hoeven said. “But the federal government is still saving money because you reduce that error rate. People who should be working and who are not, and are getting food stamps when they should not be getting them, they no longer get them. So the taxpayer still saves.”
In 2022 and 2023, North Dakota’s SNAP payment error rate was 9.5%, according to Legislative Council. The state has averaged a 5.4% error rate over the last 10 years. The analysis from the Legislative Council also projects that North Dakota will see increased costs to administer SNAP.
Hoeven said North Dakota would need to pick up about $6 million per year in new administrative costs under the new cost share formula.
In a statement released Sunday, state Rep. Lisa Finley-DeVille, D-Mandaree, said programs like Medicaid and SNAP helped her family as she raised five children on the Fort Berthold Reservation. 
She said Fedorchak, Hoeven and Cramer chose party loyalty and donor priorities over the health and dignity of North Dakotans.
“This bill is a betrayal of our values,” she said. “It gives away trillions in tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy while gutting the basic lifelines that keep our elders, caregivers, and working families afloat — especially in tribal and rural communities.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)The massive tax and spending bill signed into law last week by President Trump put a 10-year delay on a proposed staffing rule South Dakota health care groups said would close nursing homes.
The rule from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services would’ve required nursing homes to keep a nurse on site 24/7, starting in 2026 for urban areas and in 2027 for rural ones. Each resident would’ve been entitled to about three and a half hours of daily care from nurses, nursing aides and other staff.
Most nursing homes in South Dakota don’t hit that mark. 
South Dakota joins multi-state lawsuit seeking to halt federal nursing home staffing rule

Just 5% met the proposed daily staffing requirements as of last year, one lobbyist told the Legislature’s budget-setting committee in November. Another called the new staffing expectations “impossible” in parts of rural South Dakota that already rely on expensive contract nurses, and said up to 600 residents would risk displacement from home closures if the rule took effect.
“We’d have been looking at somehow finding over 299 additional staff, and about $19 million to do it,” Mark Deak, who leads the South Dakota Health Care Association, told South Dakota Searchlight this week. “One, where do you find 300 additional staff? And two, if you could, where do you get the money to do it?”
Deak praised the 10-year delay, which, he said, “in the congressional world, is essentially a repeal.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, noted the rule’s delay in an email listing the “wins” for his state in the “big, beautiful bill.”
South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley was among the attorneys general to sign on to a multistate lawsuit over the rule that was filed last year against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The South Dakota Association of Health Care Organizations also signed on to that lawsuit, which was closed in the Northern District of Iowa last month after a judge ruled in favor of the opponents on the 24/7 nurse and staffing rules.
Tim Rave, head of the association of health care organizations, said last week that the rule’s delay was expected after Trump’s election last fall, but welcome.

The battle over election certification was one of several contentious issues that came to define the 2024 election cycle in Georgia, as conservative activists — many of whom embraced President Donald Trump’s unfounded claims about massive voter fraud — sought to overhaul certain state election rules ahead of the presidential election. 
  In August 2024, the Georgia State Election Board passed new rules that would allow county canvassing boards to conduct their own investigations before certifying election results. Those rules were later overturned by a Fulton County Superior Court judge. Stanley Dunlap/Georgia Recorder
Last fall, Fulton County election board member Julie Adams, a Republican who refused to certify the results in her county’s presidential preference primary, filed a lawsuit against Fulton County, arguing that board members have the option to refuse to certify election results if they have reason to believe they are inaccurate. A spate of last-minute rule changes issued by the State Election Board would also have granted county boards greater leeway to delay certifying election results, but were later struck down by a Superior Court judge.
In October, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney rejected her claim, issuing a ruling that stated “election superintendents in Georgia have a mandatory fixed obligation to certify election results.”
In a decision issued Wednesday, a three-judge panel agreed.
“Adams’ contention that the trial court erred by declaring she had a mandatory duty to certify election results is without merit,” the judges wrote in their decision. They also concluded that while election officials have certain forms of recourse if they believe there are errors in the election counts, “these concerns are not a basis for a superintendent to partially or entirely refuse to certify election results by the deadline.”
Georgia law explicitly requires election boards to certify the election results no later than 5 p.m. on the Monday following the election. 
The decision also vacated a piece of McBurney’s ruling that had enabled elections officials to request a wide range of additional election documents at their discretion, pointing to a 2025 state Supreme Court ruling that limits county election officials’ ability to review documents to “only those occasions on which the total votes exceed the total number of electors, voters, or ballots,” within a specific precinct. 
The case will now be sent back to the Fulton County Superior Court for further consideration.

“We’ll be wrestling with this for years to come,” said one local leader as the state continues to rebuild nearly $1 billion in damaged infrastructure after record rainfall in July 2023 and 2024.

Drive through the small Northeast Kingdom town of Newark on this week’s anniversaries of July floods in 2023 and 2024 and you’ll discover highways repaired, 2023 cleanup costs paid and 2024 debts soon to be settled.
“We’re fortunate,” Newark Town Clerk Amber Holden said of damage totaling less than $300,000.
But surrounding communities, still rebuilding from nearly $1 billion in estimated destruction statewide, face rockier roads.
The town of Lyndon, for example, has secured a $18.9 million line of credit — more than double its $7.4 million annual budget — to repair miles of pavement, the municipal office building, water and sewer plants and a historic covered bridge. While federal and state reimbursements have fully covered the $500,000 in eligible damage from 2023, the town has received just $140,000 toward $14 million in 2024 expenses.

“People see things are back to normal, but they don’t understand how much paperwork remains,” Lyndon Municipal Administrator Justin Smith said. “What’s left is pretty astronomical.”
Neighboring communities are awaiting their own fixes and funds to replace inundated infrastructure, be it Cabot for a new $8 million public safety building or Marshfield for a $8.3 million package of four bridges and three culverts.
“We’ll be wrestling with this for years to come,” said Bram Towbin, town clerk for nearby Plainfield, which is working to reopen its Brook Road artery and recoup more than $8 million in repair costs.
The story’s the same in dozens of cities and towns on the anniversaries of what the National Weather Service calls “The Great Vermont Flood of 2023” and “The Significant Flooding and Severe Weather Event of 2024.”
“We’ve said from the beginning this is a long process,” said Douglas Farnham, the state’s chief recovery officer. “We still have a lot of progress to make.”

‘We have to find the money’
Up to 200 of Vermont’s 247 cities and towns reported flooding in the past two years, with a VTDigger survey finding several dozen still awash in red ink and repairs. Yet amid the slog, local and state leaders see reasons for optimism.
Vermont’s “Great Flood of 1927,” whose destruction would total up to $4 billion today, required four years of rebuilding, according to historians. Tropical Storm Irene hit so hard in 2011 that the state was finishing a few final projects when the 2023 deluge struck a dozen years later.
“It’s not as quickly as we would like,” Farnham said of the current recovery effort, “but it is consistent with our historical experience.”
Even so, the state has found cleaning up after the 2023 and 2024 storms to be uniquely challenging. The back-to-back floods ravaged freshly rebuilt infrastructure. Then the return of President Donald Trump in January raised concerns about potential cuts to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which had previously promised to cover 75% to 90% of Vermont’s recovery costs.

“The 2024 flooding destroyed pretty much everything we had repaired in 2023,” Michael Webber, Bolton’s town clerk and treasurer, said in February. “In a good year, you never knew how long FEMA would take. Who knows what’s going to happen now?”
But after a pause in federal funding this winter, local leaders reported money flowing again this spring. FEMA, which had reimbursed Vermont about $110 million for 2023 flooding and $10 million for 2024 damage just before Trump’s return, has since raised those payments by $65 million to $175 million for 2023 and by $5 million to $15 million for 2024, according to state figures.
FEMA declined to provide specifics about individual communities “for privacy reasons” and added only that reimbursement timelines “will vary by weeks or months” depending on the complexity of an application, according to an agency statement.
Moretown is wrestling with a collective $9 million in damage from 2023 and 2024 — almost five times its $1.9 million annual budget. This winter, the town had received about $750,000 from FEMA. Since then, it has reaped another $650,000.

“We’re in a waiting game,” Moretown Town Clerk Cherilyn Brown said.
Small town leaders blame much of the delay on a lack of enough staff to complete the paperwork required for reimbursements. Moretown, like many neighboring communities, doesn’t have a municipal manager or administrator. Instead, Brown juggles the jobs of town clerk, treasurer and tax collector.
Moretown has secured a $3 million loan for a year, but its bank recently expressed reluctance to extend any more money unless the municipality can promise that FEMA will pay.
“When Tropical Storm Irene hit, I contacted the bank, said, ‘I need $1 million and I need it now,’ and it was instantly there,” said Tammy Legacy, the town clerk in nearby Roxbury. “This time, not so much.”

Roxbury, whose 678 residents support an annual budget just under $1 million, has signed a $2.5 million contract to replace two bridges.
“The only issue is getting a line of credit,” Legacy said. “Now banks need a guarantee the town will receive funding from FEMA. The difficulty is getting that guarantee. I’m not blaming anyone. We’re all in a tough boat. But one way or the other, we have to find the money.”
‘Dotting every i and crossing every t’
Although the 2023 and 2024 storms began on July 10, they ended with different outcomes. The 2023 rains caused more significant damage to state government facilities, according to Farnham, while the 2024 precipitation hit municipalities hardest.
Geographically, many southern Vermont towns battered in 2023 were spared in 2024, while many northern communities were hammered both years. But all continue to swim in paperwork.

In southern Vermont, Cavendish reported $2 million in road damage in 2023 but didn’t receive the first of its FEMA reimbursements until the end of 2024. Two years later, it’s still seeking the remaining $500,000.
“People say, ‘Aren’t you glad the flood’s over?’ but it’s not over in our office,” Cavendish Town Clerk Diane McNamara said. “It has been a budget challenge.”
In central Vermont, Waterbury has wrapped up most of its $430,000 in federal and state reimbursement requests for 2023 but has yet to close out $625,000 in claims for 2024. The application process has required the town to document every single expense, employee time card and piece of equipment used.
“You have to make sure you’re dotting every i and crossing every t,” Waterbury Municipal Manager Tom Leitz said.

Leitz estimated he and his staff have invested up to $50,000 in administrative time on such paperwork, which itself can be reimbursed — with more paperwork.
In northern Vermont, Barnet reported $3 million in 2024 damage but has yet to receive any federal compensation.
“We’re still in the paperwork churn,” said Benjamin Heisholt, Barnet’s town clerk and treasurer. “It’s been a slow bureaucratic process just because it’s a slow bureaucratic process. For a small town like us, the biggest challenge is we don’t have a lot of bandwidth personnel-wise.”
To mark this week’s flood anniversaries, U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., is touring the state to spotlight the need for continued federal help.
“FEMA does lifesaving and important work after a disaster, but we need to find a way to fix the agency so it works better to help communities recover in the weeks, months, and years after a disaster,” Welch said in a statement. “Vermont saw it firsthand: There’s too much red tape, and the long-term recovery process is inefficient.”
Welch is introducing a bill — the Disaster Assistance Improvement and Decentralization (AID) Act — to streamline and strengthen federal recovery efforts. The proposal is drawing support from local and state officials.
“After facing devastating floods over the last two summers, Vermonters have seen firsthand the value of federal support and assistance from FEMA workers,” Gov. Phil Scott said in a statement. “However, we’ve also experienced gaps between response and recovery, and we need to make changes that better support responders on the ground and those trying to rebuild.”
Back in the Northeast Kingdom, Holland Town Clerk Diane Judd recalled how stormwater flooded her community’s one paved road for days in 2023, only to return and close it for weeks in 2024.
Judd, president of the Vermont Municipal Clerks’ and Treasurers’ Association, knows she isn’t alone in worrying about funding and the forecast.
“I’m just really hoping there isn’t a third year of rain,” she said.

Republican Sen. Stephen Goldfinch, 43, was set to announce his campaign for state attorney general Monday night at an event venue in Murrells Inlet, as he seeks the office to be vacated by Republican Alan Wilson.
The attorney general’s race is open for the first time in 16 years, as Wilson, first elected in 2010, makes a bid for governor.

While the 2024 election gave Republicans control of the White House and Congress, Goldfinch is billing himself as a candidate who is willing to fight against a Democratic administration if the party in power in Washington, D.C., were to again shift.
“A state has a right to step in and sue the federal government when they think they’re overstepping their bounds,” he told the SC Daily Gazette. “An attorney general can be very influential in that way.”
Wilson, former chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association, has led and signed onto numerous lawsuits over his tenure challenging the Obama and Biden administrations. Goldfinch said South Carolinians should expect such challenges to Democrat-led initiatives to continue under his leadership if he were elected.
Goldfinch, a native of Conway, holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees from The Citadel and a law degree from the Charleston School of Law. The business owner-turned-lawyer was first elected to the state House in 2012. Four years later, voters from Georgetown and Horry counties elected him to the Senate.
The Murrels Inlet father of two is also a captain in the South Carolina Army National Guard and deployed in 2023 to Africa alongside the husband of former Gov. Nikki Haley.
The Charleston-based 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade was assisting U.S. Africa Command based in Djibouti, a small country on the continent’s northeast coast opposite Yemen. Goldfinch sustained a non-combat related injury while there.
Beyond his combat deployment, Goldfinch said working in the Judge Advocate General’s (or JAG) Corps for the National Guard has given him experience as a prosecutor, investigating hundreds of cases.
And over the last two legislative sessions, Goldfinch took a leading role in a Statehouse investigation of the state’s financial officers, including a so-far unsuccessful push to remove Republican state Treasurer Curtis Loftis from office for his role in a $1.8 billion accounting error, which turned out to involve little actual money.
In recent years, Goldfinch has vocally pushed back on coastal environmental regulations he believes infringe on personal property rights.
“My whole adult life I’ve been fighting bureaucrats and agencies, anything that restricts the rights and freedoms of South Carolina citizens,” he told the Gazette. “I’m sick of bureaucracy; sick of them making decisions that ruin lives and put dampers on business.”
If elected attorney general, Goldfinch said he’d have the ability to keep pushing for changes in other ways, to include issuing legal opinions on regulations and how he thinks state agencies should be interpreting the law. Such opinions from the state attorney general are nonbinding, meaning they are the office’s interpretation of state law and how a case might be decided. But they carry no legal weight in court.
Solicitor switches from Democrat to Republican, confirms he’s considering AG run

Goldfinch said he also will expand upon programs started by Wilson to crack down both on child pornography and sex trafficking. He said he thinks there’s room to work more closely with local law enforcement to go after human traffickers operating in the state.
And Goldfinch pointed to his time in the Statehouse and the relationships he’s built as an asset when it comes to advocating for law enforcement in the state.
Other potential candidates
Goldfinch is likely to face a challenge in the GOP primary from at least one solicitor.
David Pascoe, the chief prosecutor for Calhoun, Dorchester and Orangeburg counties, continues to mull a run for attorney general. The longtime Democrat announced in April he is switching to the Republican Party. Pascoe told the Gazette on Monday he plans to make a final decision in the next eight weeks on whether or not to enter the race.
South Carolina hasn’t elected a Democrat as the state’s chief prosecutor in 35 years. The last Democrat in the office, Travis Medlock, did not seek re-election in 1994 as he made an unsuccessful bid for governor.
David Stumbo, the solicitor for Abbeville, Greenwood, Laurens and Newberry counties, also confirmed he is considering a run. He said he will continue to weigh his decision throughout the summer and expects to have a final decision by the first week of September.
Stumbo referred to himself as “an in-the-trenches crime fighter” who has spent the last 13 years as a solicitor. Before that he was an assistant attorney general.
“It is critical that we have a proven, conservative prosecutor as our state’s chief prosecutor,” he told the SC Daily Gazette.
The state attorney general’s salary is $208,000 after the Legislature made the job more financially appealing.
Prior to the last statewide elections, the attorney general was among six statewide officers receiving a salary of $92,007, unchanged from 1994. A 2022 law tasked a legislative panel with resetting the salaries of all constitutional officers except the governor and lieutenant governor. At the time, 33 employees in Wilson’s office had higher paychecks than him.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Goldfinch-in-Finance-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 19:06:27.218409

(Ryan Jones/CPW)Colorado Parks and Wildlife commissioners during a special meeting on Monday declined to direct the agency to kill or relocate a reintroduced gray wolf pack that has caused controversy in Pitkin County.
Wolves belonging to Copper Creek pack, the first breeding pack to be established as part of the state’s voter-mandated reintroduction program, are believed to have been responsible for a total of several dozen livestock killings, first in Grand County last year, and again following their capture and relocation to Pitkin County in 2025. One member of the pack, wolf 2405, was killed by state wildlife agents in late May, the first such “lethal removal” of a wolf engaged in “chronic depredation” of livestock, as per a new CPW definition.
Amid the controversy, two of the 11 members of the commission overseeing CPW moved during its June 11 meeting to direct the agency to remove the entire Copper Creek pack, but the motion was ruled out of order and subsequently withdrawn. Commissioners instead scheduled Monday’s two-hour special meeting to discuss the issue further with CPW staff.

After briefings from CPW leaders and wildlife managers, commissioners opted not to move forward with any specific direction to the agency, which Jay Tutchton, a Bent County conservationist and the committee’s vice chair, argued would set an “arbitrary” and “unworkable” precedent.
“This is not our job, to engage at this retail level,” he said.
“I’m quite sure in the last few months, we’ve had a moose that drop-kicked a human being, or a bear or a lion that killed livestock, and we don’t engage in those specific decisions,” Tutchton added. “We just delegate them to the agency to do what they think is best in those circumstances — because they’re the experts, they’re there, they’ve got the time, and they have the facts. And I don’t see how this situation is any different.”
Colorado voters in 2020 narrowly approved a ballot measure mandating the reintroduction of gray wolves to the state in the name of restoring ecological balance. A reintroduction plan subsequently approved by CPW commissioners called for annual releases of 10 to 15 wolves for three to five years beginning in 2023. The agency’s efforts have been persistently opposed by Colorado cattle producers, who unsuccessfully petitioned the agency to pause the program after one year of releases.
After two winter release windows that relocated a total of 25 wolves to the state from Oregon and British Columbia, Colorado’s reintroduction program is in a precarious position, with the population’s survival rate falling below a critical threshold following the confirmed deaths of at least eight relocated wolves. The agency said last month that it plans to review its “translocation protocols,” but not until causes of death for the animals are determined by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Meanwhile, state lawmakers, including several powerful Democrats representing rural areas where reintroductions have taken place, put renewed pressure on CPW leadership in a hearing last week to consider a pause, rather than moving forward with a third year of relocations.
The Copper Creek pack currently consists of a breeding pair, three yearlings and an unknown number of pups born in 2025. One or more members of the pack killed livestock at three Pitkin County cattle ranches in May. Following the lethal removal of wolf 2405 and a variety of nonlethal measures taken by CPW, including the deployment of “range riders” to guard livestock, no further depredations have occurred. But Garrett Watson, CPW’s northwest deputy regional manager, told commissioners the situation is “more nuanced than that,” with ranchers and range riders forced into a grueling effort to manage conflicts as cattle move into their expansive summer pastures.
“Instead of looking on a 100-acre pasture, now we’re looking at several thousands of acres, tens of thousands of acres, where these animals are distributed across there,” added Matt Yamashita, CPW’s northwest area wildlife manager. “It’s increasingly difficult to monitor and keep eyes on all these animals at all times.”
Tai Jacober, a Carbondale rancher and the CPW commissioner who introduced last month’s motion to order the pack’s removal, reported during Monday’s meeting that when the range riders took a night off over the holiday weekend, at least one cattle herd was “scattered throughout the valley” as conflicts immediately resumed.
“The staff does an incredible job, and I know they’re monitoring and trying to monitor it within the guidelines that have been put forth,” Jacober said. “But it seems clear that when you have such behavior, and a pack that’s causing such harm — to our time, to people’s livelihoods, to the efforts — we need to make a decision.”

(Fergus County Department of Emergency Services photo)Fire season has begun to kick up in Montana, with the Department of Natural Resources reporting more than a dozen new incidents in the last week.
According to the state’s wildfire tracker, there have been 886 fires this year and 18 during the last week. Additionally, it noted shortly before 1 p.m. on Monday there had been 14 new fires in the last 24 hours. The days around the Fourth of July holiday are among the busiest for first responders throughout the country.
Nearly all incidents this year in Montana have been relatively small, with state and federal firefighters aggressively fighting them. For example, the Hilger Fire, which was held at 288 acres, was estimated at a cost of $1.5 million during the waning days of the incident response according to data submitted to the National Interagency Fire Center. Successful initial fire attack by the U.S. Forest Service is defined in acres — under 100 acres for a fire burning in forest land, and 300 acres for grassland.
The largest wildfire in Montana, the Wilder Fire, so far this year has burned just 3,451 acres, but crews made significant progress after the fire received rain during the past few days, according to fire officials.
That fire, burning in northeast Fergus County, did not grow from July 5 to July 6, according to an update from the Bureau of Land Management. It is now 30% contained and about 140 personnel were on site Sunday.
Eastern Montana has seen several larger fires during the past week, including one that’s closed Makoshika State Park since July 3. The fire was listed at 169 acres and is 100% contained as of Monday. 
Two other fires — the Horseshoe and Flicker fires — were listed at 800 and 806 acres, respectively. The Flicker fire, burning in the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Reserve, was 40% contained while the Horseshoe fire in Garfield County was 10% contained.
Firefighters were able to fully contain the Jericho Mountain fire, which was burning near the town of Rimini. Heavy rainstorms in the Helena area helped tamp down activity on that fire.
Nationally, the National Interagency Fire Center reports 36,156 fires this year have burned nearly 2.1 million acres in the U.S. Last year, 17,362 fires burned 2.8 million acres. Most acreage this year has burned in Alaska, though the Madre Fire in Southern California is more than 80,000 acres and the Trout Fire in New Mexico is nearing 50,000 acres.
Nationally, there are 31 large fire incidents being suppressed — including four in Montana — and 80 others are being managed in ways other than full suppression.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FergusCountyDES-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-07 19:06:27.218409

(Courtesy of the National Weather Service, Albuquerque).Emergency warnings sounded twice during an interim legislative committee meeting Monday, as south-central New Mexico officials told lawmakers about ongoing dangerous flooding in their communities — and the help they still need to rebuild after last year’s wildfires.
Village of Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford told the members of the interim Economic & Rural Development & Policy Committee that water had flooded the Ruidoso Downs Racetrack and the village’s midtown area on Sunday, and on Monday damaged homes left intact during the 2024 South Fork and Salt fires.
Mescalero Apache Tribe President Thora Walsh Padilla told the committee the mountains have received little snowpack over the last few years, which means less vegetation to mitigate flooding in areas even outside the tribe’s reservation.
In addition, many years’ worth of sediment remains in the ravines, decreasing how much water they can hold and making current and future floods even worse, she said.
“We have done quite a bit as far as limiting the debris, the burnt logs, all the stuff coming off the reservation, but that does not stop the water,” Padilla said. “We have multiple burn scars contributing towards this, both on and off the reservation and on the Lincoln National Forest.”
Ruidoso Downs Racetrack General Manager Rick Baugh said what Ruidoso is experiencing will happen somewhere else in New Mexico.
“We almost lost the track yesterday,” Baugh told the committee. “I’m just at the end of my rope, I’ll be honest with you. If y’all got any way you can help us, we need your help.”
The meeting followed a deadly weekend of flooding in neighboring Texas.
Still cleaning up 2024 disaster
Crawford said the village is still rebuilding from the 2024 fires and subsequent floods, and hardening its infrastructure for future ones.
Thus far, he said the village has spent $16.8 million on repairing homes and buildings, but some homes remain unfixed, and the village has run out of money.
“Every dime that the village has had access to, that we could spend, we have deployed it,” Crawford said.
The village has formally requested only $4 million of the $44 million lawmakers set aside in House Bill 1 for disaster cleanup, Crawford said, because of a provision in the law that requires approval by the Federal Emergency Management Agency before the local government can ask for it.
The Legislature has, in several bills over the last three years, approved at least $200 million in emergency loans for communities recovering from fires and floods. Crawford said the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, one of the state agencies helping towns get the funding, told the village that it is “way down the list” behind other communities asking for the loans.
“The process is broke,” Crawford said. “What you passed, we don’t have access to.”
Crawford said the village assessed 498 sites eligible for some kind of repairs and organized them into 27 projects and sent them to FEMA for approval. Crawford said he learned on Monday that late last week, FEMA approved 17 of the projects.
FEMA’s engineers originally estimated the damage to total $29 million, Crawford said, and now the estimate is five times that amount.
Rep. Harlan Vincent (R-Ruidoso Downs), a former fire chief for the village, suggested to the committee that more legislation is needed because the funding lawmakers enacted in the prior session does not cover costs of flood maintenance.
“This silt is going to continue,” he said. “Did we mess up again? Does anybody want to run another $150 million bill for maintenance budgets? If this happens in your community, you’re going to go through it, or that water will come out of the banks and it’s going to devastate people’s properties.”
Padilla said the Sierra Blanca Regional Recovery Task Force has been coordinating cleanup efforts and sediment removal since the fires both on the reservation and in Lincoln County and Ruidoso. She said the task force wants to build a regional training center to improve local firefighting capabilities.
Bringing back logging
Padilla said local floodways are becoming active again nearly a century after the Civilian Conservation Corps came in during the 1930s to terrace and drain wetlands.
The landscape around Ruidoso and Mescalero doesn’t look like it did then, Padilla said. It used to be a forested grassland but now the forest is so thick and the elk populations so large that the water table can’t support it.
“This land is not in its natural state anymore, and we need something to jumpstart that and take us back a little further in time to be able to maintain living in these mountains,” Padilla said.
Padilla said there has been a huge buildup of trees that is harming the land, and her tribe wants to reopen a sawmill that closed in 2012 in order to thin the forest and reduce fire risk.
“It became very apparent during the fires that we need to get back on that track,” Padilla said.
“We’ve taken natural fires out of the system,” Padilla said. “Good logging and thinning is how we intend to replace that, and that’s how we’ve been able to keep our lands safe for many years. The sawmill is critical to that.”
Padilla said the tribe received $2 million from the Legislature to reopen the sawmill, and is now asking the U.S. Economic Development Administration for $17.5 million to finish the job.
“We’re not giving up,” she said. “We’ll stand for our homelands forever.”

Established in the wake of abuse allegations at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility, the Corrections Monitoring Commission never reached full momentum, hampered by resignations and low attendance.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Commission meant to oversee sexual misconduct in prison sunsets quietly.","The Corrections Monitoring Commission, established in 2022 after allegations of sexual misconduct in Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility came to light, quietly expired on July 1 without fulfilling its mandate.
In 2020, the Vermont Agency of Human Services contracted the law firm Downs Rachlin Martin to conduct an investigation into sexual misconduct at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility — the only women’s prison in Vermont — following a series of stories by Seven Days detailing allegations of sexual misconduct, retaliation and drug use at the facility. 
The articles described instances where Department of Corrections employees preyed on current and former incarcerated women, female officers endured sexual harassment, and those who raised concerns were disregarded or faced retaliation.
As a result of the investigation, the law firm released a report that addressed the shortcomings of the Department of Corrections and provided a series of recommendations to address sexual abuse, sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. One of the recommendations was to create a monitoring committee to oversee reporting of sexual misconduct, ensure implementation of anti-retaliation policies and improve transparency and accountability.
While the Department of Corrections has taken some steps by creating an independent hotline for reporting sexual misconduct and expanding resources related to the Prison Rape Elimination Act, the Corrections Monitoring Commission was the primary independent body specifically tasked with overseeing the department’s handling of sexual misconduct.

The Vermont Legislature established the commission in January 2022, requiring its compositon of eight members: a former judge, a retired attorney, a former corrections officer, two formerly incarcerated individuals, the executive director of the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence or a designee, a former management-level employee of the Department of Corrections, and an individual with knowledge and experience in the correctional system. None of the members could be actively employed by the Department of Corrections.
In the first few months, the group developed a governance document and a work plan, but quickly their work started slowing down.
The Corrections Monitoring Commission was supposed to provide advice to the commissioner of corrections in monitoring reporting of sexual misconduct, implementing policies related to misconduct and anti-retaliation, and reviewing disciplinary actions. 
The commission was also tasked with drafting annual reports that would provide insights on the work of the Department of Corrections, including the way it handled allegations of sexual misconduct and complaints of retaliation; compliance with the Prison Rape Elimination Act; maintenance of an independent hotline to the State Police for the women at the facility; adhereance to anti-retaliation policies; and investigations of employee misconduct, contraband, threats to personal safety and more.
But the reports were never produced, according to members of the commission, and the group struggled to understand how to carry out the work mandated by the bill.
“The commission had a lot of difficulty getting a quorum together to actually hold meetings, so that was really a major obstacle in the success of the commission,” said Timothy Burgess, the group’s co-chair, an advocate for incarcerated people and himself formerly incarcerated.
In April 2024 testimony to the House Committee on Corrections and Institutions, Karen Tronsgard-Scott, executive director of the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, and Ashley Messier, co-chair of the commission, said some members of the commission resigned in the first months, and the appointing bodies responsible for assigning new members never replaced them. Other members simply stopped attending the meetings.
With scarce attendance, the group couldn’t reach the quorum necessary to continue their work, so by June 2023, they had stopped meeting altogether.
The commission faced a number of structural difficulties, Tronsgard-Scott said. She pointed to the broad scope of the bill, the fact that members of the commission didn’t have enough experience in a monitoring capacity and the lack of legal counsel or resources.
Another challenge, according to Burgess, was collaboration and information exchange with the Department of Corrections. Burgess said more interaction with the department would have helped identify problems and draft the reports.
“The Department of Corrections has really implemented systems to address the issues that were the reason for the commission. However, there is no insight outside of the Department of Corrections to oversee what the implementation is, how effective it is, etcetera,” Burgess said.
Isaac Dayno, executive director of policy at the Department of Corrections, said the department was quite transparent with the commission but couldn’t share confidential information on personnel issues. 
“DOC is actually not involved with personnel investigations,” he said. Under a policy within the Agency of Administration, all complaints of employee misconduct have to be immediately reported to the Department of Human Resources.

Changes and next steps
After the sexual misconduct allegations emerged in 2019, the Department of Corrections implemented some of the recommendations of the Downs Rachlin Martin report, including creating and maintaining an independent hotline that women in the Chittenden Regional Facility could use to report such incidents to the state police.
The bill that established the Corrections Monitoring Commission also created the Corrections Investigative Unit within the department to ensure compliance with federal law and conduct internal investigations on incidents such as deaths, escapes, contraband, threats and safety issues, and allegations of violations of the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act. 
“The legislature authorized the program, but they didn’t appropriate any funding for it or positions for it, so it took a little bit of time for the department to have to do that work on its own,” Dayno said.  
The unit, composed of a director of investigations and two investigators, has been operational for about a year and does not carry out misconduct investigations, according to its website. 
In April 2024, Burgess, the Corrections Monitoring Commission co-chair, submitted testimony to the Legislature asking to remove the sunset and extend the duration of the Corrections Monitoring Commission for five more years. Tronsgard-Scott and Messier also proposed to modify the commission’s mandate to state more clearly its purpose and authority and ensure the involvement of the Department of Corrections. But the topic wasn’t further discussed in the Legislature, and the commission expired. 
“We had a lot of brand new people in the Legislature as a whole,” said state Rep. Alice Emmons, D-Windsor, chair of the House Committee on Corrections and Institutions. As the members of the House committee changed in the last legislative session, they had to familiarize themselves with the new work and the Department of Corrections, she explained.
“We looked to see if we had any reports given to us this year, and we couldn’t find anything,” Emmons said. “And that’s not to say that we couldn’t start conversations about it come next session.”
State Rep. Eric Maguire, R-Rutland, a former member of the House Committee on Corrections and Institutions, also expressed interest in making a proposal to the Legislature to revive the commission. 
“Even though it’s sunsetting, I believe there’s still an opportunity to get this work back into place,” Maguire said.
“The commission would need a better formation to work effectively,” Burgess said. “More exchange of information on what the department sees as problems, more information from the commissioners and interaction with the commissioners on creating the reports. Those things were not done.”

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The chair of the Arkansas Democratic Party is resigning after four years at the helm of the organization, according to a Monday news release.
The party credited Grant Tennille, who will step down July 15, with rescuing the state Democratic Party from “financial insolvency” and increasing Democratic representation in the Arkansas Legislature for the first time in decades. He also oversaw the party’s return to ethical compliance with Federal Election Commission rules, according to the release.
After Tennille’s departure, party Vice Chair Jannie Cotton will act as interim chair until new elections are held. Those elections will occur within 60 days per party rules, the release said.
Tennille, 55, said in a statement that it has been “an honor” to serve the party during his four years as chair. The role had him in the office for 50 to 60 hours a week, he said, adding that he was “weary” and missing too much time with his family.
“That work has helped the Party begin to rebuild trust and grow again, but it has come at a personal cost,” Tennille said. “Next year promises to be the most demanding yet, and it is better to step aside today, to allow the new chair to plan for ’26, preside over candidate filing and hit the ground next year with a few months’ experience under their belt.”
It isn’t the first time Tennille has resigned from his post citing the exhaustion that accompanies running the party. He first announced he was stepping down in 2022 after 14 months on the job, after resolving a debt crisis that saw the state party max out its credit cards and mortgage its headquarters, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The debt issues also caused the party to run afoul of federal election law, with the Federal Election Commission citing it in 2021 for not disclosing information about approximately $350,000 of debt.
Tennille said the party’s cashflow issues were so severe when he assumed his post that he resorted to fixing toilets at the party’s Capitol Avenue headquarters himself instead of hiring a plumber to save money, the Democrat-Gazette reported. 
Two months after stepping down in 2022, Tennille was once again nominated for the top job after two Democratic former state senators persuaded him to run.
Then, in 2024, Democrats had their first net gain in Arkansas’ Legislature for the first time in 18 years, breaking a backslide that had turned the party from the dominant political force in the state for well over a century to not having enough seats to break a GOP supermajority in either chamber.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/20231010_113235-scaled-e1696963602847-1024x690.jpg,,,2025-07-07 19:06:27.218409

He represents the plaintiff, former State Sen. John Kuehn, at right. May 20, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A former state senator appealed a second case to the Nebraska Supreme Court seeking to invalidate the state’s voter-approved medical cannabis laws.
Former State Sen. John Kuehn of Heartwell, a former member of the State Board of Health and a longtime marijuana opponent, filed the brief appeal request Saturday. Kuehn has asked the Nebraska Supreme Court to step in without going through the intermediate Nebraska Court of Appeals. The courts have not yet decided whether to take up the appeal.
Kuehn seeks to argue that the 2024 voter-approved laws to legalize and regulate medical cannabis are unconstitutional because of federal laws against marijuana.
“Plaintiff has a right to appeal directly to the Supreme Court because his case challenges the constitutionality of Nebraska laws,” the one-page filing states.
Lancaster County District Judge Susan Strong on June 26 ruled that Kuehn could not prove “injury in fact,” known as “standing,” as a direct result of the medical cannabis laws.
Strong disagreed with Kuehn’s arguments that he should be able to sue because taxpayer funds would help carry out the laws, such as employee time, and that the laws were a “matter of great public concern.”
“Nebraska, like other states, has no shortage of citizen-taxpayers with strong political opinions. That is not necessarily a bad thing,” Strong wrote. “But it would be bad if all those citizens could sue whenever a law requires a government employee to do something.”

(Kenneth Ferriera-Pool/Lincoln Journal Star)
Among Kuehn’s main contentions is that Nebraska shouldn’t be able to create a medical cannabis program because of federal law classifying marijuana as a Schedule I drug. A Schedule I drug is one that the federal government says has a high potential for abuse and no accepted medical uses. A bipartisan swath of advocates has called for rescheduling the drug for decades.
Nearly 40 states, including Nebraska, have laws on the books for some form of medical cannabis program.
Kuehn also argues that the creation of the new Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, the members of which are named in the lawsuit, is an unlawful delegation of lawmaking authority.
The preemption case also names Gov. Jim Pillen, Secretary of State Bob Evnen, State Treasurer Tom Briese, Tax Commissioner Jim Kamm and the ballot sponsors who ushered the laws through the 2024 election.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and his office, who are representing the state defendants, had asked for the case to be dismissed. 
However, the AG’s Office did so after pledging to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission once it begins licensing medical cannabis establishments while making similar preemption arguments as Kuehn. Licensing must begin by Oct. 1.
The Nebraska Supreme Court, as early as September, will hear a separate appeal from Kuehn, Evnen and Hilgers that seeks to invalidate the medical cannabis laws. That case, targeting Evnen and the ballot sponsors, argues there were not enough valid petition signatures for the ballot measures to have been placed on the 2024 ballot in the first place. 
Strong presided over that earlier case and ruled last November in favor of the ballot measures. About 71% of Nebraskans voted to legalize the drug, and about 67% voted to regulate it.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, the 2024 campaign that ushered in the new laws, said the continued legal challenges “are nothing short of an abuse of power.”
“This latest appeal is just another desperate attempt to silence the will of Nebraskans, who overwhelmingly support safe, legal access to medical cannabis,” Eggers said in a statement. “We will not be intimidated.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — All public schools in Oklahoma must pay for free cafeteria meals for every student and exclude certain dyes and processed foods, the state’s top education official ordered.
State Superintendent Ryan Walters issued a mandate Monday that all districts adjust their budgets to include no-cost breakfasts and lunches in all public schools. Walters said districts already have enough state and federal funds to afford the expense, especially if they cut back on administrators’ salaries.
He threatened to audit, withhold state funding or penalize the accreditation of districts that don’t comply, raising questions over whether he has exceeded the bounds of his authority.
“We need less administrators in our schools,” Walters said in a statement. “We need to get taxpayers dollars to the students, not to grow bureaucracy.”
No state law exists that requires districts to provide free meals to every student, nor are there legal provisions allowing the Oklahoma State Department of Education to sanction or audit a school for not doing so, according to a memo the Oklahoma State School Boards Association (OSSBA) sent out Monday.

“Local school boards maintain primary authority over district budgets, enabling them to make decisions based on local priorities and needs,” OSSBA executive director Shawn Hime wrote in the message. “While some districts choose to use discretionary funds to offset meal costs for students not qualifying for free meals, this is strictly a local decision.”
Walters also ordered the removal of “ultra-processed” snacks, sugary drinks, processed meats, various food dyes and seed oils from school meals. It also forbids schools from serving foods that were grown with pesticides like glyphosate, an herbicide commonly used in agricultural production. 
The edict seeks to restrict schools from using artificial food dyes identified as blue 1 and 2, green 3, red 40, and yellow 5 and 6. Banned seed oils would include corn, canola, cottonseed, grapeseed and soy, according to a message Walters sent to public school parents.
A recent executive order from Gov. Kevin Stitt, issued during a visit from U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., instructed other state agencies to review and potentially reduce the use of artificial food dyes, including red dye 40, in school meals. The Governor’s Office did not return a request for comment on Walters’ mandate.
The state Education Department’s announcement Monday claimed that families paid $42 million for school meals last year while administrator salaries increased by 14%. The agency did not answer a request from Oklahoma Voice to cite the source for either number.

At least nine other states, including neighboring New Mexico and Colorado, have implemented universal free school meals.
None of them did it without investing extra state money, said Chris Bernard, president and CEO of Hunger Free Oklahoma, an organization focused on expanding access to affordable, nutritious food. 
Walters did not request additional funds for school meals this year, nor did state lawmakers set any dollars aside for this initiative. The state Legislature increased public school funding by $26 million this year, but none of the money is specifically earmarked for school meals.
Hunger Free Oklahoma has been advocating for legislation to expand free school meals, but Bernard said, “We have never had the state Department (of Education) alongside supporting those bills with us.”
“There’s not a way to feed every Oklahoma kid for free without additional investment,” Bernard said.
Across Oklahoma, 256 districts already provide free meals to all students through a federal reimbursement program known as the Community Eligibility Provision, or CEP, according to a June report from Hunger Free Oklahoma.
CEP supports free meals for 277,458 students in Oklahoma schools, about 40% of the state’s student population, the organization found.
The number of students and schools covered under CEP has more than doubled in recent years, especially after the U.S. Department of Agriculture expanded eligibility to Medicaid recipients in 2023. 
The cost gap between federal reimbursements and the price of food service is too wide for CEP to be financially viable for some schools, especially smaller districts whose local poverty levels put them at minimum eligibility, Bernard said.
Hunger Free Oklahoma found 264 CEP-eligible districts don’t participate in the program, though some students still might qualify for free or reduced-price meals based on their household income. 
Now, it’s too late for those districts to change their mind, Bernard said. Walters issued his order a week after the yearly deadline passed to apply for CEP.
State lawmakers won’t have another chance to prioritize this issue in the state budget until next year, said Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City. Pogemiller said she is happy to work toward the state superintendent’s goal, but combined with the expired CEP deadline, “the reality is that Walters’ approach is an unfunded mandate.” 
Rep. Annie Menz, D-Tulsa, filed a bill this year that would have more districts apply for CEP. She said she was “stunned and thrilled” to read Walters’ mandate.

“I have filed and cosponsored legislation, cohosted bipartisan interim studies, published op-eds and held countless meetings all toward the goal of expanding the free lunch program in our schools, and I am glad someone in statewide leadership is finally listening to me,” Menz said in a statement. “Hungry kids can’t learn, and every child deserves access to healthy nutritious meals. I hope that going forward, Mr. Walters will be more collaborative with the Legislature to determine lasting budget solutions to make this program work for our kids.”

They were among 543 officers statewide fired or suspended for misconduct last year. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Nearly 550 police officers in New Jersey received major discipline last year for misconduct that ranged from bumbling to brutal, according to new data the state Attorney General’s Office released Monday.
The 543 officers fired, demoted, or suspended for more than five days in 2024 hailed from 172 law enforcement agencies around the state. Some were punished for more than one infraction, with 644 total major discipline actions logged last year.
This latest annual report on major discipline comes five years after the Attorney General’s Office first ordered agencies to disclose such discipline in an effort to increase transparency and build trust between police and the communities they serve.
Since then, the number of officers disciplined has steadily risen, jumping 40% between 2021 — the first full year of reporting, when 389 officers were disciplined — and last year.
That jump is at least partially due to Attorney General Matt Platkin in November 2022 expanding the list of major discipline infractions to include domestic violence, excessive force, intentional destruction or mishandling of evidence, lying, discriminatory conduct, and intentionally performing an improper search, among others. The expanded reporting also now captures officers charged with indictable crimes and those who left an agency amid ongoing investigations. Those changes took effect on Jan. 1, 2023, though, and discipline still rose 18% from 2023 to last year, the data shows.
Platkin said most of New Jersey’s 42,000 law enforcement officers serve their communities honorably and valiantly despite the dangers and frustrations of the job. About 370 of nearly 550 agencies reported no major discipline.
“Publicly releasing this data about the handling of disciplinary matters helps maintain the public’s trust in those dedicated, hardworking men and women of law enforcement,” Platkin said in a statement.
Misconduct that resulted in major discipline in 2024 was horrifying in some cases, humdrum in others.
The most common offense stemmed from attendance infractions, with dozens of officers disciplined for chronic lateness or sick callouts.
But dozens more officers were disciplined for actual crimes. The report documents officers accused of drunk driving, domestic violence, insurance fraud, theft, possessing child pornography, assault, harassment, theft, child endangerment, and engaging in prostitution. Some were terminated or left their jobs voluntarily, but others continue working as officers after getting suspensions of varying lengths.
Multiple officers were disciplined for negligent handling of their firearms, with some leaving loaded guns in sensitive places and others reporting them stolen after leaving them in their cars. In Voorhees, Officer Steven Kushner was suspended for 20 days after he propped his fully loaded patrol rifle against his car, then drove away, leaving the firearm in the street. Nicholas Procaccini, an Atlantic County correctional officer, left his duty belt with a firearm and loaded magazines in the restroom at AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center in Pomona, where he was guarding an incarcerated person getting treatment. Correctional Officer Daniqua Lewter reported her firearm stolen from her cousin’s house — but later admitted she gave it to her cousin, who wasn’t licensed.
Some officers were punished for using excessive force or violating pursuit policies. Andrew Eckert was terminated from the Pleasantville police force for breaking the wrist of a handcuffed person who was already face-down on the ground, tossing him into the air and into a fence, according to the report. Ignacio Hernandez Jr., an officer in Sea Isle City, was disciplined for using a ride-share service to help him in a foot pursuit.
Many officers were disciplined for workplace offenses, such as having sex on duty, harassing colleagues, failing drug tests, and searching police databases for personal reasons. Kaitlyn Hermansen resigned from the Tenafly police department after investigators discovered she crashed her police car, picked up the debris, and staged a collision elsewhere — then lied to supervisors that she’d collided with a deer.
An officer who taught for the controversial police training company Street Cop was among those disciplined. Brad Gilmore was a sergeant at the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office when he got suspended for 90 days and demoted to investigator/detective for violating police policies on outside employment, insubordination, and related offenses.

Walsh said in a report on the state’s lack of oversight on post-academy police training. (Screengrab courtesy of New Jersey Office of the State Comptroller)
Correctional officers racked up the most disciplinary infractions. Some failed to do required headcounts, slept or watched movies while on duty, or otherwise shirked responsibilities, while others smuggled contraband to incarcerated people or had inappropriate relationships with them. Two, Edgardo Mendez and Justin Paneto in Camden County, landed 60-day suspensions for failing to lock away bleach, which an incarcerated person found and drank. Several officers were disciplined for lax oversight in which at least two people died in their cells and weren’t discovered for hours.
The data shows that plenty of officers resigned or retired before supervisors could impose punishment.
It also shows wide disparities in how officers were disciplined.
In Hudson County, Guttenberg Police Officer John Lopez was terminated for faking a doctor’s note and prescription form to bolster his request to be excused from shaving due to skin irritation, while William Underwood, a rookie officer in Byram Township, got fired for “inappropriate” Facebook posts about race relations.
Yet in Jersey City, Officers Shahzad Hashmi and Fernando Procel got 120-day suspensions for failing to help a rape victim get a restraining order and medical care and alert a sexual assault response team, thereby preventing the collection of evidence. And in Newark, Officer David Paige got a 10-day suspension after he slammed a student against a wall and ground “in an unprovoked incident” and then arrested and charged the student for aggravated assault.
Platkin also released data Monday on all reported internal affairs cases statewide. Those figures show that internal affairs detectives opened more than 15,000 investigations involving about 8,800 unique officers statewide in 2024. A third of all closed investigations resulted in a sustained finding, with officers most often punished by oral or written reprimands.

The Bureau of Land Management will amend Biden-era resource management plans to reopen coal leasing in Wyoming and Montana.
The post Trump pushes to resume coal leasing in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal officials are undoing a Biden-era rule that ended new coal leasing in the prolific Powder River Basin spanning northeast Wyoming and southern Montana.
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management, at the direction of President Donald Trump, will file a notice this week to amend its resource management plans for the region to reopen federal coal leasing — just six months after the Biden leasing ban was finalized. The public will have 30 days to review and comment on the proposed action, setting a deadline of Aug. 7.
The agency on Monday reiterated the action complies with multiple Trump executive orders, including Unleashing American Energy and Declaring a National Energy Emergency.
“The BLM does not intend to hold any public meetings, in-person or virtual, during the public scoping period,” according to a preliminary notice published Monday in the Federal Registry.
What does it mean?
Though the BLM’s Buffalo and Miles City, Montana field offices had identified vast areas in the region it would consider for new leasing, coal companies here hadn’t nominated a major new coal lease in more than 10 years, which, in part, prompted the agency under Biden to initiate ending the leasing program, officials said at the time.

In justifying the lease ban, the Biden BLM noted that it did not apply to existing leases, which still include enough Powder River Basin coal reserves to maintain current production levels until about 2040, it said.
Aside from the stark swing in coal politics from Biden to Trump, speculation has been mounting over the past year about whether skyrocketing demand for electricity might entice Powder River Basin coal producers to finally nominate new major leases. That hasn’t been the case, so far. But both Congress and the Wyoming Legislature have been trying to further entice them.
Wyoming lawmakers earlier this year passed House Bill 75, “Coal severance tax rate,” which reduces the severance tax for surface-mined coal from 6.5% to 6%. The congressional budget reconciliation bill — One Big Beautiful Bill Act — signed into law Friday, reduces the federal royalty rate on coal from 12.5% to 7% through 2034, which will make “the coal royalty structure more representative of today’s market and mining conditions and helps get the industry closer to a level playing field among energy commodities,” the Wyoming Energy Authority said in a statement.

Those tax reductions, along with a slew of Trump administration measures to slash regulations on both the coal-mining and coal-burning sides of the equation are intended to finally make good on Trump’s promise during his first administration to revitalize the industry.
Critics have referred to the Trump and congressional actions as the “biggest coal giveaway in history.”
“Just last year, the Bureau of Land Management found it impossible to justify continued coal leasing in the Powder River Basin considering the abundant coal already under lease, shrinking demand, and the imperative to phase out fossil fuel development to address the climate crisis,” Earthjustice Northern Rockies Managing Attorney Jenny Harbine said in a prepared statement Monday. “The administration’s efforts to expand coal mining on our public lands are no more justified now and will sell out our communities to further enrich coal industry executives.”
Coal production in Wyoming, the largest supplier in the nation, has declined by nearly half since its peak in 2008. Though the industry is still shedding hundreds of jobs, output increased slightly during the first quarter of this year compared to the same period in 2024, according to Wyoming Public Radio.

While agents with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said that Moore’s actions endangered the health of vulnerable populations, Monday’s rally attendees held signs that read “Dr. Moore is a hero, not a criminal,” and applauded the speakers as they spoke against the COVID-19 vaccines.
“The way those of us stood up and pushed back were treated was wrong. We were treated like second-class citizens if we didn’t get the shot, we didn’t get the vaccine,” Schultz told them. “Think about it for just a minute. You had to have a vaccine passport to walk down the streets and go into a shop, to go to a Jazz game, to go to a restaurant. That was unbelievable.”
Schultz wasn’t available for interviews on Monday, a spokesperson said.
Researchers from the University of Southern California and Brown University calculated that vaccines saved 2.4 million lives in 141 countries from the vaccines’ rollout through August 2021. Experts haven’t found evidence that the vaccines cause illnesses like Alzheimer’s disease or cancer, and there have been misleading assertions that vaccines could change DNA and false claims that spike proteins from vaccines are replacing sperm in vaccinated males, according to PolitiFact.

However, Utah Republican leaders have fought the Biden administration’s COVID-19 rules citing federal overreach.
The state joined a lawsuit in 2021 opposing vaccine mandates for federal contractors nationwide. And, after the federal government mandated that big companies require employees to either provide proof of vaccination or get weekly tests in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Utah lawmakers challenged the rule, passing legislation sponsored by Sen. Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy, and Schultz during a special session to provide a vaccine exception for Utahns if they had a “conflict with a sincerely held personal belief.”
Years later, Schultz remains highly critical of the immunization efforts and reproved Dr. Angela Dunn, former state epidemiologist for Utah, and the administration of former Republican Gov. Gary Herbert. 
“I’ll never forget Angela Dunn, she sat in the legislative office and told us that we were going to see 20,000 dead Utahns in a matter of months. That turned out to be false,” Schultz said. “The scare tactics that were used was unbelievable. Think about the executive orders that came out of the Herbert’s office, to take away your freedoms.”
Rep. Karianne Lisonbee, R-Clearfield, Rep. Trevor Lee, R-Layton, and former Republican state lawmaker Phil Lyman also showed up to the rally. 
Schultz gave Moore a high-five as the doctor went up the courthouse steps for the first day in a 15-day trial. 
After his Monday remarks, Schultz said in an interview with the Robert Scott Bell Show, an “alternative/holistic health care” advocacy online show, that if Moore is convicted, he will work with U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Trump administration to try to get a pardon.
“Dr. Moore was on the right side of these things, and we appreciate him standing up,” Schultz said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Top Republican leaders were mum Monday about whether they supported a plan by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol to stop providing law enforcement coverage in the state’s urban areas later this year.
Spokespeople for Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, also did not say if they had been made aware of a plan by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol to move its resources out the state’s urban areas. Highway Patrol officials said they planned to refocus those resources on areas with the “greatest need” by Nov. 1.
The Highway Patrol said last week that it will reallocate resources away from Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City and instead focus on areas covered by smaller law enforcement footprints.
Over 1.4 million people — or over a third of the state’s population — reside in those seven cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Responsibility for the interstates and highways within city limits will shift to local law enforcement, according to a news release. 
“OHP is confident the professional law enforcement agencies within the Oklahoma City and Tulsa metropolitan areas are equipped to provide public safety services on the portions of the instates (sic) traveling through those cities,” the Thursday news release said. 
The change is a way for the Highway Patrol to adapt to the “evolving needs of our state,” according to the news release.  
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol did not respond to further questions, including whether it’s equitable to shift the responsibility and pull resources from urban communities. The state agency has been responsible for patrolling state highways since 1937.
Rep. Andy Fugate, D-Oklahoma City, represents parts of Oklahoma City and Del City, both of which will lose Highway Patrol services. 
“(Interstate) 35 and I-40 is the crossroads of America,” he said, “If we are truly interested in preventing human and drug trafficking, it’s wrong for Oklahoma Highway Patrol to pull away from those.” 
Fugate said he didn’t recall conversations at the Capitol this session about these changes to patrols. He said Del City doesn’t have the resources to police the interstate that crosses through, but can’t speak for other jurisdictions. 
“If DPS needed additional resources or funding to do their job correctly, they should have been asking for it at the Capitol,” he said. “It’s beyond bewildering to me to see them pulling away from their chief responsibility of patrolling our highways.”
The state Legislature appropriated over $120 million to the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety this session, according to the House budget transparency portal. There was not a line item for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, which is part of the department.
The Highway Patrol is tasked with patrolling Oklahoma’s state-maintained roadways and highways statewide. In addition to enforcing laws, they respond to accidents, natural disasters and assist motorists.
Local police departments typically respond to incidents within their municipal jurisdictions.  
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma City Police Department said in a statement Monday that this change presents a “new set of circumstances” for the department, and it will need time to determine appropriate protocol. 
The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority is not anticipating any changes to patrols on the state’s turnpikes in urban areas, said Lisa Shearer-Salim, a spokesperson for the agency. OTA contracts with Highway Patrol to monitor the Oklahoma turnpike system. 
The Oklahoma Association of Chiefs of Police did not comment by deadline.

The U.S. Marshals Service is requesting assistance from members of the public who were in the Bear Creek area of the Sawtooth National Forest on or around July 5 who may have seen Decker.
On Saturday, the U.S. Marshals Service received a tip from a family recreating in the Bear Creek area that was consistent with Decker, according to press releases the U.S. Marshals Service issued Sunday and Monday.
The press release said the description of Decker is of a white man with a long ponytail, beard and overgrown mustache who stands between 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 5 feet, 10 inches tall. The man was said to be wearing black gauged earrings, a cream colored shirt, shorts, a black Jansport backpack, a black Garmin-style watch and either Converse or Vans shoes. 
The U.S. Marshals Office said Decker is suspected of murder and kidnapping in Chelan County, Washington, after his children, ages 5, 8 and 9, were killed May 30.
Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Eric Toms announced Sunday that agencies were teaming up to initiate a search for Decker in the Sawtooth National Forest after receiving the original tip on Saturday.
“This morning we began our joint search with the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Marshal Fugitive Task Force, Camas County Sheriff’s Office of areas believed to be accessible to a person in Decker’s condition,” Toms wrote in a press release issued Monday. “We are canvassing local residents/campers and people in the area recreating. Decker has a history of hitch hiking – we would like to encourage the public to not pick up any hitchhikers.”
Anyone with information about Decker is asked to call the U.S. Marshals Service at 1-800-336-0102 or submit a tip online at www.usmarshals.gov/tips.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-07 21:58:12+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: How one small CT business is bracing for tariff impact,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/07/podcast-dutch-epicure-shop-tariff-impact/,WSHU’s Molly Ingram spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel about how one small business is switching gears after the Trump tariff changes.,"With tariff news swirling, one small business in Litchfield, Connecticut, is prepared to pivot to serve its community.
WSHU’s Molly Ingram spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “For CT small business, Trump’s tariffs call for another ‘pivot’,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s story here.
WSHU: For this piece, you spent some time in a unique small business in Litchfield. Who are they, and what do they sell?
JES: Well, it’s called the Dutch Epicure shop. It has been around for a long, long, long time, since 1967, and they specialize in two things. The original owner of this shop was a baker, and his daughter now owns the shop. She is also a trained chef and specialty baker. But they also specialize in imported European products, mostly Dutch, and it got me thinking, Oh, my goodness, these guys might really get slammed with tariffs if it comes to that. Since just about 100% of what comes in as a package, good, or fresh, in the case of cheeses, is imported and is going to get nailed with tariffs.
WSHU: Wilma, who owns the store, says she’s yet to see a huge impact from tariffs, but that could change soon. Can you give a little context on the tariff situation as it stands today for European goods?
JES: I can give you the status as of early in the week, but there have been a lot of different signals coming out of the White House as to whether the tariff situation may change or not. As many listeners know, there have been a lot of ups and downs. As of right now, there’s a 10% tariff on EU goods and most goods around the world. Some countries have slightly higher. Then, there are some specific products that have tariffs on them. Recently, Wilma had not seen any tariffs come through in terms of price hikes that were being passed along to her; she has seen some additional fees related to shipping and whatnot, which may be more inflationary than anything else. It’s a little hard to know, but she is ready to take them on. She has absolutely no intention of changing the products the store sells. Will she change the tactics she uses to handle certain things? Yeah, probably. But it wouldn’t be the first time for her.
WSHU: She actually used the word pivot to describe how she, as a small business owner, has had to react to a lot of changes over the last few years. Can you talk a little bit about why small businesses have had to be so flexible, and how, for some, it’s actually made them more resilient?
JES: Sure, and I think that’s the real lesson coming from Wilma’s experience, because she’s not afraid. She plunges in. And I had one business group say to me, Look, you really have to anticipate and get ahead of things and be ready, as opposed to figuring everything out after. And Wilma certainly has done that.
They used to place a fair amount of mail orders because they were the only shop of their kind in the area. But Amazon basically took the wind out of that, along with having twins a little bit unexpectedly, so the shipping had to stop. She has expanded a little into more cooked prepared products like soups or stews, in addition to all the baked goods. So that became a little bit more useful when COVID hit. That really pushed her to think a little bit differently. First of all, the move into more prepared goods worked very much to her benefit, because people who had moved out of New York, principally, and up to Litchfield County, were just overwhelming the store, and they were buying everything she could bring in. She said to me that she brings in many cheeses, mostly Gouda. People were coming in and buying half wheels of cheese, things like that. So that was sort of a fortuitous move for her, having already moved into a prepared food realm.
And she says if tariffs really hit hard, she may have to pivot a little again, maybe do more catering, or even serve food in the location she’s in now. They moved about a year and a half ago, basically next door, so she’s anticipating that things might change. But she also points to a lot of the packaged goods she sells. You know, the Dutch love licorice. She has probably four dozen different types of licorice in there, and she carries a lot of German goods, like German mustard. She carries a lot of Dutch chocolate-type things and biscuits. And she points out that these are small ticket items, and if people have to pay more, it’s not like paying more for a car. It’s paying more for a jar of mustard or a bag of licorice. Cheeses could be a little bit more problematic in that they’re more expensive and they may well have more of a target on their backs.
The other thing she’s also anticipating are some issues with products that she needs for her baking, and she’s already seen some of that she was really faced with huge increases when the egg shortage hit due to bird flu, and while she was continued baking, she was definitely looking for recipes that had fewer eggs in them. She also uses a ton of chocolates, and she makes filled chocolates that you might see. Those prices have gone way up due to low production, and that’s basically a climate issue where chocolate crops around the world are really suffering.
So she’s looking ahead to all these kinds of things, and that becomes a lesson for other businesses. See what’s going on in the world, figure out how it’s going to impact you, and start to lay some groundwork ahead of time for what the future may hold, even as uncertain as it is right now, since the President has changed his mind multiple times on what tariffs will be and when they will be there, Could they be there this week? Yeah, maybe. But who knows? They’ve already been postponed a number of times.
WSHU: And as you talk to customers, did they seem willing to pay higher prices for these goods? Part of the reasoning behind the tariffs was that if prices for imported goods went up, people would buy American goods instead.
JES: A lot of what she sells, you just cannot get in the US in the same form that it’s in. To that end, folks were willing to pay. I’ll use the licorice example. The Dutch apparently love licorice, and it’s sweet, salty, and a million different things. It’s just not readily available in this country in that form. So it’s a unique product that you’re not going to be able to get anywhere else. To that end, people seem willing to pay. Is this a somewhat economically more advantaged part of the state? Yes. Will it be harder for others who can really feel the pinch of tariffs and the pinch of potential additional inflation or recession, if we do get to that point? Yeah, it’ll probably impact people like that more, and those folks would be less willing to pay that price.
I’ve also heard from readers that it underscores the need to support small businesses. I’m not a business expert, but I do know that the bulk of the businesses in the US are small businesses. This is how people make their living, and any kind of impact on them is going to have a trickle-down effect on all aspects of the economy. So it’s all tied together.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wilma-7-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-07 18:08:36.540336

A Des Moines family that has been waiting 11 years for approval of their application for permanent residence is going to court in an effort to force action in the case and is seeking protection from retaliation by federal officials.
The family of Kham Sian Khai of Des Moines is suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, its director Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and U.S. Citizenship Immigration Services in federal court. The family is seeking a court order to force U.S. CIS to process and approve their application for permanent residence — one of the initial steps in becoming naturalized citizens.
According to the family’s lawsuit, they’ve waited since June 2014 for CIS to process their Form I-485, also called an “Application to Register Permanent Residence.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The form is a considered a crucial document for individuals already in the U.S. to apply for a green card, granting them lawful permanent resident status. The process allows eligible foreign nationals to transition from “nonimmigrant” status to “permanent resident” status while remaining in the United States.
The lawsuit alleges Khai has been a lawful permanent resident since October 2024, but his spouse and children are still waiting for a decision that would grant them that same status.
According to records filed by the family’s lawyer, their first application for permanent residence was filed 11 years ago in June 2014. A second application was filed eight years ago in May 2017. The lawsuit alleges that while this second application was approved at some level, the family’s permanent-residence case has yet to be finalized with an adjudicated decision in their favor.
The result, the lawsuit claims, is that “Khai’s spouse and children have been waiting for nearly 11 years for their Lawful Permanent Resident cards. Had U.S. CIS timely adjudicated their Form I-485, they could all be naturalized citizens now.”
The lawsuit alleges that over the past 22 years, Bondi and her predecessors at the U.S. Department of Justice have “completely failed in their statutory obligation” to eliminate a backlog of immigration-benefit cases by November 2003.
According to federal records tied to the filing of the lawsuit, it takes about 16 months for a naturalization application to be processed in the Des Moines area – significantly longer than the 9.2 months that is reported nationally.
The Khai family, the lawsuit points out, has been waiting for 96 months – an “intolerable amount of time,” the family asserts — since the second application was filed, which is “10 times the average historical processing time” for the paperwork. In the past eight years, the lawsuit alleges, U.S. CIS has provided the family with no substantive responses or explanations in response to their inquiries about their case.
The lawsuit seeks a court-imposed, date-certain deadline for U.S. CIS to act on the case, as well as attorneys’ fees and a court order protecting the family from retaliation in response to the filing of the case.
The federal government has yet to file a response to the allegations.
Altoona couple says they’ve waited five years
A similar case involves Justin and Victoria Kokeh of Altoona, who are suing Noem, Bondi, and U.S. CIS.
In that case, the Kokehs, who are from Liberia, are seeking a court order to compel the defendants to adjudicate the Kokehs’ two N-400 applications for naturalization, which they say have been unreasonably delayed.
They allege the Des Moines field office typically takes eight months to process such applications. The Altoona couple has waited 58 to 60 months, the lawsuit claims, leading to “irreparable harm.”
The couple is seeking a court order to compel U.S. CIS officials to “perform their duties” as required by law, as well as attorneys’ fees.
Although the couple filed their lawsuit in February 2025, and amended it in May 2025, the federal government has yet to file a response, and was recently granted a third deadline extension for filing an answer.
The Kokeh and Khai cases and are not the only lawsuits Iowans have pending against Noem and immigration officials alleging lengthy and illegal delays in the processing of cases — although access to the information in many immigration cases is tightly restricted by the federal courts.
Some of the cases are filed under seal by the attorneys, and even when the public is granted access to those files, the documents can only be viewed in person at the courthouse where they’ve been filed.
Chandlor Collins, clerk of court for the U.S. Southern District of Iowa, allowed an Iowa Capital Dispatch reporter to read the filings in the Kokeh and Khai cases, but said the federal rules of civil procedure prohibit his office from providing electronic copies or paper printouts of those same records.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota lawmaker removed a social media post that some fellow lawmakers described as “a direct expression of racism and sexism.”
Meanwhile, a legislative leader declined to act on the post and criticized the legislators who complained about it.
Aberdeen Republican Rep. Logan Manhart posted a photo of himself Friday on Instagram captioned, “It’s a white boy summer and the boys are back in charge. #MAGA,” according to screenshots of the post, some of which were shared by people condemning it. The post has since been removed.

  This screenshot shows state Rep. Logan Manhart’s Fourth of July Instagram post captioned “It’s white boy summer and the boys are back in charge. #MAGA.” Manhart is pictured at right. South Dakota Searchlight blurred the image of the unidentified bystander at left.

Manhart did not respond to a message from South Dakota Searchlight. He wrote Monday on Facebook that criticisms of the post described him as racist, sexist and antisemitic, and he said those descriptions “could not be further from the truth.”
“I love our state, our nation, and all of our people,” Manhart wrote on Facebook. “God bless each and every one of you and your families. Have a wonderful and festive SOUTH DAKOTA SUMMER.”
Manhart’s Facebook post did not include an apology.
Five Democratic state representatives, including House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, sent a letter to House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach and House Speaker Jon Hansen, both Republicans, on Sunday calling on Manhart to apologize and urging legislative leaders to “address this with the seriousness it demands.”
“This is not a joke. It is a direct expression of racism and sexism, rooted in white supremacy and patriarchal power,” the letter said. “For an elected official to celebrate the return of ‘white boys’ being ‘in charge’ is a disgraceful signal that our government should belong to a narrow, privileged group — rather than to all South Dakotans.”
“White Boy Summer” became popular in 2021 as a meme and rap song by Chet Hanks, son of actor Tom Hanks. The song references drug use and other sexual acts, and is a play on the 2019 song “Hot Girl Summer” by rapper Megan Thee Stallion.
“White boy summer was created to be fun, playful and a celebration of fly white boys who love beautiful queens of every race,” Hanks wrote last year.

The Global Project Against Hate and Extremism reports that the phrase “white boy summer” has been co-opted by extremist groups and has “escalated into a powerful global call-to-action for far-right recruitment, protest and violence.”
“Several extremist groups including the Proud Boys, White Lives Matter, the Identitarian movement in Europe and neo-Nazi Active Clubs are all using ‘White Boy Summer’ to spread propaganda, recruit new members and facilitate targeted hate campaigns including acts of vandalism and hate incidents,” the group wrote.
Manhart’s post caught the attention of social media users across the nation, including Toby Morton, a former writer for the TV show “South Park” who posted that Manhart “forgot to buy his own domains” and that Manhart is “about to find out what public records and petty people can do with a .com.”
The letter from the Democratic lawmakers said South Dakota is “a state rich with diversity and strength,” including Native Americans whose land was “taken through broken treaties, displacement, and violence.”
“To ignore that truth, or the continued harm experienced by Indigenous communities and other marginalized people, is not just a moral failure — it is a betrayal of our public duty,” the letter said.
Manhart represents District 1, which includes the Lake Traverse Reservation and tribal land of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate.
Dismissing Manhart’s remarks “would send a chilling message that hate and exclusion are welcome in our Capitol,” the letter added.
Majority Leader Odenbach responded to the letter in an email to lawmakers, which was shared with South Dakota Searchlight, saying it would be impossible to police and respond to social media posts of all state representatives, or “to divine their underlying meaning.”

He added that he rejects the “insinuation that South Dakota is a state founded by racist oppressors, or that our great citizens of today are the cause” of continued harm to Native Americans and other marginalized groups.
“This is an outrageous slur on our fellow South Dakotans, whether living or dead,” Odenbach said, addressing the signers of the letter. “You can and must do better.”
Healy told South Dakota Searchlight that she and her Democratic colleagues “raised the issue because we’d be complicit in letting harmful rhetoric go unchallenged” otherwise. She added that “acknowledging truths about our history is not an attack on South Dakota” or its residents. 
Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, who is running for the 2026 Republican nomination for governor, said in a text message that he saw Manhart’s post, and saw that Manhart wore a “Toby Doeden for South Dakota” jacket in the post.
“I don’t really get it. I am not at all sure what he was trying to convey,” Doeden said. “Seemed like a pretty stupid use of words if you ask me.”

Jim Pillen is deploying Nebraska Task Force One to help with search and recovery after central Texas flash flooding that has killed at least 90 people, including children, and left others missing.
Over the weekend, the Guadalupe River in Texas’s Hill Country flooded. The river, about 70 miles north of San Antonio, rose 26 feet within 45 minutes, Texas state officials said. The area has about 20 campsites clustered along its banks, according to the Texas Tribune, including Camp Mystic, a summertime haven for generations of Texas girls.
The region expects more rainfall in the coming days, which could lead to more flash flooding. 
The disaster has raised questions about whether recent cuts to the National Weather Service played a role, as local officials in central Texas said they couldn’t have seen it coming. 
President Donald Trump is scheduled to visit Texas later this week. He approved federal disaster assistance for the Lone Star State on Sunday. 
Pillen said he has been in contact with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, who requested the help. Pillen said in a statement that the flooding was a serious situation that required an immediate response. 
Typically, the task force is deployed and managed under the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but this deployment was directed using Pillen’s authority under the Nebraska Emergency Management Act. Texas will be responsible for covering the costs of deploying personnel and equipment, as well as associated travel expenses, officials said.
“Nebraska stands ready to assist in any way it can,” Pillen said. “The team we are sending has the training necessary for dealing with these kinds of disaster environments and will be able to expedite the search efforts that continue to take place.”
Task Force One, the state’s elite urban search and rescue team, includes firefighters from Nebraska’s largest paid departments. The team was deployed to New York and the Pentagon after 9/11. The task force will transport boats, vehicles and other necessary equipment to Texas for navigating flooded areas. The group is expected to be deployed for two weeks and expects to reach San Antonio on Tuesday.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Justice is appealing a federal judge’s decision to award North Dakota $28 million in damages for the executive branch’s response to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.
The case now heads to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals for review.
Thousands traveled to south-central North Dakota to protest the construction of the oil pipeline underneath the Missouri River’s Lake Oahe reservoir alongside the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in 2016 and 2017. The tribe says the pipeline poses serious threats to the environment, intrudes upon Native territory and has desecrated sacred cultural sites.
Judge blasts Army Corps for pipeline protests, orders $28M in damages to North Dakota

The main demonstration camp was located on land managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The state filed suit in 2019 against the federal government, arguing that the Corps unlawfully allowed, and at some times encouraged, protesters to use its land at the state’s expense.
The case went to trial in February 2024. The trial lasted four weeks and included witness testimony from former North Dakota governors Doug Burgum and Jack Dalrymple, Indigenous activists, law enforcement officials and others.
In an April ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor sided with North Dakota’s claims, finding the Army Corps at fault for negligence, public nuisance and civil trespass claims.
The executive branch has disputed North Dakota’s accusations and maintains it did the best it could to manage an unpredictable situation.
The U.S. government must file its initial arguments for appeal by Aug. 15, the docket states.
North Dakota sought to recoup $38 million from the federal government, though Traynor lowered this amount to $28 million since the U.S. Department of Justice previously gave the state $10 million as compensation for the protests.
The state can’t get any of the money until the appeals process wraps up, according to the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget. The award would also have to survive review by other judges.

(Photo by Andrea Tinker for The Alabama Reflector)Montgomery Mayor Steven Reed said in a press conference Monday that crime had fallen in the city through the end of June. 
According to Reed, violent crime is down to 28%, homicides and nonviolent crime are down to 13% and non-fatal shootings are down to 22.5% during the first six months of the year.
This is in comparison to the 18% decrease in homicides Montgomery Advertiser reported last year which came after the formation of the Metro Area Crime Suppression Unit in 2024.

“We want to see these numbers improve throughout the rest of this year, and that’s why we’ve been in touch with our new director of office of violence prevention,” Reed said.
Reed gave credit to the Montgomery Police Department and the community citing a 70% clearance rate for the Montgomery Police Department which is higher than the national average.
The city for years struggled to fill vacant positions in its police department. Rep. Reed Ingram, R-Pike, introduced a bill in the 2025 legislative session that would have allowed the state to take over police departments that had staffing shortfalls. The legislation, which was opposed by Mayor Reed and other lawmakers, did not become law. 
The mayor  also said Montgomery is looking at investments in technology and other areas to assist in decreasing crime.
“There is no limit, there is no holdback on what we’re doing to invest in public safety and to invest in making sure all facets of this community are as safe as they can be,” Reed said
However, Reed said there is still work to be done to further decrease violent crimes in Montgomery including looking into regulating bail bondsmen practices to ensure repeat offenders who have committed a violent act are not being released.
“We have to make sure we hold them accountable through their regulation. We have to make sure that they understand that we all have a right to peace and solitude in our community,” he said. “While we respect the role bail bondsmen play, what they’re currently doing and some of the practices they have undertaken, particularly in Montgomery, have to end.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_6922-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-07 18:08:36.540336

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island State Police will continue 24/7 patrols of the four bridges owned by the Rhode Island Turnpike & Bridge Authority (RITBA) for another three years, according to an agreement reached between the two agencies in mid-June.
The memorandum of understanding calls for RITBA to pay the base salaries of two troopers through the end of June 2028 to assist with speed enforcement, potential vehicle collisions, and preventing deaths by suicide. Under the new contract, the authority will pay about $515,000 to the State Police, with payments scheduled on a quarterly basis over the three-year period.
A similar agreement was first reached by the RITBA and the State Police in 2021, though a copy was not immediately made available.
At the time, the Newport Daily News reported that a speed study by RITBA found 29% of drivers were traveling at least 15 miles per hour over the limit on the Pell and Jamestown Verrazzano bridges. Then–State Police Superintendent Col. James Manni told RITBA’s board in October 2021 that “a gray cruiser is the biggest deterrent we have in the state right now,” according to the meeting minutes.
 
How much RITBA will pay the Rhode Island State Police 
Year 1 (July 1, 2025 – June 30, 2026): $165,417
Year 2 (July 1, 2026 – June 30, 2027): $172,034
Year 3 (July 1, 2027 – June 30, 2028): $177,195



 The amount is equivalent to the salaries of two “less senior” officers who will be assigned to posts covering the Pell, Mount Hope, Jamestown Verrazzano, and Sakonnet River bridges — along with Route 138 through Jamestown and the 10 smaller bridges associated with the state highway.
State Police will determine which troopers are assigned to patrol RITBA bridges, with day-to-day rotations likely. Only one trooper will be assigned to the bridges at a time per shift.
One trooper is scheduled to patrol the bridges from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., while the other works from 9 p.m. to 8 a.m., said Lt. Col. Robert Creamer, the State Police deputy superintendent and chief of field operations.
In addition to 24-hour patrols, State Police enforce weight restrictions on the Mount Hope and Pell bridges at least bi-weekly. The Pell Bridge, which was constructed in 1969, has a weight limit of 80,000 pounds, but vehicles weighing up to 160,000 pounds can cross if they are given a permit.
No vehicles over 60,000 pounds are allowed to cross the Mount Hope Bridge, which was built in 1929.
Under the new contract, RITBA may provide office space for troopers if available. The closest State Police facility to the authority’s Jamestown office near the Pell Bridge is the Wickford Barracks in North Kingstown.

(Photo courtesy David Abbey)In 2023, David Abbey retired after 26 years as director of the Legislative Finance Committee and 40 years influencing and crafting the New Mexico budget. 
Shortly thereafter, he sat down to detail his experiences. A 340-page book is the end product of that reminiscing. 
Called “Forty Years in the New Mexico Roundhouse” — and featuring a Source New Mexico photo on its cover of the state Capitol building at dusk — the book details Abbey’s experiences guiding the state budget through seven governors, starting with Gov. Toney Anaya in 1983, through Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s second term, along with dozens of iterations of New Mexico’s Legislature.
As LFC director, Abbey spearheaded the committee’s creation of its own budget proposal and offered nonpartisan, independent guidance to lawmakers and as they developed their own tax-and-spend proposals. 
But just because retirement freed Abbey from the nonpartisan requirements of his job doesn’t mean he’s seeking to settle four decades of scores or reveal what he really thought about one governor or another.
“I had some motivations for this book, and improvement is one of them,” Abbey told Source New Mexico in a phone interview. “You don’t get there by throwing stones; you get there by truth telling. I tried to do that.”
The following interview has been edited for concision and clarity.

Source: I want to talk about your retrospective, but I thought I’d first start with the current crisis, specifically the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP and rural hospital closures the state is anticipating due to the passage of the ‘big beautiful bill.’ Does what’s happening now remind you of anything in your career, or is this totally unprecedented? 
Abbey: I just read your story about [current LFC Director] Charles Sallee’s presentation. He says, ‘Everybody take a deep breath, let’s analyze this.’ That would be what I recommend, as well. And we don’t really know yet what the impacts are. I’m concerned about overstating it, and I’m definitely concerned about a lot of things we need to do in the state. If we get too preoccupied with the [cuts to] federal funds, we’re going to miss other stuff.
NM lawmakers presented with tough choices amid federal cuts to Medicaid, SNAP 

And have I ever seen anything like this? We’ve seen severe crises, and I think we’re well-positioned to deal with the federal funds situation. 
You write in your recommendations at the end of the book that ‘it’s as if New Mexico is a hoarder,’ regarding how the Legislature hasn’t responded to huge oil and gas surpluses by cutting taxes all that much. Does the current federal funds cut make you think differently about that?  
That comment about hoarding was pertinent to our tax structure, and it needs attention. I don’t think you can use [the] risk of a downturn in oil and gas or [a reduction in] federal funds to ignore it. It’s certainly true that it validates being cautious, but not to ignore it. I think we’ve ignored it. The Legislature basically did virtually nothing this year [on this issue], and the governor vetoed what little they did. 
Why do you call the 2010s, when Susana Martinez was governor, ‘the lost decade’?
Every year, the state was limping along, trying to patch together budgets. It was an extreme [period] of status quo when our rankings then weren’t that different than now — near the bottom. And so the early childhood initiatives had merit, but they got, for example, squeezed out by Gov. Martinez [who] was preoccupied with tax cuts even when there wasn’t money. There were some initiatives that had merit, like early childhood and pre-K and home visiting and health care, mental health, and they were left behind, so we lost a decade through failure to address [those] initiatives.
As they revamp the state’s behavioral health care system this year, state Democrats frequently reference all the behavioral health contracts the Martinez administration canceled. Do you agree the damage done in the last decade to the behavioral health system took this long to catch up?
I think there was severe damage, but that was 11 years ago. We’re into the seventh year of the new governor. It’s past time to be forward-looking rather than backward-looking.
Do you think the Legislature did that this year? Did they take a big enough swing? 
I think they really tried. Yeah, it’s a vexing problem. And I suppose just kind of a slight concern: It looks to me like the solution had to do with putting the leadership [of the behavioral health reforms] in the judicial branch and that’s not really the function of that branch of government. So some questions about that. But there was enough money to address that in a recurring way, and they tried. 
Behavioral health package shifts responsibility to the courts

Another of your recommendations to the Legislature is that ‘education trumps everything.’ To what do you attribute the longstanding leadership failures in the Public Education Department?
We need to take 100 buckets to three fires, not 100 buckets to 100 fires. Reading proficiency at the early grades — that’s the big fire. I’m a strong believer in extended learning time. That goes back two decades. Anaya wanted more learning time. [Gov. [Garrey] Carruthers wanted more learning time. In the COVID area, just when Sen. [Mimi] Stewart’s ‘plus’ initiative was taking root, teachers and parents pushed back on it.
You recount a lot of the corruption that’s surfaced in New Mexico politics over four decades and contend that paying lawmakers could help alleviate that. What do you think about moving away from the 30-day/ 60-day session set-up we have now?
In activity levels, the Legislature has a robust interim process. Many of the committees meet monthly. [Lawmakers] get per diem. Now they get pensions. Now they have aides. So the Legislature has made a lot of investments to make the volunteer work of legislators easier. So all that interim work could be more effective in getting stuff ready for the session.
From the Roundhouse to the White House: An interview with NM Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham

I think a good example of that is the criminal justice stuff [where the governor and the Legislature failed to pass criminal justice legislation during a special session last summer]. There’s a lot of finger pointing about who’s to blame and who wasn’t ready. But the reality is, that’s interim work. And if you had a 60-day session every year, those extra days aren’t going to make up for rolling up their sleeves during the interim and getting the bills ready for the beginning of the session, whether it’s 30 or 60 days.
What do you think is the largest misperception New Mexico residents have about how the Legislature works?
I don’t think they realize they’re volunteers. They think they’re hanging out in Santa Fe living off the fat of the land. The reality is,  in my 40-year history, a lot of the state’s leadership came from the Legislature…it’s a pretty long list of strong leadership coming from the Legislature, especially dealing with the hard times. The Legislature did a terrific job, and I don’t think that’s valued.
What were the biggest changes you saw during your 40 years?
You know, unfortunately, I would say not enough change. [That’s what] Chapter 13 [is] about, ‘Show me your metrics.’ We haven’t seen enough change. We certainly have had times of great fiscal constraints, and in certain times, money has been pouring in, and we haven’t been able to make money pouring in improve results. So, not enough change.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/JPEG-image-4656-AB77-4C-0-e1751923728520.jpeg,,,2025-07-07 18:08:36.540336

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)As the Oak Ridge Fire continued to spread southwest of the Navajo Nation capital last week, families living in the fire’s path not only scrambled to save what they could from their homes, but many also had to rescue their animals and livestock.
Even as the fire grew, a majority of Navajo families living in the immediate evacuation homes refused to leave because they did not want to abandon their livestock.
“It was really heartbreaking,” Navajo Nation Council Delegate Brenda Jesus said. She represents the St. Michael’s and Oak Springs chapter and has been on the ground helping the impacted communities since the fire started.
For many families on the Navajo Nation, livestock is their livelihood. They rely on their livestock to support their family.
“I’m not leaving if I can’t take my livestock. I’m not going to leave my livestock behind, ” Craig Tsosie, vice president of St. Michael’s Chapter, said he was told by many families during the peak of evacuations after the fire started on June 28.
Tsosie said that the only way many families in evacuation zones felt comfortable leaving their homes was if their livestock also got out.
The Navajo Department of Agriculture, Forestry, Fish & Wildlife, Navajo park rangers and Resource Enforcement have been on site in Window Rock since the fire began and have been actively assisting families who need their livestock evacuated.
The Department of Agriculture announced on its Facebook page that the Dean Jackson Arena on the Navajo Nation Fairgrounds was open to evacuated livestock as of June 28.

The department established a livestock evacuation team that families affected by the disaster could contact to coordinate evacuation assistance.
Veterinary staff were on-site at the fairgrounds to monitor the animals as they arrived. The livestock were fed and watered daily.
Tsosie said he was glad that the Department of Agriculture stepped up and mobilized to work with families to save their livestock.
“They provided trucks, trailers and they were limited on their end to what they could do,” he said. “They couldn’t be everywhere at once.”
Tsosie said many of the teams working to evacuate livestock were out on the ground in Hunters Point, Oak Springs and St. Michael’s, helping owners load their livestock into trailers at all hours of the night. There were days when he was out until 3 a.m.
Even as they worked to evacuate livestock, Tsosie said there was some frustration from the community, potentially due to the long wait times or miscommunication.
He said he hopes people understand that it was whole communities that were impacted and needed assistance.
“It wasn’t just a couple of people,” he added. “Everybody in those fire zones that were getting evacuated needed livestock evacuated along with them.”
As of July 4, the department had evacuated 39 cattle, 236 sheep, 27 chickens, 21 goats, 16 horses, seven dogs, four hogs and two turkeys, according to the Navajo Nation President’s Office.
Diné volunteers help evacuated sheep
As a way to help the sheep and owners impacted by the Oak Ridge Fire, a group of volunteers banded together at the Dean Jackson Arena on July 4 to give a flock of sheep a much-needed haircut.
“A lot of families are going to receive their sheep back better than they brought them in,” Tsosie said of the sheep shearing provided by the volunteers.
During the summer months, sheep are sheared to help them handle the heat and stay healthy. Sheep have thick wool, and unshorn sheep often experience extra stress and potential health problems during hot summer temperatures.
“They’re reliant on their shepherds to shear them,” Diné shepherd Nikyle Begay said. If they don’t get sheared, they could potentially get flystrike, a condition where flies lay their eggs within the sheep’s wool.
“Maggots will work their way into the sheep’s skin, infecting the sheep and basically eating it,” he said.
To help keep the sheep healthy and ease some of the stress from the owners, Diné shepherds Jay Begay from Hard Rock, Arizona, and Nikyle Begay from Cornfields, Arizona, put a call out on social media for volunteers to help them shear the sheep impacted by the Oak Ridge Fire.
With more than 200 sheep evacuated from the fire, there were a few flocks that were not sheared for the summer.
“Many flocks are shepherded by elders who probably had (shearing) planned for the summer, but instead, they were displaced by the fire,” Nikyle said. “We just wanted to ease whatever worries they might have and offer our services.”
Working with the Navajo Department of Agriculture, they were able to arrange a shearing event for the sheep.
“This is a way for us to help without being in the way and helping the best way we know how,” Nikyle said, adding that when they put out the call, the response was immediate.
The response, Nikyle said, is because because they are part of a great community of shepherds, fiber artists and those who admire sheep.
Shearers from across the Navajo Nation showed up to help give haircuts to nearly 80 sheep, each of them taking one animal at a time throughout the day.
Traps and plyboards were laid out on the dirt floor in different areas of the arena for volunteers to use to hand-shear the sheep. The sheep varied in size, from small lambs to full-grown rams.
The volunteer shearer would take a sheep, tie off the legs if needed, and hold the sheep down to be sheared using sharp shearing scissors.
After the volunteers were done shearing, the wool was collected and saved in bags for the owners.
A total of 18 volunteers showed up to help with the sheep, Nikyle said, and 10 stayed throughout the day.
“Sheep are an integral part of our culture,” Nikyle said. “They’ve always been; they’ve made their place within ceremonies and everyday life.”
For more information about the event and the shearing work, Nikyle can be reached on Instagram at Navajo Shepherd.

(Photo courtesy of Friends of the Everglades/Ralph Awrood)As Gov. Ron DeSantis insists the immigrant detention center in the Everglades is temporary, photos shared by an environmental law group show new construction using what appears to be asphalt.
The opening of the detention center drew almost immediate backlash and a lawsuit from environmental groups, arguing against construction in the highly sensitive environment of the Big Cypress National Preserve.
DeSantis labeled environmental concerns as illegitimate, claiming that construction occurred over already developed facilities, like the tarmac and taxiway, of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, and that any waste would be removed.
Aerial photographs from Friends of the Everglades, one of the groups suing federal and state officials, taken Saturday show land where grass has been removed and recently paved-over areas.
Other images that Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity entered as evidence in the suit show newly paved roads and light brightening the night sky from the detention center that were visible from approximately 15 miles away. Evidence shows the progression of the paved areas before and during construction.
“The environmental impacts will be devastating,” the groups wrote to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida on Thursday. “Defendants cannot hide from this fact — or from the public — under cover of darkness and avoid their responsibilities under federal law.”
The groups are suing the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Florida Division of Emergency Management, and Miami-Dade County alleging construction of the detention center violates a federal law that requires environmental analysis of potential harms and that the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
“The Governor is absolutely correct, Alligator Alcatraz was built only on existing runway facilities and paved areas,” a spokesperson for FDEM wrote in an email to Florida Phoenix. “All of those photos show pre-existing paved areas.”

During a Monday press conference in Jacksonville, DeSantis said the temporary structures from the 3,000-capacity tent and trailer detention center eventually would be broken down and moved. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who publicly rolled out the detention center he dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” announced on Wednesday that hundreds of people would arrive at the detention center that night.
“What we’re doing is temporary,” he said. “We’re not going to make permanent sites on these locations. You know, the place down in South Florida, it’s just a massive airport that’s there in the Everglades.”
Last week, the federal government distanced itself from responsibility for the site in its response to the suit, saying the federal regulations didn’t apply because it didn’t fund or authorize construction of the center.
President Donald Trump applauded Uthmeier for his role in opening the detention center during his July 1 visit.
“I know you’re taking a little heat from some environmental groups, but I take it all the time,” the president said. “That’s an honor.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-07-07 21:28:41+00:00,Mississippi Today,New vending machine provides free medicine to fight opioid overdoses,Simeon Gates,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/07/vending-machine-medicine-to-fight-opioid-overdose/,NFL player Jeffery Simmons chooses his native Mississippi as a site for free distribution of naloxone.,"Several public health groups unveiled a new vending machine Monday in the Jackson Medical Mall, where people can pick up free boxes of naloxone, a medicine that temporarily reverses opioid overdoses in children and adults.
The machine holds 250 boxes. Fund Recovery and the REACH Institute donated the machine, and Padagis donated the naloxone. 
Naloxone attaches to opioid receptors in the brain and reverses or blocks the effects of opioids. It has no effect on people who don’t have opioids in their system. 
Naloxone only works for 30 to 90 minutes. Someone who takes a dose will still need immediate medical attention. 
Jeffery Simmons is a Mississippi native and defensive tackle for the Tennessee Titans. He’s featured throughout Fund Recovery’s  “Tackle Naxolone Now” campaign, and he specifically chose Jackson as the location for Fund Recovery’s fourth naloxone vending machine. 
“I’m not from Jackson, but I grew up right down the road. I see what’s going on in our community,” Simmons said. “Mississippi is home for me, so I don’t just think about Macon, Mississippi, Starkville…. I think about Mississippi.”
The “Tackle Naloxone Now” campaign seeks to make the medicine more accessible by distributing it free in vending machines. The campaign already set up machines in Tennessee: two in Fentress County and one in Nashville.

“What we know is that prevention is important, treatment is important,”  said Ryan Cain, Fund Recovery’s president and CEO. “We recognize that, but you can’t treat a dead patient, so we have to make naloxone available.”
Jan Dawson is the director of substance use education, prevention and control at the Mississippi Public Health Institute. She explained that the vending machines are part of the larger effort to combat opioid abuse and overdose deaths.
“We know over time that naloxone has saved a lot of lives in Mississippi,” Dawson said.
Working with the Department of Mental Health, the institute has trained first responders about drug overdoses, and she said 77% of them have used naloxone.
“We do think that we’re saving lives,” she said. “However, what we have to realize is, our numbers of overdose deaths are just now down to the pre-COVID numbers.”
The number of opioid overdose deaths in Mississippi spiked by 51% between 2020 and 2021, in part because of the pandemic. It declined by 25% between 2021 and 2022, and grew by 6% between 2022 and 2023. It declined again by 29% between 2023 and 2024.
In 2024, the number of times emergency medical services administered naloxone dropped nearly 14% compared to 2023.
“We have reduced those numbers,” Dawson said. “We haven’t continued to let those numbers go up, but we have to continue to fight.”
According to Dawson, a grant from the Mississippi Department of Mental Health will pay to restock the machine for at least the next year.

A 2024 law offering bonds to cover 70% of stadium costs expired June 30, 2025. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A bipartisan council of Kansas lawmakers voted Monday to extend by six months the deadline for the Missouri-based Kansas City Royals or the Kansas City Chiefs to accept economic development incentives from Kansas for construction of sports stadiums.
The Legislative Coordinating Council unanimously agreed to grant the reprieve so the Kansas Department of Commerce could present options for stadium deals to the LCC until Dec. 31, 2025.
A 2024 law that set the framework for issuance of STAR bonds to cover 70% of construction costs for one or both stadiums and support structures had a deadline of June 30, 2025. The statute gave the LCC authority to add another year to the timeline.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, recommended adoption of a six-month alternative for the presentation of formal proposals by the Department of Commerce to the LCC. He said he didn’t want the stadium issue to bleed into the 2026 session of the Legislature, which would convene in early January.
“We have had this law out there for a year now and each team has had a year to come to some type of conclusion,” Hawkins said. “Neither team has and quite frankly for the last month and a half, I have been very consistent across the board saying, ‘Let’s get it done.’ ”
He said he was persuaded to endorse a half-year extension because one of the teams waited from November to February for responses from the administration of Gov. Laura Kelly. Also, he said, the Kelly administration didn’t answer a proposal from a team — previously reported to be the Chiefs — for seven weeks.
“It doesn’t matter what team it was. That’s not fair to the teams, when they’re making proposals and they’re not getting responses back,” said Hawkins, who is a candidate for state insurance commissioner.
The LCC adopted the six-month extension but also voted to broaden the window of opportunity for stadium deals with Kansas to June 30, 2026. That could be a technicality, because the LCC could decide on behalf of the full House and Senate not to consider recommendations submitted after that date.
Missouri offered to finance up to 50% of the cost to renovate or build new stadiums for the Royals and Chiefs. Both franchises have played at a Jackson County, Missouri, complex since the early 1970s.
Sen. Tim Shallenberger, a Baxter Springs Republican serving as the Senate’s vice president, said he didn’t want to force the Chiefs or Royals to abruptly wrap up a deal with Kansas.
“When I was younger, I was a banker,” Shallenberger said. “Putting a deal like this together is not easy. You have landowners that look at the deadlines that we put out and use that as leverage. You have the teams look at the deadlines we put out and use that as leverage. Approved by the LCC by this December seems a little quick to me.
Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, convened the LCC meeting because he recently observed signs of progress during confidential negotiations involving the Chiefs.
“We weren’t interested in being a pawn and extending for no reason at all,” Masterson said. “The sense was as long as there’s legitimate, real conversations about the possibility of that relationship … we could move forward.”
Chiefs president Mark Donovan asked Kansas lawmakers to amend the deadline to continue negotiations with Kansas on building a stadium, team headquarters, practice facility and related business developments.
In the correspondence, Donovan said complexity, importance and scale of the project made it clear “more time is needed to bring the effort to full fruition.”

""Congress appropriated these funds, and they need to be issued to states,"" Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler said. ""Intentionally withholding this funding is going to have detrimental impacts on every state and all communities, especially for some of our most vulnerable students.""
The post Review suddenly holds up $108M in education grants appeared first[...]","STATE OFFICIALS said Monday that $108 million in federal education grants that were expected to arrive July 1 are now instead under review “to make sure they align with President Trump’s priorities.” 
Gov. Maura Healey’s administration said local school districts were counting on the funding for summer and after-school programs, behavioral and mental health supports, bullying prevention and intervention, reducing chronic absenteeism, and buying materials and supplies for classrooms.
“Every day that goes by without this education funding hurts children, educators, communities and our economy,” Healey said in a statement. “Without this funding, districts are going to be forced to lay off staff, delay or cancel programs and services, and disrupt learning. Our schools were promised this funding, and the Trump Administration needs to deliver it.”
The US Department of Education notified states on June 30 that certain programs would not be issuing grant award notifications on July 1, Healey’s office said. The administration added that the department “also communicated that they are withholding funds for the Integrated English Language and Civics Education programs, as well as the Adult Basic Education Grants to States program.”
“Congress appropriated these funds, and they need to be issued to states,” Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler said. “Intentionally withholding this funding is going to have detrimental impacts on every state and all communities, especially for some of our most vulnerable students.”
ABC News on July 2 reported that the Trump administration had “paused” more than $6 billion in education funding, writing that funding decisions concerning this academic year have “not yet been made.”
In statements released by the governor’s office, House Speaker Ron Mariano called the Trump administration actions “reckless and mean-spirited” and Senate President Karen Spilka said Trump “must respect the separation of powers and Congress’s Constitutional authority to appropriate funding.”
“I urge him to release these funds immediately – and I urge Congress to stop ceding their power to this President,” Spilka said.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education shared an email its received from noreply@ed.gov about title programs. The email said in part that the department was reviewing funding and “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year.”
“Accordingly, the Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review. The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”

(Photo by edb3_16/Getty Images)The Oregon Legislature approved matching funds last week for Washington’s $125 million commitment to replacing the 100-year-old Hood River-White Salmon Bridge. 
Combined, the state funding covers about a quarter of the project’s estimated $1.12 billion cost. 
“This project strengthens our entire region’s foundation for growth and prosperity. This isn’t just about new steel and concrete — we’re literally rebuilding the backbone of our communities,” Oregon State Rep. Jeff Helfrich, R-Hood River, said Thursday in a joint news release with Washington State Sen. Curtis King, R-Yakima. 
“The combined funding between our two states puts us in a stronger position when we approach the federal government for additional dollars to help pay for the bridge project,” King said. 
The Hood River-White Salmon Bridge Authority also has an outstanding $532 million request for funding from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Bridge Investment Program. 
The current proposal is to replace the existing bridge, which is narrow and has steel decking, with a structure designed to meet modern traffic demands and safety standards. 
Design on the new bridge is expected to begin in September, with the opening targeted for 2030. 
The existing Hood River-White Salmon Bridge was built in 1924. ​​It spans the Columbia River between Interstate 84 in Oregon and State Route 14 in Washington, connecting the communities of Hood River on the Oregon side and White Salmon and Bingen in Washington.
The Port of Hood River, which manages the structure, reports that the bridge is a safety hazard for commuters and slows the movement of goods through the Columbia River Gorge.
While Port of Hood River officials say the bridge is “functionally obsolete” and cannot adequately accommodate large trucks, it is still a primary freight route listed on the National Highway System and is frequently used by trucks transporting fruit, wood products, locally manufactured unmanned aerial vehicles, and other cargo. 
And even though the Port of Hood River says the bridge is “one of the most challenging bridges on the Columbia River Gorge for barge operators,” barges frequently travel past it.
Efforts to replace the Hood River-White Salmon Bridge began in 2003, but were quickly paused due to a lack of funding. 
At the time, project organizers estimated that the bridge’s remaining lifespan was about 30 years. 
A renewed push to replace the bridge began in 2017 after the Oregon Legislature approved funding to resume environmental studies. 
Earlier this year, the Washington Legislature approved $10 million in project funding for the 2025-27 biennium and $40 million in the 2027-29 biennium as part of its transportation budget. Washington previously promised $75 million in 2023. 
The legislation approved in Oregon added $45 million of lottery funds in the 2025-27 biennium, $30 million for the 2027-29 biennium and $30 million for the 2029-31 biennium, for a total of $105 million over six years. 
Oregon previously allocated $20 million in lottery funds to the project in 2023. 
Washington’s early commitment helped project advocates secure funding in the Oregon Legislature, Helfrich said
Other funding sources include a $200 million grant from the federal Nationally Significant Multimodal Freight and Highway Projects program, and $105 million through a federal Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation loan that will be repaid with tolling revenue. 
Tolls for the existing bridge increased in 2023 from $2 to $3.50 for cash customers and $1 to $1.75 for those with a prepaid Breezeby account. All new revenue from that increase was put into a restricted fund to be used only for the new bridge.
The Port of Hood River previously increased the bridge toll rate from $1 to $2 for cash customers, 80 cents to $1 for those with a Breezeby account, in 2018 to cover increasingly frequent repairs and upgrades necessary to keep the bridge open until it could be replaced.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/hood-river-white-salmon-bridge-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 17:12:48.560633

“There is going to be a race out there for the truth in terms of what happened last week,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District. “There are going to be forces and money and groups that are going to be trying to confuse and mislead people about what actually this bill is all about.”
At a press conference at the Charter Oak Health Center, a federally funded provider of primary care for the poor and uninsured just four blocks from the state Capitol in Hartford, a lineup of speakers led by Gov. Ned Lamont acknowledged that a precise analysis of the law’s granular impact is a work in progress.
Officials have no complete assessment of the new law on Connecticut’s finances or safety net, but Lamont said he saw no immediate need for new state revenue given the delayed impact of key provisions, most notably changes in how people qualify for Medicaid and the nutrition assistance program, SNAP.

Richard Blumenthal, U.S. Reps. John Larson and Joe Courtney, and other politicians who condemned the “Big Beautiful Bill.”  Credit: Dana Edwards / CT Mirror
“Let us take a look at what this bill does,” Lamont said. “It’s incredibly cynical, because all the tax cut goodies happen immediately, just exploding the deficit, and most of the spending cuts happen after the midterms and even beyond that. So I don’t think there’s any need for revenue now, but we’ll see what happens over the next few years.”
The broad strokes are evident: A permanent continuation of temporary tax cuts Trump pushed in 2017 will increase the national debt by trillions and, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, raise after-tax incomes for the richest 10% of Americans and lower them for the poorest 10%.
The same congressional office estimated that about 138,000 people in Connecticut could lose Medicaid coverage, primarily due to compliance with new work requirements that Andrea Barton Reeves, the state commissioner of social services, said could prove daunting.
Nearly three quarters of Medicaid recipients in Connecticut already hold jobs.

While the law makes no direct cuts on Medicare, Courtney noted that its impact on the deficit will trigger a provision of the so-called “PAYGO” law, short for pay as you go. It requires spending increases or tax cuts to be offset by across-the-board cuts of 4% on certain entitlements, most notably Medicare. 
“Last January, after the inauguration, President Trump said that he would love and cherish Medicare and Medicaid. In the history of broken promises, I think this one sort of surpassed, ‘Read my lips, no new taxes,’” Courtney said.
U.S. Rep. John B. Larson, D-1st District, said the impact on Medicaid, Medicare and SNAP not only will be obscured by the passage of time but actually will be blunted by the actions of the Connecticut General Assembly and other state legislatures to maintain social safety nets.

As a result, Larson said, the Democrats’ warnings may strike some as overly alarmist: “‘What are the Democrats talking about here? I’m still getting my Social Security check. I’m still being taken care of.’”
Indeed, Comptroller Sean Scanlon said, “Our message to the people of Connecticut is, ‘We got your back. We’re not going to let you fall through the cracks under this governor and this legislature.’ We’re going to step up to make sure that the people of Connecticut impacted by this bill are going to be protected, and we should be damn proud of that.”
How that would occur and at what cost were questions for another day.

“I think our core precept, mine certainly, is we’re going to do everything we can to protect the most vulnerable. That’s one of the reasons we have a rainy day fund,” Lamont said.
The governor has been opposed to any increases in the state income tax, and he showed no sign Monday of wavering on that position.
Lamont, a two-term governor who has hinted at seeking a third term in 2026, said Trump’s bill and the Republicans who voted for it were doing so by racking up huge debt.
 “No Republican in Washington [who] voted for this bill can ever use the words ‘fiscal conservative’ with a straight face,” Lamont said. “And I want to hear where Republicans in this state stand on this bill.”
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said the Democrats are accentuating the negative and ignoring the positive aspects, such as the greater deductibility of state and local taxes, or SALT.
“I continue to be disappointed by the governor and Democrats’ reaction,” Candelora said. “They continue to publicize and only point to things that could be harmful.”
Greater accountability for Medicaid and SNAP recipients are not necessarily harmful and could force the state to do a better job in assessing eligibility, Candelora said.
“I think in terms of the SALT deduction, it’s undisputed, it’s going to give significant tax relief to our constituents,” Harding said.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal predicted Republicans will avoid constituents as the law is further analyzed.
“Don’t expect them to be having a lot of town halls in the future as the impact of this bill becomes clearer,” he said.

Leaders vow to continue serving all patients.,"The sweeping federal budget bill signed into law on Friday freezes Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood for one year, a move the organization’s leadership called “a direct assault on reproductive freedom and public health.”
The measure, which took effect immediately upon the bill’s signing, prohibits Medicaid payments to any nonprofit “primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health, and related medical care” that provides abortions in cases other than rape, incest or health of the mother. 
Amanda Skinner, president of Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which serves Connecticut and Rhode Island, called it “a backdoor abortion ban.”
Despite the cuts, Skinner reassured patients that clinics would remain open and continue to serve patients with Medicaid. “Our first and most important priority in this moment is to ensure that our patients know that we are there for them, that our doors are open and they can continue to get the care that they need from us regardless of their payer source,” Skinner said during a virtual press conference on Monday. “We will not turn them away.”
PPSNE is the largest freestanding abortion provider in Connecticut and, like a federally qualified health center, provides services to anyone, regardless of ability to pay. Last year, PPSNE served 60,000 patients in Connecticut and Rhode Island, 42% of whom were insured by Medicaid. 
Skinner said PPSNE receives $12 million annually in Medicaid funding, which accounts for 24% of the organization’s annual revenue. “Defunding Planned Parenthood will place an immense strain on our current operations,” Skinner said. 
Nationally, 200 Planned Parenthood health centers in 24 states across the country face the risk of closure as a result of the bill. Over 90% of these closures would occur in states where abortion remains legal and protected, Skinner added. 
A federal law called the Hyde Amendment, in place since 1977, already prohibited federal funding from covering abortions. The measure passed last week raises the stakes by withholding Medicaid funding from certain organizations just because they provide abortions, even though Medicaid was never used to cover the procedures.
Skinner said abortions account for slightly over 10% of services provided by PPSNE. The facility also provides what are known as “family planning services,” which include a broad swath of care related to contraception, STI treatment and testing, and cancer screenings.
Anti-abortion advocates saw the bill’s funding cuts to Planned Parenthood as a win for the movement.
Leslie Wolfgang, director of public policy at the Family Institute of Connecticut, said she would welcome a permanent federal defunding of Planned Parenthood that extends beyond the current one-year plan.
“We can’t separate the fact that Planned Parenthood provides abortion in Connecticut,” Wolfgang said. “They are sitting on a large endowment here in Connecticut, so I don’t have a lot of sympathy for any loss that they receive for one year from the federal government.”
Polling shows that a majority of Americans support legalizing abortion in all or most cases. In 2024, 63% of Americans supported legalizing abortion, including 41% of Republican and Republican-leaning voters and 85% of Democrat and Democrat-leaning voters.
The Connecticut legislature has demonstrated strong support for Planned Parenthood following Trump’s reelection. 
In January, at the recommendation of the governor, the Appropriations and Human Services Committees approved an additional $500,000 in federal funding for PPSNE, under what’s known as the Social Services Block Grant, to help support the increased demand for services. The funds were slated to go towards annual exams, cancer screenings, birth control and other family planning services.
The following month, Planned Parenthood was the largest beneficiary of an emergency certification measure passed by the state legislature. The organization received $800,000 out of a total of $2.8 million granted to organizations that would face negative impacts as a result of the Trump administration’s policies; Planned Parenthood leaders stated at the time that part of the funding would go towards stockpiling mifepristone, a drug used to end pregnancies. 
At a press conference on Monday discussing the broader implications of the “big beautiful bill,” Gov. Ned Lamont hinted at a willingness to continue state support for the organization.
“This is how we’re looking at it. Planned Parenthood is going to have a $5- $6- $7 million cut. I don’t know what their alternatives are, except for perhaps the state stepping up and helping out in any way we can,” Lamont said.
Planned Parenthood Federation of America also plans to sue the Trump administration, Skinner said.
“We know that in an environment where the Trump administration and where Congress has passed this bill, it would be an uphill battle for any legislative strategy at the federal level, which means we do have to double down and work in court,” Skinner said.

We’ve seen a lot of positive developments in the right direction, but the administration, the president and his trade team want to cut the best deals for the American people and the American worker.”The administration has used tariffs aggressively to reset trade relationships with every partner. The new threats are part of a push to reach trade deals with individual countries.Trump set a goal of reaching 90 deals within 90 days of his April 2 announcement, but only two — Vietnam and the U.K. — had materialized by that deadline.Trump will also sign an executive order further extending to Aug. 1 the deadline for tariffs on every country without a one-to-one trade agreement with the U.S., Leavitt said.Trump shook the global economy when he imposed wide-reaching levies on nearly every country on April 2. The president walked them back just seven days later, announcing a 90-day pause on staggering tariffs that reached nearly 50% on some major U.S. trading partners and, briefly, 125% on Chinese imports.The U.S. Court of International Trade struck down Trump’s emergency tariffs May 28. The following day, an appeals court temporarily restored the tariffs and as of Monday they remain in place while the court case is being heard.Shauneen Miranda contributed to this report.",,,,2025-07-07 17:12:48.560633

The 2024-2025 school grades show that 28 of Florida’s 67 districts are A districts, 31 are B, eight are C, and none are D or F. 
The state calculates the scores using student math, science, reading, and social studies assessment scores, graduation rates, “maintaining a focus on students who need the most support,” and more. 
The highest-scoring counties are Nassau and St. Johns, both achieving 74%, and Lafayette and Walton scoring 73%. Collier, Indian River, Sarasota, and Miami-Dade counties were the next highest scoring. 
Gadsden County scored lowest, achieving 49% of points available. The next above Gadsden County were Jefferson at 51%, Hamilton at 52%, Okeechobee at 53%, and Madison at 54%. 
“Florida schools are improving across the board, and this is a direct result of the governor’s innovative policies and his mandate to school board members and superintendents across the state to bring education back to the basics and focus on student success,” incoming Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas said during a news conference in Jacksonville Monday afternoon.

In order to receive an A grade, elementary schools must earn 62% or more points on the rubric while A grade middle and high schools received 64% or more points. 
For districts, the A mark requires 64% points or more, while B grades range from 57% to 63%, C is 44% to 56%, and D is 34% to 43%. 
In 2022-2023, high schools needed to score 70% for an A and middle schools needed 68%.
No districts received a D or F this year, although 10 schools received an F and 61 received a D. 
According to the department, 347 schools, or 10%, decreased their grade this year from last year and 1,908 schools, or 56%, increased or maintained an A. State metrics showed 6% more schools are rated A this year compared to last. 
According to department data, 573 schools rated D or F in 2015 while, in 2025, 71 schools rated a D or F. Last year, 117 schools fell within in the lowest two grades. 
The grading scale will change next year, and the department anticipates about 12 districts now rated A will no longer receive that mark and 12 more will be rated C. State law requires the scale to change if more than 75% of schools receive an A or B rating. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Kamoutsas credited the rising grades largely to progress monitoring assessments, which just completed the third year of administration. The progress monitoring tests, the Florida Assessment of Student Thinking, focus on student achievement throughout the year instead of on just end of the year exams. 
“I think the progress monitoring has led to better student performance and better student achievement. There’s always things that we’re looking to do to improve, and if there’s policies that we need to implement at the state level, either through the education department, or if we need to go to the Legislature to seek reforms, we won’t hesitate to do so,” DeSantis said. 
The Phoenix reported last month that math scores for all Florida students improved by 3% in 2024-2025 when compared to 2023-2024 and reading scores increased by 4% in that same time frame.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales announced Monday that his office had struck a deal with the federal government to scrutinize Indiana’s voter rolls to identify noncitizens living in the Hoosier State.
The agreement with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, part of the Department of Homeland Security, allows the state to access a database to verify citizenship of individuals on the state’s voter rolls.
Indiana officials ask federal government to verify citizenship of 585K registered voters

In the past, opponents have argued that the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, wasn’t designed for checking massive datasets, but rather for one-by-one verification. Using it at a large scale could accidentally flag some naturalized citizens, they worry.
Morales, a naturalized citizen born in Guatemala, celebrated the move in a statement.
“As someone who knows firsthand what it means to earn U.S. citizenship, I deeply value the rights and responsibilities that come with citizenship— especially the right to vote. This agreement is another step in safeguarding the rights of every eligible Hoosier voter and reflects our commitment to protecting the integrity of our elections,” he said.
The office’s release said that voters registered without having their citizenship confirmed by the Bureau of Motor Vehicles will be notified by mail and have the opportunity to confirm their citizenship status, as outlined by a 2024 bill that ultimately became law.
The new access follows a joint lawsuit filed by Morales and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who sued to access the SAVE data to aide voter verification efforts in April. In October 2024, weeks before the November presidential and gubernatorial election, the duo asked the federal government to let them use SAVE to scrutinize over 585,000 registered voters, or 12% of all Hoosiers on Indiana’s voter rolls.
The review never occurred
“Our Constitution and laws are clear — only U.S. citizens are eligible to vote in our elections. This is not about politics. It’s about protecting the sanctity of the ballot and ensuring Hoosiers can trust that their votes are counted and their elections are secure,” Morales continued.

Owned by Canadian energy company Enbridge, Line 5 stretches from northwestern Wisconsin, through the Upper Peninsula, into lakebed in the Straits of Mackinac where Lake Michigan and Lake Huron meet and down into the lower peninsula ending in Sarnia, Ontario. 
Transporting more than 22 million gallons of light crude oil and natural gas liquids daily, activists have called the pipeline a ticking time bomb, pointing to a July 2010 spill, where Enbridge’s Line 6B ruptured, releasing 840,000 gallons of crude oil into Talmadge Creek, which flows into the Kalamazoo River. 
Watershed Aware, a limited liability corporation that says it was founded by a group of concerned citizens, on July 3 placed along I-75 in Gaylord the first of what it says will be several billboards in an effort to “help Michigan citizens understand more clearly the impacts and costs of Enbridge’s proposed Line 5 Tunnel Project.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Enbridge identified gaps in Line 5’s protective coating in 2014, while a 2018 anchor strike dented the pipeline in three places, intensifying concerns about the pipeline’s safety. In 2018, Enbridge announced an agreement with the state to relocate the two segments of the pipeline into a new section, housed in a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock of the Straits of Mackinac. 
The project has since received necessary permits from the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and the Michigan Public Service Commission, while the United States Army Corps of Engineers moves forward under emergency processing in line with President Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order instructing federal agencies to utilize the corps’ emergency permitting provisions “to the fullest extent possible” to facilitate the nation’s energy supply. 
The Corps issued its draft environmental impact statement on May 30, with Enbridge spokesperson Ryan Duffy telling the Michigan Advance the company’s goal in constructing the tunnel is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint. 
“The tunnel design already reflects that intent, and we will use the USACE’s findings from the [draft statement] to further refine the project,” Duffy said. 
Public comment on the statement closed on June 30 with several environmental organizations arguing the review failed to consider the pipeline’s long-term impacts on climate change, while calling for a more detailed review of the geology of the lakebed as well as a consideration of alternatives to the tunnel. 
The company is also working to redo several permit applications with the Department of Great Lakes Environment and Energy, including its Water Resources Protection, National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, which aims to limit the amount of pollutants discharged into surface waters.
The billboard posted in Gaylord calls attention to the permit’s request to discharge 5 million gallons per day of various wastewaters associated with tunnel construction and drainage as well as groundwater seepage, and storm water into Lake Michigan.
However, Duffy said conditions for water use and return to the environment are dictated by a separate National Pollution Discharge Elimination System permit issued by the department that authorizes discharges of water in a manner that will not adversely impact Lake Michigan’s water quality.
Watershed Aware said in its statement that they are working to raise funds for billboards along the I-75 corridor, which leads up through Mackinaw City across the Mackinac Bridge into the Upper Peninsula.
Alongside concerns about the tunnel project’s environmental impacts, members of Michigan’s Tribal Communities raised concerns on how the construction process will impact cultural sites and ancestral remains. 
A recent investigation from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that Enbridge potentially escaped federal review of land that tribes say is likely to have items of cultural significance through a land swap with Michigan’s Emmet County, with County later paving over the plot in 2023. 
“While people are celebrating their 4th of July, the alleged freedoms and rights that were fought for. The Indigenous people of Michigan are fighting a tunnel that is being built for Canadian gains and profits, their plan is to desecrate tribal ancestral remains that have been buried for thousands of years on both sides of the Straits of Mackinac. This proves that we are not free nor do we have rights, even in death. This is disgraceful,” Andrea Pierce, chair of Anishinaabek Caucus and a citizen of the Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, said.
Pierce was among a group who in 2020 identified a submerged cultural site just a short distance from Line 5. 
Duffy said Enbridge has conducted surveys in the Straits at the direction of and in consultation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers which is responsible for consulting under the National Historic Preservation Act to assess potential impacts to historic properties The details of those surveys were provided to the corps. However, Enbridge is unable to provide information on the findings due to confidentiality agreements. 
Duffy also noted that Tribal representatives were consulted as part of the corps’ efforts to assess the project’s effects on historic properties, noting that the corps consulted routinely with Tribes over the course of the last five years. 
In advance of the Trump administration’s move to place the tunnel project on an expedited track for review, the Bay Mills Indian Community alongside the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians, Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi, and Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potawatomi and the Little Traverse Bay Band of Odawa Indians withdrew from participating in the project as “cooperating agencies” under the National Environmental Policy Act. 
At an April 16 meeting, the corps said it continues to consult with the Tribes who withdrew their participation, as well as 13 other Tribes.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2-1024x510.png,,,2025-07-07 17:12:48.560633

While there, he said he was tortured, physically and psychologically, by Salvadoran officials, according to court records.Now he is in custody in Tennessee, where he faces federal criminal charges related to human smuggling. He could be released as soon as July 16, and Maryland District Judge Paula Xinis questioned Department of Justice lawyers about their intentions for him upon his release.Abrego Garcia's attorneys expressed concern that once he is released, immigration officials would immediately detain the Maryland man and either quickly remove him to a third country or send him back to El Salvador by attempting to remove his earlier deportation protections.“We do need protection from the government waking up tomorrow and upon Mr. Abrego Garcia’s release from criminal custody, (removing him) to somewhere they haven’t identified,” said Andrew J. Rossman, of Quinn Emmanuel, the firm representing Abrego Garcia in his immigration case in Maryland.DOJ attorney Jonathan Guynn said removing Abrego Garcia to a third country is likely the path forward, but could not confirm or detail which country.‘Jello to a wall’Xinis set a Thursday afternoon hearing to obtain testimony from a witness who will be involved in making the decision about what will happen to Abrego Garcia.“It's like trying to nail jello to a wall to figure out what happens next week,” she said of Abrego Garcia’s potential release on July 16 ahead of his trial.Xinis said until she’s clear about what steps the Trump administration will take next, she’ll hold off on issuing an order bringing Abrego Garcia back to Maryland.During the Monday hearing, Xinis also denied the Trump administration’s two requests to dismiss the case.DOJ lawyers argued that because Abrego Garcia was returned to the United States, the case is now moot. Xinis said the case is not moot because the “status quo” has not been fulfilled — although Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S., he is not back in Maryland, but instead is in the custody of U.S. marshals in Tennessee.Attorneys for Abrego Garcia made the same request last month, on an emergency basis to try to bring him back to Maryland while his criminal case continues, but Xinis denied that request as well.At that time she referred to an answer from DOJ attorney Guynn, who said Abrego Garcia’s removal to a third country was not immediate, as part of her reasoning.“He will be taken into (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement) custody and removal proceedings will be initiated,” Guynn said June 26 of Abrego Garcia’s release. “There are no imminent plans to remove him to a third country.""Rossman during Monday’s hearing also raised concerns that Abrego Garcia, yet again, would not receive proper due process if he is to be removed to a third country. He said Abrego Garcia must be notified where he will be sent and have time to appeal if he fears he will face harm in that country.Xinis said while that will likely fall under an immigration judge, she does have the authority to have access to the information detailing how the Trump administration is going to remove Abrego Garcia.Tennessee caseAbrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. from El Salvador last month to face federal criminal charges lodged in Tennessee that accuse him “of conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain” and “unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain.”The indictment by the Trump administration occurred while Abrego Garcia was in prison custody in El Salvador. Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the charges.During Monday’s hearing, Xinis pressed Department of Justice attorney Bridget O’Hickey on whether the federal charges played a role in the return of Abrego Garcia to the U.S.“He was not indicted with the purpose of bringing him back,” O’Hickey said.  “He was indicted because he was under investigation.”Xinis questioned the timing of the investigation, which began on April 21, when Abrego Garcia was in a Salvadoran prison and shortly after the Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return.O’Hickey could not give an answer on when the investigation into Abrego Garcia began, but she said that he was “under investigation prior.”Xinis also questioned O’Hickey on the DOJ’s motion to dismiss the case entirely in May.On May 27, the Department of Justice told Xinis that nothing could be done to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador and therefore the case should be dismissed because of a lack of jurisdiction. But federal charges were filed on May 21.“Why else would you file an indictment against someone you couldn’t produce?” Xinis asked O’Hickey.O’Hickey said that negotiations with El Salvador were ongoing and that it was not clear that the indictment would mean Abrego Garcia would be released from El Salvador.“I am aware that the proceedings were moving in tandem,” she said.",,,,2025-07-07 16:15:17.586268

“There’s so many people who don’t know there’s an election,” said candidate Marcia Ranglin-Vassell, a former state representative who works for Providence Public Schools. “As an educator, that’s what frustrates me most.”
A short timeline gave the four candidates little time to get their messages out. The Rhode Island Board of Elections set the schedule for the race in early May, less than three weeks after Ruggerio died. Primary and election dates were chosen based on when schools would be available to serve as polling places.

Democratic candidate Lenny Cioe, a nurse who lost his bid to unseat Ruggerio in the last three Democratic primaries, said he felt it would have been better to wait until early next year to hold the election.
“Right now, the state is in a deep deficit,” Cioe, 66, said in an interview Monday. “We’re paying a large amount of money for the special election. I’m upset about the money.”


Polling information 
Polls open at 7 a.m. and close at 8 p.m.
North Providence will open three polling places for district voters: James L. McGuire Elementary School, Dr. Joseph Whelan Elementary School and Dr. Edward A. Ricci Middle School. Information about which voters are assigned to which polling place is available online. 
Eligible Providence voters will all vote at Veazie Street Elementary School.
Voters must be registered Democrats, or unaffiliated, to participate in the special Democratic primary. 


Election-related costs for the Rhode Island Department of State, including for printing of ballots, were not immediately available. There is no significant cost for the Rhode Island Board of Elections to test and prepare voting equipment and oversee election operations, including counting votes, Chris Hunter, a board spokesperson, said in an email. 
The city of Providence is spending $19,000 on the special primary and general election combined, Anthony Vega, a spokesperson for Mayor Brett Smiley’s office, said in an email. The North Providence Board of Canvassers did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding estimated costs for the special election.
Both municipalities offered early voting from June 18 to 4 p.m. Monday in addition to accepting mail ballots.
Early voting turnout approaches 5%
As of Monday morning, 465 primary ballots had been submitted by mail, with another 428 people casting early ballots in-person at Providence or North Providence city halls, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s office said in an email. There are 22,214 registered voters in the district, 19,683 of whom are Democrats or unaffiliated, and therefore able to participate in the Democratic primary, according to Chybowski.  Registered Republicans cannot vote in a Democratic primary under state election rules.
Candidate Manny Taveras characterized the preliminary early voting numbers — equal to 4.6% of eligible voters — as “pretty high.”
By comparison, the last special state legislative primary for the Senate District 1 seat in Providence in September 2023 drew 1,300 voters for a four-way Democratic primary, including early voting.
However, Taveras, a 40-year-old account executive for a pharmacy benefits company, also said that construction at the Dr. Joseph A. Whalen Elementary School in North Providence — one of the three North Providence polling places — may make it harder for voters to find parking and cast ballots Tuesday.
North Providence Mayor Charlies Lombardi’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the construction at the polling place.

“The response has been great,” Stefano Famiglietti, a North Providence Town Council member and lawyer, said in an interview Monday. “I’ve had great conversations with a lot of people I hadn’t met before, and made contact with others I hadn’t connected to in a while.”
Famiglietti is considered the frontrunner, evidenced by the endorsement of the Senate District 4 Democratic committee, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, and the proliferation of signs for his campaign throughout the district. Famiglietti also leads the pack in campaign fundraising, with more than $46,000 in his campaign account as of June 30. 
By comparison, Cioe had $865 cash on hand, Taveras had $719, and Ranglin-Vassell had $57 in her account, according to the most recent reports filed with the Board of Elections.
Ranglin-Vassell said she has had positive responses from door-knocking, including from older women who want to see a woman win the race.
“This seat has never been represented by a woman in 40 years,” Ranglin-Vassell said.
Ruggerio first won the seat in 1984, winning every subsequent reelection until he died of cancer on April 21. 










 The response has been great. I’ve had great conversations with a lot of people I hadn’t met before, and made contact with others I hadn’t connected to in a while.


– Democratic candidate Stefano Famiglietti, a North Providence Town Council member and lawyer


Ranglin-Vassell is the only candidate with state legislative experience, having served three terms representing House District 6 before opting not to seek reelection in 2022. Famiglietti, meanwhile, has served on the North Providence Town Council since 2018. Taveras is a first-time candidate for any elected office, though his brother, Angel Taveras, served as the Providence mayor from 2011 to 2015.
Whoever wins the Democratic primary will face the sole Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, a 39-year-old lawyer, in an Aug. 5 general election. The winner of the election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026. 
State lawmakers are paid $19,817 a year.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health and a former Kentucky state senator is considering running for Congress in a Central Kentucky district.
Dr. Ralph Alvarado, the 2019 running mate of former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, announced in a social media post that he is considering a run after Republican state Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, of Lexington, said she will not be seeking the seat.
Its current occupant, Republican Andy Barr, is running next year for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Mitch McConnell.
Bledsoe, long speculated to be considering a run for Congress, issued a statement about her decision on social media Monday afternoon, citing personal reasons.

Bledsoe also said she would work to hold the congressional seat for Republicans, adding that “a great candidate for this seat will be announcing in the coming days, and I’m going to be all-in with him.”
“This was not an easy decision, but I know it’s the right one,” Bledsoe said in her statement. “I had every confidence in my ability to win and to serve, but ultimately this timing is just not right for me and my family. I am in a unique and meaningful season of life. My children are in high school, and these years you only get once. As I imagined what it would be like to fully commit to a campaign and to service in Washington, I kept coming back to Friday night games, school events, and everyday moments I don’t want to miss — and that my children deserve to share with me.”
The state senator added that she remains committed to working in the legislature and vowed to be “in the fight on the campaign trail here at home” including supporting Barr in his race for U.S. Senate. Other notable Republicans in the primary are former Attorney General Daniel Cameron and Lexington businessman Nate Morris. The current seat holder, U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, will not be seeking reelection in 2026.
In a recent interview with the Lexington Herald-Leader, Bledsoe said that in addition to focusing on her children, she also will need more surgeries to recover from a 2023 accident where a horse kicked her in the face.
Another state lawmaker, Republican Rep. Ryan Dotson, of Winchester, has announced his campaign for the congressional seat.
On the Democratic side, former Kentucky House Democratic caucus chair Cherlynn Stevenson and former Lexington council member David Kloiber are running for the seat.
Kentucky’s primary elections will be held in May of 2026.
Alvarado, a physician, represented a state Senate district that includes Clark and parts of Fayette and Montgomery counties from 2015 until 2023 when Republican Gov. Bill Lee tapped him to become Tennessee’s health commissioner.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

Laurel Libby of Auburn speaks with a colleague on the floor of the Maine House of Representatives on March 20, 2025. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)An Auburn lawmaker who was censured last legislative session won’t dispute the Attorney General’s office’s argument that her case is “moot” after the Maine House of Representatives reinstated her voting and speaking abilities next session.
Republican Rep. Laurel Libby was barred from speaking on the chamber floor in late February, when the House voted 75-70 along party lines in favor of the censure after the lawmaker called out a transgender athlete on her legislative Facebook page, drawing national attention to Maine’s inclusive policies.
The censure could have ended at any point if the legislator apologized to the body, but she declined. Instead, Libby sued House Speaker Ryan Fecteau in March and petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court in April after the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied her motion for an expedited appeal to end the censure, which she argued disenfranchised her constituents. In May, the high court granted an injunction overruling the Maine House of Representatives’ decision to block Libby from voting.  
On June 25, the last day of the legislative session, the House passed a resolution restoring Libby’s ability to vote and speak in the next legislative session, which is still part of the two-year term she was elected to. 
Because of that decision, the Attorney General’s office filed a letter with the First Circuit Court of Appeals saying the lawsuit is now moot, as reported by Maine Public. Libby said in a statement Monday that she won’t contest the mootness argument and ask for the appeal to be dismissed.
“I will not contest the AG’s mootness argument — but only because the constitutional rights of my constituents have now been restored and the leadership has formally abandoned the punishment they once insisted was justified,” Libby said. “That change didn’t come voluntarily. It came because we fought back — and we were winning.” 
The letter on behalf of Libby to the circuit court included an email from Assistant Attorney General Kimberly Patwardhan saying that any effort to impose the February censure next legislative session would be ruled “out of order.”

The task force consists of two swift water rescue teams as well as two additional members of the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management, which are performing search and rescue operations in the area, said Keli Cain, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma Department of Emergency Management.
The deployment of the teams from Oklahoma City and Tulsa areas follows a request from the Texas Division Emergency Management, she said. 
Although deployment could be extended or shortened as needed, the teams are expected to remain in the area for 14 days. 
Texas lawmakers failed to pass a bill to improve local disaster warning systems this year

In central Texas, 10 inches of rain fell Friday, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet. According to officials, more than 80 people have died throughout Texas Hill Country. In Kerr County, of 75 people that died in the flash floods, 27 of which were children. Officials said at least 40 people were still missing. 
Both swift water rescue teams deployed Saturday to aid in ongoing search and rescue efforts and recovery operations. The members of the Oklahoma emergency management department deployed Sunday to work at the Texas State Operations Center to assist in coordinating additional resources from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
The Oklahoma City task force includes personnel from the Oklahoma City Fire Department, Yukon Fire Department and Norman Fire Department. The Tulsa task force includes personnel from the Bixby Fire Department and Skiatook Fire Department. 
“As always, Oklahoma will answer the call to help our friends and neighbors during these devastating floods,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. “I’m grateful to our elite first responders in Tulsa and Oklahoma City for their willingness to step up and help our neighbors once again.”
Last year, the state deployed personnel to North Carolina and Florida through the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, a state-to-state mutual aid program, in response to Hurricane Helene. The Category 4 hurricane brought 29 inches of rain across the Appalachian Mountains, as well as deadly landslides and flash floods.

Rural parts of state could be particularly hard hit due to lack of alternative resources, a teachers group says.
The post Trump administration may cost Wyoming schools $24.5M by withholding federal funds appeared first on WyoFile .","CHEYENNE—Wyoming officials say the Cowboy State stands to lose more than $24.5 million after the Trump administration withheld more than $6 billion in funds supporting various education programs earlier this week.
Kim Amen, president of the Wyoming Education Association, said she was blindsided by the decision, and now Wyoming K-12 public school districts, as well as her organization, are in a “scramble” to determine budgets before school begins across the state in just a few weeks.
Nationally and in Wyoming, the funds withheld support professional development for teachers, support for English learners, offer student support and academic enrichment grants, and support after-school and summer enrichment programs.
“This all comes back to our students, and they’re the ones that are going to suffer,” Amen said. “… Everything we do in our schools is to support our students.”

She said Wyoming’s public school districts will now face tough decisions about where to put their money. There is potential for teachers or paraprofessionals to lose their jobs, or other services may be cut for some school districts to continue after-school programs or professional development, if they choose to do so, Amen said.
This scramble may be more pronounced in rural areas of Wyoming, as many may not have access to other services for after-school care like a YMCA and typically rely more heavily on the type of federal funds withheld by the Trump administration in this move, Amen said.
The Wyoming Department of Education is encouraging school districts to not obligate any funds beyond existing carryover funds for Title II-A, Title III and 21st Century Community Learning Centers, a federal program under Title IV.

Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder testified for a subcommittee of the U.S. House Committee on Education & the Workforce on Oct. 19, 2023. (Screenshot courtesy of U.S. House subcommittee stream)
Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder commented on the decision in a written statement to the WTE.
“We are constantly in contact with our partners at the federal level, and while we do not yet know the details of this review of funds, President Trump’s education priorities are Wyoming’s priorities, and I continue to support his leadership,” she wrote.
The WDE provided the following figures that will not be allocated to the state if the funds are not distributed:

Title II-A, professional development for teachers — $10,835,611
Title III, support for English learners — $500,000
Title IV-A, student support and academic enrichment grants — $6,659,535 (the state was actually given allocation figures for this grant in May, but they rescinded that while they review)
Title IV-B (21st Century Community Learning Centers), after-school and summer enrichment programs — $6,515,398
Total: $24,510,544

For Amen, she said she could see the burden falling on the state, and Wyoming taxpayers, to continue to fund services provided by Wyoming’s public schools.
“We were told by some people in leadership in this state that the gutting of the (U.S.) Department of Education was actually a good thing for the state of Wyoming because it would mean that all the money would come back to the states and that we would get to decide how that money was spent.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.
Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

DemasA federal lawsuit against the Michigan Department of Corrections, alleging toxic mold at the Women’s Huron Valley Correctional Facility made inmates ill, may move forward after a judge rejected the department’s call to end the case.
In a recent opinion issued by U.S. District Judge Stephen Murphy of the Eastern District of Michigan in Bailey v. Washington, the court found that the department’s defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity. Murphy also denied the bulk of the department’s motion for judgment based on facts already pleaded in the case.
Murphy also found that Paula Bailey and the lawsuit’s plaintiffs pleaded sufficient facts to show the defendants were personally involved in decisions that led to dangerous and poor conditions at the facility in Washtenaw County’s Pittsfield Township. 
The department alleged that two of the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring their portion of the lawsuit, but Murphy found that they did have standing to seek injunctive relief.
It was further noted that the plaintiffs adequately pleaded a negligence claim against the defendants.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That said, the court dismissed state law claims against the defendants in their official capacities.
The lawsuit alleged that MDOC Director Heidi Washington, other department officials and staff at the facility knew of the poor conditions, which later led to the presence of toxic mold. The case was initially dismissed along with a similar lawsuit, Pearson v. Corrections, but both were later revived by the courts on separate amended complaints.
In an opinion issued June 24, Murphy said that the defendants were not entitled to immunity on Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims, namely because Bailey and other inmates adequately alleged that poor ventilation and exposure to various environmental hazards led to illnesses.
Murphy also noted that the court could not conclude the department’s defendants were unaware of the poor conditions.
The department’s defendants said they responded reasonably to inmates’ complaints of mold and associated issues through “ameliorative efforts,” but those efforts included giving inmates inadequate cleaning supplies to deal with the hazards, which forced some inmates to clean cells and floors with menstrual pads. Inmates were also allegedly told to scratch the mold off tiles with their fingernails.
Inmates were not, however, in any position to replace the aging HVAC system, fix the leaking roof, install new air filters and remedy the various structural issues that made the prison dangerous.
After weighing those alleged facts, Murphy said he could not conclude that the department’s response to the mold issues was reasonable.
The Bailey plaintiffs asserted that they have a clear constitutional right to an environment free of toxic environmental elements and fresh air. 
Murphy said the allegations that some of the mold compounds were so destructive – eating through bricks, dripping from ceilings, and with some MDOC employees refusing to work in certain mold-infested areas – were significant. Efforts to complain about the mold provided enough notice to the department regarding the overall unlawfulness of the conditions of the facility, Murphy added.
The same conclusion applied on the right to fresh air, as case law establishes that poor air quality can be a basis for an inadequate ventilation claim and does not confer qualified immunity to the department.
MDOC attempted to claim that the plaintiffs had not pleaded sufficient facts to demonstrate that the defendants were personally involved in decisions that led to the presence of mold. The department also asserted that the plaintiffs failed to comply with federal court rules and failed to allege personal involvement from high-level decision makers at MDOC. 
Murphy said that neither argument passed muster, as the complaint satisfied court rules and it only attempted to hold higher-level decision makers, like Washington, responsible for their own actions.
On the issue of standing regarding two of the plaintiffs, Murphy wrote that the department’s arguments also failed. The judge previously determined that the plaintiffs in question had exhausted their administrative remedies before filing a lawsuit, nullifying the department’s argument. Murphy also stated the plaintiffs had an obvious interest in the condition of the prison because they were incarcerated there.
“The harm alleged is real, immediate and ongoing,” Murphy said.
Murphy therefore denied the department’s motion for judgment on the pleadings regarding the request for injunctive relief, but split the difference on the state law claims.
The defendants sought to dismiss the lawsuit’s state negligence claims as it related to being sued in their official capacities and the complaint’s supposed non-compliance with the Court of Claims Act. 
To that end, Murphy granted the motion for judgment and dismissed the official capacity state law claims, but the bulk of the complaint withstood MDOC’s attempt to end it outright.
The opinion from Murphy moves the case further along to the discovery phase, which is set to conclude no later than January 30, 2026.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-07-07 15:10:22.837574

(Keeneland photo)President Donald Trump’s massive spending and tax package includes provisions that will affect Kentucky’s Thoroughbred racing and breeding industries — an incentive for horse owners and a provision that makes it harder for bettors to turn a profit. 
Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Barr of Lexington is hailing the former, saying it will provide racing with security for generations to come, while Democrats warn the latter will harm the sport by taxing bettors “into oblivion.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by the president on the Fourth of July after Congress gave final passage to the measure last week, makes permanent a 100% bonus depreciation included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) called it “an important incentive for Thoroughbred breeders and owners.” 
However, the act also limits the amount of gambling losses that can be claimed as a federal tax deduction, making it harder for bettors to profit. That change, which is to take effect in January 2026, will limit what gamblers can deduct from their income taxes to 90% of their losses in that year. Now bettors can deduct all of their losses up until the losses match winnings. Some gamblers are saying the new law could force them to pay taxes in years when they lose more than they win from bets.
Damon Thayer, a former Kentucky Senate Republican floor leader and horse racing industry consultant, said that the change in the deduction for gambling losses “will likely affect decisions made in the betting industry — both the casino and sports betting, as well as horse racing betting.” 
“This is not good,” he said. 
Thayer added that he hopes that by the end of the year, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association can work with allies in Congress, like Kentuckians Barr and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, to remove the section affecting bettors. 
In its statement about the passage of the bill, the National Thoroughbred Racing Association said “there is still work to be done to offset some losses by horseplayers in their ability to deduct tax losses.” The organization added that it is “committed to working on that fix moving forward.” 
Thayer said that Thoroughbred breeders stand to suffer declines in demand if the lower deduction remains in place for bettors. “It could lead to a big decrease in the amount of money wagered on horse racing, which will have a direct effect on purses, and therefore the amount of money people are willing to spend on horses.”
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Madison Andrus criticized the limit on the amount bettors are allowed to deduct from losses in a statement ahead of Trump signing the bill. 
“At every turn this Republican Tax Scam gets worse and worse for Kentuckians. Kentucky’s horse racing industry is a cornerstone of American culture and Republicans are taking a hatchet to it all to pay for billionaire tax cuts. This is yet another example of Republicans’ betrayal of the American people.”
Thayer said the provision “won’t kill the Kentucky horse industry, but it would have a negative effect.” Thayer added that he contacted Barr about the provision. 
On the other hand, the permanent 100% bonus depreciation is a “big win for the industry,” Thayer said. Like the other tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term, the break for horse owners was scheduled to begin phasing out this year.
National Thoroughbred Racing Association President and CEO Tom Rooney said in the organization’s statement that it “can’t be overstated how important permanent 100% bonus depreciation is to the sport.” 
“Equally as important was getting the language changing section 461(l) removed,” Rooney said. “Those changes to the excess business loss carryover would have wiped out many gains that those in the horse industry would have seen with 100% bonus depreciation.” 
The changed loss carryover section means that horse owners and small farm operators can carry forward excess business losses as net operating losses, according to Barr’s office. 
Barr, who is running for U.S. Senate in 2026, said in a statement that OBBBA’s permanent bonus depreciation and protections for small-business loss carryovers “delivers (a) targeted but a critical boost for our signature horse industry,” 
“The thoroughbred horse racing industry is a special part of Kentucky, and this bill ensures it will thrive for generations to come,” Barr added. 
Keeneland President and CEO Shannon Arvin said in Barr’s press release that the permanent bonus deprecation “is a significant win for the Thoroughbred industry.” Keeneland is a thoroughbred auction house and racetrack in Lexington, which is in Barr’s congressional district. 
“These measures provide much-needed stability for owners and breeders, support reinvestment in bloodstock and infrastructure and strengthen the long-term health of our sport,” Arvin said.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ScenicsKS9-24KLD602-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 15:10:22.837574

Article Summary

JB Pritzker’s new running mate Christian Mitchell has held several roles in state government, including lawmaker and deputy governor.
Pritzker said he trusts Mitchell is ready to take over as governor if required and Mitchell said he shares Pritzker’s vision for Illinois.
Mitchell spearheaded some of Pritzker’s top legislative accomplishments during his first term.
Affordability will be a top issue for Pritzker’s campaign, Mitchell said.
Mitchell said he’s willing to consider ethics reform after holding a top leadership position in the Democratic Party of Illinois under former Chair Mike Madigan.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


At 38 years old, Christian Mitchell has been inside most corners of state government as a top advisor on political campaigns, state legislator, deputy governor and civic engagement leader at a major university.

All those experiences make him ready to be Gov. JB Pritzker’s running mate next year in the governor’s campaign for a third term, Mitchell said.

“Bringing somebody who will continue to do the work, who with the governor, will go everywhere in the state of Illinois, advocating for the state of Illinois — that’s the thing I think I bring to the ticket. And I think we think about the state the same way,” Mitchell said in an interview with Capitol News Illinois.

Mitchell, a Black Bronzeville resident who currently works as vice president of civic engagement for the University of Chicago, was raised by his single mom and his grandfather and attended the now-shuttered St. Joseph High School in Westchester. He got an undergraduate degree in public policy from the University of Chicago, and while serving in the General Assembly, earned his law degree at Loyola University.

Mitchell represented a South Side of Chicago district in the Illinois House from 2013 until 2019 when Pritzker selected him to be one of four deputy governors, which serve a chief of staff-like role in Pritzker’s administration overseeing specific state agencies and policy areas.

He also joined the Illinois Air National Guard in 2023 shortly after leaving the governor’s office.

“It’s certainly not great for my free time, but your time is the most precious thing you have and the ability to give my time in service of my state and my country is very important to me,” Mitchell said.

Why Pritzker picked Mitchell 

Pritzker told reporters in the days after he launched his campaign he was looking for a running mate who shared the same affinity for Illinois and was qualified to step in as governor if required. He said he picked Mitchell more than a week before announcing his reelection in late June, but he declined to say how many people he considered.

“He is somebody that I have grown to trust,” Pritzker said at an event in Peoria. “I’ve seen him usher enormous legislation through the legislature. … He’s a guy who knows how to get big things done and I’ve worked with him to get it done and I’m excited for the people of Illinois to get to know him.”

Lieutenant governors in Illinois have virtually no constitutional authority, other than to replace a governor who is impeached, resigns or dies in office. Pritzker’s running mate selection has received more attention as the governor is believed to be considering running for president in 2028 and would resign as governor if victorious.

Mitchell said he’s running to be Pritzker’s right-hand man for four years, but said Pritzker would make a good candidate for president.

“Illinois is the state most representative of the nation and it’s really exciting to see a governor who is considered for president and not for prison,” Mitchell said, referring to the fact that two of Illinois’ last five governors and four of the last 11 have served time in prison.

“I think he would be excellent. Having said that, that’s why I’m so excited he’s running for reelection to continue the progress of the last seven years,” Mitchell added.

Though Mitchell hails from Chicago, Pritzker said he believes Mitchell can appropriately address the needs of all areas of the state.

“When you’re a state representative, you don’t just represent the people of your district; you are also voting on things that are good for people all across the state,” Pritzker told reporters last week after greeting Chicagoans at a Bronzeville coffee shop with Mitchell.

Policy goals

As deputy governor, Mitchell led some of Pritzker’s hallmark initiatives through the General Assembly during his first term: a $45 billion infrastructure plan, legalization of cannabis for recreational use by adults, and a climate initiative setting clean energy goals for the state.

Mitchell has a reputation as a hard-nosed negotiator, even among fellow Democrats. Though he has sometimes angered political allies, Mitchell said he’s open to listening to anyone’s ideas.

“For me, it’s build the biggest tent that you possibly can, ask people for their ideas and be willing to listen to them and change your mind when something is different than you thought it was,” Mitchell said. “That’s how Gov. Pritzker has always led, that’s how he has always directed me when I was deputy governor, that’s what we’ll do as partners in state government going forward.”

Economic affordability is a top concern for Pritzker, who has preached in national media interviews that Democrats must champion policies addressing cost-of-living concerns for Americans. Mitchell said he shares those goals.

“People want to know that you understand what’s going on in their lives, that you’re working on your behalf every single day and when you do things that they can see on their paycheck, in their pocketbook, that is how you inspire confidence and that is something I think we can do as statewide elected officials,” Mitchell said.

He acknowledged price concerns are a macroeconomic issue outside the state’s total control, but Mitchell said state lawmakers can promote policies that lower costs within the state’s control. Reducing the education system’s reliance on property taxes could be a priority in a third Pritzker administration.

“The governor has put ... hundreds of millions of new dollars into education every single year to help drive down that burden,” Mitchell said. “We do now need to work with our local governments to make sure those savings are being passed along. That’s another way in which you touch people’s pocketbooks directly.”

Mitchell said he sees some of the same themes surrounding affordability concerns for voters playing out in the 2026 election that helped Democrats win big victories in Illinois in 2018 when he was executive director of the Democratic Party of Illinois. Democrats swept races for statewide offices that year and gained supermajorities in the legislature that have remained strong since then.

Madigan ties and ethics reform 

Mike Madigan was chair of the state party while Mitchell worked as executive director. Madigan, the longtime speaker of the Illinois House until early 2021, was sentenced last month to 7 ½ years in federal prison for bribery and corruption.

Prosecutors accused Madigan of using his positions as House speaker, party chair and as partner in his real estate law firm as a “criminal enterprise” meant to maintain and increase his power while enriching his allies. He was not convicted of the overarching racketeering charge regarding the alleged “enterprise,” but was convicted on lesser bribery counts.

Mitchell took over the administrative reins of the party from Tim Mapes, Madigan’s trusted chief of staff who was accused in early 2018 of sexual harassment and bullying, who is now in prison for perjury.

Like many other Democrats, Mitchell said Illinois has moved beyond Madigan’s era and brand of politics.

“I think it’s important to take the message that not just voters but now a jury has sent, which is let’s make Illinois the most ethical state in the nation,” Mitchell said.

Mitchell argued that work started with the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act – the 2021 clean energy policy he led for the governor’s office. In addition to setting decarbonization goals, it also ended the formula rate system that was at the center of bribery allegations against Madigan and the electric utility Commonwealth Edison.

State lawmakers passed other ethics legislation in 2021 months after Madigan left Springfield and nearly a year before he would ever be charged with a crime. But the legislature has largely not dealt with the issue since then, even after Madigan was convicted early this year.

Mitchell said he and Pritzker would be open to any ethics proposals in the future.

July 4, 2025 | Screenshot from Detroit Police Facebook pageDetroit will be cracking down on juvenile curfew violations and ticketing parents who are not ensuring their children are staying out of trouble at night, Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison told reporters after shootings in the city over Fourth of July weekend left a teen dead, as well as injuring an officer and two-year-old boy.
On Saturday, the two-year-old was watching fireworks with his family at a home just before midnight when an altercation between juveniles at a park a block away escalated to shots being fired, with a stray bullet striking the toddler, according to the Detroit Police Department.
The toddler’s injuries were a temporary serious status, Bettison said following the Saturday shooting, but the incident will spark a crackdown on juveniles violating the city’s curfew.
“I’m appalled by it. I’m upset by it. And as a result, this department will definitely be stepping up our efforts tremendously when it comes to curfew violations,” Bettison said. “[I’m] definitely thanking God that the fact that this 2-year-old baby is going to be okay” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Detroit has a curfew of 10 p.m. for unaccompanied minors under the age of 16 to vacate public spaces such as playgrounds and an 11 p.m curfew for 16 and 17-year-olds. Parents that fail to ensure their child is accounted for past curfew will receive parental responsibility tickets, Bettison said.
Two juveniles are in custody in connection to the shooting, Bettison told media Sunday morning.
The police department is imploring parents to be vigilant of the whereabouts of their children and their access to firearms, Bettison told media the morning of the Fourth of July Friday following an altercation that left one officer shot and one teen dead.

Officers had been patrolling the city’s East side Thursday night in response to reports of breaking and entering, Bettison told members of the media Friday, when at around 10:30 p.m. officers observed three masked individuals by a building.
As officers detained one teenager, Bettison said two other individuals fled, one of whom, a 16-year-old boy, is alleged to have reached for a handgun and shot an officer in the hand. Officers then returned fire, killing the teen.
“I just need parents to really step up. At this time of night, our kids should not be out and they should not have handguns,” Bettison told members of the media Friday morning, asking for the public’s help in locating the third individual police encountered.
When asked by the media about his concerns that the city may be seeing an uptick in gun violence, Bettison said though gun violence is a national problem, the city is making improvements to address the issue.
Bettison noted that the city is seeing a 20% decline in homicides and a 30% decline in non-fatal shootings compared to last summer.
This time last year, Detroit saw a surge in summertime shootings as the result of illegal block parties. In the first week of July 2024 six such gatherings led to 27 people being shot.
These shootings in 2024 were coupled by a mass shooting at a Rochester Hills splash pad over Father’s Day weekend where seven adults and two children were shot by a gunman. All the victims survived their injuries and the gunman shot and killed himself during a police standoff.
Reflecting on the one-year anniversary of the shooting, Rochester Hills Mayor Bryan Barnett told WDIV-TV, that the violence of that June 15 day, which left children’s shoes and ice cream cones strewn across a children’s splash pad does not define the city, the community’s love for one another in the wake of tragedy does.
“I’m appreciative of so many people that have come together. Our community raised about a half a million dollars for these folks, but more so than that it was the chalking on the neighborhood streets, it was eight and nine-year-old girls putting a lemonade stand raising $32. It was the best of a community coming at the worst time a community’s ever experienced,” Barnett said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-07-142805.png,,,2025-07-07 15:10:22.837574

After bedtime, she may feed the baby a bottle or wake the mother to breastfeed. She soothes the infant back to sleep. Sometimes, she prepares meals for the family in a Crock-Pot or empties the dishwasher.
She leaves the following morning and returns, often nightly, for two or three weeks in a row.
“I’m certified to do all of it,” said Oliver, of Hardeeville, South Carolina, who runs Compassionate Care Doula Services. It takes a village to raise a child, as the adage goes, but “the village is not what it used to be,” Oliver said.
Doulas are trained to offer critical support for families — before delivery, during childbirth, and in those daunting early days when parents are desperate for sleep and infants still wake up around the clock.
While doulas typically don’t hold a medical or nursing degree, research shows they can improve health outcomes and reduce racial health disparities.
Yet their services remain out of reach for many families. Oliver charges $45 an hour overnight, and health insurance plans often don’t cover her fees.
That’s partly why business “ebbs and flows,” Oliver said. Sometimes, she’s fully booked for months. Other times, she goes several weeks without a client.
That may change.
Two bipartisan bills, introduced in separate chambers of the South Carolina General Assembly, would require both Medicaid, which pays for more than half of all births in the state, and private insurers to cover the cost of doula services for patients who choose to use one.
South Carolina isn’t an outlier.
Even as states brace for significant reductions in federal Medicaid funding over the next decade, legislatures across the country continue to pass laws that grant doula access to Medicaid beneficiaries. Some state laws already require private health insurers to do the same.
Since the start of 2025, Vermont lawmakers, alongside Republican-controlled legislatures in Arkansas, Utah, Louisiana, and Montana, have passed laws to facilitate Medicaid coverage of doula services.
All told, more than 30 states are reimbursing doulas through Medicaid or are implementing laws to do so.
Notably, these coverage requirements align with one of the goals of Project 2025, whose “Mandate for Leadership” report, published in 2023 by the conservative Heritage Foundation, offered a blueprint for President Donald Trump’s second term.
The document calls for increasing access to doulas “for all women whether they are giving birth in a traditional hospital, through midwifery, or at home,” citing concerns about maternal mortality and postpartum depression, which may be “worsened by poor birth experiences.”
The report also recommends that federal money not be used to train doctors, nurses, or doulas to perform abortions.
The Heritage Foundation did not respond to an interview request.
Meanwhile, the idea that doulas can benefit babies, parents, and state Medicaid budgets by reducing costly cesarean sections and preterm birth complications is supported by a growing body of research and is gaining traction among conservatives.
A study published last year in the American Journal of Public Health found that women enrolled in Medicaid who used a doula faced a 47% lower risk of delivering by C-section and a 29% lower risk of preterm birth. They were also 46% more likely to attend a postpartum check-up.
“Why wouldn’t you want somebody to avail themselves of that type of care?” said Republican state Rep. Tommy Pope, who co-sponsored the doula reimbursement bill in the South Carolina House of Representatives. “I don’t see any reason we shouldn’t be doing that.”

Pope, R-York, said his daughter-in-law gave birth with the assistance of a doula.
“It opened my eyes to the positive aspects,” said the House speaker pro tempore.
Amy Chen, a senior attorney with the National Health Law Program, which tracks doula reimbursement legislation around the country as part of its Doula Medicaid Project, said lawmakers tend to support these efforts when they have a personal connection to the issue.
“It’s something that a lot of people resonate with,” Chen said, “even if they, themselves, have never been pregnant.”
Conservative lawmakers who endorse state-level abortion bans, she said, often vote in favor of measures that support pregnancy, motherhood, and infant health, all of which these doula
reimbursement bills are intended to do.
Some Republicans feel like “they have to come out in favor of that,” Chen said.
Health care research also suggests that Black patients, who suffer significantly higher maternal and infant mortality rates than white patients, may particularly benefit from doula care. In 2022, Black infants in South Carolina were more than twice as likely to die from all causes before their first birthday as white infants.
That holds true for women in rural parts of the country where labor and delivery services have either closed or never existed.
That’s why Montana lawmakers passed a doula reimbursement bill this year — to narrow health care gaps for rural and Indigenous communities. To that end, in 2023, the state enacted a bill that requires Medicaid to reimburse midwives for home births.
Montana state Sen. Mike Yakawich, a Republican who backed the Democratic-sponsored doula reimbursement bill, said pregnant women should have someone to call outside of a hospital, where
health care services can be costly and intimidating.
“What help can we provide for moms who are expecting? My feeling is, it’s never enough,” Yakawich said.
Britney WolfVoice lives on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in southeastern Montana, about two hours away from the closest birthing hospital. In early July, she was seven months pregnant with her fourth child, a son, and said she planned to have a doula by her side for the second time in the delivery room.
During WolfVoice’s last pregnancy, an Indigenous doula named Misty Pipe brought cedar oil and spray into the delivery room, rubbed WolfVoice’s back through contractions, and helped ensure
WolfVoice’s husband was the first person their daughter saw.
“Being in a hospital, I felt heard for the very first time,” WolfVoice said. “I just can’t explain it any better than I felt at home. She was my safe place.”
Pipe said hospitals are still associated with the government forcibly removing children from Native American homes as a consequence of colonization. Her goal is to help give people a voice during their pregnancy and delivery.
Most of her clients can’t afford to pay for doula services out-of-pocket, Pipe said, so she doesn’t charge anything for her birth services, balancing her role as a doula with her day job at a post office.
“If a mom is vulnerable, she could miss a prenatal appointment or go alone, or I can take time off of work and take her myself,” Pipe said. “No mom should have to birth in fear.”
The new state law will allow her to get paid for her work as a doula for the first time.
In some states that have enacted such laws, initial participation by doulas was low because Medicaid reimbursement rates weren’t high enough. Nationally, doula reimbursement rates are improving, Chen said.
For example, in Minnesota, where in 2013 lawmakers passed one of the first doula reimbursement bills, Medicaid initially paid only $411 per client for their services. Ten years later, the state had raised the reimbursement rate to a maximum of $3,200 a client.
But Chen said it is unclear how federal Medicaid cuts may affect the fate of these state laws.
Some states that haven’t passed doula reimbursement bills, including South Carolina, may be hesitant to do so in this environment, she said. “It’s just a really uncertain time.”

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks instituted additional hoot-owl restrictions on stretches of the Madison River and Sun River last week, in response to warm temperatures and low streamflows across the state.
The fishing restriction prohibit angling on the designated stretches of river from 2 p.m. to midnight each day, and will remain in place until conditions improve.
Hoot-owl restrictions are already in place on the upper Madison River above Hebgen Lake, and the additional restrictions implemented last week include the lower Madison River from Warm Springs BLM day-use area downstream to confluence with the Jefferson River near Three Forks.
On the Sun River, the restrictions are in place from the mouth of Muddy Creek to the Highway 287 Bridge.
To check for other restrictions, click here.
In accordance with the department’s drought policy, FWP institutes angling restrictions when streamflows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.
The restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when water temperatures warm, and can help reduce catch-and-release mortality by restricting fishing to only cool morning hours.
Catch-and-release anglers can reduce stress on fish by getting them to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.
As the summer warms, Montana offers many other angling options with better conditions for fish, including larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation lakes and streams.
Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors stream flows and in some streams holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

(Photo courtesy of Commonwealth Media Services)Gov. Josh Shapiro is criticizing Pennsylvania Republicans who voted in favor of the reconciliation bill signed into law late last week by President Donald Trump, saying the commonwealth “got screwed.”
“It breaks my heart after all the progress we’ve made that the federal government, with one vote, ripped a good chunk of that away,” he said. “I hope that the representatives wake up and see the negative impact that they are having on our commonwealth.”
Speaking in York Monday, Shapiro said the consequences of the vote, “to give a tax cut to those at the highest income brackets and pay for it by slashing Medicaid and SNAP and harming rural hospitals,” hang on the commonwealth’s nine House members and GOP U.S. Senator Dave McCormick for their action.
“They knew what they were voting for. They voted for it,” he said. “Pennsylvania can’t backfill this. We don’t have the money to do it. I warned these members of Congress that we couldn’t do it, and so the cuts that are about to come are coming as a direct result of how your federal representatives voted here.”
“They’re taking billions of dollars away from Pennsylvania, and we can’t make up for that,” he added.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The governor warned the commonwealth’s rural hospitals could be atrisk, since the measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid. According to an analysis by the nonprofit health policy group KFF, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states. 
“We have about 25 rural hospitals that are both working with an operating deficit, where about 50% or more of their revenues are coming from public payer, right, coming from Medicaid,” he said. “If you’re already facing a deficit and your Medicaid is being slashed, we estimate that there’s about 25 rural hospitals that are likely to shutter in the next few years because of this.” 
The state Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage. Some 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases.
But, Rep. Dan Meuser (R-09), who is considering a run for governor next year, said the new law strengthens Medicaid “for those it was intended to support.”
“It includes common-sense work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents, removes individuals who are ineligible under the law from the rolls, and, beginning in October 2026, it ends the federal cost-share for states that choose to include illegal immigrants in their Medicaid programs,” he said in a statement. “It also delivers support for rural health care, creating a $50 billion fund to help rural hospitals and ensure continued access to care.”
According to the Associated Press, advocates for rural hospitals warn the funds won’t make up for the shortage. A recent American Hospital Association report found in 2023, hospitals received nearly $28 billion less from Medicaid than the actual cost of treating Medicaid patients.

North Carolina was rocked by a political earthquake this past week when its senior U.S. Senator, Republican Thom Tillis, broke with President Donald Trump and then announced that he will not seek reelection in 2026. Tillis’s announcement – which came on the heels of his decision to oppose Trump’s hugely controversial omnibus budget bill – initiated a chain of events that has just begun to play out both in Washington and here in North Carolina.
So, what will this chain look like? How will Tillis approach his final 18 months in the Senate? Who are the candidates likely to be throwing their hats in the ring to succeed Tillis? And who among them are best positioned to capture the Republican and Democratic nominations?

Thomas Barwick/Getty ImagesThe giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)A growing number of firearms are being stolen from parked cars, especially in urban areas, according to a new report that highlights a frequently overlooked source of illegally circulating guns.
The nonpartisan think tank Council on Criminal Justice released an analysis examining five years of gun theft data reported to law enforcement in 16 cities — both urban and rural — with populations over 250,000. The analysis found that while the overall rate of reported gun thefts remained steady between 2018 and 2022, gun thefts from motor vehicles rose sharply.
The number of guns reported stolen from vehicles increased by 31% over the five-year period, while gun thefts during burglaries of homes and businesses fell by 40%. In large urban areas, the overall gun theft rate jumped by 42% between 2018 and 2022, while rural areas saw a 22% decline
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

The findings are based on data from more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies across the country that consistently submitted detailed crime reports to the FBI’s National Incident-Based Reporting System between 2018 and 2022. Together, those agencies represent about 25% of the U.S. population and 12% of all law enforcement agencies nationwide.
As gun violence continues to grip communities across the country, a growing body of research suggests that firearm theft — particularly from vehicles — is a key, but often overlooked, source of weapons used in crimes. While research remains limited, some studies show stolen guns are disproportionately recovered at crime scenes, and gun violence tends to rise in areas where thefts have occurred.
Yet national data on gun theft remains sparse and there is no nationwide system for tracking stolen guns. Even basic details — such as how many guns are taken in each reported incident — are often missing from official police reports.
With crime and firearm policy high on the Trump administration’s agenda, experts say more research is urgently needed to understand how stolen guns fuel broader cycles of violence.
“We really don’t have a full national picture of stolen guns,” said Susan Parker, one of the report’s authors and a research assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern University. “It’s really difficult to think about prevention when you don’t know much.”
The report’s findings suggest that parked cars have become a major weak point in firearm security — one that could be addressed through policy, public education and better data collection.
Some states, including Colorado and Delaware, have recently passed laws requiring firearms stored in vehicles to be locked in secure containers. In recent years, several other states have considered similar measures, including legislation mandating safe storage and stricter reporting requirements for lost or stolen guns.










Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles.


– Susan Parker, research assistant professor at Northwestern University



	Currently, just 16 states and the District of Columbia require gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms to law enforcement, according to the Giffords Law Center, a nonpartisan gun safety group.
“Where you store your gun really matters. We see that so many of the guns that are stolen are increasingly from vehicles,” Parker said. “That kind of shift in how we’re carrying guns should also maybe be accompanied by shifts in how we’re thinking about keeping them safe and out of the risk of being misused.”
Among the 16 cities included in the report, Memphis, Tennessee, had the highest rate of gun thefts in 2022 — 546 reported incidents per 100,000 residents. That’s nearly double the rate in Detroit, which ranked second at 297 per 100,000, and more than 10 times higher than in Seattle, which had the lowest rate at 44 per 100,000.
Kansas City, Missouri, had the third-highest rate at 234 per 100,000, followed by Milwaukee, at 219 per 100,000, and Nashville, Tennessee, at 210 per 100,000.
While residences remained the most common place guns were stolen from overall, the share of gun thefts occurring in parking lots, garages and on roads rose significantly. By 2022, 40% of all reported gun thefts involved a vehicle, up from 31% in 2018.
Vehicle break-ins resulting in stolen firearms nearly doubled in urban areas — from 37 per 100,000 people in 2018 to 65 per 100,000 people in 2022.
As parked vehicles have become a more frequent target for thieves, the locations of those thefts have shifted. In 2018, about half of all reported gun thefts from vehicles occurred at residences. By 2022, that share had dropped to roughly 40%, while thefts from vehicles in parking lots and garages rose by 76%. The report also found significant increases in gun thefts from vehicles on roads, highways and alleys — up 59% over the five-year period.
In the most rural areas, where gun ownership is often more common, the share of vehicle break-ins that resulted in gun theft rose from 18% to 24%. In urban areas, that figure increased from 6% to 10.5%.

The tree’s trunk is so large that a whole class of professor Ann Fisher-Wirth’s honors students could barely fit their linked arms around it.
In her poem, “Catalpa,” Fisher-Wirth imagines the ancient tree as a sapling, and her “mind enters a great quiet.” 
She sees the tree through Mississippi history: the Depression, yellow fever, the burning of Oxford during the Civil War. She meditates on the lichen on the catalpa’s bark and the hollow in its trunk, and she ends the poem imploring, “turn around, and look at the tree.”
Fisher-Wirth, whose poem “Catalpa” appeared in the 2023 collection “Paradise is Jagged,” recently began her four-year term as Mississippi’s poet laureate, nominated by other writers and leaders of cultural agencies and appointed by Gov. Tate Reeves. Her outreach will invite the state’s residents to create and appreciate poetry together.
“In Mississippi, people have amazing stories,” Fisher-Wirth said in an interview. “And I would welcome to hear some of those stories.”
Fisher-Wirth directed the University of Mississippi’s environmental studies program and taught creative writing in its Master of Fine Arts program before she retired in 2022. She is a past president of the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment, and is a senior fellow of the Black Earth Institute, which concentrates on social justice and environmental issues.
Fisher-Wirth has written eight books of poetry. Her writing centers on place and humans’ connection to nature. 
Her responsibilities as poet laureate include creating poetry and reading poetry at state events. She will also spearhead initiatives that engage the public with poetry.
Fisher-Wirth plans to start a podcast called “The Favorite Poem Project,” where she and fellow Mississippians will read and discuss their favorite poems. A written version of “The Favorite Poem Project” will be published as a column in the Clarion Ledger.
Fisher-Wirth also hopes to continue the Mississippi Poetry Project, started by her predecessor, Catherine Pierce. Each year, K-12 students write poems that respond to a prompt from the poet laureate. Last year’s prompt centered on students’ dreams and wishes.
Fisher-Wirth often writes on seeing and listening to the world. Her poems contemplate natural scenes — such as a lone zinnia near a pond or a stag eating flowers over a raw grave.
“We are absolutely embedded in an interrelationship with the environment,” she said. “We can’t live without this world that we find ourselves in.” 
In Fisher-Wirth’s perspective, “paying attention” invites a positive relationship with the nonhuman world. She explained that awareness of the trees in our yard, the types of fish that we catch, the birds that come in the winter and the people who grow our food all shows care to nature.
“A lot of people already have a lot of environmental knowledge,” Fisher-Wirth said. “But this is just a way to kind of bring that forward.” 
She is in the “very, very beginning stages” of a project of collective poetry writing. She hopes to collaborate with residents of Mississippi towns to write poetry fragments about their communities. Eventually, each town’s fragments will be woven into a single poem that represents the town.
At present, she is recovering from a second hip replacement surgery. 
“Nothing can start until I’m back on my feet,” Fisher-Wirth said. 
She said art, including poetry, is “the vital lifeblood of a culture.” Poetry is one way of paying attention. Fisher-Wirth, who has edited two ecopoetry collections, writes primarily about place and is eager to hear Mississippi stories.
“I think poetry is a great way to move people’s hearts and awaken their senses, and just open the world in them,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/01164721/Ann-Fisher-Wirth.jpg,,,2025-07-07 14:18:00.483376

(Photo by Brenda Bazán/For The Texas Tribune)For the last three days, state Rep. Wes Virdell has been out with first responders in Kerr County as they searched for victims and survivors from the devastating floods that swept through Central Texas early Friday morning.
“All the focus right now is let’s save all the lives we can,” Virdell, who was still on the scene in Kerrville, told The Texas Tribune on Sunday.
Virdell’s closeup view of the havoc wreaked on his district has made a lasting impression, he said, and left him reconsidering a vote he made just a few months ago against a bill that would have established a statewide plan to improve Texas’ disaster response, including better alert systems, along with a grant program for counties to buy new emergency communication equipment and build new infrastructure like radio towers.
“I can tell you in hindsight, watching what it takes to deal with a disaster like this, my vote would probably be different now,” said Virdell, a freshman GOP lawmaker from Brady.
The measure, House Bill 13, would have created a new government council to establish the emergency response plan and administer the grant program, both of which would have been aimed at facilitating better communication between first responders. The bill also called for the plan to include “the use of outdoor warning sirens,” like those used in tornado-prone Texas counties, and develop new “emergency alert systems.”
Authored by Rep. Ken King, R-Canadian, the legislation was inspired by last year’s devastating wildfires in the Panhandle, where more than 1 million acres burned — including part of King’s property — and three people died. The bill failed in the Texas Senate, prompting newfound questions about whether lawmakers should have done more to help rural, cash-strapped counties stave off the deadly effects of future natural disasters.
As of Sunday evening, at least 79 people had died in the floods. Of those, 68 were in Kerr County, many of them camping or attending a private summer camp along the Guadalupe River.
Virdell, a Hill Country native who lives about 100 miles away, made his way to Kerrville early Friday after seeing news that rains raised the Guadalupe more than two feet, swamping its banks in Hunt and other river communities that host thousands of holiday vacationers.
He stressed an alarm system may not have helped much in this instance because the floodwaters came so quickly. Between 2 and 7 a.m., the Guadalupe River in Kerrville rose from 1 to more than 34 feet in height, according to a flood gauge in the area.
“I don’t think there was enough evidence to even suspect something like this was going to happen,” he said. ”I think even if you had a warning system there, this came in so fast and early in the morning it’s very unlikely the warning system would have had much effect.”
Virdell said he doesn’t recall the specifics of the bill or why he opposed it, though he guessed ”it had to do with how much funding” was tied to the measure.
Even if it had passed, it would not have gone into effect until Sept. 1, after the Hill Country flooding.
The bill’s initial $500 million cost drew heavy criticism from fellow Republicans including state Rep. Tony Tinderholt, R-Arlington.
“This shouldn’t be about anything other than the fact that it’s a half a billion dollars,” Tinderholt, a hardline conservative and budget hawk, said during the April 1 House floor debate. “This is probably one of the most simple votes we should be able to take today. It’s that this interoperability council is going to spend money to try and get these departments to be able to talk together.”
Steven Aranyi, a spokesperson for Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, noted that lawmakers — including the Texas Senate, which Patrick oversees — made several “unprecedented” investments in disaster response during this year’s legislative session, totaling $547 million. That included:

$257 million for disaster response aircraft,
$135 million for regional operation facilities,
$90 million to provide ambulances to rural counties,
$65 million for emergency response drone technology.

The flaw with HB 13, Aranyi said, was that it proposed rolling out the local grant money over an estimated timeline of up to 10 years.
“By the time any system was developed, it would be outdated due to advances in technology,” Aranyi said. “The grants in the bill were limited to planning purposes only; they did not support disaster response.”
As the disaster quickly unfolded in Kerr County, located in the heart of an area known for flash floods, much has been made of the fact that the county lacked a siren system that counties in other parts of Texas have to alert residents of tornadoes. Such a system has been considered before in Kerr County, but quickly dismissed because the high cost would fall alone on local taxpayers.
A flash flood watch was issued by the National Weather Service by Thursday afternoon for the region. Then, in the middle of the night, at 1:14 a.m. Friday, a flash food warning was issued as possibly “catastrophic,” for Bandera and Kerr Counties, according to the NWS. Those alerts would have automatically triggered Wireless Emergency Alerts on enabled mobile devices, the weather service said.
But because the alerts went out when most residents and visitors were asleep, coupled with the fact that many of those children attending summer camp as well as their counselors were without cell phones, the alerts likely went unheeded by many.
Residents who were up before daylight on Friday 4 reported rain misting by 3 a.m. but nothing out of the ordinary. That changed quickly by 5 a.m. Friday when flooding was detected on roadways in Kerr County.
The flooding reached its peak at around 6:45 a.m. in Kerrville, hours after warnings were first issued, according to the local flood gauge.
Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly told reporters on Saturday local residents have rejected the idea of a siren system due to its expense when it had been suggested before.
“The public reeled at the cost,” Kelly said.
At a news conference on Sunday, Gov. Greg Abbott left the door open to legislation aimed at improving emergency warning systems, but stopped short of saying he would put it on the agenda for lawmakers to consider during the special session he has scheduled to begin July 21.
“It’s going to be something that will be looked at,” Abbott said. “The reality also is this, and that is, what’s needed in that river basin at that location could be far different than it was needed in some other river basin across the state.”
For now, Virdell said his focus and that of officials in Kerr County is on locating more victims and helping residents. He said the collaboration between local responders and those others coming in from around the state has been “amazing.”
Talk of warning systems and how to improve communications will eventually happen, Virdell said, adding that, right now, the focus needs to be on the immediate community.
“That’s the No. 1 priority for now,” he said.

“Michigan man dead after firing at U.S. Border Patrol station in South Texas” was first published by The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan media organization that informs Texans — and engages with them — about public policy, politics, government and statewide issues.

McALLEN — A Michigan man is dead after opening fire on a U.S. Border Patrol station in McAllen, Texas early Monday morning, injuring one McAllen police officer.
McAllen police responded to the scene shortly before 6 a.m., where the shooter, Ryan Louis Mosqueda — believed to be 27 or 28 years old — attacked the federal building with an assault rifle. U.S. Border Patrol agents returned fire, killing the suspect.
Ismael Garcia, a 10-year veteran with the McAllen police who responded to the scene, was struck in the knee during the shootout and is in recovery, Chief Victor Rodriguez said during a news conference Monday.
“Incidents like these make us realize that we’ve to always be on guard to keep our community safe,” Rodriguez said.
Law enforcement on the scene found additional assault weapons and ammunition in the vehicle Mosqueda drove to the scene. Spray-painted writing was also found on the side of the vehicle but Rodriguez could not provide details of the lettering and said it is not known if it’s connected to the attack.
Mosqueda is believed to have some ties to the community as he was reported missing from a Weslaco address, about 18 miles east of McAllen, at 4 a.m., though Rodriguez could not disclose the nature of those ties.
Rodriguez said a motive for the attack remains unknown and declined to call the attack an act of terrorism, saying not enough information is available. However, the FBI will now lead the investigation as the incident involved an attack on federal officers and a federal building.
Flights at the nearby McAllen International Airport were delayed for several hours as law enforcement secured the area.

Wray, a 10-term Democrat from Northampton County, lost the House District 27 Democratic primary last year to Rep. Rodney Pierce of Halifax County by 34 votes. Pierce faced no general election opponent. 
Wray challenged the election results, but all three counties in the district — Warren, Halifax, and Northampton — dismissed his protests. 
Wray’s decision to run sets up a likely rematch with Pierce, who plans to seek a second term.

Wray was one of the Democrats who voted most often with Republicans. He voted with Republicans to override 14 of former Gov. Roy Cooper’s 25 vetoes in the 2023-24 session, one of a handful of Democrats to do so. 
Wray’s voting record was an issue in the primary campaign. A conservative group with ties to former House Speaker Tim Moore and a PAC that supports House Republicans sent mailers supporting Wray and Rep. Cecil Brockman (D-Guilford).
Wray said in a statement he was effective in bringing state funds for projects and programs to the district.
“I am not going to apologize for working in the back rooms of the State Legislature to make sure that our region gets money from the state budget,” Wray said in a statement. “Meanwhile, my opponent hasn’t passed a single bill or gotten a single penny for our district.”
The General Assembly has not passed a budget for the current fiscal year, so no area outside the counties hurt by Helene has received money for projects or programs. 
Pierce said in an interview that “people will see that I’ve been a more responsive and authentic representative of District 27” in speaking out against legislation that will hurt constituents.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Newsmakers)The Indiana Supreme Court on Monday tentatively scheduled an Oct. 10 execution date for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward, but acknowledged they “lack the parties’ insight into … the next steps in the judicial and executive branch process that are specific to Ward if an execution date is set.”
In a five-page order, the high court justices said they were fulfilling an “administrative task” in setting the tentative date, but quoted a request from Ward to delay the case due to “serious questions and concerns about whether the State of Indiana can carry out his execution in a constitutionally permissible manner.”
In recent cases, they have not used the term tentative in setting a date.
“We are mindful … that after we perform our administrative task of setting an execution date, other state and federal officials must work backwards from that date to fulfill their own important duties related to an ordered execution,” wrote Chief Justice Loretta Rush.
Story continues below.
Order – Briefing schedule
 
Ward’s execution, if approved, would be the third in Indiana since December 2024, following a 15‑year hiatus. Joseph Corcoran was executed by lethal injection in December under former Gov. Eric Holcomb, and Benjamin Ritchie followed in May 2025 under new Gov. Mike Braun. Both executions used a single‐drug protocol of pentobarbital.
But Braun said recently that Indiana does not currently have usable lethal injection drugs and that he does not plan to buy more until lawmakers debate the issue during the 2026 legislative session.

In June, the governor further disclosed that state officials spent $1.175 million on lethal injection doses over the past year — $600,000 of which was spent on drugs that expired before use.
The Indiana Attorney General’s Office filed a motion on June 27 to set an execution date for Ward, who was sentenced to death in 2007 for the 2001 rape and murder of 15-year-old Stacy Payne in Spencer County. The state argues Ward has exhausted all appeals and no legal stays remain in place.
Ward’s attorneys pushed back, however, asking the court for additional time to respond, citing pending public records requests to the Department of Correction for information about the drugs Indiana plans to use in future executions. The defense also pointed to witness accounts from Benjamin Ritchie’s execution in May, where observers said Ritchie “violently” lifted his head and shoulders off the gurney during the procedure.
“The witness accounts are consistent with accounts from other executions where, like Indiana, a single drug — pentobarbital — has been used to carry out the execution and are indicative of potential problems with the execution,” Deputy Public Defender Laura Volk wrote in the July 2 filing. “Given these accounts, Ward has serious questions and concerns about whether the State of Indiana can carry out his execution in a constitutionally permissible manner.”
The state objected to the delay, arguing that the only issue before the court is whether an execution date must be set as required under state law: “Whatever information [Ward] gleans from any response to those [public records] requests is only relevant to potential future litigation and entirely irrelevant to the substance of the State’s request,” the state wrote in its response.
The court sided with the state in part, saying that although concerns about drug protocols are valid, they must be addressed in a separate legal proceeding. Still, Rush noted that the setting of an execution date often prompts a wave of related litigation, clemency requests and logistical planning.
Indiana seeks execution date for death row inmate Roy Lee Ward

 
Per the court’s order. Ward’s legal team has until July 30 to file its response to the state’s motion. The state has until Aug. 11 for a subsequent reply. Rush said in Monday’s order that a final execution date remains pending until the court issues a definitive ruling.
Ward’s case has spanned over two decades. His initial conviction and death sentence were overturned due to concerns about pretrial publicity, but a second jury sentenced him to death again in 2007 after he pleaded guilty. His appeals concluded in 2017.
Court records indicate Ward attacked Payne after she answered the door of her Dale, Indiana, home shortly after noon on July 11, 2001. Her younger sister heard screams and called 911. Police arrived within minutes and found Ward standing in the doorway of the home, holding a knife. He was arrested at the scene. 
Payne, an honor roll student, later died from severe injuries.

(Getty Images)Medicaid officials are moving quickly to expand statewide a managed care pilot project for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities championed by Miami Republican and House Speaker Daniel Perez.
The Agency for Health Care Administration last week solicited public input on the proposed changes to the Medicaid managed care program for people with these disabilities (sometimes called “IDD”) through July 31. The state is required to give the public 30 days to comment before sending the changes to the federal government for approval. No changes can take place until the federal government agrees.
Florida requires most Medicaid beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans. The managed care mandate doesn’t apply to people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. The home- and community-based services those beneficiaries require are delivered through what’s called the Medicaid iBudget program. But the iBudget program has long waiting lists and traditionally has been underfunded.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2023, then-speaker designate Perez pushed for a managed care pilot program designed to provide care for up to 600 individuals in Medicaid regions D and I, who were on the iBudget wait list. Medicaid Regions D and I serve Hillsborough, Polk, Manatee, Hardee, Highlands, Miami-Dade, and Monroe counties.
As of July 7, 378  people were enrolled in the IDD managed care pilot project, said Carol Gormley, vice president for government affairs for Independent Living Systems. That is the parent company of Florida Community Care, the state-contracted managed care plan that operates the program.
The policy update reflects changes contained in HB 1103, which Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last month.
The new law lifts the 600-person cap on the IDD managed care pilot program effective on Oct. 1, expanding enrollment statewide for qualifying disabled people on the wait list. Some 21,000-plus people are on the waitlist, according to a legislative analysis.
Effective in July 2026, people enrolled in the iBudget program can switch to the IDD managed care program if they choose. So can people with IDD who are enrolled in a different Medicaid managed-care program known as the Statewide Medicaid Managed Care long-term care program.
There are mixed feelings in the IDD community about the expansion of the program.
Valerie Breen, executive director of the Florida Developmental Disabilities Council, told the Florida Phoenix that there hasn’t been enough experience with the pilot program to take it statewide.
“[The] council believes there should be more data before it goes statewide. In addition, we believe that people should have the ability to choose their long-term support and services,” Breen said. She added, “Communication and choices and understanding what they are going to get and what they are going to give up will be essential.”
The Arc of Florida, though, doesn’t oppose statewide expansion of the pilot program because enrollment in it isn’t mandatory, former ARC executive director Alan Abramowitz told the Florida Phoenix in May.

The report is entitled “North Carolina’s Missing Voters,” and it finds that these nonvoters — nearly 20% of the state’s estimated 8 million eligible voters — are more likely to be young, Black, or Latino.
What’s more, the report finds that the current situation is largely the result of a series of intentional policy choices made by Republican legislators that were designed to discourage voting by young people and people of color whom they fear will favor candidates from other parties.

Workers covered the sign at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport Wednesday night with a replacement bearing the moniker Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier publicly rolled out two weeks ago, when he announced plans for the facility, according to a photo published in the Miami Herald. Uthemeier announced Wednesday that hundreds of immigrants were set to arrive that night.
“It’s definitely our official title,” said Bryan Griffin, the governor’s communications director, to reporters on Wednesday morning. But immigrant and environmental advocates and indigenous leaders have criticized the name.
During President Donald Trump’s visit to the detention center on Tuesday, Uthmeier told the president he’d been inspired by his quest to reopen California’s Alcatraz Island, which served as a maximum-security prison from 1934 to 1963 and is now a public historical landmark.
Trump applauded the name when he visited the detention center on Tuesday, and the press release announcing the presidential tour had “Alligator Alcatraz” in the dateline.
“It’s known as Alligator Alcatraz, which is very appropriate because I looked outside, and that’s not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon,” Trump said. “But very soon, this facility will house some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet.”

While the identities of those who arrived at the detention center Wednesday night is not yet known, approximately 71% of immigrants detained nationwide have had no criminal record, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.
The rebranding of the airport prompted the Republican Party of Florida to sell shirts, beverage coolers, hats, and mugs, and the official U.S. Department of Homeland Security and White House X accounts have posted AI-generated images of alligators wearing “ICE” hats.
Both the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida have denounced the opening of the detention center. William “Popeye” Osceola, secretary of the Miccosukee Tribe, said he considered the portrayal of alligators and pythons as guards to the detention center as contradictory to the environmental harms.
“It’s just, again, not an accurate framing of the actual issues out there, and, you know, adding more stress to this ecology that’s not gonna help anything when we still need a lot more resources to address what’s going on out there,” he said. “People aren’t gonna be aware of that because they’re gonna be focused on this idea of like, ‘Oh Alligator Alcatraz, what a fun name.’”
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, called the merch ugly and criticized the media’s adoption of the DeSantis administration-given name.
“It’s like a cartoonish name that’s supposed to sort of normalize the center, diminish its negative impact in the minds of the public while also associating immigrants with crime through the name Alcatraz — which in Americana and history is associated with one of the most nefarious prisons in American history,” Kennedy said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
“So, I do think the name is regrettable, and so many people just kind of regurgitate it.”
Responding to a suit filed in federal court to halt the detention center, the federal government tried to distance itself and referred to the site as the temporary detention center or TNT Detention Facility.
Elise Bennett an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups suing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, said her group opposes the harm to the environment in the Big Cypress National Preserve.
“The name itself really shows that this is a political stunt,” she told the Phoenix.

Cristo Rey in Sunland Park, New Mexico, as seen from a U.S. Customs and Border Protection helicopter on Dec. 14, 2021. (Justin Hamel for Texas Tribune and Source NM)Las Cruces Catholic leadership says it will continue to oppose a proposed border wall across Mount Cristo Rey in Sunland Park, as federal officials move to fast-track construction.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Cruces owns 200 acres on the mountain situated in the Chihuahua Desert at the junction between Texas, New Mexico and Mexico, topped by a 29-foot tall limestone statue of Jesus Christ on the cross. The statue, installed in 1939, draws thousands of people every year in pilgrimage.
A U.S. Customs and Border Protection proposal to construct a 1.3-mile steel wall across the mountain’s southern flank drew condemnation from conservation groups last week, who said it would worsen migrant deaths, erosion and habitat losses.
Granting federal entry onto the land would deter migrants and pilgrims from exercising their faith, the diocese said in a statement provided by their attorney Kathryn Brack Morrow late Friday.
“The erection of a border wall through or along this holy site could irreparably damage its religious and cultural sanctity, obstruct pilgrimage routes, and transform the sacred space into a symbol of division,” the statement read.
Advocates: Mount Cristo Rey wall will worsen migrant deaths, erosion, habitat loss

In June, the Department of Homeland Security announced a slate of projects to “close critical gaps in the border wall and enhance border security operations” in the border areas of El Paso, Tucson and Yuma. Secretary Kristi Noem waived federal environment and water laws to speed up border wall construction projects, including the 12 miles between Santa Teresa and Mount Cristo Rey.
Public comment on the project closed July 3.
The U.S. The Department of Justice made multiple requests in the last several months to access land owned by the church for a series of border wall proposals, according to the statement.
The diocese said it has “respectfully but firmly urged,” the federal government to exclude the area from planning, surveying and construction.
“Any federal action to seize this land, construct physical barriers, or impede access to Mount Cristo Rey would constitute a significant infringement on religious freedom and the rights of worship, which are protected under both the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA),” the statement read.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”



An unsettled situation in North Carolina
While North Carolina is clearly among the states that will have to grapple with the impact of Medicaid cuts, state leaders have given little indication of their intentions at this point. On July 3, Gov. Josh Stein issued a statement condemning the cuts in the congressional mega-bill and pledging to work to limit their impact in his state.
The North Carolina Healthcare Association, which represent the state’s hospitals, issued a statement saying it, “will work closely with state lawmakers to find solutions that preserve access to care for North Carolinians and continue to engage with our members of Congress to ensure they understand the impact these cuts will have on our state’s Medicaid program”
Whether lawmakers will tackle the issue when they return to Raleigh the week of July 28, however, remains uncertain. For his part, the General Assembly’s most powerful leader, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) wrote on Facebook that he supports the federal legislation and that “the legislature will work through any implementation issues.”

Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.

“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Courtesy of Tyson Logan)It was a few minutes before 11 p.m. on a warm June night when a driver called 911 from U.S. Route 70, the long stretch of highway that connects Las Cruces to Alamogordo and White Sands National Park. The driver spotted someone walking along the median; a deputy with the Otero County Sheriff’s Office took the call.
In about 30 minutes, Deputy Jacob Diaz-Austin arrived in his patrol car. Elijah Hadley, a 17-year-old boy who was a registered member of the Mescalero Apache Tribe, waved a shirt in greeting and kept walking in the median, toward the deputy’s vehicle. Diaz-Austin told Hadley to stop, and he did, holding his right hand over his eyes to shield them from the deputy’s harsh lights.
“Let me see your other hand, bro,” Diaz-Austin called out to Hadley. “Let me see your other hand, dog.”

Hadley extended his other arm, which loosely held a BB gun that was styled like a pistol and pointed it at the ground. When Diaz-Austin told him to drop it, Hadley promptly threw it into thick brush in the median. That was when Diaz-Austin pulled his trigger four times, according to a new lawsuit filed by Hadley’s family. Hadley fell onto the road, screaming. As his blood spilled onto the hot blacktop, he called out “It’s just a BB gun” and “I’m dying.” The deputy continued to demand that the boy show his hands. Despite the pain, Hadley continued to comply.
After three-and-a-half minutes passed, the lawsuit says, Diaz-Austin opened fire again, this time shooting Hadley 14 times. As Hadley’s now-limp body sat on the highway, the suit says, Diaz-Austin reloaded his service weapon and fired another four shots into the boy’s back. All told, he shot him 22 times.
Later, when a sergeant with the Otero County Sheriff’s Office reviewed the shooting, he decided that Diaz-Austin had “complied with the county’s policies and training,” the lawsuit says. Nonetheless, Diaz-Austin was charged with first-degree murder in January. The civil suit brought in June by Hadley’s family seeks compensation for physical and emotional pain and suffering and the “value of Hadley’s life apart from his earnings.” The family’s attorneys filed the suit in federal court and are seeking an unspecified amount of punitive damages.
Hadley’s death “highlights the contrast between the public, who believe that calling the police is a way to keep people safe, and this sheriff’s office, who endangers the public,” Tyson Logan, the family’s attorney, told Searchlight. “This motorist had no idea that calling the police might get this teenager shot to death.”

When a welfare check turns deadly
Hadley’s story is like that of many across New Mexico and the nation. Time and again, “welfare checks” — non-violent 911 calls that ask a first responder to check in on someone’s mental health, safety or general wellbeing — end with a fatal display of violence. After such shootings, municipalities often turn to alternative response models and internal reviews of police shootings, yet the trend persists.
Nationally, police in New Mexico routinely kill civilians at an outsized rate, according to the nonprofit Mapping Police Violence, which tracks data nationwide. In 2023, Searchlight reported that the Albuquerque Police Department, in particular, contributed heavily to this trend. In 2022, Searchlight found, Albuquerque police killed 10 people in shootings — a total surpassed only by police forces in Los Angeles, New York and Houston, all of which dwarf Albuquerque in size.
As happened with Hadley, many of these cases start with a call for help. In Las Cruces in 2022, police shot and killed Amelia Baca, a 75-year-old grandmother with dementia who spoke no English, after her family called 911 and asked for help, because they believed she appeared to be off her medication. She came to the door holding a kitchen knife in each hand and looked confused when an officer shouted at her, in English, to “drop the fucking knife.” In Albuquerque that same year, police shot and killed Collin Neztsosie — from long distance with assault rifles — on Central Avenue while he was on the phone with a 911 dispatcher and was visibly suffering a mental health crisis.
Municipal officials have often used such cases as proof of the need for alternative response models. Shortly after George Floyd’s murder in 2020, Albuquerque police shot a young man suffering a “schizoaffective episode,” as his family called it, during a mental health call in which he asked officers to kill him. Within weeks, city leaders announced the creation of Albuquerque Community Safety, a stand-alone public safety department consisting of licensed clinical social workers and behavioral health professionals who would respond to nonviolent 911 calls, including mental health crises, homelessness and overdoses.
Five years later, though, police officers continue to kill civilians even after mental health professionals were called to the scene.
In February, Albuquerque police sent armed officers to the apartment of 67-year-old David McElvain and killed him after he allegedly pointed a gun at the officers. Earlier that day, ACS responders knocked on McElvain’s door because a colleague had called 911 and expressed concern that McElvain was going to harm himself. Police officials at the time said that McElvain, who “wanted to hurt himself,” refused to meet with the mental health responders but opened the door for the responding officers before pointing a gun at them.
It’s not an uncommon story: Someone calls 911 when a friend or family member is experiencing a mental health crisis, unarmed behavioral health professionals initially respond, and by day’s end, news of a fatal police shooting hits the news. The problem is so acute that one of ACS’ much-publicized hires, Elaine Maestas, has since accused the department of undercutting its own mission to remedy the city’s problem with police violence.
When Maestas was hired by ACS in 2022, she was already well-known in the Albuquerque area for her activism following the death of her sister, Elisha Lucero, who Bernalillo County sheriff’s deputies had shot 21 times in the midst of a mental health crisis. Lucero was living in an RV outside her uncle’s South Valley home and was experiencing symptoms of psychosis after undergoing surgery to remove a brain tumor. One night, she slapped her uncle in an argument — so her family called 911, remembering that first responders had previously taken her to the hospital in similar situations. When two deputies arrived, Lucero allegedly rushed at them with a kitchen knife, and they shot her “until she was no longer a recognizable person,” Maestas told me in an interview in 2023. This March, Maestas filed a lawsuit against the city and alleged that “below the surface, ACS is not what it purports to be.”
“In fact, ACS operates hand-in-glove with the Albuquerque Police Department, often relying on APD for the types of calls that ACS tells the public it handles on its own,” the lawsuit says. Maestas alleges that she witnessed an ACS responder joking with an APD officer about “roughing up” a civilian.
A young, relatively untested law
For five years now, reform advocates have looked to alternative response programs like ACS to bring about change. More recently, survivors of shootings and family members of victims have turned to a new law.
Hadley’s family is invoking the New Mexico Civil Rights Act, which was passed in 2021. The law did away with qualified immunity as a defense for New Mexico government officials. Their lawsuit claims that the sheriff’s deputy who killed Hadley and the elected members of the Otero County Commission violated his civil rights — namely, the right to life and liberty — by allowing Diaz-Austin, the sheriff’s deputy, to use “objectively unreasonable lethal force.”
The state law is still so young, though, that its parameters are not fully known. Many of the cases that could test its contours, including one brought in May by Jacob Johns, the survivor of the 2023 shooting at an anti-Oñate rally in Española, have yet to go to trial.
“We view the constitutional rights as quite straightforward here,” Logan, the attorney for Hadley’s family, said. “Really, there’s no question that shooting an unarmed teenager 22 times violates both the U.S. Constitution and the New Mexico Constitution.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/policeshootingsearchlight-1024x575.jpeg,,,2025-07-07 13:18:41.911007

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)As President Donald Trump sends mixed messages about immigration enforcement, ordering new raids on farms and hotels just days after saying he wouldn’t target those industries, he has hardly mentioned the industry that employs the most immigrant laborers: construction.
Nevertheless, the Trump administration is going after construction workers without legal status to meet its mass deportation goals — even as the country has a housing shortage and needs new homes built. A shortage of workers has delayed or prevented construction, causing billions of dollars in economic damage, according to a June report from the Home Builders Institute.
Almost a quarter of all immigrants without a college degree work in construction, a total of 2.2 million workers as of May, before work site raids began in earnest. That’s more than the next three industries combined: restaurants (1.1 million), janitorial and other cleaning services (526,000) and landscaping (454,000), according to a Stateline analysis of federal Current Population Survey data provided by ipums.org at the University of Minnesota.
Within the construction industry, immigrant workers are now a majority of painters and roofers (both 53%) and comprise more than two-thirds of plasterers and stucco masons. U.S. citizens in construction are more likely to work as managers and as skilled workers, such as carpenters.
Many immigrant workers are likely living here illegally, although there are some working legally as refugees or parolees, and others are asylum-seekers waiting for court dates. There’s also a small number of legal visas for temporary farmworkers, construction workers and others.
The pool of immigrant workers Stateline analyzed were employed noncitizens ages 18-65 without a college degree, screening out temporary workers with high-skill visas.
About half of the immigrant laborers in construction are working in Southern states, including conservative-leaning Florida, North Carolina and Texas, where there is more building going on, according to the Stateline analysis. Another 584,000, or one-quarter, are in Western states, including Arizona, California and Nevada.
In recent months, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE, has conducted construction worksite raids in Florida in Tallahassee and near Ocala, and in South Texas and New Orleans, as well as more immigrant-friendly California and Pennsylvania.
Roofers may have been the first targeted by new workplace raids because of their visibility, said Sergio Barajas, executive director of the National Hispanic Construction Alliance, a California-based advocacy group with chapters in five other states.
“That’s the first place we heard about it. Roofers are right out there where you can see them,” Barajas said. He added that all segments of construction work have been targeted for ICE raids, and that even some legal workers are not showing up for work out of fear.
“Six or eight weeks ago, I would have said we weren’t affected at all. Now we are. There’s a substantial reduction in the number of workers who are showing up, so crews are 30%, 40% smaller than they used to be,” Barajas said.
In residential construction, a system of contractors and subcontractors opens the door to abuses, said Enrique Lopezlira, director of the Low-Wage Work Program at the University of California, Berkeley Labor Center. Lopezlira said contractors hire workers, often immigrant laborers, for low-wage jobs and pay them in cash, to save money on benefits and make the lowest possible bid for projects.
“It becomes a blame game. The developers can say, ‘I hired this contractor and I thought he was above board and paying people a decent wage.’ And the contractors can say, ‘I rely on subcontractors,’” said Lopezlira. “It becomes a race to the bottom.”
In many places, residential construction draws more immigrant labor because of looser state and local regulations and lower pay. But in some states with weaker unions and rules that are less strict, such as Texas, the commercial construction industry also employs many immigrants who are here illegally.
Commercial construction labor costs are 40% lower in Texas than they are in large Northeastern cities where unions are more powerful, said David Kelly, a lecturer in civil and environmental engineering at the University of Michigan.
“The large difference [in cost] suggests workers and their employers in some regions are not paying for income taxes, overtime, Social Security or unemployment insurance,” Kelly said in an email. “Since undocumented workers have limited employment options they may be more willing than others to accept these conditions.”
Despite political claims that Democratic policies result in immigrants taking jobs others need, noncitizen immigrant laborers were about 7% of jobholders nationally as of May — about the same as 2015, according to the Stateline analysis.
That share has hardly budged over the past 10 years, including in 2019 under the first Trump administration, dipping to 6% only in 2020 and 2021.
In construction, however, the share of jobs held by immigrant laborers has increased from 19% in 2015 to 22% in 2024, according to the analysis. Immigrant laborers have gotten more than a third of the 1.5 million jobs added between 2015 and 2024, as home construction reached historic levels.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Brenda Bazán for The Texas Tribune)Camp Mystic confirmed Monday it is “grieving the loss of 27 campers and counselors” following the devastating floods in Texas over the weekend.
The all-girls Christian camp, which has been a summertime retreat for generations of Texas girls, has become the focus of floods’ aftermath. The camp is Kerr County along the Guadalupe River, where water reached catastrophic levels overnight Friday. About 10 inches of rain fell within a few hours, causing the river to rise 26 feet in 45 minutes.
“Our hearts are broken alongside our families that are enduring this unimaginable tragedy,” the camp wrote in a statement to their website. “We are praying for them constantly.”
The camp said it has been in communication with local and state authorities who are conducting searches for the missing girls.
Officials have confirmed at least 79 deaths as of Sunday from the floods in Central Texas, including 40 adults and 28 children in Kerr County. It was not immediately clear Monday morning how many of the girls from Camp Mystic were included in that official count. A press conference has been scheduled for 10 a.m.
Camp Mystic’s director Richard “Dick” Eastland is among those who have been confirmed dead. According to Eastland’s son, the director died trying to save campers as the floodwaters began engulfing the camp.
“We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of support from community, first responders, and officials at every level,” the camp said on its website.
Questions about a lack of sufficient warnings have continued to grow since the flash floods. The National Weather Service issued a flood watch Thursday afternoon, predicting up to seven inches of isolated rainfall early Friday morning.
At 1:14 a.m. Friday, the NWS issued the first flash flood warning. At 4:03 a.m., the NWS issued a flash flood emergency, warning of an “extremely dangerous and life-threatening situation.”
Local and state officials have since said the NWS forecasts did not accurately predict the intensity of the rainfall.

(Photo by Jane Hawkey/ Integration and Application Network, UMCES)When they last signed a Chesapeake Bay cleanup agreement in 2014, officials from seven jurisdictions set ambitious targets and a hard deadline of 2025.
They didn’t quite make it.
So as they drafted the next agreement, which was released to the public Tuesday, they did things a little differently: Some targets shifted, deadlines were staggered and some goals have yet to be set, awaiting new computer modeling that will show the most up-to-date picture of bay pollutants.
The preliminary plan includes refreshed goals for oyster restoration, underwater grass acreage, public access sites and wetland plantings, among a host of other subjects. And that’s before terms like “diversity” and “climate change” were tweaked at the request of the Trump administration.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But officials think the plan, months in development and still months from completion, will be worth it.
“One thing we’ve heard over and over again — and frankly, for probably since the beginning of time with this agreement — is the need for it to be something that people actually can understand and see themselves in. And I think we worked really hard to make sure that each one of these outcomes did just that,” said Maryland Secretary of Natural Resources Josh Kurtz, who chairs the Chesapeake Bay Program committee that was behind Tuesday’s revisions.
The draft plan includes different deadlines for different outcomes: Some goals are set for 2030, many are in 2035 or 2040. Kurtz said that allowed for a more individualized approach to each goal, making use of the latest science.
“That’s one of the places we’re most excited to get feedback from the public,” Kurtz said. “Is 10 years right? Is 15 years right? Do we want to set targets that are more interim?”
One of the key goals of the 2014 plan was to limit nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and sediment pollution, the villains behind the bay’s oxygen-deprived summer “dead zones” where crabs, oysters and fish can no longer survive. Sediment goals had been met by last year, but Pennsylvania and five other states as well as  Washington, D.C. had achieved only 92% of phosphorous reduction goals and 59% of the nitrogen target, despite billions being spent. The Susquehanna River is the bay’s largest tributary.
The new plan gives experts until 2030 to develop a goal for nutrients and sediment, as they await new data from an updated computer model that estimates pollution flow, said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which convenes lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia to discuss bay issues.
“That process of updating the model takes time, and has to be peer reviewed. And so, we’re not in a place where we can speed that up, and really still call it sound, good science,” Killius said. “We can’t really put new numbers in place — or ask the jurisdictions to plan around those numbers — until we’ve got that model up and running.”
The nutrient and sediment targets are not likely to change, since they were set in 2010 by the Environmental Protection Agency. The new plan will likely focus on a new timeline or methodology for achieving the total maximum daily load, or TMDL.
“We’re working with the how,” Killius said. “So, what is going to be our plan of attack in getting to what the TMDL tells us we need to do?”
The new computer modeling was originally expected January, but officials now expect about a yearlong delay before that’s done, said Lee McDonnell, acting director of the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program office.
Kurtz said Bay Program officials understand that the lack of new nutrient and sediment timelines may “lend a feeling of uncertainty” to the bay restoration effort.
“That’s why we’re going to be doing a lot of public outreach,” Kurtz said, including about the computer model.
Keisha Sedlacek, federal director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the number of “gaps and holes” in the 2025 draft are a concern — in some places, including goals for conserved lands, the draft includes blanks in lieu of specific numbers. She would also like to see a consistent deadline, such as 2040, with periodic check-ins along the way.

“If we set these interim targets and actually evaluate the program — not every 10 years, but every couple of years — to see what tweaks we need to make based on the best available science, we’ll have a stronger, more efficient program moving forward,” Sedlacek said.
The update comes at a time of uncertain federal support for bay cleanup programs. The Trump administration has moved to slash funding for agencies that assist with bay clean-up, including the EPA, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — but it has so far proposed stable funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program, which Trump had targeted for elimination during his first term.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents about 300 environmental organizations in the bay region, said the $92 million in funding for the Bay Program, while it is critical, is only “one piece of the puzzle.”
“These states and federal agencies are recommitting to the work and coming up with these revised goals and outcomes,” Reilly said, “when it’s being proposed that the infrastructure around achieving them could be gone.”
Mindful of the administration’s antipathy toward climate change and DEI, Reilly said some language in the document changed at the request of federal agencies. While the 2014 agreement cited “climate resiliency,” the 2025 version references “changing environmental conditions.” The 2025 draft also jettisons a reference to “diversity” in clean-up efforts, instead calling for a  “wide range of engaged individuals whose communities enjoy access to the waters and natural landscapes of the region.”
Killius said the committee wanted to bypass buzzwords and focus on “saying what we mean.”
Killius said the new bay agreement was also informed by a groundbreaking 2023 study, called the Comprehensive Evaluation of System response, or CESR. That report cited a number of reasons for the struggle to attain the 2025 goals — and for the bay’s lackluster response to the pollution reductions achieved thus far — including the possibility that the Bay Program’s current computer model could be overestimating phosphorus reductions.
But mainly, while jurisdictions were able to cut pollution from wastewater treatment plants and other “point” sources, they struggled to reduce pollution from “nonpoint” sources, including farm fields and city streets.
The report delivered a sobering message: Portions of the bay, especially the deepest reaches, may never meet standards for criteria such as dissolved oxygen. Targeting shallow-water areas, and triggering an ecosystem turnaround, could have more impact on the health of the bay than focusing on the total nutrient runoff and its impact on the deep channel.
Killius points to a section in the revised agreement about fish habitat, which calls for a focus on improving “the quantity and quality of shallow water fish habitat in tidal areas.” Kurtz points to revised oyster goals, which include mention of aquaculture and the native fishery, rather than on oyster sanctuaries — where no harvesting occurs.
But some observers worry that the agreement hasn’t gone far enough to address nonpoint source pollution and restore ecosystems. That includes Gerald Winegrad, a former state senator and vocal critic of current bay policy.
He noted that some goals were revised downward, including for forested lands and wetlands. While the 2014 agreement called for states to “create or re-establish 85,000 acres of tidal and non-tidal wetlands” by 2025, the draft calls for 3,000 restored acres by 2035.
“When you look at forest cover, and you look at [forest] buffers, and you look at wetlands — three very important things, like the heart, lungs, kidneys of the bay — it is a complete flop compared to what was already required,” Winegrad said of the draft document.
He was frustrated, too, that the agreement didn’t specifically mention the TMDL numbers for nutrient and sediment reductions — or set a new deadline.
“This has been kicking the can down the road, moving the goal post — all the worst little idioms you can use to say that there is no political courage to really restore the Chesapeake Bay with the hard choices that have to be made,” Winegrad said.
Targets for restoring submerged aquatic vegetation were also revised down from a goal of 130,000 acres by 2025, to interim targets of 90,000 acres by 2030 and 95,000 acres by 2035.

Leila Duman, Chesapeake and coastal bays restoration officer for Maryland DNR, said the ultimate goal is still to reach 196,000 acres of grass coverage across the entire bay.
“That said, that’s not something we can get to in the next 10 years,” Duman said. “Part of this revision process was really about making goals achievable.”
The agreement also includes altogether new goals, such as a first-time goal for freshwater mussels, calling for development of mussel conservation plans in five bay tributaries by 2035. Filter feeders, like mussels and oysters, remove harmful nutrients from the water, making them a critical piece of the effort to cut pollution in the estuary.
“The oyster goal is so important,” Kurtz said. “But that really is focused on the tidal part. And what mussels really gets us is more of that work in the freshwater space.”
On the bay’s beloved blue crabs, the draft agreement calls for keeping the fishery at sustainable levels, but defers to a baywide stock assessment, which is coming out in 2026, on what the population levels ought to be.
Kurtz acknowledged that not all parts of the draft plan use specific numbers just yet.
“But I think that’s also reflective of reality. We’re continually improving the science,” he said.
After revisions, the document will head to the Bay Program’s executive council, which includes state and federal leaders such as Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), for final approval. Officials are urging interested parties to submit feedback as soon as possible — before a Sept. 1 deadline, Kurtz said.
“If you are a community that reads this and says: ‘Well, this isn’t for us,’ we need to know that,” Kurtz said. “Because we want this to be for every single person within this massive watershed.”

(Mary Sanchez/The Beacon)Kansas City’s immigration court is on the fifth floor of a nondescript downtown office building.
The area is better known for the bustling shops of Crown Center to the south, or nearby Washington Square Park, a potential site for a new Royals stadium.
Yet thousands of life-changing decisions for immigrant families are routinely handed down in the courtroom on Grand Boulevard.
Three immigration court judges can determine if someone is given the chance to continue seeking asylum after facing dire threats in their birth nation. They can decide if an immigrant might be removed from the U.S. within weeks, or if they’ll be given time to find an attorney who might be able to help them with a case.
Access to an attorney is key.
It’s one factor that sets immigration courts apart from criminal courts, which are far more familiar to most people.
In immigration court, there is no universal right to a government-appointed attorney.
Because deportation is classified as a civil sanction, not criminal, immigrants facing removal are not given the constitutional protections under the Sixth Amendment that are provided to criminal defendants, according to the American Immigration Council.
This differs from the criminal justice system, where people facing even one day in jail will have a court-appointed attorney, if they can’t afford one.
“It’s like a system that is completely stacked against immigrants,” said Clare Murphy Shaw, executive director of the Asylum Clinic Kansas City, which primarily focuses on pro bono help for immigrant children who entered the U.S. without parents or guardians.
Only 23.4% of immigrants, including unaccompanied children, had an attorney with them when they were ordered to be removed from the country in May 2025, according to government data compiled by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
Legal experts fear even those percentages will drop as programs focused on assisting vulnerable populations, like children, struggle to maintain funding under the Trump administration.
Legal representation increases the likelihood that a case will be decided in the immigrant’s favor.
The American Immigration Council in 2016 found that detained immigrants were more than 10 times as likely to successfully defend against deportation when they were represented by counsel.
But reaching an attorney to take a case, or even a consultation, is increasingly difficult.
Not all immigration attorneys in Missouri and Kansas handle time-sensitive removal or asylum cases. Some focus their practice on visas for businesses, or family reunification.
The sheer volume of cases before the nation’s immigration courts is another complicating factor.
There are currently 3.5 million cases backlogged, including 52,533 in Kansas City’s court, which is the only one in Missouri and Kansas.
Unlike civil and criminal courts, the nation’s 71 immigration courts are not independent of the Department of Justice.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has made it clear that all judges, including those outside of immigration courts, can be subject to discipline as the Trump administration pursues its mass deportation effort.
“Nobody is above the law, not even a judge,” Bondi said.
Bondi made the comment in April, after a Wisconsin circuit judge was arrested and accused of helping an immigrant evade agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
 Immigration courts on trial 

The nation’s immigration courts, and the lack of a right to an appointed counsel, have long been criticized.
Legislation has been introduced to create a national system of representation for indigent immigrants facing removal, but it’s never passed into law.
U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state, sponsored such legislation in 2023.
Jayapal recently held an online shadow hearing for Congress to discuss what she termed the due process crisis within the nation’s immigration courts.
During the session, immigration court’s lack of independence from the Department of Justice was described as a long-standing structural flaw from which other problems follow.
Immigration judges can find themselves caught between upholding the rule of law or maintaining their jobs, said Ashley Tabaddor, a former California immigration judge.
Tabaddor served as the Biden administration’s chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Homeland Security “is represented by trained counsel, but noncitizens have no right to appointed counsel, even in life or death matters,” Tabaddor said.
Increasingly, the limited assistance once offered immigrants by the government is being eliminated, Tabaddor said.
And much of it was advisory, not legal representation.
Programs helped detained immigrants understand basic aspects of the government’s case against them. Sometimes, the assistance was as simple as telling someone in a language that they understood which jail they were being held in, and in what state.
Most of the programs have been terminated by the Trump administration.
One example is a federal program that offered legal representation to immigrants whom a judge had found to be incompetent, such as due to a severe mental health disorder.
Only three states still offer that program — Washington, Arizona and California — because of a court order, said Sara Van Hofwegen, managing director of legal access programs at the Acacia Center for Justice.
Acacia manages the federal grants still in place that are dispersed to legal clinics around the nation, including Kansas City’s Asylum Clinic.
“What limited access they had to fairness and due process is being taken away every day, and it puts people more and more at risk,” Van Hofwegen said.
Many of the federally funded programs long had bipartisan support because the efforts made the courts more efficient, Van Hofwegen said. That bipartisan support is going by the wayside.
“There’s very little room for mercy in the system,” said Murphy Shaw of the Asylum Clinic KC.

The nonprofit clinic, established in 2015, provides pro bono help to certain categories of immigrants, including the asylum cases of Afghans.
It also receives some federal funds to represent unaccompanied children.
The Trump administration moved to terminate that funding this spring. After a California court injunction, the money was released while the issue is being litigated.
Changing policy from the White House continues to complicate the work of the clinic’s attorneys.
“It’s like sands shifting under our feet,” Murphy Shaw said. “It’s very, very hard to get a grasp on what’s actually happening and how to advise clients.”
 Cases triaged, not enough immigration attorneys

The government maintains a database of pro bono legal help in each state.
The list, as it is known, is made available to immigrants who come before immigration judges.
It’s kept in a file managed by the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR).
For the Kansas City court, the EOIR names two St. Louis agencies — the Migrant & Immigrant Community Action Project and the St. Francis Community Services/Catholic Legal Assistance Ministry.
Neither program accepts clients from the western part of the state.
Finding legal help among area immigration attorneys is also difficult.
The Missouri/Kansas chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) has about 240 members.
Not all live in or focus their practice in either state, said Genevra Alberti, the immediate past chair of the Missouri/Kansas AILA chapter.
And less than half of the attorneys in the chapter accept cases involving the defense of migrants targeted for removal, said Alberti.
Those with removal expertise are overwhelmed with the crush of immigrants being detained, a record 59,000 nationwide as of late June.
“There just are not enough attorneys to handle the volume,” Alberti said.
A government system, the ICE detainee locator, isn’t updating quickly as people are being moved among jails, local attorneys said.
This makes it more difficult for attorneys and family members to locate someone to prepare a defense.
For immigrants detained by ICE, a best-case scenario is having legal representation before being taken into custody.
That’s the situation a Kansas City mother from Guatemala faced. She has long been aided by the attorneys at Martinez Immigration Law, where Alberti is employed.
The firm had her paperwork, her history and all necessary documents when she was detained by ICE in June after showing up for a routine check-in.
The woman is seeking the right to remain in the country on humanitarian grounds because her youngest child is autistic and largely nonverbal.
For other people, local attorneys are too busy to even schedule a consultation.
“You worry about all the people who need help, but then you’ve got to worry more about the people who you already are helping, because you have an ethical duty to do so,” Alberti said.

Another local woman, a longtime area resident originally from Mexico, keeps a running list of immigration attorneys in her head.
She wants to be prepared, just in case.
She has a temporary, renewable reprieve from running afoul of immigration agents through Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known as DACA. DACA helps people who were brought to the U.S. as children, usually by a parent.
Triage is how attorney Michael Sharma-Crawford described how his office is being forced to decide whom they can help with legal assistance — and which immigrants will not receive any help at all.
William E. Hanna, a former attorney at Stinson, is the latest to join the firm, bringing the number to four lawyers at Sharma-Crawford Attorneys at Law.
Hanna began doing some cases pro bono in recent years, taking classes to learn the complexities of immigration law.
“I wish the immigration system worked the way we want it to work,” Hanna said as he unpacked boxes and set up his new office.
A common scenario is that someone will receive notice of a court date. But then they can’t retain an attorney in time to file the necessary paperwork, said Trinidad Raj Molina, accompaniment organizer with Advocates for Immigrant Rights and Reconciliation KC.
An asylum application is an example, Molina said.
The judge ends up, sometimes through an interpreter, explaining what should have happened, knowing that the person might have qualified to remain in the country.
“It’s frustrating for everybody when there could be a better solution of having a universal legal representation system,” Molina said.
 Limited help, soaring need

Programs like the Equity Corps of Oregon and Innovation Law Lab have devised ways to fund pro bono counsel in immigration courts, Molina said.
And locally, several organizations sponsor clinics offering limited legal help, such as filling out forms that need to be filed with the government.
A Vera Institute of Justice poll in 2019 found widespread public support for government-funded attorneys in immigration court — 87% of people surveyed, including 73% of Trump voters.
AILA has long pressed for a nationwide program to represent indigent people facing removal proceedings.
Advocates feel that the need for qualified and ethical representation heightened in early June.
That’s when immigration judges were advised by the government to begin dismissing cases when asked to do so by Homeland Security attorneys. In those situations, the government asks for cases to be dismissed, preventing the noncitizen from having more time to argue their case. Then Homeland Security pursues “expedited removal,” which can involve mandatory, immediate detention.
ICE agents were waiting in some courts to immediately take immigrants into custody for expedited removal.
In Kansas City’s court, a handful of such instances occurred. But not within the past few weeks, Molina said.
Advocates credit the presence of volunteer court monitors who are ready to witness whatever transpires for the change. Cellphones, video or other recording equipment are not allowed in the court.
Tabaddor is among those voices highly critical of the new approach by Homeland Security and ICE.
She contends that the Trump administration is attempting to bypass the role of immigration courts, creating situations where there is “no judge, no hearing and virtually no review.”
“As a former judge, I can tell you when one part of the framework breaks, when judges are undermined, when legal support disappears, when people are too afraid to show up, the entire system fails,” she said. “Not just for immigrants, but for all.”

(Courtesy of Robert Arnold)Robert Arnold probably means well. He seems sincere. He’s just aiming too high in his first attempt at elected office. 
Arnold is a 19-year-old Dakota State University student who has announced his intention to run for the Democratic nomination for governor (he says he’ll be 21, the minimum legal age for a governor, in time to serve). Now he just needs 1,232 petition signatures from registered voters to get on the 2026 primary ballot. 
Arnold made news after he declared his candidacy by claiming that the leaders in the state’s Democratic Party were not supportive of his effort. In a Dakota Scout story, Arnold said that the party leaders told him they had someone else in mind to run for governor.

Leaders in the Democratic Party were quick to deny Arnold’s allegation. “The state party does not get involved in primaries and we are actively recruiting candidates up and down the ballot,” said Democratic Party Chairman Shane Merrill. 
The Democratic Party doesn’t get involved in primaries because it doesn’t have that many. On those rare occasions when a Democrat is willing to appear on the ballot, they usually don’t have a fight on their hands from another Democrat. 
Arnold hasn’t said who the party has in mind for the top of the ticket. The real mystery surrounding this incident is not whether Arnold has a chance of winning the governor’s office (he doesn’t) but who Democrats could have in mind to run for governor in 2026. 
With no one from their party in statewide elected offices and just a small handful of legislators, Democrats don’t exactly have what anyone would call a deep bench. The Democrat with the most name recognition is likely state Sen. Jamie Smith, who ran for governor against Kristi Noem in 2022. Smith has decided to take his name recognition and use it in a run for mayor of Sioux Falls. 
Even if Arnold is mistaken about the reaction of Democratic Party leaders, putting teenagers on the ballot is not the way to build a political party. We can all agree that with the Democratic Party outnumbered in this state by independents and people with no party affiliation, the party needs some work. 
Arnold’s best effort, if he really feels like he must run for office, would be to aim local. He should run for city council or school board. Once he has a few years of service and a reputation for electability and trustworthiness, he could aim higher. The next step would be the Legislature, where he could take on statewide issues and get accustomed to the give and take of policymaking. 
Then, and only then, should he consider a run for governor. 
If the Democratic Party is ever going to be more than an asterisk in South Dakota politics, it will need people like Arnold who are willing to serve. But those people need to be willing to help build the party from the ground up, not shoot for the top office right out of the gate. Running for governor may make an interesting topic for Arnold’s “what I did on my summer vacation” essay, but it won’t do the party much good. 
The Democratic Party in this state is in need of seasoned, credible candidates for office. Arnold, as sincere as he may be, is little more than a novelty act.

(Photo by Amanda Frank)At a book launch in May, Paul Herbert shared to a full theater at the Morris Thompson Cultural Visitors Center in Fairbanks how he met Chris Cannon, the author of the newly published book “In the Footsteps of the Traveller: The Astronomy of Northern Dene.”
One evening after he had been out on a trail all day, Herbert visited with a friend when they heard a faint knock on his door in Fort Yukon. 
“We looked at each other and I yelled, ‘Come in,’” Herbert said, “loud enough for someone to hear it next door.”
Nothing happened and he heard another quiet knock.
“So me and my friend looked at each other and I jumped up and went and yanked the door open and there’s this red-headed guy standing by the door. He stuck his hand out and he tried to talk to me in Gwich’in.”
The person knocking on Herbert’s door was Cannon.
“I gave him a hard time, I tried to drive him away, but he kept coming back. Then he said, ‘I’m here to talk to you about the stars.’”
Before Cannon met Herbert, and before he studied astronomy, Cannon’s life was more grounded. He grew up in Helena, Montana, and moved to Alaska in 2001 to study aviation in Anchorage before switching majors and earning a bachelor of science in wildlife biology. Working with the University of Alaska Museum of the North, Cannon traveled across Alaska with a portable planetarium used to teach about the northern lights, presenting to students. Through these presentations, Cannon noticed many of the student’s cultural responses, such as whistling at the northern lights. This sparked an interest in Indigenous knowledge of the sky.
“It became more of a personal interest to look for things, to look for books or something that I could read about, just to educate myself more about cultural knowledge of the sky. There was some good information out there for Inuit or Yupik. The more I dug into Northern Dene, the less I found. So that increased my curiosity to find something,” Cannon shared in an interview.
This book details a 15-year journey across Northern Dene communities, sometimes known as Athabascan in Alaska, meeting with elders and experts to learn more about the cultural stories and significance of Dene astronomical knowledge. Cannon received a master of arts in Northern studies at UAF and continued his work towards a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology at the university. He’s now an assistant professor at UAF’s College of Indigenous Studies.
Starting in 2009, Cannon worked with more than 65 elders in 34 communities across Alaska and Canada. That work became the basis for the new book, which features 60 illustrations and shares his research into the significance of the stars to Northern Dene life, language and culture.
A leading theme in the book is the story of the Traveller: a teacher, gamekeeper, guardian and practical guide for wayfinding. Cannon spent many years working in communities to identify the stories, combining interviews, photography and detailed illustrations. 
“The Traveller is this figure who went around the world in ancient times who shaped the world into the way it is today. To make the world more safer and more useful for humans or especially Dene peoples. It’s a world transformation story; it has lots of variation but it’s pretty widespread throughout the Americas,” Cannon shared.
The book guides readers through a deep dive of multiple Dene languages, explaining star formations. And it provides an exclusive depiction of Indigenous understandings of the sky and other celestial and atmospheric phenomena, from thunder to the northern lights, and how it relates to the human experience.
“When you discover this Traveller in the stars, you’re also discovering a lot about yourself and where you come from and that your spirit is also ancient and continuous through time,” he said. “And you understand how all things are related, which also informs how you are in the world and how you relate to it and treat things.”
Cannon hopes that his work brings about a new awareness and a deeper cultural context about the stars, stating that the teachings from the elders shared throughout the book have deep antiquity and still have uses in a modern and contemporary world.
“Like when you read about cultural astronomy, it’s always about this huge focus on the story but this is trying to push that beyond a story. Certainly there’s stories about the Traveller, but what’s more, is that there’s this model for how to live, be and relate to this world and everything in it. It’s a very huge concept, huge model, huge being up there that’s not treated as stars but treated as a living, animate thing that’s always there.”
Cannon’s research has been featured in shows such as Molly of Denali on PBS Kids, capturing audiences of all ages.
“Please know, Chris, that this is generational work for all of us as Indigenous people, as we get to know ourselves again as we make a shift from generational trauma to healing. It’s going to be generational healing from here on out and this is part of it,” said Teisha Simmons, dean of the College of Indigenous Studies, who shared the importance of Cannon’s work in closing at the book launch.
The book is published by the University of Manitoba Press. Cannon has offered the proceeds from the book to the Doyon Foundation in support of Northern Dene language revitalization.
For those who missed the book launch, Cannon will give a talk about his work as part of the University of Alaska Fairbanks Summer Lecture Series, on July 30, at 7 p.m. at the BP Design Theater on campus and available through a livestream.

As a young physician, I’ve come to recognize the pattern: young adults, unstably housed, cycling through jails, shelters and emergency rooms while grappling with severe psychosis unresponsive to conventional approaches. Some I’ve seen before. Many I’ll see again.
One such patient arrived in my care this past spring agitated and paranoid. Over several weeks, we adjusted his drug regimen, consulted specialists, and navigated the ethics of compelled medications after he stopped eating, convinced fasting would bring spiritual clarity as directed by his hallucinations.
Clozapine, the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, wasn’t an option. Without stable housing or a reliable system for routine blood monitoring, it simply wasn’t safe; its use demands regularity to avoid life-threatening side effects. We had to settle for a less effective, but more practical, substitute.
By discharge, he was calmer, eating and talking more. He agreed to a long-acting injectable antipsychotic, and we arranged for transportation to a shelter with appointments at a public clinic. It wasn’t ideal, but it was something. His story, like so many others, reflects a broader, broken system. And like I’ve done so many times before, I let him go into uncertainty, hoping it would be enough.
This is not a mental health system. It’s crisis management on repeat.

Stories like his are painfully familiar. As a psychiatry resident working in Louisiana’s only public safety-net hospital, I see versions of this every day. Many of our patients spend their 20s bouncing between detention centers, psychiatric wards, and the streets. They’re denied consistent connection to care in systems shaped more by surveillance than by support.
Legislation like Senate Bill 196, House Bill 619, and House Bill 262 advance policies that may further isolate and penalize unhoused citizens by imposing criminal penalties for “unauthorized public camping.” Though including language about supportive interventions and rehabilitation, in practice, strict enforcement of these bills means prison time and fines for unhoused individuals, many of whom live with untreated psychiatric illness.
For decades, Louisiana has chronically underfunded mental health care. Rather than investing in recovery, the state is now leaning into penalizing homelessness, a condition many of my psychiatric patients experience, through newly proposed legislation. Such disinvestment makes healing nearly impossible for those with severe mental illness. Even after surviving years of trauma and reaching brief stability in clinical settings, patients often return to the circumstances that contributed to their illness in the first place. This return, however, may soon come with the added risk of criminalization.
After Hurricane Katrina shuttered Charity Hospital, followed by the closure of several other public psychiatric facilities, Louisiana promised to shift to a modern, community-based mental health network. That vision never fully materialized. Instead, the state adopted a crisis-oriented model: short inpatient stays, fragmented outpatient services, and minimal housing support.
Community mental health clinics are overwhelmed. Few psychiatrists accept Medicaid, and statewide reimbursement rates remain among the lowest in the United States, making it hard for providers to serve those who need us most. As of 2023, Louisiana only had 689 state hospital psychiatric beds, well below national recommendations. Just a handful of Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams operate across the state despite widespread demand for this kind of wraparound support.
Mental illness affects people of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds too, yet its consequences reflect entrenched inequities. Black Louisianans disproportionately affected as many experience delayed diagnoses, higher hospitalization rates, and increased criminalization.
Meanwhile, Louisiana, already home to one of the highest incarceration rates in the country, routinely relies on jails and prisons as de facto psychiatric facilities, a ramification of closed state mental health institutions and underfunded alternatives.
Inside our hospitals, we do everything we can no matter the patient. We titrate medications, discuss with social work and chaplains, and coordinate outpatient plans. But far too often, we discharge patients with little more than prescriptions and a list of follow-up appointments, knowing that without stability, recovery may not hold. We need more bridges across housing, outpatient care, and long-term community support.
What troubles me most isn’t how sick some of my patients are when they arrive to my care. It’s where they have to go when they start getting better.
I earn their trust. I see glimpses of the person beneath the illness. Then they are discharged… back into the very conditions that perpetuated their suffering.
In these cases, they don’t fail treatment; the system fails them. And that failure is the result of policy decisions that we have the power to change.
While Louisiana faces real limitations in resources, we need solutions rooted in continuity, compassion, and care that work, not more laws like Senate Bill 196.
This means investing in strategies that treat housing as health care like expanding Housing First initiatives that embed behavioral health care into living environments; establishing ACT teams especially in rural parishes; equipping mobile crisis teams to intervene early; fully funding community clinics serving patients with complex needs; creating psychiatric step-down facilities to offer structure without the trauma of institutionalization; and raising Medicaid reimbursement rates so more providers can serve this vulnerable population.
Above all, we must reject policies that punish illness and deepen despair. Lack of mental health access is a public crisis, not a crime, and our response must reflect that.
We cannot treat a delusion with a shelter cot alone. But we also cannot medicate someone into recovery only to abandon them at discharge. Bills like SB 196 don’t offer real answers. They present care as a reward for pleading guilty, not a right. In doing so, they are punitive for unhoused people with psychiatric illness and force clinicians like me to watch as patients are pushed from hospitals into handcuffs.
The safety net shouldn’t just catch people when they fall. It should be a bridge, to healing, to housing, to hope. Until we build that bridge, we will keep watching people fall through.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Post-Roe2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 10:03:16.927146

Michael Stewart, the Satanic Grotto leader, says the denial is religious discrimination. Adam Proffitt, the Kansas secretary of administration, says the permit was denied because of safety concerns and violence at the last protest.
Stewart was planning a “witching hour protest” from 9 p.m. to midnight on Aug. 2 with the same sentiment as the black mass: “to end Christian favoritism within our state government,” as the group’s Facebook post reads.
“This isn’t just a permit denial; it’s an outright cancellation of our right to protest, fueled by what appears to be a deeply biased agenda,” Stewart said in a news release. “The State of Kansas is actively working to silence voices that challenge the status quo, especially those from minority faiths and marginalized communities.”
Stewart told Kansas Reflector that his permit request was “flat out ignored” for a few weeks, and he only got a response after he showed up in person.
In response to a Kansas Reflector request for comment, Department of Administration spokesman Samir Arif pointed to a response Proffitt had given to Stewart.
“The State has increased safety concerns regarding any event occurring on the south steps after sundown, including whether adequate Kansas Highway Patrol resources are available to address these safety concerns after dark,” Proffitt wrote.
In the new release, Stewart said Capitol Police Chief Brandon Bichsel told him he had “no reservations” about the police’s ability to maintain security. Bichsel did not respond to a Kansas Reflector request for comment.
“Additionally, I decline to grant a permission to you, on behalf of the organization, due to improper acts that occurred when a previous permit space on the Statehouse grounds was granted to you for an event that occurred in March 2025,” Proffitt wrote, referencing the black mass.
The permit Stewart obtained for the black mass allowed the Satanic Grotto to protest outside of the Statehouse — but not inside — after Gov. Laura Kelly banned any protests inside the building on the planned day. Before the black mass, Stewart told Kansas Reflector he planned to defy Kelly’s directive.

On the day of the black mass, Stewart entered the Statehouse and began a dedication to Satan. Counter-protesters physically intervened, including Marcus Schroeder — a 21-year-old from Wisconsin who had been charged with making a false bomb threat on a Pride parade. After Schroeder attempted to grab Stewart’s copy of “The Satanic Bible” two times, Stewart punched Schroeder in the face twice, which resulted in both of their arrests.
“Your conduct created a risk to public safety, violated the terms of your permit, and caused injury to another person,” Proffitt wrote.
Shawnee County prosecutors decided not to pursue charges against Stewart.
Restrictions didn’t stop Stewart at the last protest. But after his arrest, Stewart said he is hesitant to go forward with his planned “witching hour” event.
“We are going to do everything in our power to ensure the event can take place,” Stewart told Kansas Reflector. “However, after consultation with my criminal lawyer, I’m concerned the state is setting the ground for heavy consequences if we proceed.”
Stewart said he could face 18 months of incarceration if the prosecutors decide to pursue the charges from his black mass arrest. He said that being incarcerated would prevent him from serving the community.
“We aren’t done fighting,” he said. “We stepped up to the plate last time when it came to making a point with our safety and freedom. This time we will find other routes that hopefully illustrate the same points.”
The Department of Administration on July 1 denied Stewart’s request to reconsider its decision.
“Should your organization wish to reserve a space for its event, the ending time cannot go past sundown, and someone other than you must take responsibility for the application and event,” said Pat Doran, chief counsel for the Department of Administration, in an email to Stewart.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Stewart-punch-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-07 10:03:16.927146

Just four districts use it.,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/07/few-mississippi-school-districts-adopt-bimonthly-pay/,"Few Mississippi school districts have adopted bimontly pay for teachers, which was seen as a recruitment and retention tool.","The last weeks of January are difficult for Mississippi teachers. Mention of the stretch will draw audible gasps. By then, paychecks last deposited in mid-December are stretched thin. 
For Jefferson County biology teacher Chiquitta Gaylor, that meant Christmas shopping in July. For others, it means pay day loans and a tighter winter budget.
“Even to this day, that’s horrible,” said veteran Amanda Elzy High School teacher Brandice Brown-Williams. “Every year, I try to write a Facebook status and tell as many young teachers as I can to start saving in October.”

It’s a unique problem for teachers in districts that don’t pay their teachers twice a month or bimonthly. Only 10% of US employers pay monthly, according to the Bureau of US Labor Statistics.
In Mississippi, school districts were granted the right three years ago to pay teachers bimonthly. But few have made the change.
Mississippi Today compiled data from every school district in Mississippi regarding bimonthly teacher pay, calling superintendents and clicking through school handbooks. We found four of Mississippi’s 138 school districts had adopted it.
Lowndes County School District, Greenwood-Leflore Consolidated School District, Holly Springs School District and Harrison County School District offer bimonthly pay. Harrison County is the largest district to offer it.
During the 2022 legislative session, Senate Education Chairman Dennis DeBar, R-Leakesville, authored the bill giving districts the choice whether to adopt the policy of bimonthly pay that later became law.

“We have all probably heard teachers ask for it,” he said on the Senate floor.
In a recent interview with Mississippi Today, Debar remarked that it was about “security.”
“We’re trying to help get more young people into the education field,” he added.
In districts with high turnover rates and multiple vacancies, bimonthly pay could be an enticing enough incentive to retain some of their talent.
Mary Johnson felt so during her recent tenure as superintendent of Greenwood-Leflore Consolidated School District. On July 1, the Delta district became the latest to offer the payroll option. One teacher that was expected to leave already signed a contract for next year. Summer hiring has been easier, she reports.
“A lot of what we notice in the Mississippi Delta is teachers are trying to make ends meet,” said Johnson. “I feel like it’s going to help with teacher retention. It will relieve the stress to aid them to get from one period to the next.”
Her announcement of the new board policy went viral on Facebook. The posted video garnered about 90,000 views and was shared nearly 300 times.
She shared that most of the early resistance to the new policy came from a misunderstanding regarding taxes. Some of her teachers were under the impression their paycheck would be taxed twice. She also had to convince a payroll staff that would now have to double their workload.
“I think it’s going to be a recruitment strategy in the long run,” she said.
Some districts even tried bimonthly payout but found it impractical. The district had to hire payroll staff full time during the summer months to process the twice-a-month payments. That was the case in Gulfport, said Superintendent Glen East.
“But teacher retention has been an issue beyond bimonthly pay,” he said. “In the past, if we could get teachers past the three- and eight-year mark, we could keep them. That isn’t happening anymore.”
For public school advocates and political candidates, bimonthly teacher pay, like other investments in teaching staff, have been important campaign issues. Among other challenges confronted by Delta educators, it inspires former Greenville teacher and principal Clayton Barksdale to run for state Senate.
Barksdale feels bi-monthly teacher pay would help districts hold on to talented teachers. He remembers early on in his teaching career when he would call in sick for work because he didn’t have enough gas money to get to school.
“Teachers are a loving bunch,” he said. “They don’t mind using their own money for their classroom. So it would make sense to pay those teachers back in a form of biweekly pay as quickly as possible.”
“With bimonthly pay, you just feel better about coming to work. You have less stress. You have more life in you,” he said.
As a young single mom, Jefferson County School District biology teacher Chiquita Gaylor found it hard to budget, especially during the winter stretch. She frequently bought science kits out of her own pocketbook. 
“I think it would be helpful,” she said. “You have to be very, very disciplined.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/03100346/3X0A7098.jpg,,,2025-07-07 10:03:16.927146

GUEST

Phil Eng



AFTER YEARS OF underinvestment and disrepair, the MBTA is well-positioned to build on crucial recent improvements, according to the man tasked with turning the blighted system around. 
With the system moving more than 800,000 passengers around its service area every day, facing the ire of frustrated riders and public pressure from elected officials to get the system on track, General Manager Phil Eng said he entered the transit system’s top job when it was hard but essential to “think big, think bold” to shake loose from a “status quo” spiral of worsening service. 
“The future is bright,” Eng told reporter Gintautas Dumcius on The Codcast, about two and a half years into the MBTA job and just after lawmakers and the governor approved a sweeping supplemental budget sending $548 million to the MBTA. When he started, Eng said, the system was “slowing down. We were degrading service, and confidence had been lost.”  
The culture at the T at the time was reliant on “external experts” rather than internal institutional knowledge, Eng said. There were also issues with decision-making and “accountability” for those decisions, he said.  
A civil engineer, Eng came to the MBTA from his post as president of the New York commuter railroad, the Long Island Rail Road. From his vantage point as a newcomer, “we were basically going towards shutting down the system, if you ask me, if we’d continued down this path.” 
Leadership had to juggle several priorities at once, like building and retraining the workforce and leadership team, making signal improvements, getting delayed new subway cars on the tracks, tackling the dozens of dreaded speed restrictions that dragged several lines to a crawl, and building a better process to handle new slow zones quickly if they appear. 
“The idea is to not let it get back into that state of disrepair that we were facing,” Eng said, “and that’s why, this year, we continue to have diversions to actually bring the condition of that track to where we want it to be.” 
Last year, Eng said, the light and heavy rail system was at about 65 percent in a state of good repair, and by the end of this year he estimates the system will be 75 or 80 percent in a state of good repair. Frequency of service is up, he said, and the number of dropped bus trips is down to just 0.6 percent this spring from 8.8 percent in 2023. 
Eng emphasized that MBTA leadership is constantly keeping an eye out for service expansion and improvement opportunities – be that through boosting water transit or long-term changes to the commuter rail system as the T works on a new commuter rail operator contract.  
One lesson he brought with him from his postings in New York – including roles at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the New York State Department of Transportation – Eng said, is even if “mega-projects” are the focus of headlines, “the smaller projects that are out in the suburbs are just as important to those communities. And whether it’s 50 people or whether its millions of people, those transportation projects support quality of life, support housing, support businesses. It’s just a different magnitude.” 
During the episode, Eng talked about the overall state of the MBTA system (1:30),  balancing the needs of current riders with future ones (14:30), and the future of the commuter rail (16:00).

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.




We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– Matt Loszak, CEO of Aalo Atomics



Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

Following the shooting death of a Democratic Minnesota lawmaker in June, Assemblymember Mia Bonta wants to beef up a state law that would allow elected officials and candidates to spend an unlimited amount of campaign funds toward private security.
The Oakland Democrat is introducing legislation today that would temporarily remove through 2028 the $10,000 lifetime cap California lawmakers can currently spend of campaign money on security expenses for themselves, staff and family members. On Jan. 1, 2029, the limit would be reimplemented as a $10,000 annual cap. The bill makes no mention of restricting personal funds for security.

Bonta, in a statement: “Everyone should feel safe running for office and representing their community. However, local and state candidates in California face a significant cap on security spending compared to those running for federal offices. This (bill) comes at a time when we’re seeing an increase in threats and harassment…”

The existing cap was set last year, after Gov. Gavin Newsom signed another bill by Bonta that doubled the amount of money legislators were allowed to use for security expenses. Besides Bonta, Democratic lawmakers at the time including Assemblymember Isaac Bryan of Culver City and Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco also reported receiving death threats.
Bonta’s latest proposal is backed by the influential Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat and the bill’s co-author. Because the measure would amend the voter-approved Political Reform Act of 1974, it requires a two-thirds vote in the Senate and Assembly to pass.
Threats of violence against political candidates have reportedly persisted after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, disproportionately affecting officials and candidates who are women, people of color or LGBTQ+. 
In addition to the killings of Minnesota Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were seriously wounded. Last year a bullet struck President Donald Trump’s ear during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. And in 2022 a man wielding a hammer attacked the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their San Francisco home.

CA prisons tried to help ICE before LA immigration raids


Protesters rally against immigration raids around Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles on June 6, 2025. Photo by J.W. Hendricks by CalMatters




Last month the Trump administration touted that federal immigration enforcement agents captured some of “the worst illegal alien criminals in Los Angeles,” and accused California officials and protestors in L.A. of “fighting to keep … violent criminals loose.”
But state records and an analysis by CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Byrhonda Lyons reveal that the state had coordinated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an attempt to hand over the agency’s top targets in L.A. — undermining the administration’s justification for carrying out widespread immigration raids in the city.
In May, for example, state prison officials gave a heads up to ICE about the upcoming release of one of the federal agency’s top targets. Federal agents did not pick up the convicted sex offender, and so he was released. Two weeks later, ICE publicized his arrest in L.A.
California’s so-called sanctuary law does not shield unauthorized immigrants convicted of serious crimes. Since Newsom took office in 2019, state prisons have handed over more than 9,000 people with those backgrounds to ICE.

What’s next for CA’s polluted air?

California regulators must devise new methods to clean up the state’s air now that the Trump administration has limited their ability to enforce rules intended to combat air pollution, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
Before the start of Trump’s second term, the state abandoned its rules for zero-emission trucks due to likely opposition from the incoming federal administration. Trump and Congress also eliminated tax credits for electric car buyers, and blocked three critical rules that would have banned the sale of new gas-powered cars in California and phased out diesel trucks.
But Californians still experience some of the worst air quality in the country — particularly Black and brown communities located near ports and highways — and the California Air Resources Board is struggling to come up with effective methods to solve the issue.
The state must now rely on voluntary agreements by companies to reduce emissions, and it lacks funds for a consumer incentive program to expand its electric vehicle market. The board’s updated fuel standards also faced strong opposition from the public, industry groups and some legislators, who’ve argued that regulations are driving up California’s cost of living.

Speaking of air pollution: As part of our partnership with PBS SoCal, Alejandra and CalMatters’ video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment about how air regulators in Southern California rejected proposed rules that would have reduced smog by phasing out gas-powered water heaters.

With 7 of its most ambitious rules for cars, trucks and trains repealed, California officials now must find new ways to clean up the nation’s worst air pollution. But officials face growing pushback about affordability and costs.



At an electric vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Christopher Grundler — one of the top executives in California responsible for cleaning the air — said despite all the setbacks his agency has faced this year, he’s confident the state can keep making progress. 
“This president, this Congress, will not kill the electric car,” said Grundler, a deputy executive officer of the state Air Resources Board. “They won’t kill the electric truck, and they certainly won’t kill the California spirit.”
Despite that optimism, California officials — now reined in by the Trump administration and growing concerns about affordability and costs — are struggling to come up with new ways to clean up the nation’s most polluted air.
Lacking federal permission to set aggressive emission standards for the first time in almost 60 years, California may be left mainly with voluntary agreements with the auto, trucking and rail industries, and subsidies to entice consumers into buying electric vehicles.
Congress last month revoked the state’s authority to implement three landmark rules that ban sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035 and phase out diesel trucks. In addition, California was forced to abandon four other ambitious rules for zero-emission trucks, locomotives and commercial harbor craft because the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency would be unlikely to grant waivers. 
Those seven mandates, now unenforceable, were key to cleaning up the pollutants that leave about 34 million Californians regularly breathing unhealthy air. In another blow to California’s efforts, Congress and President Donald Trump eliminated tax credits for consumers who buy electric cars.
At the same time, California’s air quality rules are facing growing pushback from the public, industry — and even some Democrats in the Legislature — because of the impacts on gas prices and other economic concerns.
Air Resources Board Chair Liane Randolph, in an interview with CalMatters, did not offer any details on how the agency will make up for the voluminous tons of smog-causing gases and soot those rules would have eliminated.
“There’s no one strategy that’s going to work. It’s really going to need to be a suite of different things,” Randolph said. The governor and Legislature will help decide “what strategies are going to be the most effective, the most cost effective, the most likely to be able to scale up,” she said.
The air board is hosting four meetings in the coming weeks to hear ideas from industry groups, environmentalists and community members about how the state should now approach clean air regulation.

In an executive order last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom directed the air board to develop a new zero-emission car mandate — apparently in preparation for when the state either wins its lawsuit against Trump or when he leaves office.
Newsom also ordered the air board to develop a plan by Aug. 11 to keep expanding California’s market for electric cars and trucks. As part of the plan, the state agency must consider ways to improve charging infrastructure and offer incentives.
“We know that the federal government is going to be completely useless in our efforts to clean the air, despite rhetoric claiming they care about clean air. State and local governments are going to have to do more,” said Adrian Martinez, an attorney with the San Francisco-based environmental group Earthjustice. 
“We just have to go it alone.”
Heart and lungs at stake
It’s been a long, bumpy road to cleaning up exhaust from California’s 36 million vehicles. Gas-powered cars and diesel trucks remain the state’s largest sources of smog and soot despite decades of cutting emissions.
Much of that pollution is inhaled by the most vulnerable Black and brown communities near ports, highways and warehouses. Ozone, a smog-causing gas, and fine particles of soot are linked to premature deaths from heart attacks and respiratory diseases, and increased emergency room visits. 





For six decades, a provision in the Clean Air Act has granted California the power to set its own vehicle standards that are stricter than the federal government’s because of the state’s unique and severe air pollution problem.  
But last month, Congress invoked the Congressional Review Act to repeal waivers granted by the Biden administration. The state in its lawsuit called this an unlawful action by Congress.
John Dunlap III, who served as California Air Resources Board chair under Gov. Pete Wilson in the 1990s, said in an interview with CalMatters that the Newsom administration “pushed too fast, and I think there were some holes” in their zero-emission car and truck rules.
Dunlap said by moving forward despite concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure, cost and the impacts on trucking, California regulators sent their critics straight into the arms of a more sympathetic federal government. 
“They’ve been all in on zero-emission technology, which is great. It’s been a priority. But, they haven’t really cared to dialogue much, if at all, with the users of technology, particularly truck fleets,” he said. Dunlap was chair in 1996 when the board repealed deadlines requiring sales of electric cars because the technology wasn’t ready.
Under the landmark rule adopted by the air board in 2022, all new cars sold in California would have to be zero emissions beginning with 2035 models, ramping up from 68% in 2030. For trucks, California enacted two rules, one in 2020 and  then one in 2023 that would phase out new diesel trucks by 2042. None will now be implemented.

Automakers say the rules were too aggressive and would have led to manufacturing job losses, higher car prices and limited consumer choices.  
“The auto industry has invested billions in electrification and has 144 electrified models on the market right now. Again, the concerns were about the mandate – not the technology,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement. 
Conservatives say the air board is an unelected board that wields too much power. (Its members include appointees from Newsom and the Legislature, and local elected officials.) A Democrat in the Legislature last month urged Randolph, the board’s chair, to resign because the agency hasn’t analyzed the economic costs of its rules.
One new clean-air rule, the revamped Low Carbon Fuel Standard implemented last week, was met with widespread, vehement criticism from elected officials and industry since it will raise the price of gasoline by an unknown amount.

Amid concerns about the costs to consumers, the Trump administration and industry groups also are making it difficult for local agencies to take bold action.
The South Coast Air Quality Management District — responsible for regulating industrial plants and products that pollute the LA basin’s air — recently rejected rules phasing in zero-emission water heaters and furnaces.
The rules would have brought one of the biggest pollution reductions that the district has implemented in decades. But business groups and others were strongly opposed, saying fees imposed on manufacturers would raise the cost of products. And U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli threatened the local air district with a lawsuit if it approved the rule. 
South Coast district Board Chair Vanessa Delgado and Executive Officer Wayne Nastri rejected multiple requests for interviews with CalMatters about what they plan to do next to clean the air in the LA basin.
“As you know, 80% of emissions in our region come from mobile sources — planes, trains, ships, heavy-duty trucks — all of which we do not have federal regulatory authority over,” said Nahal Mogharabi, spokesperson for the agency.
She directed all questions to Trump’s EPA.  
What else can the state do?
Last month at the clean-vehicle showcase in Anaheim, Brett Ivy, a fleet manager for the aerospace company Northrop Grumman, wandered through Angel Stadium’s parking lot, looking at electric trucks and machines that he could potentially buy for his company. 
Ivy knows the state isn’t enforcing its truck mandates, so he doesn’t know what his bosses will direct him to do in the future. He said they could abandon electric vehicles altogether. 
But Ivy added, who knows what the next administration would bring, and Northrop Grumman has to think long-term. He wants to be prepared to do his job managing the company’s fleet of trucks.
“If we don’t, a new administration might reverse what (Trump) did,” he said. “Then you’re behind.” 
The trucking industry, when the mandate was approved in 2023, predicted economic chaos and dysfunction and that it would “fail pretty spectacularly.” With its repeal, Nick Chiappe of the California Trucking Association expects that fleet owners will keep buying hydrogen and electric trucks when it makes economic sense, such as with smaller vehicles with shorter hauls.
“The industry will continue to work with (the air board) on reasonable steps to advance zero-emissions technology but maintain that the programs being rolled back were infeasible from the moment they were proposed,” Chiappe said.

Experts and advocates say California will have to approach clean air policy from many angles — mandates and incentives.
“There is still work that can be done,” said Martinez of Earthjustice. It’ll require “being creative and not losing steam,” he said. “These are big hits (from Trump) but I think still continuing to press on zero-emission vehicles is going to be really critical.” 
Craig Segall, a former deputy executive officer for the state Air Resources Board, said the state should set new standards for cars and trucks. “The only thing that EPA is barred from doing is issuing substantially the same – not similar – waivers in the future,” he said. “The state can actually do quite a lot in terms of new standards.”
Segall said the state also should support companies that have already been buying zero-emission trucks with financing programs and get at the root of the transportation problem by expanding mass transit.
“There’s a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don’t wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.” MARY NICHOLS, FORMER CHAIR OF THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD
Offering incentives to consumers buying clean cars and trucks will be key. But Grundler, when asked whether California has the funds for more incentive programs, answered bluntly: No. 
The state’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, paid for by its cap and trade market program, typically has around $4 billion for programs related to climate change and air pollution. But because of the large deficit this year, the new budget allocated about $1.5 billion of those cap and trade funds to Cal Fire for fire prevention. It’s unclear how much will be left over for other projects.
In the state’s new budget, $132 million is allocated over the next fiscal year for an air board program offering incentives to truck fleet buyers.There also are creative ways that the state can encourage the purchase of electric cars, said Mary Nichols, the longtime chair of the air board under two previous governors and Newsom. Registration fees or sales taxes could be based on whether a car is gas-powered or electric, she said.
“The state of California has authority over everything relating to what cars can operate on our roads, as long as we’re not violating any constitutional requirements that deal with commerce between the states,” Nichols told CalMatters. “There’s a wide array of things that the state could do to make it clear that they don’t wish to continue having gasoline cars sold in the state of California.” 
Tackling ‘pollution magnets‘
Experts say one of the most impactful policies the state could pursue without federal intervention could be regulating “pollution magnets.” These are hotspots, such as warehouses, ports and airports, that don’t directly pollute, but draw high-polluting vehicles, like diesel trucks and trains into communities.
Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that’s released into these neighborhoods because of their operations.”BRENNON MENDEZ, UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW
The South Coast Air Quality Management District is developing a rule that would push the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports to install more charging stations for zero-emission trucks and cargo handling equipment. The district also approved a rule for warehouses that environmentalists call a success. These are known as “indirect source rules” since they regulate a place that is a hotspot. 
These types of regulations “are definitely a leading strategy that California can continue to pursue environmental justice goals, despite the federal government being completely disinterested in environmental justice,” said Brennon Mendez, an environmental law and policy fellow at UCLA School of Law.
Polluting ports, airports and warehouses “should be held responsible for the air pollution that’s released into these neighborhoods because of their operations,” he said.

But while local air districts’ power to enact indirect source rules is well-established, the state’s power to do the same isn’t as clear.
A bill in the Legislature that enshrines the state’s power is opposed by labor and industry groups, especially now that the ports are facing economic uncertainty because of Trump’s tariffs. Assemblymember Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Rancho Cucamonga, said action on the bill is delayed until next year. 
Also, a Senate bill would limit the South Coast district’s power to regulate the LA and Long Beach ports, requiring the agency to consider the costs and how ports and their tenants would be reimbursed, as well as the energy use and impacts on workers. 
Randolph said it’s always been a struggle for California to slash enough emissions in California to achieve health standards, but now Trump’s actions “make the challenge even steeper and even harder.”
“The fundamental question,” she said, is “how do we continue to make progress…in the short-term and the long-term?”

The House Committee on Education and Workforce has included two California universities so far this year on its invite list for hearings on antisemitism. In May, the president of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, outlined several steps the university is taking in response to antisemitism complaints. On July 9, the chancellor of UC Berkeley will address the committee.


A congressional committee trying to root out antisemitism in higher education across the country is continuing to scrutinize California universities. On June 26, the committee sent a letter to the president of Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, following up on his recent testimony about actions he said the campus is taking in response to antisemitic acts that occurred there. On July 9, the president of UC Berkeley will answer to the committee in its next hearing.
University presidents are under increasing pressure to answer for what lawmakers are calling hate and discrimination toward Jewish students and faculty. While both Republican and Democratic committee members have denounced antisemitism during the hearings, some question where the line gets drawn between free speech and hate speech.
Many of the universities that have been called to testify before the House Committee on Education and Workforce are among the nation’s most elite schools. However, the Republican chair of the committee, Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, told CalMatters in a written statement that “antisemitism is a widespread problem across the country,” which is why the committee specifically chose Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo’s president Jeffrey Armstrong to testify on May 7.
“We sought out colleges that fit this criteria and offered diverse school settings across the country. We also sought out a balance of public and private schools. Cal Poly also had several incidents of antisemitism that stood out and were a concern to the Committee,” according to the statement attributed to Walberg, who his press team said did not have time for an interview.
The hearing placed Cal Poly in the national spotlight amid concerns over antisemitism on college campuses and heightened political scrutiny of higher education. Under former President Joe Biden, the House committee last year questioned university leaders across the country, including UCLA, about campus policies and safety after the Israel-Hamas war sparked protests on both sides of the issue. Three university presidents, from Harvard, University of Pennsylvania and Columbia, resigned from their positions after testifying last year. 
So far this year, during President Donald Trump’s second term, the Department of Justice has formed a task force to investigate antisemitism on campuses, including UCLA, UC Berkeley and University of Southern California, and the House committee has announced investigations into at least nine universities. 
While no university leaders who have testified before the committee have resigned this year, the Trump administration has frozen federal funding to institutions for alleged antisemitism. Following the administration’s policy to deny research grants to universities that allow the boycott of Israel, UC President Michael Drake sent a letter to all campus officials on July 2 affirming that boycotts of businesses based on affiliations with any country are against UC policy. 
In May, Armstrong spoke before the House committee alongside officials from Haverford College and DePaul University. All three universities received “F” scores in March from the Anti-Defamation League, an international non-governmental, non-partisan organization that combats antisemitism. While other presidents in that hearing faced intense questioning, Armstrong talked for less than eight minutes of the three-hour hearing and did not receive the grilling his counterparts did. 
In a letter to Armstrong prior to the hearing, the House committee referenced the Anti-Defamation League’s report card, reports of Jewish students being verbally harassed, and graffiti on school buildings with phrases such as “From Gaza to Cal Poly, let the intifada spread.” 
The committee questioned Armstrong mostly about the extent of disciplinary action on his campus, while the other presidents were questioned deeper about what lawmakers described as the schools’ inaction as they received antisemitism complaints.   
“Calling for the death of any group or harassing or discriminating would be subject to discipline,” Armstrong said at the hearing. “For students, it could be suspension. If repeated, expulsion. We also have procedures for our faculty and staff that could result in discipline.”
Armstrong reported during the hearing that, as a result of acts the university deemed antisemitic in 2024, six students were disciplined ranging from suspension for two quarters to deferred suspension to probation.
Cal Poly’s report card was changed to “D” on April 4 after the university enacted policy changes. In a campuswide email on April 2, Armstrong announced the formation of an antisemitism task force, which will have its first meeting this fall. The task force will use data from a Jewish climate survey to draft a plan supporting Jewish life, antisemitism education and cultural awareness, according to the email. 
The university will also require mandatory student training on antisemitism awareness and endow a chair of Jewish studies. Armstrong reported during the testimony that the number of Jewish students at the campus has doubled since 2011. 
In his written statement to CalMatters, Walberg noted the follow-up letter the committee sent to Armstrong on June 26 asking for more details on these plans. “I will be curious to see whether these efforts help improve the well-being of Jewish students at Cal Poly,” Walberg wrote to CalMatters.
Cal Poly students speak up about antisemitism
Vandals spray-painted several phrases, including “divest from genocide,” on Cal Poly buildings on Halloween 2024. Avi Shapiro, a materials engineering senior, reported the graffiti to campus police after he heard about it from another student. The Cal Poly Police Department investigated the vandalism, but the case is not moving forward because of insufficient evidence, according to university spokesperson Matt Lazier.
“I think the university did a wonderful job with the incident,” said Shapiro, who is Jewish. “They were able to clean everything that night. The people that vandalized clearly wanted to get a message across.” 
Shapiro co-wrote a letter with another student to the House committee in support of Armstrong’s testimony. The local Chabad and Hillel groups also wrote a letter of support. 
“Many campuses have faced significant antisemitism, including Cal Poly,” San Luis Obispo Hillel Executive Director Lauren Bandari wrote in an email to CalMatters. “While it is deeply disappointing that this climate has necessitated congressional hearings, we look forward to continuing to work with the Cal Poly administration to ensure Jewish students feel as safe and welcome as any other student.”
Leora Feinsmith, a junior at Cal Poly studying public health, supports Armstrong’s efforts. As a Jewish student, she said she has not always felt comfortable sharing her identity with people around campus. She believes new campuswide initiatives could make a difference but it’s too soon to tell. 
“I think we’ll have to do a progress report and see if things are all talk or if things actually create action,” Feinsmith told CalMatters.
Feinsmith shared her concerns about antisemitism during the public comment session of the Cal State Board of Trustees meeting on May 20. 
“I expect better from the CSU system,” Feinsmith told the trustees. “Antisemitism is not a political issue. It’s about our basic dignity and right to feel safe on campus. So, look at us, listen to us. We are your students, and we’re hurting.”
The subpoena letter to Armstrong included a reference to one event in which an unnamed Cal Poly professor allegedly verbally harassed Jewish students on April 4, 2024 at a community Hillel and Mustangs United for Israel event. Adira Fogelman, a business sophomore at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, did not want to be interviewed for this story but sent a statement to CalMatters recalling the event. 
“[The professor] identified me as a Zionist and equated me to a member of the KKK,” Fogelman, who is Jewish, wrote to CalMatters, adding that the same professor – who she did not name – used profanity in reference to Israel and shoved a Palestinian flag in student’s faces. She reported the incident to the campus Civil Rights and Compliance Office. However, she said the process of reporting harassment is long and burdensome, which she believes discourages students from formally reporting incidents.
When asked for confirmation of this incident and whether the faculty member faced consequences, university spokesperson Lazier emailed this response: “Employee privacy concerns prevent the university from acknowledging or offering comment on specific pending personnel matters.”
Last year, universities including USC and UC San Diego had large pro-Palestinian encampments and protests that resulted in dozens of arrests. Both institutions have “C” scores from the Anti-Defamation League. UCLA had more than 200 arrests and received a “D.” Pro-Palestinian Cal Poly students and faculty protested the war in Gaza with demonstrations on campus that resulted in eight arrests last spring.
Pro-Palestinian students in California have also reported violence, harassment and intimidation. Notably, counterprotesters attacked the pro-Palestinian encampment at UCLA in May 2024, resulting in injuries and national scrutiny about how the melee unfolded. Islamophobia has also affected college campuses since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023. One study out of The University of Chicago showed that within three months of the start of the war, 56% of Jewish college students and 52% of Muslim college students felt personally in danger.
Defining antisemitism complicates campus policies
Questioning Israel’s right to exist may be considered antisemitism under the Trump administration. During his first term, Trump issued an executive order federally defining antisemitism to include certain forms of anti-Zionist expression, aligning with the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s examples of antisemitism. One example includes criticism that denies “the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor.”
Trump’s executive order says antisemitism may violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, but does not cover discrimination based solely on religious belief. While the Department of Education has “interpreted Title VI to reach religious discrimination when it overlaps with race or national origin discrimination,” case law is sparse and inconsistent, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Violating the Title VI anti-discrimination law can result in loss of federal funding or legal action, according to the Library of Congress.But executive orders aren’t law, said Catherine Lhamon, former assistant secretary for civil rights in the U.S. Department of Education, at a journalism conference in May. “Executive orders bind federal agencies about what the president directs those federal agencies to do. They don’t create law.” When asked about Trump’s antisemitism executive order, she added that schools and colleges “have an opportunity to challenge that in court, and they are not bound by the administration’s interpretation.” Llamon was recently named executive director of the Edley Center on Law & Democracy at UC Berkeley Law.
David Cole, a Georgetown Law professor, spoke at the May 7 House committee hearing by invitation from the Democratic representatives. He said members of the committee throughout the hearings repeatedly conflate any criticism of Israel or Zionism as discrimination, both of which are constitutionally protected.
He told the committee antisemitism only violates Title VI in narrow circumstances: when the speech is targeting an individual’s Jewish identity and when the speech is so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it denies equal access to an education.
“That’s a very high standard,” Cole said in the hearing. “It’s almost never been met in the case law.” 
Even within non-profit organizations that combat antisemitism, Jewish scholars debate whether criticism of Israel is antisemitic. The Nexus Project holds that criticism of Israel should not be seen as necessarily antisemitic, while Stand With Us believes much of what is labeled “criticism of Israel” is actually rooted in antisemitism.
The Nexus Project’s campus guide for identifying antisemitism deems the term “intifada,” which means “shaking off” in Arabic, as not antisemitic on its face. The guide explains that the term has come to mean “resistance to oppression and especially Palestinian resistance to Israeli occupation.” Further, if the term intifada is referring to the removal of all Jews in Israel, then it would be antisemitic.
UC Berkeley associate professor of history and Jewish studies Ethan Katz was on the task force that created the Nexus guide, and he says that slogans like “let the intifada spread” will disproportionately impact Jewish community members. Katz acknowledged the emotional impact such language can have on Jewish communities. At the same time, he expressed concern that some efforts to address antisemitism are being politicized.
“I am sure that there are people involved in holding these hearings who care about antisemitism on campus and are understandably enraged by things that they’ve seen happen over the last 18 months,” Katz said. However, he thinks that “the overarching motivation for many of these people is to use this as a way of attacking higher education. This means that they are using Jews as a kind of pawn to play a political game.”
The American Jewish Committee recently released a statement in support of the federal government investigating antisemitism on college campuses. Still, the committee warns that actions against campuses, like canceling research grants and shutting down academic freedom, have become too broad and could imperil innovation and detract from the fight against antisemitism. 
During the May 7 congressional hearing, many of the Democratic representatives on the House committee questioned whether the federal administration could effectively address antisemitism and other forms of discrimination on campus if the Office of Civil Rights is closed. The office operates under the U.S. Department of Education, which Trump has called for dismantling. Rep. Bobby Scott, a Democrat from Virginia, said of the 12,000 current Office of Civil Rights complaints, only 144 relate to discrimination based on national origin involving religion, which includes antisemitism. 
A federal judge blocked the Trump administration on May 22 from firing Department of Education employees, saying this is an act only Congress can do, and called for hiring back over 2,000 employees.

Universities navigate federal scrutiny
Earlier this year, the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in funding for Harvard and other institutions due to their handling of campus activism and antisemitism. The Department of Education is investigating dozens of universities for antisemitic discrimination and harassment. 
Leaders from over 600 universities around the country have signed a joint statement from the American Association of Colleges and Universities and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences condemning “unprecedented government overreach and political interference,” including nine of 10 UC chancellors and 14 of 23 Cal State presidents. The UC system President Michael Drake signed, but the Cal State system Chancellor Mildred Garcia did not. 
Armstrong declined to sign the statement because Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo has no role in determining public policy, according to Lazier, the university spokesperson. A letter signed by 284 faculty members urged Armstrong to publicly support Harvard and sign the statement. 
UC Berkeley’s chancellor did sign the statement. When Lyons testifies before the House committee in July, he will appear alongside top officials from Georgetown University and The City University of New York. Both UC Berkeley and the House committee denied CalMatters’ request for the letter sent to Lyons requesting his appearance and outlining key concerns.
In his statement to CalMatters, the committee chair Walberg noted only that “The July 9th hearing will focus on the factors underlying antisemitic upheaval and hatred on campus. Until these factors—such as foreign funding and antisemitic student and faculty groups—are addressed, antisemitism will persist. Several of these factors have long been present at Berkeley, and Berkeley has failed to effectively respond.”
UC Berkeley spokesperson Dan Mogulof sent a written response to CalMatters acknowledging the campus is dealing with antisemitism and needs to combat it. He wrote, “Chancellor Lyons looks forward to testifying before the committee to share how the campus has been investing, and continues to invest, in resources and programs designed to prevent and address antisemitism on the Berkeley campus.”

County activist impacted by the Chiquita Canyon Landfill.","Guest Commentary written by

Yasmina Valdivia
Yasmina Valdivia is an activist and longtime resident of Val Verde, a town in Los Angeles County.


The Los Angeles County community of Val Verde has been my home for 48 years. It’s where I grew up, where I raised my children and where my husband and I plan to retire. It used to be the kind of place where people said “hi” to each other on the street, kids rode their bikes around and you didn’t have to think twice about the air you were breathing. 
However, what used to be clean, breathable air is now filled with the stench and pollution coming from the Chiquita Canyon Landfill. Alarmingly, the air isn’t just unpleasant anymore — it’s toxic.
For years, my neighbors and I have been sounding the alarm over the noxious pollution being emitted by the landfill. Myself, and my friends and family, have experienced chronic symptoms like headaches, rashes, burning eyes and constant nausea. People complain of migraines, asthma attacks, stomach issues and even reproductive problems. 
California’s landfills also emit huge amounts of the highly pollutant greenhouse gas, methane, which are a major contributor to global warming. In 2023 alone, estimated methane emissions from California’s landfills were equivalent to more than 5 million cars on the road. Greenhouse gasses are exacerbating natural disasters, like the horrible January wildfires that the Los Angeles area is still recovering from.
There are people with the power to do something about this. The California Air Resources Board sets standards for how landfill operators find and control methane emissions. Those standards, called the Landfill Methane Rule, haven’t been updated since 2010. That’s 15 years ago. And while the air resources board is currently considering updates to the rules, they’re moving far too slow and trying to get away with the bare minimum.
CARB’s most recent proposed updates to landfill regulations fail to include basic, proven strategies that could protect our health and climate. A recent report by Industrious Labs found that making common-sense updates to how landfills operate could slash methane emissions in half by 2050. Reducing methane also means reducing dangerous co-pollutants that make people sick. 
One survey found that the vast majority of Val Verde residents experience frequent headaches. That’s not normal. And it’s only gotten worse — in 2024 alone, more than 14,000 complaints about the landfill were submitted to the South Coast Air Quality Management District.
I’ve learned that, while Val Verde’s situation is devastating, it’s unfortunately not unique. There are over 300 landfills across the state, and many — like Newby Island in Milpitas, Clover Flat Landfill in Calistoga and Avenal Landfill in Avenal — have also been in the news for making nearby residents sick. That’s because landfills emit health-harming pollutants like benzene, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds. 
Like Val Verde, where nearly 60% of residents are Hispanic, communities of color are often the ones bearing the brunt of landfill pollution. It’s no coincidence that 70% of California’s highest-emitting landfills are located in these communities, a report by Industrious Labs found. Communities like mine are paying the price in doctor’s bills, in sick days, in missed school and in lives shortened by toxic exposure.
CARB could make a meaningful difference right now by requiring stronger landfill cover practices, making sure that more landfill gas is collected before it escapes into our atmosphere, and using established technology to find invisible methane leaks. 
These aren’t radical solutions — they’re affordable, effective and ready to go.  
Watching the people I love suffer pushed me into activism. I had no choice. I began speaking out — not just in my neighborhood but to elected officials and policymakers across all levels of government. I even shared my story with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency last year and testified in front of the air resources board earlier this year. 
Poor landfill management comes at a price, and communities across California have paid that price for too long. We’ve done our part — we’ve testified, we’ve suffered, we’ve waited.

Audrey S. Heinrichs-A Celebration of Life
It is with sorrow that we announce Audrey Heinrichs’ passing on June 25, 2025 at the age of 97. She was held in high respect. Audrey’s final home after a busy life of academia, personal and professional accomplishment and devoted family, including husband, four sons, 10 grandchildren and 9 great grandchildren, was at the Greensboro Nursing Home in the Northeast Kingdom of Vermont. We thank the nursing home and NC Home Health and Hospice for their excellent care.
Mom earned a PhD in Education from the University of Illinois. She was a seasoned educator, and a teacher of teachers. As a University level professor, Mom contributed materially to the quality of education in her home districts.
A believer in the power of early education, Mom spent many hours reading to us, her children, at home. She came from a generation who believed that with a quality education, the ability to read and write well, a solid family background, a person could achieve great things. An early advocate for women’s rights, Mom pushed past the barriers that held women back in the 1970’s and 80’s. Opportunity awaited those who worked hard for it. Over the years she positively influenced literally hundreds of students, both men and women, with her skills and enthusiasm.
One of her great joys in life was her family. She invested herself in the lives of her kin, hosting family gatherings in Shoreham. She played a major role in the editing and production of her husband Waldo’s books. One of those books (Implacable Foes; co-written with Mark Gallicchio; Oxford University Press, 2017) won the Bancroft Award for Historical Writing from Columbia University.  Waldo pre-deceased her in 2019 after nearly 70 years of marriage. Son Timothy, also a PhD in History, predeceased her in the fall of 2024.
Mom was highly skilled at many things. She played golf, she was a Master knitter, and she loved square dancing. She understood gardening and flower growing very well. Her home in Shoreham VT had lovely Peonies, Iris, and Hollyhocks.
Her daughters-in-law felt accepted and embraced. Her grandchildren’s lives were enriched by books and magazines and visits to museums. She actively sought ways to enhance and vitalize her relationships with her grandchildren. We would get lovely letters and cards signed Mom/Audrey/Granny underlining her multi-dimensional family ties.
Mom had challenges as well. She lost the ability to read because of blindness later in life and her hearing deteriorated as she aged. Mom was a great mother and outstanding educational professional and will be sorely missed.

While New Mexico's share of lead pipes in public water systems is estimated to be low, about one-third of water systems failed to turn in surveys of the issue for an October 2024 deadline. (Courtesy of ABCWUA)Just over one-third of water systems failed to submit surveys to the State of New Mexico regarding the status of lead pipes in their water systems, despite a federal October 2024 deadline.
In 2023, the federal government tightened the limits on lead in drinking water and passed a new rule mandating that states replace all lead service lines in drinking water systems within a decade. The rule is fully in effect in 2027, at which point states will be required to submit replacement plans to address all lead pipes by 2037.
Cities, states say they’ll need more help to replace millions of lead pipes

The rule required cities and smaller water systems to start inventories of their water lines, and to submit them to state regulators by October 2024. The state currently does not have enforcement power, which lies with the federal government. Between April and June, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is in charge of the rule, issued warning letters to the water systems.
The letters contained boilerplate notice of the failure to comply with the rule and requested water systems contact the EPA for further assistance.
Further enforcement may come down the line from federal officials, according to Muna Habib, a spokesperson at the New Mexico Environment Department, in the form of administrative orders, which will not include fines, but are more “like formal instructions to take corrective action,” she said in an email.
A 2023 EPA report estimated New Mexico has about 15,400 lead service lines —  less than 1% of the state’s pipes — projecting the replacement costs to be about $1.6 billion.
New Mexico efforts to catalog lead water lines off to ‘slow start’ as federal money flows in

So far, of the 462 water systems that submitted surveys, none reported any lead pipes to the New Mexican Environment Department, officials said.
But there’s a catch, said Martin Torrez, who directs the Public Water Supervision System at NMED: The survey allowed water systems to identify all of their pipes as made from “unknown” materials.
“Now [the systems] have to do their due diligence to investigate and to identify that material by 2027,” Torrez said. “So I would say we’re still in that phase; the majority of the water systems in New Mexico have identified their lines as unknowns.”
About 37% of the lines in New Mexico’s surveys were confirmed not to have lead, according to the surveys.
Lead and copper were common materials in household plumbing, but corrosion of the pipes or joinings could expose people to lead in their water— which is unsafe in any amount, especially for children, pregnant people, and the elderly.
The federal government banned the use of lead for plumbing in 1986, but many older homes and water systems still use lead pipes. In 2023, the EPA identified about 9 million lead service lines used for drinking water in the U.S. with a$625 billion price tag— conservatively — to address the issue.
Officials at the state’s largest water systems, Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority, said they don’t anticipate finding many lead pipes across the water system.
“Many lines owned by the Water Authority have already been replaced,” said ABCWUA Compliance Manager Danielle Shuryn. “Evidence so far indicates that lead pipes were not prevalent in any parts of the service area.
About half of the system’s 200,000 water lines were installed before 1988, and about 10% have already been inspected by staff, she said, but noted the actual survey will possibly take all 10 years to complete.

Officials with Alabama's medical cannabis regulator and licensed producers are optimistic about the start of medical cannabis production in the state after a recent series of court rulings.  (Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector))CULLMAN — From the outside, it appears to be another one of over 1,500 farms in Cullman County, with a couple of facilities and a structure that will eventually serve as a greenhouse. The front office looks — and smells — like any other office space, with their current hemp-derived products on display and a couple of private offices behind a conference table.
But when Joey Robertson, CEO and president of Wagon Trail Med-Serv and a managing partner at Wagon Trail Hemp Farms, opens a door behind the front office, an herbal and skunky smell blows out, strong enough to leave one’s senses feeling overwhelmed.
That’s where Robertson produces hemp-derived products like gummies,  which he has been doing since 2019.
“It’s been essentially the exact fall-in-line with what we’re going to be doing on medical, minus some infrastructure improvements and a bigger fence, so we’re already ready to roll,” Robertson said during a tour of his facility last month.
The Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission awarded Robertson an integrated facility license in 2023, meaning he can grow, process and sell products under one license. But Alabama’s medical cannabis program, approved by the Legislature in 2021, remains stalled, meaning Robertson has multimillion-dollar machinery sitting idly.
“We’ve been able to carry or offset most of our losses, though, with hemp,” he said. “So it’s made it to where hemp was hard to thrive, I guess you would say, because we’re turning so much back into keeping that (medical cannabis) license opportunity open.”.
After over two years of legal wrangling over the licensing process — and over four years after the Alabama Legislature first approved the medical cannabis program  — state officials and cannabis producers like Robertson think they’re moving closer to making cannabis available for patients throughout the state, thanks in part to recent state appellate court rulings.

(Andi Rice for The Alabama Reflector)
“I think the commission and the staff are more encouraged than we have been any time in the past to date,” said Alabama Medical Cannabis Commission (AMCC) Director John McMillan, saying he is “kind of coming around to being very hopeful” that medical cannabis could be available to Alabamians by the end of 2025, though he stressed that is a best case scenario.
But there are still many obstacles ahead, including ongoing legal battles and strong opinions regarding the program’s structure and fairness.
Marty Schelper, founder and president of the Alabama Cannabis Coalition and Alabama Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition, said she was skeptical about the entire program, saying potential patients may turn to a potentially cheaper black market even when the program has been rolled out.
Schelper, who called the medical cannabis framework a “legal medical cannabis cartel,” said she believes that the current system is designed to control and regulate the industry by limiting competition, allowing license holders to “set their price on whatever your product is, because you have none of the competition.”
“They created the Alabama medical cannabis cartel, and they’re not allowed free markets, and that’s why they can’t implement medical cannabis in the state of Alabama,” Schelper said.
But others are sounding optimistic. Ray French, CEO for Specialty Medical Products of Alabama, a company that won a license in each of the attempted rounds, said that integrated operators who can grow, process and sell the final product, like his own business, will be able to start operating within “a few weeks, once the commission completes their process,” as they are already operational and possess the necessary equipment and certifications.

A stalled program

The Alabama medical cannabis law, enacted in 2021, allows registered physicians to recommend cannabis for specific qualifying conditions. The approved product forms are restricted to tablets, tinctures, patches, oils, and gummies (only peach flavor), with raw plant material and smokable forms remaining prohibited.
When the program is fully operational, there will be up to 37 dispensaries across the state. After the licensees have operated dispensaries for at least a year, the commission may allow licensees to open additional dispensaries.
Robertson said they plan to operate dispensaries in Cullman, Decatur, Florence, Athens and Montgomery, though he said that dispensary locations are subject to change. He said that some cities have a higher concentration of planned dispensaries compared to more rural parts of the state.
“So working with the commission, if they allow for us change and really cover more of the state, which I feel like they will, people get more coverage in medicine,” Robertson said.
But the licensing process, which began in 2023, has been contentious. The commission’s first round of license awards in June of that year was withdrawn amid controversy over the scoring of applications. A second round of awards later that year was put on hold because of allegations that the AMCC violated the Open Meetings Act. The commission awarded licenses at the end of 2023, but those have been caught up in litigation.
The AMCC has already issued licenses in several categories, but integrated facility and dispensary licenses, which are required before doctors can be certified and allowed to recommend products to patients, have been on hold due to the ongoing litigation.
But the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals in May overturned a permanent injunction imposed by Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge James Anderson in April that blocked the last round of licensing because it was awarded under emergency rules.
The month prior, the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals overturned a temporary restraining order that prevented the commission from issuing licenses due to allegedly not complying with the Administrative Procedure Act, saying that Anderson lacked jurisdiction when it issued a stay in favor of Alabama Always, a company seeking a medical cannabis license, and dismissed the case.
A more recent lawsuit was brought by five parents who want the court to order the AMCC to establish a patient registry for medical cannabis patients. A scheduled hearing on the case was postponed late last month; as of Thursday morning, it had not been rescheduled.
All that remains for the commission to do before finalizing awards, said McMillan, is to conduct investigative hearings, which can be called by any applicant in the license category.
“We have notified the applicants that are eligible to participate as they want to, and then we’ve turned it over to the administrative law judge,” McMillan said, “We’re totally out of it, no communication, no nothing. It’s between him and the applicants now.”

But McMillan was vague about a timeline for the hearings, saying that several factors could influence it.
“It’ll depend on how many of the applicants want to participate in the hearing, and then how long it takes the administrative law judge to do the preparatory work for having the hearings and then to actually have the hearing,” McMillan said.
Robertson said at an interview he feels that is a reasonable prediction. He said his integrated facility, which includes an outdoor greenhouse and indoor growing facility, as well as processing and production facilities, is ready to begin operations as soon as he receives final approval.
Because cannabis plants can take months to grow, he plans to first procure raw plant material from cultivators, whose licenses have been approved and have been growing cannabis since the first half of 2024, to make the first few rounds of products.
“We want to be that option for people to be able to bring their biomass to us. We can convert it to oil products– either purchase it from them to resell or to produce their products for them to sell in the independent dispensaries,” Robertson said.
He said that with cannabis plants having been growing in the state since cultivators received their final licenses, the remaining steps can be completed within a month.
Because he is also a managing partner of Wagon Trail Hemp Farms, where they have been making seed-to-sale hemp-derived products since 2019, he also believes he won’t have much of a learning curve. The facility, he said, can process 1,000 pounds of raw plant material per day, which translates to about 80 kilos of oil daily.
“That’s enough oil for the entire state of Alabama. That’s enough to produce 3.5 million doses in one day’s worth of oil,” Robertson said.
Once they have the oil processed and tested, the production process is quite quick. They can produce 30,000 to 40,000 gummies in one shift.
Ongoing litigation

But lawsuits have continued. Will Somerville, an attorney representing Alabama Always, one of the firms that sued AMCC after not receiving a license, said in an interview in May the hearings should be conducted on a “level playing field,” saying that applicants initially chosen in December 2023 should not receive an unfair advantage.
There is a strong belief that some licenses were awarded to those who did not “raise as much of a stink about the process” as others, Somerville said, a practice he believes to be illegal and discriminatory.
“I think that’s why they rewarded the people who sucked up to them,” Somerville said. “I don’t think there’s any other basis for awarding those licenses.”
French, of Specialty Medical Products of Alabama, called those claims “unbelievable.” He said that his company is well qualified, with extensive experience in the hemp industry in Alabama. He currently also owns Oscity Labs, which produces CBD edibles and tinctures in an integrated facility.
The facilities, he said, have been certified as having Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP), a set of regulations enforced by the FDA to ensure products are consistently manufactured under controlled and healthy conditions.
“We feel like we are not only a qualified applicant in all ways, but we are one of the handful of operators that are actually already CGMP’ed. I mean, that’s a huge lift,” French said.
Alabama Always has also filed a federal lawsuit alleging the AMCC commissioners showed bias and acted against those who challenged the process. Somerville said the lawsuit seeks to determine the extent of the commission’s misconduct and its impact on its clients, with monetary damages potentially on the table, but he doesn’t foresee it stalling the process further.
“We don’t think a lot of these commissioners have the ability to be impartial,” Somerville said, saying the lawsuit is intended to ensure the process moves along according to the law. A hearing has not been set on the lawsuit.
McMillan said that the timeline for making medical cannabis available also depends on how many applicants participate in the investigative hearings process and how long the administrative law judge takes to prepare and conduct them.

French said the appeals court’s decision to overturn the restraining order was “very encouraging news.”
But the delays can be financially straining for applicants as they wait to begin production.  French said “keeping employees operational, keeping operations going” has been a challenge, as well as maintaining expensive facilities without being able to sell products.
Robertson predicted that he would come out even in about two years after investing $4 million into the facilities. Because of the delays, he said that it could be four years before he is able to break even.
“Between the legal fees and operational fees, and holding all of the facilities and everything else, it’s been a multimillion-dollar venture at this point. We have $4 million of infrastructure sitting here, and we can’t do anything with it, and then we’ve got all the other operations and legal fees,” Robertson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ALR_061125_Selects-29-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

In May, NV Energy agreed to pay Baker $30,000 for the damage caused by the removal of trees and brush deemed by the utility to be fire hazards to electricity lines and utility infrastructure. Now, the company is off the hook for what Baker and others call widespread ecological harm.
“It was a complete blindside,” Baker said upon learning the settlement prompted the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada to close its case on a complaint she filed last year against the utility. “I did not understand at all that by agreeing to settle I would not be able to have the PUC hold NV Energy accountable for the damage to the adjoining riparian area and all other riparian areas.”
Nevada Administrative Code says if a complaint has been settled and the PUC has been notified, “the Commission will dismiss the complaint.”
Baker says she intends to file another complaint regarding U.S. Forest Service land adjacent to her property. She says it’s been “horrifying” to watch the utility, with the assistance of the Forest Service, “take trees above the prescribed size that we cannot grow back and do not have the climate conditions to grow back.”
The work is part of NV Energy’s Resilience Corridor Project, a $21 million effort to “create resilient forests adjacent to approximately 28 miles of NV Energy utility infrastructure on the Nevada side of the Tahoe Basin.”
Like Baker, no one informed David Simon that the Forest Service, on behalf of NV Energy, intended to thin the trees surrounding his home a mile from the lake. 
“If they had, I wouldn’t have thought twice about it,” Simon, a retired attorney, told the Current in 2023. “Whereas, if somebody tells you, ‘hey, we’re going to take out 90% of the trees in your forest, you’d not only take notice, you’d start taking action.”
Simon, like his neighbors, learned of NV Energy’s Resilience Corridors project when a wide swath of cedars, pines, and other massive trees vanished from his home’s view. 
Baker and neighbors contend the utility and the Forest Service are exceeding the parameters of the project, which calls for removing trees and brush “immediately adjacent to utility infrastructure” and thinning the forest up to 1,000 feet from utility equipment “to improve forest health, remove trees that could grow into or fall on power lines and reduce hazardous fuels.”
“This is clearcutting. Commercial logging,” says Baker, pointing to “ancient trees” felled by the utility and the Forest Service. 
“Riparian fuels, such as mature aspen trees, will be removed only if they have the potential to grow into the utility infrastructure,” says the U.S. Forest Service’s Decision Memo, which notes trees of more than 30 inches in diameter would be removed only with the approval of a Forest Service biologist in the event it is a safety hazard, infested with insects, or in the way of equipment.

“Many of the trees felled were certainly over 30 inches,” Tahoe Area Sierra Club co-chair Tobi Tyler wrote in 2023 to NV Energy, the Forest Service, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) and the Tahoe Douglas Fire Protection District, adding that “photos show that thesespecifications were not followed, there were no buffers in place and wholesale destruction of wetland and riparian corridors occurred.”
The project, Tyler complained, “did nothing to improve the environment or make the forest more resilient and the public safer. In reality, this was and continues to be a commercial logging operation sanctioned as a ‘forest resiliency’ project.”
In response, the utility and the agencies agreed to increase notifications to the public, abide by best management practices, and facilitate communication among contractors. 
“Whether they are following through on these things, I’m not sure,” Tyler said Wednesday.  
NV Energy, in a statement to the Current, said it has taken steps in recent years to improve communication with customers in areas where deforestation crews are working. 
“Last year, we hired a dedicated customer communications specialist for work that happens within the natural disaster protection program,” the utility’s spokeswoman Meghin Delaney said via email. “This role, among other duties, coordinates direct outreach to customers, responds to media, and helps organize and attend community events to provide education and outreach to the communities we serve.”
Given her service as chairperson of the PUC and as a member of the TRPA, Tahoe resident Hayley Williamson has unique insight into the project, as well as the state regulation that prevents the PUC from holding the utility accountable when a complaint is settled, however, she declined to be interviewed, given the potential for the issue to come before the PUC in the future.
America’s forests are increasingly subject to commercial logging, and much of it occurs with little oversight.  The NV Energy project, under federal law, is excluded from requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
The same exclusion would apply to deforestation efforts under the Fix Our Forests Act, federal legislation which seeks to increase forest management through thinning and prescribed burns. The bill is supported by all of Nevada’s congressional delegates, with the exception of Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Las Vegas.
“Under FOFA, logging operations up to 10,000 acres (15 square miles) could move forward without any public input,” Tyler wrote in a recent opinion piece. “To put that into perspective, that’s roughly the size of more than 7,500 football fields, cleared without so much as a town hall meeting. That’s not forest management, that’s a corporate giveaway.”
The bill, says Tyler, “advances a deeply flawed narrative that commercial logging and grazing are effective wildfire mitigation strategies. The science says otherwise.”
Climate change, not tree density, “is the root driver of the catastrophic wildfires we’ve seen across the West,” Tyler wrote. “Logging our way out of this problem is not just shortsighted, it’s counterproductive.”
Studies, Tyler noted, indicate measures such as creating defensible space around structures and hardening buildings against fire, offer more protection to communities.
“FOFA includes no funding for these proven strategies,” Tyler wrote. “Instead, it funnels energy and attention into large-scale commercial logging, which may actually increase fire risk by removing old-growth trees that are naturally more fire-resistant.”
Some scientists are at odds with what they deem an alliance among governments, electric utilities, and the commercial logging industry under the guise of fire management. Archaic methods that are futile in controlling fire are wreaking ecological havoc and exacerbating risks for people and property, they say.
“The Forest Service uses the term ‘thinning and fuel reduction,’ a euphemism for commercial logging,’” says Dr. Chad Hanson, an ecologist and vocal critic of traditional fire management practices at a time when climate change has increased fire severity. “What they’re really doing is selling and removing large, commercially valuable trees on a fairly significant scale. Not only does that fail to protect homes, it will actually make a fire spread faster, and often more intensely toward the homes.”
The vast majority of homes that burn in wildfires – about 90% – are ignited by embers, carried on the winds, sometimes from miles away in advance of the flames, experts say. Logging reduces canopy cover and windbreak. 
“What you get are hotter, drier, and windier conditions that are more conducive to moving rapid wildfire toward homes,” Hanson says.
“The benefits of harvesting timber extend way beyond a healthy forest and reducing hazardous fuels. Timber harvesting also supports jobs and businesses in the local community,” Brad Seaberg, timber sale contracting officer for the Tahoe National Forest, said in 2023. “When forest land is properly managed, forests have both economic and ecological benefits. Regular thinning provides an improved environment for maximizing a site’s growth potential, which results in larger, healthier trees and more valuable timber.” 
The Forest Service did not respond by publication to requests for comment, or for data on the amount and value of the timber removed from the Tahoe forest.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3447-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-07 08:00:40.205261

(File photo by Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)When a 24-year-old Bishopville City Council member cruised to victory last month in a special election for a House seat, he got a lot of attention from Democrats nationwide.
However, while Keishan Scott is currently the youngest legislator, his age didn’t set any firsts in the General Assembly for either party.
Former GOP Gov. David Beasley was first elected in 1978 to the state House at only 21 (as a Democrat). Even younger, by months, was former state Sen. Sherry Shealy Martschink, a Mount Pleasant Republican in her junior year at the University of South Carolina when she was first elected in 1970.
Legislators can’t be any younger: The state constitution sets 21 as the youngest age for representatives and 25 for senators.
Being a 20-something legislator comes with scrutiny, sometimes a youthful arrogance and often being mistaken for a staffer, former and current lawmakers told the SC Daily Gazette.
But by showing a seriousness to do the job, it doesn’t take long to earn respect, they said in offering advice to the newest legislator.

“You hang out like they hang out,” said former Rep. Bakari Sellers, who was 22 when first elected to the state House in 2006.
‘What the young guy had to say’
That year, Sellers ousted the chamber’s oldest member, then-82-year-old Thomas Rhoad, in the Democratic primary to become the youngest.
The USC law student from rural Denmark wasn’t even born when Rhoad was first elected in 1982.
When Sellers’ first session started in January 2007, he felt like everyone was watching him, he told the Gazette.
“Some people wanted to hear what the young guy had to say,” said Sellers, who became a CNN commentator after losing a bid for lieutenant governor in 2014. But within months, he was treated like every other member, he said.
The first two weeks on the job are crucial, Sellers explained.
“I spent mine doing the most important thing: building relationships,” he said.
And by 2009, then-House Speaker Bobby Harrell decided to place Sellers on the chamber’s powerful Judiciary Committee. Sellers thought it was ironic that he was still in law school while sitting on the committee that handles criminal and constitutional proposals, as well as anything relating to the judicial system.
“He just felt like I had the capacity and being in law school … he knew I had a willingness and appreciation” for that role, Sellers said.
In 2008, Boyd Brown was elected to the House, also at age 22. He and Sellers were desk mates for a time.
Brown, whose great-grandfather and grandfather both served in the Statehouse, decided in 2007 to run for the seat representing Fairfield and Chester counties. At the time, he was finishing his junior year at USC. He crammed classes and was able to graduate that December.
That “gave me the whole spring to campaign and knock on doors,” he said.
When the Winnsboro Democrat was sworn in, he was the youngest legislator. And he acted like it, he said. He developed a reputation for being outspoken and unafraid to make the occasional personal attack.
Toward the end of his two terms in the House, he brought his father to the Statehouse to prove he was not “the spawn of Satan,” The State newspaper reported.
“My personal style back then was to make myself known,” he said. “I was young, brash, and a member of the minority party.”
While the 2024 elections gave the GOP supermajority control of both chambers, back in 2008, the partisan divide wasn’t so lopsided. The parties had to work together more, particularly to get something through the more-evenly split Senate.
In the House, Brown was among 51 Democrats in the 124-member chamber. (With Scott’s special election to replace a Democrat, Republicans maintained their 88-to-36 advantage.)
Brown’s job, as he puts it, “was to throw rocks” at the other party.
He left his seat in 2012 to focus on finishing law school. Now 38, Brown is a lobbyist at the Statehouse and has had to ask some lawmakers not to “hold 22-year-old me against 38-year-old me.”
Mistaken identity
In Brown’s first week at the Statehouse, then-Rep. Nikki Haley, who became governor two years later, asked him to get her a cup of coffee, confusing him for a legislative page, which drew laughs from multiple people.
“I probably should have done it. I kind of made a joke about not being page, saying ‘I’m a member just like you are,” said Brown, adding it wasn’t the only time he was mistaken for a staffer.
When Brandon Newton was elected to the House in 2016, also at age 22, he too was confused for a page.
A couple of his college friends actually were pages when he walked in as a legislator.
That’s why the Lancaster Republican wasn’t taken aback when former Rep. Joe McEachern asked Newton to get him a cup of Joe. His reaction was to say “yes” and talk with the Richland County Democrat for a few minutes.
In the next election, McEachern was ousted in the Democratic primary by a 26-year-old USC law student. And Newton has risen in GOP ranks to assistant majority leader. Earlier this year, he helped launch the bipartisan South Carolina Future Caucus, a coalition of millennials and Generation Z lawmakers aiming to bridge partisan divides.
Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey said when he was campaigning for the 2007 special election that first sent him to the Statehouse, his youthful appearance at age 32 caused some voters to jokingly question whether he even had a driver’s license.
The Edgefield Republican said that during his first year in the Senate, a security guard stopped him as he was walking over to the House, saying, “Senate pages aren’t allowed on the House floor.”

“I don’t think I’d be confused for a Senate page anymore,” Massey said.
When he joined the Senate, a chamber where seniority rules, Massey said his colleagues questioned him because of his youth.
“You have to prove yourself more,” he said, adding “they question if this person has enough life experience.”
But Massey made sure people knew he was ready and willing to work.
“If you demonstrate you have the ability, the older guys, the more senior members will allow you to participate,” he said. “I certainly wasn’t punished for my age.”
When Republicans elected Massey their majority leader in 2016, at age 40, they wanted someone who represented a younger generation. He replaced Sen. Harvey Peeler, first elected in 1980, who unexpectedly stepped down from the leadership role after 11 years. Massey was Peeler’s caucus whip.
In a social media post after the leadership vote, Peeler — the chamber’s chief budget writer since 2022 — referenced the movie “Karate Kid,” saying Massey had been the “‘Mr. Miyagi’ to his ‘Daniel-san.’ He is prepared.”
Being a 30-something senator isn’t so unusual anymore.
When Deon Tedder, a Charleston Democrat, won a special election to the Senate in November 2023 at age 33, he was the youngest senator — but not for long. Republican JD Chaplin of Darlington took the title with his November 2024 election at age 30, when he ousted a 22-year incumbent Democrat.
Now 31, Chaplin told the Gazette he didn’t reveal his age during his first session unless someone asked.
Advice 
Asked what advice they have for the 24-year-old Scott as he enters the Statehouse next year, the former and current youngsters of the Statehouse offered similar suggestions:
Learn the rules and processes of the Legislature, get to know colleagues on a personal — not just political — level, and remember that it’s your duty to represent the people who elected you there.
“It’s going to be pretty awe-inspiring … just do the job and stay in touch with the people back home,” said Massey.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SC20-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

Future U.S. Rep. John Lewis was released after 40 days from Mississippi’s most notorious prison, the State Penitentiary at Parchman. Jackson police arrested him and other Freedom Riders who entered a “whites-only” area of the bus station and refused to move on. 
After Lewis, a son of sharecroppers, learned about the 1956 Montgomery bus boycott, he decided to attend the American Baptist Theological Seminary in Nashville, where he embraced the nonviolence philosophy.
 One of the original 13 Freedom Riders, he entered the “whites-only” waiting room in Rock Hill, South Carolina — only to become the target of an attack. Two weeks later, he joined another Freedom Ride, this one bound for Jackson, Mississippi. When he and other riders arrived in Montgomery, Alabama, an angry mob attacked them, striking Lewis in the head with a wooden crate. 
“I thought I was going to die,” he recalled.
In 1963, he delivered a fiery speech at the March on Washington. Two years later, he led the demonstrations in Selma, Alabama, which helped propel passage of the Voting Rights Act. In 1986, he was elected to Congress and, not long after, he proposed an African-American museum in the nation’s capital. In 2003, the bill finally passed Congress, and the president signed it. 
In 2011, he received the nation’s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and five years later, he won the National Book Award for the third installment of his graphic novel, “March.” 
“I grew up in rural Alabama, very poor, very few books in our home,” he told the crowd gathered. “I remember in 1956, when I was 16 years old, going to the public library to get library cards, and we were told the library was for whites only and not for coloreds.

And Sen. Thom Tillis still has a full year-and-a-half left in office. (Photo: Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)From the beginning of his tenure in the North Carolina General Assembly, it’s always been evident that Thom Tillis was not a true right-wing, authoritarian extremist.
Arch-conservative – especially on matters of taxes and economic policy? Yes. Ready to pare the social safety net to the bone and “divide and conquer” the various groups of people who find themselves relying upon it to maintain a semblance of economic security? Certainly. Happy to ram through a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage while forecasting that its demise was inevitable? Sure. Willing to swallow his pride and abandon basic personal values on a regular basis in order to assuage an above average case of political ambition? Absolutely.
But a genuine, dyed-in-the-wool, Trump and Putin-loving, immigrant-hating, LGBTQ-bashing, white/Christian nationalist MAGA-believer? No way.
Like a lot of modern conservative Republicans, Tillis has certainly blown with the winds that overtook his party the last couple of decades. And he’s probably embraced a number of positions and policies that he would have found surprising back in his early 40’s, when he commenced his political career by running for a local park board position in order to champion a public bike path.
But as he made clear on multiple occasions while serving in the North Carolina House and during his 10-plus years in Washington, Tillis’s political values and instincts were and are much more in line with the rapidly withering Bush/McCain/Romney branch of Republicanism than the Trump-as-flawless-Dear-Leader cult. While he regularly caved in to the demands of the bully-in-chief and his hench-people (on immigration, on foreign policy, on advancing unqualified buffoons to court seats and cabinet positions), you knew they were always moves of calculated – some would say cowardly — political expedience. The Trump people knew this too and clearly never trusted him.
This past weekend, Tillis finally reached his limit. Faced with voting for one of the most monstrously destructive legislative proposals in American history — a bill that will wreak havoc on his state and further empower a man who openly aspires to become a national dictator – Tillis made clear there was a limit to how far down the Trump cult rabbit hole he was ultimately willing be dragged. By voting against the president’s disastrous mega-bill and then quickly announcing his decision not to seek reelection next year, Tillis appears to have taken a big step in officially severing ties with the sect and recapturing a small sense of who he is and what he believes as he contemplates his final 18 months in office.
Of course, as mental health experts will attest, leaving a cult — like overcoming an addiction — can be a complicated, up-and-down process. This is especially true for disillusioned former true believers.
Fortunately, in this case, Tillis’s departure seems more akin to that of someone who knew all along that they needed to get away from a controlling and abusive leader, but just hated the thought of being ostracized by the community they so long inhabited and the ideals that many members of the group still nominally professed – not to mention giving up a position of political power.
But as other Republicans like former Congresswoman Liz Cheney have discovered, there can be life beyond the cult. What’s more, and this is important, unlike Cheney whose time in Congress almost immediately ended after she bravely dared to cross Trump, Tillis is now a free man with a full year-and-a-half left in office to do and say what he believes, and maybe just maybe, to convince other disaffected Republican lawmakers who know the emperor is naked to, at least occasionally, join him.
Indeed, with partisan margins so razor thin on Capitol Hill, Tillis now has the opportunity to be the most important and impactful politician for good from North Carolina since Sam Ervin helped spearhead the demise of Richard Nixon a half-century ago.
For instance, as University of Richmond law professor and judiciary watcher Carl Tobias told NC Newsline Sunday, now that he’s free from reelection concerns, Tillis is well-positioned to stymie some of Trump’s looniest court nominees from advancing in the Senate Judiciary Committee – a body in which the GOP holds only a 12-10 advantage.
If only Tillis had had his epiphany before caving on the execrable nomination of Pete Hegseth as defense secretary.
Could all of this be wishful thinking? Maybe.
Blood runs thick and Tillis has already taken to social media to say that he wants a Republican to win his seat next year. But given the state of the North Carolina GOP, that will ultimately mean supporting a craven Trump toady who will be commanded to specifically condemn Tillis, so who knows how enthusiastically he’ll stick to that stance?
Whatever the state of Senator Tillis’s psyche at what is no doubt a difficult personal moment, he’s clearly come to a fork in the road on the overriding issue of our times: Trumpism. In one direction lies the rocky path of strength, honor, morality and making an important difference for the nation’s future that would be long remembered. Down the other lies the path of acquiescence, personal ease and comfort, and utter political and historical irrelevance. Stay tuned.

Not as pets. As protection.
We’d share sidewalks with grim-faced men leading their bears by a leash. Stores would have signs reminding patrons not to bring bears inside. Those that didn’t would have many frightened customers trying to evade the enormous beast blocking the aisles.

Of course, this would be normalized like any other male paranoia. Movies would feature cops staring down criminals, their cold gazes intercut with their bears’ faces. There would be bear sections at sporting goods stores, with staff available to describe the reach and quality of each grizzly on sale. Your Facebook page would be flooded with AI-generated images showing Good Guys with a bear stopping Bad Guys with a bear.
This isn’t a world you would want to live in. Grizzly bears weigh 800 to 1,200 pounds, have terrifyingly powerful bites, and can outrun human beings with surprising speed.
But what would that matter? In this world, as in ours, the ability of some to legally commit violence against others is the only “freedom” not subject to judicial veto. People always have reasons to justify bear ownership. And when one reason fails, they grab another. Any ursine restriction is viewed with abhorrence. Licensing? Authoritarian. Training to handle bears? An insult to our intelligence. Bear storage? Nanny state intrusion.
Cable news would perpetually defer to bear wrangling experts, perpetually annoyed about the media getting details about claws and fur incorrect.
Meanwhile, bears would be attacking people. Because that’s what happens when inexperience confronts wild animals.
I thought about this as I was reading the latest butcher bill from Alabama’s guns-for-everyone approach to public safety. A Johns Hopkins University study released last month found the state in 2023 had a gun suicide death rate of 12.1 per 100,000 residents.
That’s much higher than the national average (7.6 per 100,000) and bad even for the gun-choked South. Only Arkansas and Tennessee had worse numbers.
This is what happens in a state with a lot of guns, a lot of despair and comparatively little access to mental health care.
Improving that system would be great, and improve the well-being of anyone in a crisis, whether life-threatening or otherwise. But a fully-funded, fully accessible mental health care network would still struggle to contain the damage from a society deluged with firearms. In a city where everyone carries lighters and oily rags, you can’t expect a fire department to prevent an inferno.
The Johns Hopkins report has good solutions, even transparently obvious ones: laws requiring gun owners to safely store their weapons; gun licenses as a prerequisite to purchasing a gun, and laws allowing the confiscation of the weapons of people who may be a danger to themselves and others.
In the past, these proposals have died quick deaths in the Alabama Legislature. Republican lawmakers never want to face attacks from the right on gun access. So we have little oversight of firearms, a policy only a party extremist could love.
And maybe – maybe – legislators are starting to see the issues with that. The Legislature this year voted to make possession of Glock switches, which can turn handguns into automatic weapons, a state crime. It’s already a federal crime, but the hope is that the new law will make it easier to get these devices off the streets.
Lawmakers also passed a bill that will allow people to voluntarily surrender their firearms to a licensed arms dealer if they think they might be a threat to themselves or their loved ones. It’s a step, though not one that would save as many lives as allowing family members to ask a judge to do that.
But safe storage laws, about as common-sense an approach as you can get in a state that claims to love common sense, have struggled to get anywhere in this Legislature. And gun licenses? We all but abolished those for concealed carry in 2022.
Roughly half of Alabamians own guns. There are plenty of legitimate reasons to own them, particularly rifles for hunting.
But many Alabamians have a terrible idea that a gun is the only thing that will ensure our safety. A lot of people here marinate in a media environment that encourages fear and suspicion. One that suggests everyone has the ability to properly handle a firearm.
So we get hyped into believing that nothing must block the path to owning one. Not law; not personal responsibility; not concern for the safety of others.
This is madness. And it’s hard to tell how any of this is different from letting people run wild with bears. Alabama has nation-leading rates of firearm suicide and homicide, all in the name of “freedom.”
And what freedom is that? The freedom to fire a gun into a world that frightens you.
If we want a safe Alabama, we can’t allow this attitude to govern public safety. The stubborn defense of the freedom to kill is killing us.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Guns-for-June-17-2025-story.jpg,,,2025-07-07 09:12:40.825061

West is scheduled to be executed in September. (Alabama Department of Corrections)Gov. Kay Ivey last week set an execution date for Geoffrey Todd West, who was sentenced to death for the murder of Margaret Parrish Berry in March 1997.
West, 50, is scheduled to be put to death by nitrogen gas between midnight on Sept. 25 starting at midnight and 6 a.m. on Sept. 26 at 6 a.m. The announcement came less than a week after Ivey scheduled the execution of David Lee Roberts for August by the same method of execution.
A jury convicted West of capital murder in 1999.
According to court documents, West and his girlfriend on March 28, 1997 entered an Etowah County convenience store where West previously worked with the intention of robbing it.
He entered the store with a firearm and held a gun close to Berry while taking $250 during the robbery.
“The medical evidence indicates that Berry was shot in the back of the head while lying prone on the floor behind the counter of the store,” court documents state. “According to the medical examiner, the ‘wound would cause rapid incapacitation and a very rapid death.’”
West would be the fifth person that Alabama put to death this year. Demetrius Terrence Frazier was executed in February using nitrogen gas. The state put James Osgood to death in April by lethal injection and executed Gregory Hunt in June with nitrogen gas.

Amid all the worries about the perennially elusive youth vote, there’s a promising trend to talk about: In a growing number of towns and cities across the U.S., 16- and 17-year-olds are gaining the right to vote. The numbers are still small, but the momentum is real. Advocates say it’s about nurturing lifelong voters.
Take Newark, New Jersey, which allowed 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in its school board election in April. Teen turnout was only about 3%. But that was better than the adults managed. Besides, as Sam Novey from the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement puts it, the city “started from nothing.”
Indeed, adding younger teens to the voter rolls involves building a lot of things from scratch. After Newark passed its ordinance last year allowing youth voting, officials had to rewire voter registration systems and launch a full-scale education campaign. It was about 14 months before 16- and 17-year-olds could cast their first ballots.
“Comparatively lightning fast,” Novey said.
And there’s a payoff to look forward to.
“Research shows that those who are allowed to register and begin voting at 16 are more likely to vote later in life than their peers,” said Joshua Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky. “It’s an important way to increase participation.”
In short: Get ’em young, and they’ll keep coming back. The act of voting becomes normal, even expected. And school, Douglas said, is an ideal environment for that first civic nudge — with teachers and peers available to discuss the issues.
The research Douglas cited looked at Scotland, which allowed 16-year-olds to vote in its 2014 independence referendum. The decision was initially controversial, but “nothing bad happened,” said Jan Eichhorn, a political science professor at the University of Edinburgh who studies youth participation and cowrote the study. “Adults realized teenagers were paying attention, often more than adults.”
Public support for youth voting soared in Scotland after that.
The U.S. has been slower to move. Nationwide, the U.S. Constitution guarantees voting rights only for people 18 and older. But at the local level, things are heating up.
Right now, Maryland leads the way. Several municipalities there have already lowered the voting age for local races, taking advantage of state law that makes it easy for municipalities to accommodate registration and ballots for 16- and 17-year olds. A local council vote is enough to change quite a lot of election rules, including, for example, allowing noncitizens to cast ballots.
Compare that with Oakland, California, where voters approved youth voting back in 2020 — only to have to wait four full years for Alameda County to get around to updating its registration systems, a much longer delay than Newark.
In other words, even when the people say yes, the bureaucracy can say, “We’ll get to it eventually.”
That’s what Novey wants everyone to know: that lowering the voting age isn’t just a matter of changing policy. “It touches on a lot of different systems and issues,” he said. Some cities might be able to handle the transition in-house, but others may need new tech, new training, and a lot of patience and support.
In Newark, one of the biggest forces behind the policy was the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice. Attorney Micauri Vargas, the associate counsel for the institute’s Democracy & Justice program who drafted the ordinance, said supporters “knew it wasn’t going to get done statewide,” despite Gov. Phil Murphy mentioning it in his last two State of the State speeches. So they went local, to the state’s largest city, where the mayor and City Council were supportive — and, notably, where the movement had been “started by the students.”
Not everyone was cheering. “People still just don’t feel comfortable with young people having a say in what they think are only money matters, but they aren’t,” Vargas said.
Even some teenagers were skeptical. “But then other young people would ask them if they trusted themselves, and they always said they did,” Vargas said. “They changed their minds.”
This question is about more than voting rules. It’s about trust — not just in systems, but in young people’s ability to shape them. And like Eichhorn said, some adults might just need to spend more time with teenagers to see what they’re capable of.
Of course, there are critics of expanding the franchise this way. Some argue that it’s a slippery slope, or that teenagers are too immature or uninformed to handle voting responsibly. But Douglas points out that we don’t typically take voting rights away from adults on that basis — “even ones who may be legally incompetent. Yet bright, informed 16-year-olds can’t vote.” Fair point.
For now, youth voting in America is a patchwork, enabled by quirks in local laws, driven by ambitious students, and supported by researchers like Novey and his Vote 16 Network, which offers best practices for cities.
And it’s still far from mainstream. But so was same-day registration once. So was voting by mail. So was early voting. All of those ideas sounded radical at some point — until they didn’t.

Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s decision in 2025 to veto a bill that would have created a reparations commission offers a modern echo of Booker T. Washington’s famous Atlanta Compromise of 1895. Though separated by more than a century, both decisions represent strategic compromises made by Black leaders navigating predominantly white political environments. Each action provoked debate within the Black community over the pace and form of progress, raising enduring questions about the best path toward racial justice.
Booker T. Washington’s Atlanta Compromise speech, delivered in 1895, advocated for a philosophy of accommodation in the post-Reconstruction South. Rather than push for immediate civil rights or political equality, Washington urged African Americans to focus on vocational education and economic self-reliance, arguing that success in these areas would eventually lead to greater social equality.

His proposal was seen as a pragmatic adaptation to the harsh realities of the Jim Crow South, where direct challenges to white supremacy often provoked violent backlash. Washington’s stance won support from many white leaders and philanthropists, but it also sparked fierce criticism from Black intellectuals like W.E.B. Du Bois, who saw the compromise as capitulation and a betrayal of the struggle for full civil rights.
Gov. Wes Moore’s veto of the reparations bill, similarly, was rooted in political calculation. Though Moore — a Black man, moderate and Rhodes scholar with a history on Wall Street — acknowledged the importance of addressing racial inequities, he argued that there have been enough studies done to explore reparations, and the time to act is now. But action without a coherent, community-informed plan risks superficiality, inefficacy or even harm.
Supporters of the bill saw it as a vital step toward truth-telling and economic justice for descendants of slavery and systemic racism in Maryland. Critics of Moore’s veto, much like Du Bois in Washington’s time, viewed his decision as a disappointing deferral of long-overdue justice. They argued that the governor, as a symbol of Black political ascendance, had a unique responsibility to champion reparations — regardless of political risk. What Maryland’s first Black governor reminds us is that representation does not easily translate into major policy changes.
What unites both Washington’s compromise and Moore’s veto is the strategic tension between symbolic gestures and material progress, between idealism and pragmatism.
Washington sought to avoid confrontation and appeal to white power brokers to secure economic uplift; Moore sought to preserve political capital and maintain broad legislative momentum. Both decisions can be interpreted as efforts to navigate hostile or resistant political terrains while avoiding moves that could stall broader progress. In both cases, however, this approach came at the cost of alienating parts of the Black community who view these decisions as moral failures to confront systemic injustice head-on.
Yet, while Washington operated in a time of almost total disenfranchisement for Black Americans, Moore functions within a democratic system that purports to be more progressive and inclusive — raising the stakes and expectations for a leader like him. The veto, for many, stings more deeply precisely because Moore, unlike Washington, holds real executive power in a state where Black political mobilization has shown tangible results.
Ultimately, both the Atlanta Compromise and Moore’s veto reflect the complex calculus required of Black leadership in America. They reveal the enduring struggle between compromise and confrontation, reform and revolution. As history continues to unfold, these decisions are likely to be reassessed not only by their immediate political effects but also by their place in the broader moral trajectory of racial justice in America.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/DSC_0372-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-07 08:00:40.205261
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-07 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The CT diesel fuel tax dropped this month. What you should know,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/07/ct-diesel-fuel-tax-dropped-what-to-know/,"Since most goods delivered to CT come by truck, changes in the diesel tax can impact the price of groceries, clothing, medications and more.","Connecticut’s tax on diesel fuel is unlike most other charges the state levies.
Legislators consistently tweak the state’s largest revenue engines — the income, sales and corporation taxes — revising credits, closing or adding exemptions, or revising rates every few years.
The retail gasoline tax, one of the chief drivers of Connecticut’s transportation program, isn’t the product of any special calculations, but rather a flat, 25 cents per gallon.
The diesel tax, though, has largely been on autopilot for almost two decades, following a formula and updating itself automatically every July 1. This year, that formula ended up producing a drop in the tax of 3.5 cents per gallon, which went into effect last week.
And given that the overwhelming bulk of goods delivered to Connecticut come by trucks, which chiefly rely on diesel fuel, changes in that tax can impact the prices of groceries, clothing, medications and a wide variety of other items.
Here’s what to know about the state’s diesel tax and the impact of this year’s decrease.
How is the diesel tax calculated?
Asked by the trucking industry and others to keep diesel taxes close to those state levies related to regular gasoline, the 2007 General Assembly enacted a three-step formula.
First, state officials would look back over the prior year and determine the average wholesale price of diesel fuel in Connecticut.
Second, they would multiply that average price by 8.81%, which is the effective wholesale rate that’s applied to gasoline when it is delivered to local filling stations and convenience stores.
Third, they would add a flat amount, which is 29 cents per gallon.
The formula would be applied each summer with an updated diesel tax rate taking effect on July 1.
This is not identical, but like Connecticut’s system for taxing regular gasoline. Besides the wholesale levy that’s added to the price when fuel is delivered to the station, the state adds a retail tax — a flat, 25-cents-per-gallon — when motorists purchase the gas.
How has the diesel tax changed over the last few years?
Despite those steps, the diesel tax doesn’t always work out the way state legislators or the governor likes — although this year it did.
The Department of Revenue Services announced recently that, effective July 1, the formula had reduced the levy by 3.5 cents per gallon, from 52.4 cents to 48.9 cents.
“This tax cut comes at a critical time when the economy is facing much uncertainty between conflict in the Middle East that could affect oil prices and the [federal] administration’s on-again-off-again trade wars,” said Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Transportation Committee. “This decrease will provide some relief on operating costs for businesses, the trucking industry in particular, and I am hopeful that relief will be shared with consumers.”
About 90% of the freight — both in terms of tonnage and dollar value — moved across Connecticut in 2019 traveled via truck, according to the 2022 update to the Department of Transportation’s Statewide Freight Plan. The remainder was carried chiefly by rail.
But three Republican state senators recently urged consumers to remember their history.
Since July 2021, when the formula produced a tax of 40.1 cents per gallon, the levy, overall, has grown by 8.8 cents.
Minority Republicans proposed suspending the entire diesel tax in the summer of 2022, when surging fuel prices produced a 9-cents-per-gallon increase in the levy — even as inflation took a historic bite out of consumers’ wallets.
The Consumer Price Index increased 9.1% in June 2022, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the single-largest increase in 40 years.
And the diesel tax would have jumped another 12 cents per gallon in July 2023, but Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature ordered a one-time suspension of the formula.
Is the formula accepted or have there been calls to change it?
The GOP has argued for a reduction of the diesel levy and to eliminate a highway mileage tax on large, non-dairy, commercial trucks.
“That would support local businesses, create jobs, and provide real relief for everyone in Connecticut,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Republican Sens. Jeff Gordon of Woodstock and Henri Martin of Bristol wrote in a joint statement in late June.
The diesel tax supports roughly 6% of the state budget’s Special Transportation Fund, or STF, which gets most of its resources from Connecticut’s sales tax and from levies on regular gasoline.
It generated $134 million in the 2023-24 fiscal year — the last full year of data available from state tax officials. 
Connecticut has generated large STF surpluses in recent years, some exceeding 10%, though legislators and Lamont have committed to use much of those windfalls to accelerating paying down bonded debt on highway, bridge and rail construction projects.
The Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, which represents fuel distributors across the state, has pushed in recent years for the state to replace the formula-based diesel tax with a flat, per-gallon charge.
“Stability in the tax makes the most sense,” said Chris Herb, CEMA’s president and CEO. “If the taxes aren’t bouncing around, it becomes a little easier to sell the fuel.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/IMG_9178.jpg,,,2025-07-07 08:00:40.205261

This issue starkly highlights the disconnect between the more urban and liberal centers of central and western Vermont and our predominantly rural and conservative communities.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sean Montague: Our independent schools are more than just educational institutions, they are social and economic cornerstones.","This commentary is by Sean Montague of West Burke. He is a remote federal employee with the Smithsonian Institution and parent of two — one attending St. Johnsbury Academy and another soon to enroll. 


Gov. Phil Scott recently signed H.454, legislation with profound implications for independent schools, particularly here in the Northeast Kingdom. Institutions like St. Johnsbury Academy and Lyndon Institute aren’t merely schools — they are fundamental economic engines sustaining our local communities.
It’s clear to me that many people from Vermont’s population centers to the west don’t fully grasp how deeply intertwined these academies are with the economic vitality and demographic stability of our region.
St. Johnsbury Academy, for instance, is more than an educational institution; it’s a magnet attracting young families and professionals who contribute significantly to our local economy. Vermont faces well-documented demographic challenges, with an aging population and difficulty attracting younger residents. The Academy’s appeal counters these trends, bolstering our communities with newcomers who bring energy, skills, and economic resources.

Moreover, these academies offer invaluable educational opportunities to socially disadvantaged students who otherwise might never have access to such high-quality education, typically available only to higher-income families. While recognizing that other regions of Vermont may not have this option, it remains crucial to acknowledge the transformative impact these institutions have on the lives of many students in our community.
Anecdotally, many families I know have openly stated they would consider leaving Vermont if their children could no longer attend St. Johnsbury Academy. The ripple effect would be devastating — not just academically, but economically — leading to fewer local businesses, declining property values, and diminished regional vibrancy.
Furthermore, our state senator faces unfair criticism alleging a conflict of interest due to his employment at St. Johnsbury Academy. Yet he was elected precisely to represent and advocate for the economic well-being of the Northeast Kingdom.
The Academy isn’t a private interest — it’s the cornerstone of our economic and social fabric. His support of it aligns entirely with the interests of the constituents who elected him.
This issue starkly highlights the disconnect between the more urban and liberal centers of central and western Vermont and our predominantly rural and conservative communities.
While I consider myself politically liberal, if there is one thing liberals and conservatives in this part of Vermont can agree on, it’s this: we deserve policies and legislation informed by genuine understanding and respect for our unique circumstances, not assumptions made from afar.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Keith Jennings: Proposed NASA funding cuts and their effect on Vermont-based research.","This commentary is by Keith Jennings, director of research at the University of Vermont’s Water Resources Institute.


A few short years ago I reached out to VTDigger about a fledgling research project I was leading. We needed volunteers in Vermont to submit observations of rain and snow so we could help NASA better track and simulate precipitation type during winter storms in mountain regions across the U.S.
Readers responded to Emma Cotton’s article enthusiastically. Nearly 300 new Vermont volunteers signed up just after its publication.
I am now writing to VTDigger readers not to report on our findings or share new opportunities, but to warn of the risks coming to the US scientific enterprise from the “One Big Beautiful Bill” just passed by the Senate. The administration is proposing to shutter the very program that funded our work in Vermont, NASA’s Citizen Science for Earth Systems Program.

While NASA may evoke images of spaceflight, galaxy-defining telescopes, and interstellar satellite missions, the agency also has a critical Earth-observation mandate. Its constellation of satellites crisscrosses the globe every day, monitoring important properties like rainfall, soil wetness, river height, land surface temperature, and others.
Underpinning these observations are the unreplaceable measurements of Earth system phenomena, many made by CSESP volunteers, that evaluate and improve the process of data collection, simulation, and synthesis.
Our project, Mountain Rain or Snow, is a prime example. The differences between rain and snow are obvious to a real human observer, but satellites and computer models often struggle to differentiate the two. This shortcoming worsens our ability to predict floods, manage roadway conditions, and estimate avalanche risks.
In peer-reviewed literature, the scientific gold standard, our team has shown time and again that there is no replacement for visual observers. Not even artificial intelligence can do the jobs that humans do.
We are at the precipice of losing this ability to understand our planet. Without CSESP funding, projects like Mountain Rain or Snow, to which Vermonters have volunteered countless hours, will no longer exist.
And it’s not just our team at risk. CSESP projects have examined river ice dynamics for transportation and flooding in Alaska, water quality in Chesapeake Bay, and lake levels across the globe. Work like this is on the verge of disappearing.
Every Vermonter knows that despair is the cousin to apathy. So don’t think of this as a eulogy for U.S. scientific research, but instead treat it as a call to action, a rallying point for continued American scientific excellence.
Talk to your friends, reach out to colleagues in Republican congressional districts, protest the unnecessary kneecapping of U.S.-funded research, and make your opinions known.

Both lawmakers represent the 32nd Legislative District, which covers part of Seattle and surrounding areas. (Photos courtesy of Washington State Legislature)Two Democratic state lawmakers are set to clash in 2026 in one of the party’s strongholds in western Washington.
State Rep. Cindy Ryu has launched a campaign to unseat Sen. Jesse Salomon, saying the colleague she once endorsed is “too moderate” for their district, which straddles the border of King and Snohomish counties.
“He’s my senator. If you don’t like somebody as your elected official, what do you do? You try to get them out of office,” she said.
Salomon, who is seeking a third term, said he’s proud to be a “pragmatic progressive.” He did not criticize the liberal Ryu, though it’s no secret under the dome that the two do not get along.
“I have been an effective voice for my district, and due to my pragmatic approach, have made real progress on affordable housing, public safety, and behavioral health,” he said in an email.
Salomon said he has not asked donors to “refrain” from giving to Ryu’s campaign. His focus is getting the word out that he enjoys the backing of the Senate Democratic Caucus and the third member of the legislative district’s delegation, Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Seattle.
Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, is very displeased by the brewing intra-party battle.
“It is a distraction,” he said. “Our caucus is a team. We support our members. I do not welcome people deciding to run against and divert resources to run against members in safe districts and in good standing.”
Pedersen has tried to choke off a potential source of funds for Ryu – unspent contributions to her 2024 House race that are now in a surplus account. To transfer any of those donations to her Senate bid, Ryu must first get the donor’s permission.
“As you consider this request,” Pedersen wrote in a June 27 email to Democratic donors obtained by The Standard, “please know that we will view any surplus transfer as a direct contribution to Rep. Ryu’s campaign. Our strong preference is that resources be directed toward supporting our campaign committee and members in competitive races.”
Setting the stage
This looming duel is in the 32nd Legislative District, which includes northwest Seattle, Shoreline, Edmonds, Woodway, Mountlake Terrace, and Lynnwood.
It is a safe district for Democrats. In 2024, Ryu and Davis were each re-elected with more than 74% of the vote. Salomon received nearly 75% when he won a second term in 2022.
Both Ryu and Salomon arrived in Olympia following stints on the Shoreline City Council.
Ryu, who immigrated to Washington from Korea in 1969, spent four years on the council before winning her House seat in 2010. She has been re-elected seven times. If she is unsuccessful next year, she will be out of legislative office.
She chairs the House Technology, Economic Development, and Veterans Committee and serves on the Appropriations and the Consumer Protection and Business panels.
Salomon served seven years on the city council before he got elected in 2018 by unseating the incumbent Democratic senator, Maralyn Chase. Salomon was re-elected in 2022. In 2006, while living in Whatcom County, Salomon ran for state Senate in the 42nd District and lost to the incumbent, Republican Dale Brandland.
He chairs the Senate Local Government Committee and serves on the Housing, Law and Justice, and Rules committees.
Ryu said she told Pedersen over a year ago that she might mount a challenge because she didn’t feel Salomon was “pulling in the same direction” as she and Davis. Ryu also criticized the senator for not engaging with the representatives enough on events in the district.
Policywise, Ryu said his vote to raise the state’s limit on rent increases to 10% plus inflation in a single year — up from the 7% cap that she and a majority of House Democrats had approved — helped cement her decision.
“Why couldn’t he pass the 7 percent?,” she said.
“I am always concerned about unintended consequences,” Salomon said. I gather input from a variety of people and reach out to experts to ensure that we’re not going to throw things off track.”
“It’s easy to throw things off track if you vote based on feelings or ideology,” he said. “I believe it’s essential to uphold our values while avoiding ideological purity that might hinder progress on the most pressing challenges facing our district.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/salomon-ryu-side-by-side-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-07 07:04:58.706672

It began as an evening of celebration on May 18, 2024, but devolved into melee when wedding guest Jonathan Goff and his wife began arguing in the parking lot over whether Goff’s wife had been flirting with another wedding guest.
The groom later told police “everybody knew” he kept a handgun in his car’s center console. So, when an angry, intoxicated Goff bolted for Parker’s car, Parker followed and the two struggled for the gun. Patrick McIntosh tried to intervene but was wounded in the hand as the gun went off. He spent the night in the hospital.
Gun violence in rural America seldom receives the media attention of shootings in larger urban areas. But the problem in rural towns like Salem is more prevalent — and growing faster — than many people realize, gun control advocates say. 
“There’s this myth that all gun violence is in big urban cities and it’s just suicides in rural areas and homicides in cities,” said Nick Wilson, senior director of the gun violence prevention program at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning policy institute in Washington, D.C. “We wanted to see if that assumption was true.”
Compiling Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2016 to 2020, the think tank found that 13 of the 20 U.S. counties with the most gun homicides per capita were in rural areas. 
Of those 20 counties, 80% were in states that received an “F” grade for their weak gun laws in the 2021 annual state scorecard from Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. For all gun deaths — homicides, suicides and accidents — the rate in rural communities was 40% higher than it was for metropolitan areas. The study defined as rural any county with fewer than 50,000 people.
Southern Indiana statistics
Several rural counties in southern Indiana have surprisingly high rates of gun homicides. 
Based on CDC statistics compiled by Giffords from 1999 to 2023, Washington County ranked 23rd in the state for gun homicides while placing 57th in population among all 92 counties. More dramatic were findings in Scott County, which was ninth in gun homicides but 62nd in population, and Owen County, which ranked 13th in gun homicides and 68th for population.
After a year of permitless carry in Indiana, handgun licenses and related misdemeanors drop

Rural counties in every state traditionally have a higher rate of gun suicides than larger metropolitan counties. In Indiana, the top five counties for gun suicide rates are all rural – with Washington County ranked highest followed, in order, by Crawford, Brown, Jennings and Scott counties.
Given the tradition of hunting and shooting in rural areas, “we see more people carrying their guns out and about,” Wilson said. “Then they get into an argument, they get road rage, they get in a minor dispute that might have been just people shouting or maybe a fistfight before. Now with so many people carrying guns, they can escalate to shootings. And as more people carry their guns with them, they leave them in their car.”
Adding to the problem is “the loosening of concealed carry laws” in states like Indiana, he said.
Indiana received a D- rating from Giffords for its weak gun laws. The state has no universal background checks, no gun owner licensing, no restrictions on assault weapons, no ban on large capacity magazines, no waiting period to purchase firearms, no permits for carrying concealed handguns, no funding for community violence intervention, and only a few laws addressing the problem of guns and domestic violence.
Indiana’s lawmakers also declined to pass a safe storage bill in 2024 that would have imposed criminal penalties on gun owners who failed to secure firearms used by children to injure or kill.
Pushback
Gun rights advocates, however, say the real blame is the failure of states like Indiana to address the underlying issues of mental health and crime. 
“The Giffords organization takes an amalgamation of data from a few very serious public health issues, and they label it all as gun violence,” said Charlie Hiltunen, president of the Indiana Rifle and Pistol Association and a board member of the National Rifle Association. 
“Unfortunately, it distracts from the underlying problems” associated with homicide and suicide, he said, including the lack of mental health services and especially in rural areas.
  Charlie Hiltunen
Scott County Sheriff Jerry Goodin called the CDC data “not accurate to us because it appears to use gun deaths no matter what kind.” 
The CDC’s homicide data reflects the intentional taking of a life with a gun by another person, including victims killed in cases of self-defense. 
The agency’s tally includes cases like the 2024 death of Scottsburg resident Edward Calton, 49, who was shot by his brother during a fight in their mother’s apartment, as well as the 2023 death of Michael Chastain, 45, who was shot by his ex-girlfriend’s mother as Chastain held the father at gunpoint in the front yard of their home. Both cases were considered self-defense and the shooters weren’t charged.
“I’m not saying that people shouldn’t have firearms or that we should take guns away from people,” said Beth Keeney, chief executive of LifeSpring Health Systems, the state-appointed nonprofit offering medical and behavioral services at 27 facilities in southern Indiana. “But we should absolutely try to limit access to them when we know that people are experiencing behavioral health crises or concerns.” 
Keeney added that “families can do that through their local law enforcement using the Red Flag provisions and statute.” 
In 2005, Indiana became one of the earliest states to enact a Red Flag law that allows local courts to temporarily suspend a person’s access to firearms if they demonstrate significant risk of violence to others or self-harm. 
In reality, however, rural counties seldom issue such protective orders. 
In 2023 and 2024, court records show that Washington County didn’t issue a single Red Flag order and Scott County issued just one in each of those years. By comparison, Marion County recorded 82 in 2023 and 145 in 2024.
Residents of rural communities often don’t give mental health issues the serious consideration they deserve, said Jessica Staley, a LifeSpring employee and Floyd County volunteer for the Indiana LOSS Team, a support group for those who have lost loved ones to suicide.
“Farming communities have always had the reputation of (thinking) ‘we’re strong, we take care of our own and we keep it in-house,’” Staley said. “Nobody really talks about (suicide) in those families.”
When rural residents do talk about people with mental health problems, it’s not with any urgency, she said. “It’s like, ‘You know, there’s just something wrong with so and so.’ But nobody ever talks about it other than gossiping.”
Hiltunen of the NRA pointed out that the Indiana Legislature continues to underfund mental health services, especially in rural areas. The state budget provides only $50 million of the $130 million that the Behavioral Health Commission says is needed each year to adequately serve the mental health needs of Hoosiers.

Lifespring offers walk-in behavioral services at all 27 of its facilities. Anyone with concerns can also call 833-SAFE-988 to access support at any time.

Staley agreed that mental health services are lacking in many rural communities in Indiana, “but LifeSpring is working to change that.” The group offers walk-in behavioral services at all 27 of its facilities. Anyone with concerns can also call 833-SAFE-988 to access support at any time.
Staley, 44, is familiar with mental health issues from her own family. For 15 years, she took care of her bipolar and schizophrenic mother until she died in 2022. 
That same year, her older brother Aaron, who was struggling with addiction, died from an intentional overdose at age 53. 
“His mother, my stepmother, had passed away a couple years before, and that devastated him mentally,” she said. “He himself was kind of a good old boy. And they don’t talk about mental health — that’s for, you know, sissies and pansies.” 
Staley urges every rural resident to overcome the stigma of seeking behavioral help and not wait until it’s too late. 
“It’s okay to not be okay. That’s such a huge thing that we all have to give ourselves,” she said. 
And that goes for anyone else we see in mental anguish, she said: “Don’t hesitate to tell them, ‘You might want to talk to someone. Have you thought about it?’”

(Getty Images)There is so much happening in the world today, and I find myself asking, “Have we learned nothing from history?” American journalist Norman Cousins once said, “History is a vast early warning system.” Right now, we need to heed that warning system. 
Current conversations and actions around Medicaid are deeply concerning. We must remember our history and the hard-earned lessons that came with it.
States across the country, including Indiana, are facing significant cuts to Medicaid funding and increasingly strict eligibility rules. Indiana has already begun reducing costs by limiting services and tightening who qualifies. Even harder decisions will be made in the coming months as we fully understand the ramifications of the federal budget bill.  
Some policymakers have already stated that it could be less expensive to serve people in large congregate settings, institutions, rather than providing services in their family home or small residential settings. 
This is not only flawed thinking; it’s dangerous.
Indiana once led the nation in opening institutions for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD), but we also led the nation in closing them. We should take pride in that history of progress, not abandon it.
Indiana’s history of institutionalization

1890 – Asylum for Feeble Minded Children, one of the first institutions in the nation for the “Feeble Minded,” opened in Fort Wayne.  
1907 – Indiana Village for Epileptics, one of the first facilities in the world designed specifically for people with epilepsy, opened in New Castle. 
1920 – Indiana Farm Colony for the Feeble Minded opened near Butlerville. 

The “Feeble Minded” were later classified as idiots, imbeciles, and morons. The more “progressive” terms of low, mild or high functioning mental retardation followed. By 1997, when Gov. Mitch Daniels signed a law requiring “people first” language in Indiana code, along with eliminating the use of the “R” word, the term “intellectual and developmental disabilities” (IDD) was widely in use. 

1943 – Northern Indiana Children’s Hospital opens in South Bend to care for children with polio. It later became an institution for children with IDD. 
1974 – Silvercrest Children’s Developmental Center opened in New Albany.  

In addition to warehousing people, often under terrible and dehumanizing conditions,  Indiana led the world in enacting a law in 1907 authorizing the involuntary sterilization of institutionalized people, including “idiots and imbeciles,” based on eugenics principles. Approximately 2,500 Hoosiers were sterilized under this and subsequent laws before the practice was repealed in 1974.
Expansion of home and community-based services
In 1997, a hidden camera investigation by WISH-TV exposed abuse at New Castle State Developmental Center. That began the process to close all of Indiana’s state institutions for people with IDD between 1998 and 2007. Fort Wayne State Developmental Center was the last to close, 117 years after it opened. Both Democratic and Republican governors believed investing in home and community-based services was the right thing to do and continued to close Indiana’s institutions. 
The establishment of the Medicaid Waiver Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) program under President Ronald Reagan in 1981 allowed for the growth of HCBS services. Indiana’s program began in 1990. This bipartisan effort, from Govs. Frank O’Bannon to Daniels, was powered by a shared belief that people deserve to live with dignity in their communities.   
Medicaid Waivers “waive” the requirement that a person live in a Medicaid-funded institution if the cost is less to support them in the community. When Indiana’s last Medicaid-funded institution closed in 2007, the yearly cost per person was $233,600. Adjusted for inflation, this would now be over $350,000 per person per year (Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator).
Investing in HCBS is not only cost-effective, it is the morally right thing to do.
We cannot let history repeat itself
Think about the thousands of Hoosiers with IDD who are now living meaningful lives in their communities — going to work, spending time with their families and friends, and being part of society. Imagine telling them they must return to prison-like institutions because the state wants to save money.
And what about future generations? Children will continue to be born with significant disabilities. Do we want to return to a time when doctors told parents, “Put your child in an institution and try to forget about them?”
We’ve come too far to turn back.
Let us honor our history, not repeat its darkest chapters. The choices we make today will determine whether we continue to build a more inclusive and compassionate society or retreat into one we should never revisit.

Michigan’s top education leader is urging the Trump administration to release nearly $7 billion in funding the federal government is withholding from schools nationwide.
In Michigan, that includes nearly $160 million.
The funding, approved by Congress earlier this year as part of a continuing budget resolution signed by President Donald Trump in March, was supposed to be distributed Tuesday. But the Trump administration said Monday it would not release the funds, Chalkbeat reported.
“These federal dollars support some of our most economically disadvantaged and vulnerable students,” Michigan State Superintendent Michael Rice said in a statement Wednesday. “The U.S. Department of Education should provide the approved funding immediately.”
The money funds programs that support migrant education ($5.4 million), services for English learners ($12.8 million), staff professional development ($63.7 million), before- and after-school programs ($36.7 million), and academic enrichment ($38.3 million), Rice said.
Rice said that based on past practice, “local school districts were rightly counting on this approved funding by July 1.”
He said the Michigan Department of Education, which he oversees, “is working with colleagues across the country and with legal counsel to reflect upon the adverse impact to students, staff, and schools of this withholding.”
It was unclear Wednesday afternoon if the department is considering legal action.
A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, said Wednesday that the move to withhold the funding was part of an ongoing programmatic review of education funding, and that no decisions had been made yet.
Initial findings, the spokesperson said, “have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”

The tax and spending legislation President Donald Trump signed Friday, enacting much of his domestic agenda, cuts federal health spending by about $1 trillion over a decade in ways that will jeopardize the physical and financial health of tens of millions of Americans.
The bill, passed in both the House and the Senate without a single Democratic vote, is expected to reverse many of the health coverage gains of the Biden and Obama administrations. Their policies made it easier for millions of people to access health care and reduced the U.S. uninsured rate to record lows, though Republicans say the trade-off was far higher costs borne by taxpayers and increased fraud.
Under the legislation, reductions in federal support for Medicaid and Affordable Care Act marketplaces will cause nearly 12 million more people to be without insurance by 2034, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. That in turn is expected to undermine the finances of hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers — which will have to absorb more of the cost of treating uninsured people. Some may reduce services and employees or close altogether.
Here are five ways the GOP’s plans may affect health care access.
Need Medicaid? Then get a job
The deepest cuts to health care spending come from a proposed Medicaid work requirement, which is expected to end coverage for millions of enrollees who do not meet new employment or reporting standards.
In 40 states and Washington, D.C., all of which have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, some Medicaid enrollees will have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption, such as caring for a young child. The new requirement will start as early as January 2027.
The bill’s requirement doesn’t apply to people in the 10 largely GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid to nondisabled adults.
Health researchers say the policy will have little impact on employment. Most working-age Medicaid enrollees who don’t receive disability benefits already work or are looking for work, or are unable to do so because they have a disability, attend school, or care for a family member, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
State experiments with work requirements have been plagued with administrative issues, such as eligible enrollees’ losing coverage over paperwork problems, and budget overruns. Georgia’s work requirement, which officially launched in July 2023, has cost more than $90 million, with only $26 million of that spent on health benefits, according to the Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization.
“The hidden costs are astronomical,” said Chima Ndumele, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.
Less cash means less care in rural communities
Belt-tightening that targets states could translate into fewer health services, medical professionals, and even hospitals, especially in rural communities.
The GOP’s plan curtails a practice, known as provider taxes, that nearly every state has used for decades to increase Medicaid payments to hospitals, nursing homes, and other providers and to private managed-care companies.
States often use the federal money generated through the taxes to pay the institutions more than Medicaid would otherwise pay. Medicaid generally pays lower fees for care than Medicare, the program for people over 65 and some with disabilities, and private insurance. But thanks to provider taxes, some hospitals are paid more under Medicaid than Medicare, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a health research nonprofit.
Hospitals and nursing homes say they use these extra Medicaid dollars to expand or add new services and improve care for all patients.
Rural hospitals typically operate on thin profit margins and rely on payments from Medicaid taxes to sustain them. Researchers from the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research who examined the original House version of the bill concluded it would push more than 300 rural hospitals — many of them in Kentucky, Louisiana, California, and Oklahoma — toward service reductions or closure.
Republicans in the Senate tacked a $50 billion fund onto the legislation to cushion the blow to rural hospitals. The money will be distributed starting in 2027 and continue for five years.
Harder to get, and keep, ACA coverage
For those with Obamacare plans, the new legislation will make it harder to enroll and to retain their coverage.
ACA marketplace policyholders will be required to update their income, immigration status, and other information each year, rather than be allowed to automatically reenroll — something more than 10 million people did this year. They’ll also have less time to enroll; the bill shortens the annual open enrollment period by about a month.
People applying for coverage outside that period — for instance because they lose a job or other insurance or need to add a newborn or spouse to an existing policy — will have to wait for all their documents to be processed before receiving government subsidies to help pay their monthly premiums. Today, they get up to 90 days of premium help during the application process, which can take weeks.
Republican lawmakers and some conservative policy think tanks, including the Paragon Health Institute, say the changes are needed to reduce fraudulent enrollments, while opponents say they represent Trump’s best effort to undo Obamacare.
The legislation also does not call for an extension of more generous premium subsidies put in place during the covid pandemic. If Congress doesn’t act, those enhanced subsidies will expire at year’s end, resulting in premiums rising by an average of 75% next year, according to KFF.
On Medicaid? Pay more to see doctors
Many Medicaid enrollees can expect to pay more out-of-pocket for appointments.
Trump’s legislation requires states that have expanded Medicaid to charge enrollees up to $35 for some services if their incomes are between the federal poverty level (this year, $15,650 for an individual) and 138% of that amount ($21,597).
Medicaid enrollees often don’t pay anything when seeking medical services because studies have shown charging even small copayments prompts low-income people to forgo needed care. In recent years, some states have added charges under $10 for certain services.
The policy won’t apply to people seeking primary care, mental health care, or substance abuse treatment. The bill allows states to enact even higher cost sharing for enrollees who seek emergency room care for nonemergencies. But if Medicaid patients fail to pay, hospitals and other providers could be left to foot the bill.
Cuts to lawfully present immigrants
The GOP plan could cause at least hundreds of thousands of immigrants who are lawfully present — including asylum-seekers, victims of trafficking, and refugees — to lose their ACA marketplace coverage by cutting off the subsidies that make premiums affordable. The restriction won’t apply to green-card holders.
Because the immigrants who will lose subsidies under the legislation tend to be younger than the overall U.S. population, their exit would leave an older, sicker, and costlier population of marketplace enrollees, further pushing up marketplace premiums, according to marketplace directors in California, Maryland, and Massachusetts and health analysts.
Taking health care access away from immigrants living in the country legally “will do irreparable harm to individuals we have promised to protect and impose unnecessary costs on local systems already under strain,” John Slocum, executive director of Refugee Council USA, an advocacy group, said in a statement.
The bill reflects the Trump administration’s restrictive approach to immigration. But because it ran afoul of Senate rules, the legislation doesn’t include a proposal that would have reduced federal Medicaid payments to states such as California that use their own money to cover immigrants without legal status.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)If you’re wondering what happens when history is bowdlerized or suppressed, lies are enshrined, free enquiry stifled, empathy ridiculed, education crippled, and hatred valorized, take a look at Preston Damsky, racist, antisemite, and top law student at the University of Florida.
Damsky’s now notorious for receiving a “book award” as the best student in his “Originalism” seminar. Seems the professors were dazzled by his capstone essay arguing the Constitution’s “We the People” means white people.
Only white people.
Non-whites should have their voting rights protections removed. What he calls “criminal infiltrators at the border” should be shot on sight.
Amendments 13, 14, and 15, the ones abolishing slavery and enshrining citizenship, equal treatment under the law, and the right to vote are illegitimate.
According to Damsky, “The United States was founded as a race-based nation-state for the preservation and betterment of White Americans (the People), as clearly laid out in the Preamble and revealed by our history, it is difficult to see how these amendments (or at least the way they have been interpreted in the post-World War II era) do not amount to unconstitutional, revolutionary usurpations by the constituted government power.”
There’s a touch of truth in this: The 18th Century iteration of our Constitution was indeed written by white men for white men.
But much as he’d love for American society to look like it did in 1788, when the Federalist Papers were published, times have changed. We fought a bitter war over slavery, marched against segregation, demanded rights for the disenfranchised, and eventually legislated our way — slowly and partially — to a more equitable nation.
The post-Civil War amendments are just as valid, just as much a part of the Constitution of the United States, as the earlier ones.
For now, at least: it’s unclear whether this will continue to be the case.
 At home in Florida
Most Americans once celebrated our heterogeneity, our pluralism, and our tendency to expand freedoms. We valued knowledge and tried to foster understanding; we welcomed the new.
Not so much these days, not here in Florida. Trump and DeSantis have made ignorance great again.
This state now has statutes forbidding teaching the truth about slavery and Jim Crow, threatening educators who discuss gender, sexuality, systemic racism, and other disfavored topics.
Universities are scrubbing their websites of words that might upset the governor and his goons: “women,” “Black,” “colonialism,” and “diversity” — even if it’s “biodiversity” — anything seen as threatening to white, male Christian hegemony.
No wonder Preston Damsky, who was raised in the alarmingly multicultural world of Southern California, feels at home in here in Florida.
Florida is also alarmingly multicultural, of course, but our governor — while not an avowed white supremacist — is nonetheless an anti-immigrant, anti-civil rights, Viktor Orban-wannabe whose definition of “American” leaves out an awful lot of people.
DeSantis’ Florida is big on book bans, removing from schools books with LGBTQ characters, books about civil rights, books questioning American exceptionalism, books that tell painful truths about the world.
Toni Morrison’s “Bluest Eye,” Kurt Vonnegut’s “Slaughterhouse Five,” William Styron’s “Sophie’s Choice,” Khaled Hosseini’s “Kite Runner,” Margaret Atwood’s “Handmaid’s Tale,” Judy Blume’s “Forever,” and Anne Frank’s “Diary” have all been challenged or deep-sixed by parents and school boards who want to suppress stories that might deepen and complicate students’ knowledge of the country they live in or expand their understanding of ways to be human.
In Escambia County, they’ve yanked the dictionary off the shelf.
Seems Merriam-Webster might harbor smut and subversion.
 ‘Institutional neutrality’
But nobody’s censoring Preston Damsky’s weird, warped take on who counts as a real American, and nobody is punishing him for being a white supremacist.
When asked why Damsky’s paper was not only acceptable but worthy of an award, the interim dean of UF’s law school cited “institutional neutrality” and said professors must not practice “viewpoint discrimination.”
This is actually as it should be: Contrary to right-wing talking points accusing the academy of “canceling” the insufficiently “woke,” universities are places where you can express unpopular, even vile, racist, exceptionally stupid opinions.
But “institutional neutrality” doesn’t seem to apply to all exceptionally stupid opinions — as Preston Damsky has now discovered.
Virulent racism is OK: The Trump regime is not yanking funding from universities for anti-Black discrimination.
Antisemitism, however, unleashes a firestorm.
The Trump-DeSantis axis has ginned up such hysteria over perceived antisemitism (which the rational among us can see is often principled support for the Palestinian people and horror at the murderous Netanyahu government), that anyone who criticizes Israel is treated like Heinrich Himmler, architect of the “Final Solution.”
Mohsen Madawi, Rumeysa Ozturk, Mahmoud Khalil and other student protesters detained for exercising their First Amendment rights are not Nazis. Preston Damsky, on the other hand … well, he has said calling him a Nazi “would not be manifestly wrong.”
His social media posts call Jews “parasites” and declare they must be “abolished by any means necessary.”
In a neat triangulation of white nationalism, antisemitic paranoia, and (somewhat understandable) disdain for the whole U.S. government, one of Damsky’s X posts castigates Donald Trump for inviting rapper (and Florida native) Kodak Black to the White House.
This, Damsky said, serves to “normalize and glorify the mongrelized stupidity that is modern Jewish-produced ‘popular’ ‘culture.’”
 ‘Warrior culture’
You’d think the guy would notice Trump is not exactly devoid of his own antisemitism, accusing Jews of being money-grubbing and “disloyal” to America. In Iowa the other day, he invoked one of the oldest and nastiest Jewish stereotypes, calling bankers “shylocks.”
And surely Damsky would give the Trumpists credit for their own racist projects, restoring Confederate names to military facilities and starting the process to take Harriet Tubman’s name off a Navy ship.
Defense Secretary “Good Hair” Hegseth bleats about restoring a “warrior culture” to the military, obviously unaware that Harriet Tubman spied for the Union Army and led the 1863 Combahee Ferry Raid into Confederate territory.
Look it up, Pete. She was a warrior.
UF hasn’t expelled Damsky, but the university has made clear he’s not welcome on campus. If he trespasses, he could be charged with a second-degree misdemeanor.
It’s not the racism, it’s the antisemitism.
While Damsky shares many of the sentiments of Trump’s team of white nationalists, especially Stephen Miller, who wants to deport anybody with brown skin, Damsky despises Trump for being a tool of our old friend, the International Jewish Conspiracy.
Damsky’s X account is a crazy salad of the-enemy-of-my-enemy-is-my-friend pro-Iranian screeds, demands for a Palestinian state (has he noticed that Persians and Arabs are not, according to his definition, white?), attacks on conservatives deemed insufficiently pro-Caucasian, and ranting about “Black criminality.”
He’s a Florida man, all right — an antebellum Florida man.
 ‘Illegitimate revolution’
His law school papers echo Confederate Ordinances of Secession: “The negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition.”
At times he sounds like South Carolina’s Jim Crow Sen. Ben Tillman, who thundered in 1900 that Black people had no rights: “We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will.”
Census projections show the U.S. will be a majority minority nation in about 2045. Appalled at the thought, Damsky calls this “an illegitimate revolution” and says white folks “cannot be expected to meekly swallow this demographic assault on their sovereignty.”
 The 14th and 15th Amendments must be repealed; non-whites, who cannot be citizens, should be given 10 years to leave the country; political violence on behalf of white hegemony is not only acceptable, it’s desirable.
Preston Damsky is not a cause, he’s a symptom, yet another white man terrified of losing the power he assumes is his God-given right.
He and the white nationalist Trump regime are unable to accept that the indigenous peoples our European ancestors displaced, killed, or locked up on reservations; the Africans kidnapped and forced into slavery to enrich the likes of Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger Taney, author of the Dred Scott decision (and apparently one of Damsky’s heroes); and the immigrants from all over the world who risked everything to get here, are what make America great.
These scared people should get out more — and read more, say, W.E.B. Du Bois’ “Black Reconstruction” or Maya Angelou’s “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,” or Percival Everett’s “James” or Marie Arana’s “Latinoland.”
Education is the enemy of hatred.
Most of the time.
Nevertheless, those of us who teach must keep trying to blast the Preston Damskys out of their sad, cramped little worlds by showing them the many and wonderful ways to be an American.
Damsky’s probably enjoying all this attention. That’s fine. He will no doubt go on to become an intellectual star in the white supremacist world.
He may even get an invitation to dinner at Mar-a-Lago.
But he won’t get what he wants. America never was, and never will be, a “white man’s country.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)After a recent wave of confirmations by the state Senate, judicial vacancies have fallen close to a level court officials have said is sustainable — but the New Jersey Legislature’s traditional summer recess that runs through Election Day risks a backslide.
The Senate last week confirmed 17 new Superior Court judges that will chip New Jersey’s court vacancies down to 33 after the new jurists are sworn in and assigned to seats on the court over the coming days, weeks, and months. At least two have been sworn in already, a court spokesperson said.
New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner has said the courts could operate sustainably with about 30 vacancies.
Kiran Sheth, a spokesman for Gov. Phil Murphy, said Murphy is “grateful” for the new additions to the bench. In New Jersey, the governor appoints would-be judges and the Senate confirms them.
“Our Administration has been laser-focused on filling critical Superior Court vacancies to maintain a functioning Judiciary and ensure New Jerseyans get the justice they deserve in a timely manner,” Sheth said.
But at least 11 judges are expected to retire by mid-October, said New Jersey Bar Association President Christine Amalfe. Inaction through legislators’ traditional recess could swell vacancies back to levels that threaten the courts’ ability to hear certain types of cases, Amalfe said.
In recent years, judicial vacancies have caused court officials to halt civil and divorce trials in some jurisdictions because there weren’t enough judges to hear the cases. The state’s top court administrator warned lawmakers in April that Vicinage 13 — a court jurisdiction that covers Hunterdon, Somerset, and Warren counties — risked another similar stoppage.
Recent confirmations have brought that jurisdiction’s vacancies down to a single empty seat in Somerset County. Amalfe said Mercer County, where a quarter of its 24 judgeships are empty, now faces issues.
“We would like a full complement of judges. There’s a number of judges that were deemed to be the correct number in order to dispense justice given the amount of cases on the dockets,” Amalfe said. “We haven’t had that in years.”
It’s not clear whether the Senate will meet to confirm judges before November’s elections, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot.
Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson), who chairs the chamber’s Judiciary Committee, did not return a call seeking comment, nor did a spokesperson for Senate Democrats.
The character of New Jersey’s vacancy crisis has shifted since Rabner issued a dire warning to lawmakers in May 2022. The courts saw about 75 vacancies that year and in 2023.
Vacancies are fewer today, but delayed trials are still a problem, especially as the courts continue to winnow a case backlog swollen by the pandemic. Amalfe, an employment attorney, said some of her cases filed in 2021 and involving facts from 2019 or 2020 were still awaiting trial. New Jersey has no speedy trial guarantee for civil matters.
“You lose witnesses. People die, people relocate, people forget. It’s a problem,” she said, adding that the delays cost clients money.
In one instance, a divorce case involving a client represented by a colleague lasted longer than the marriage it was ending, Amalfe said.
Judicial nominees are moving faster now than they have in past years. Nine would-be judges are still awaiting confirmation, and seven of them were nominated in June by Murphy. Five of those nominees would fill vacancies in Mercer County.
It’s possible the state will see a flood of judicial confirmations in this year’s lame-duck session, as it did in the final months of former Gov. Chris Christie’s second term (Murphy leaves office in January). Judicial vacancies fell to nine at the end of 2017 after 63 judges were confirmed that year.
Legislators have at times pointed to the lack of nominees to explain vacancies, and the nine unconfirmed nominees would not be enough to fully staff New Jersey’s bench.
“The Governor looks forward to filling as many judicial vacancies as possible during the final months of his term in office,” said Sheth, the Murphy spokesman.

(Photo courtesy of Kelly Waggoner)A Kansas City man spent his weekends in Cole County jail in June, after pleading guilty last year to two misdemeanor charges for submitting fraudulent documents to cannabis regulators in 2021 to obtain a marijuana cultivation license. 
It’s a license his company still holds, according to the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation, along with a manufacturing license issued in January 2020. 
And the state shows no signs of taking the cultivation license away from him, despite his application resulting in a criminal conviction last August.
“Neither of these licenses is operational and has never been,” the division’s spokeswoman Lisa Cox told The Independent in an email last week. “Due to the licenses being suspended and not operational, DCR has not taken any additional enforcement action at this time. DCR is currently reviewing the guilty plea and monitoring the civil litigation to determine if additional enforcement action is necessary.” 
Cox said both licenses were suspended on Jan. 19, 2023, due to internal disputes on ownership and control.
A Missouri State Highway Patrol investigation in 2023 alleged Kelly Waggoner committed 20 felonies, including identity theft, forgery and conspiracy, according to the probable cause statement investigators gave to Cole County Prosecutor Locke Thompson. 
Last summer, Thompson dropped the charges down to two misdemeanors —  identity theft and deceptive business practices. Waggoner was sentenced to a total of 10 days in jail, served on the weekends.

Without a felony conviction to make him ineligible, Waggoner retained the two cannabis manufacturing licenses held by his company, Red Tractor Cultivation LLC, where he holds 77% ownership interest.
In an interview in June, Waggoner told The Independent that he knew he was submitting erroneous documents but he only did it to “buy more time” in the application process. 
“I didn’t think I was doing anything malicious because I knew those documents, as soon as they hit DHSS would be rejected,” Waggoner said, believing cannabis regulators would give him time to fix the errors. “But that’s not how the highway patrol saw it. I made a mistake, so I have to do the time.”
When the state informed Waggoner that Red Tractor would be awarded a cultivation license in 2021, he said he and most of the minority shareholders had been in a heated ownership battle for months. 
To stall for time to reach an agreement, he said he sent in the same personal financial disclosure forms he used in 2020 for the manufacturing license. But he knowingly included errors in them, like lowering the minority shareholders’ percentages of equity without their permission so regulators would “kick them back.”
Identity theft comes in because he resubmitted pages with the shareholders’ signatures attesting to their identity — a crime the shareholders reported to the division three months after it happened, according to an October 2021 email the highway patrol reviewed as part of its investigation.
In July 2023, highway patrol investigator Sgt. Larry Nelson asked several Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation officials what they would do if his investigation ended up proving fraud, according to a recording of the interview The Independent obtained. 
Andrea Balkenbush, the division’s deputy director, said at the time, “In our rules from an administrative perspective, if we find something and we call it false and misleading information in an application… then we have the opportunity to revoke their license.” 
The Independent obtained a 2022 notice of pending revocation that the division issued in Red Tractor’s cultivation license, with a detailed timeline of the ongoing ownership dispute. 
Balkenbush told Nelson in 2023 that division officials had been dealing with ownership issues among Waggoner and the minority shareholder “for years now and they are not willing to resolve it.” 
“We’ve tried to bring them together and say, ‘Hey, sign this settlement agreement,’ but we need all parties to sign it,” she said. “But we’re not going to go and tell them, you know, that they have to kick one person out … that’s just not in our rules to do that.”
Waggoner and the minority shareholders both agree on one thing — the division revoking the licenses would be the worst outcome.
“I want to ensure that the whistleblowers who promptly informed state regulators about crimes are not penalized for reporting these violations,” stated Michael Allen, the owner of a marijuana transportation company and the director of security for Red Tractor. “For six years now, we have been excluded from this industry due to his fraud. We want to pursue our original mission and fully participate in this industry.”
‘Our dream’

In 2015, Waggoner, then a graphic designer, knew he wanted to get into the marijuana industry, he said, so he volunteered with the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association, where he served as a board member for four years. 
After Missouri legalized medical marijuana in 2018, he and a friend, David Ross, joined the mad rush to form teams of marijuana experts to apply for facility licenses, he said. 
“It just kind of came together organically from friends, new friends,” Waggoner said, adding that most of them had been working in cannabis in other states. “Without them, [I] probably wouldn’t have gotten any licenses. But with them, it’s been very difficult.”
Waggoner said experts each earned “sweat equity” of up to 3.03% of the company because they completed the license applications on behalf of Red Tractor. At that time, the license had to be majority owned by a Missouri resident, so Waggoner held 77.26%.
Red Tractor ended up scoring second on its manufacturing license application, winning a license in January 2020. 
“A tremendous amount of effort and emotion went into this,” said Allen, adding that the sweat-equity group worked around the clock to complete the applications. “This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to earn a license in this industry’s launch in our home state — and we won.”

They scored 63rd for a cultivation license— the most lucrative type of license – which was just shy of the cut off. 
When the 2020 Census results came in a year later, it triggered the release of additional cultivation licenses because the Constitution mandates a minimum number of licenses to be available based on population. 
It meant Red Tractor was in line for a cultivation license. And that’s when a slowly brewing ownership battle between Waggoner and the seven sweat-equity minority shareholders — including Ross — really started to heat up. 
In April 2021, Waggoner’s attorney, Nick Kurt, sent the seven shareholders a letter that stated Waggoner was “the only proper member of the company” because he was the only person who signed the operating agreement. 
“Any ‘ownership’ purportedly granted to you as a result of the May 2016 operating agreement — signed only by Mr. Waggoner – is invalid and not recognized under Missouri law,” the letter states.   
Despite the letter, Kurt asked them to sign financial disclosure forms with their original ownership percentages – but with the caveat that Waggoner would challenge their ownership interest in the future, said Matt Brown, a Missouri native who worked in Colorado’s cannabis industry and is among the shareholders. 
That’s why they refused to sign them.
To secure the license, Waggoner reused old personal disclosure forms with their signatures on them but changed the date and reduced some of their shareholder percentages, Waggoner said. While he believed the division would flag the percentage errors and give him time to fix them, he said he also believed that the shareholders should receive a lower percentage based on the team’s early negotiations. 
The team found out about the documents during a WebEx meeting between Waggoner, the other owners and division employees several months after they were submitted, Allen said.
“I’ve worked for the Missouri State Highway Patrol,” said Allen, who has served more than 30 years in Missouri public safety agencies. “I have never, never in my life seen a three-month Division of Drug and Crime Control investigation that yielded a probable cause statement of 20 felonies be watered down to two misdemeanors.”
Thompson said the highway patrol identified a number of charges, and he “exercised prosecutorial discretion” in pursuing three felony charges in June 2024. But he said “a number of factors” played into his decision to drop it to two misdemeanors, “including the allocation of prosecutorial resources, Mr. Waggoner’s lack of documented criminal history, and the pendency of civil litigation in the matter.”
Red Tractor’s operating agreement gave the sweat-equity players rights as members to call meetings and take actions “by written consent of all members, or otherwise as agreed among the members,” it states.
In October 2021, the sweat-equity shareholders filed a lawsuit against Waggoner in Cass County Circuit Court, arguing they legitimately held a meeting as members to oust Waggoner as the manager of the company. The lawsuit is still pending.
The best outcome
  The red area of the graph shows the membership percentages Kelly Waggoner included in the personal financial disclosure documents he submitted in 2021, which were later deemed to be forged. The graph was included in documents filed as part of the Red Tractor Cultivation LLC lawsuit.
In July 2023, Nelson sat down with several Division of Cannabis Regulation leaders and its general counsel as part of his investigation into possible fraud. 
The Independent obtained a copy of an audio recording of the hour-plus meeting. 
When the minority shareholders notified the division about the signatures in the fall of 2021, division leaders told Nelson they delayed processing the application at first.
 “I think we did look into it the best we could,” Balkenbush said. “We asked questions, but we couldn’t find anything fraudulent.” 
At that point, no one at the division reported the allegation of fraud to law enforcement authorities, they said. The division general counsel, Steven Doerhoff, told Nelson that there are 400 licensed marijuana facilities with different ownership groups.
“And it’s not uncommon there’s pretty sharp business tactics,” he said. “And there’s several that have disputes going on. And this, I think this felt like an ownership dispute… and less of criminal activity.”
The shareholders went before a judge, who certified the documents as fraudulent, and that’s when Doerhoff said he forwarded it on to the prosecutor.
Nelson asked if division officials normally investigate allegations of fraudulent documents or do they wait for a judge’s order.
“This is the first time that I believe the Division of Cannabis Regulation has dealt with allegations of a fraudulent signature,” Doerhoff said. 
Balkenbush told Nelson that Red Tractor had “been one of our licensees who we’ve encountered problems with for a very long time,” regarding ownership disputes. 
The division doesn’t have the authority to do criminal investigations, she told him, but the cultivation license has been suspended.
“They can’t move forward with, like, doing a commencement inspection to become operational,” she said. “So they’re just basically sitting there.”
Doerhoff said the division lacks authority to do more than revoke, fine or suspend a license because of how the constitutional amendment that legalized marijuana was written. 
“It was probably drafted by marijuana lawyers, industry groups, all kinds of people and they didn’t put anything in there about law enforcement…so all of our powers are derived from there,” he said. “We don’t have a law enforcement arm, so that’s why we’re excited that you guys are here to help us.”
Cox told The Independent last week that the division does not intervene in internal licensee ownership disputes. 
“It is the individual owners’ responsibility to run a compliant licensed facility,” Cox said. “If such a dispute occurs, reviews of minimum standards/business change applications, etc., are placed on hold or denied, and the license may be suspended until the dispute is resolved.”  
Cox said the division may revoke a license that is suspended for more than a year due to an ownership dispute.  
“DCR may also take enforcement action on licensees for rule violations, including providing false and misleading information to DCR,” she said. “DCR makes enforcement decisions based on the totality of the circumstances.”
The sweat equity shareholders’ lawsuit is still ongoing, and Allen recognizes that the most likely outcome for them is not going to be great. A win would mean the three new managers — the minority shareholders who were elected in 2021 — would take over control of the licenses while Waggoner retains 77% of the ownership and profits.
Allen said they’d also be coming into the industry with a “negative reputation.” 
“Finding executives and investors will be challenging due to Waggoner’s history and criminal convictions,” Allen said, but it’s still something he wants to take on.
For Waggoner, he said his best outcome would be for a judge to appoint a “receiver” or someone to take over and run the company, “and do what’s best for shareholders.” 
Even if he gets no say in who the appointed manager is, Waggoner said he’d prefer that to the minority shareholders taking over — because the appointee would likely sell the licenses. A judge rejected Waggoner’s motion suggesting this in 2023. 
He told The Independent he wants out.
Waggoner said, “It’s just been a long journey.”

The college began phasing out several academic programs, including its law, accounting and finance majors last summer. Students enrolled in those programs say they were caught off-guard.

Aidan Pearl, 22, graduated in May from Champlain College with an undergraduate degree in law. He’ll be one of the last cohorts of students to graduate from the school through that program.
In June last year, the private, non-profit school began phasing out five majors — law, broadcast media production, data analytics, finance and accounting — announcing then that students would no longer be admitted for those majors beginning this upcoming fall, according to Nicole Junas, the chief executive of Junapr, a public relations firm working with Champlain College.
The move is part of a broader strategy by the Burlington-based school to design a new “career-focused” curriculum for the fall of 2026 “that is focused on and driven by employer needs and student interests,” according to a fact sheet provided to VTDigger by the college.
That effort includes redesigning the school’s 27 majors and streamlining academic offerings by merging or phasing out programs with lower enrollment numbers, according to Alex Hernandez, the college’s president.

The accounting program, for instance, saw its enrollment decline from 60 students in 2015 to 20 in February 2024, according to documents from the school’s Academic Affairs Committee. The law program, similarly, had little student interest, Hernandez said, and had only three students apply in the fall of 2023, while the data analytics program had only two applications.
“Our majors evolve over time to meet the needs of Vermont, to meet the needs of our students,” Hernandez said in an interview. “And so we’re really looking at, where are there career opportunities?”
The adjustments to curriculum, the school wrote in a fact sheet, “are not about reducing academic opportunities,” but are “about modernizing how Champlain delivers education in ways that preserve the college’s distinctive strengths while creating more room for student agency, innovation, and adaptability.”
But students who have either recently graduated, or who remain in programs being phased out, fear for the school’s future, and said the administration is playing down their impact.
As part of the college’s restructuring last year, a “very small number” of faculty members were eliminated, said Junas, the public relations executive. The college could not comment beyond that, she said, citing “individual personnel matters.” She noted though that “no widespread layoffs occurred as a result of the program phase-outs.”
Still, that has caused some consternation among the students still enrolled in the college’s accounting program and others being eliminated. (Students still enrolled in those programs will graduate with a degree).
Pearl, who served as the head of the college’s student government before graduating, estimated that 12 people were laid off, while 20 additional staff members and faculty left on their own.
“My worry is, whatever the direction is, whatever the efficacy of that plan is, we are losing people along the way that would execute that plan,” Pearl said in an interview. “I truthfully think the direction we’re going in is going to lead to the doors closing.”

‘Social capital risk’
The changes at Champlain College come as small, private colleges and universities across the country are facing tremendous financial pressures. Responding to declining enrollment and increased operating costs post-Covid, many schools have been forced to cut programs and staff, or close altogether.
Champlain College is no different. Enrollment numbers reported at the start of the school’s fall semesters have steadily declined since 2016. That year, the school enrolled 4,778 graduate and undergraduate students at the beginning of its fall semester, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics.
By fall 2023, enrollment had dropped to 3,328 students, down more than 30% from 2016. This past school year, the school saw this trend continue, with roughly 3,200 undergrad and grad students enrolled in the fall of 2024, according to the college’s fact book for the 2024-25 school year.
The college’s finances, meanwhile, are facing headwinds. The school ran budget deficits in 2023, 2021 and 2019, according to publicly available tax forms filed by the non-profit.
A more than $60 million bond the school issued in 2016 to refinance its debt — and to finance the construction of the Eagles Landing student housing project on Burlington’s St. Paul Street — has weighed on the college’s cash flow.
A federal audit of the school’s finances in 2023, conducted because the school was a recipient of federal grant money, found the college was “not in compliance” with a minimum debt service coverage ratio — meant to measure whether an organization has enough cash flow to pay its debts.
The college corrected course in 2024 after bringing on a consultant, a federal audit conducted in 2024 noted. But earlier this year in May, the college’s bond rating was lowered, and its outlook downgraded to “negative” by S&P Global Ratings, which cited “the college’s history of significant enrollment declines” in its analysis.
The ratings agency noted in their report there was a “social capital risk, as fewer graduating high school students expected in the region” may continue to put pressure on the college’s enrollment expectations. 
Their negative outlook “reflects our expectation that as both enrollment and operations remain pressured,” the school will have to draw from its endowment or reserve funds, “further worsening financial resource ratios” compared to the college’s peers, the ratings agency wrote.
Hernandez, the college’s president, remains optimistic, and said the school has been “really strategic and worked really hard to improve our finances over the last couple of years.”
While 990 tax filings are not yet available for 2024, Hernandez said the college “made an important step forward in 2024” to improve the school’s financial health.
“We expect to do that again in 2025,” he said.

‘Growing our community’
The school’s recent reorganization is meant to lean in on the school’s strengths, Hernandez said. While several programs are being phased out, Hernandez said schools are being “redesigned” to offer a more fluid education for students.
The college now offers 27 different majors for its on-campus students, Junas said, while more than 130 degree and certificate programs are available through both the school’s in-person curriculum and through Champlain College Online, which Hernandez noted has seen growing enrollment in recent years.
Hernandez said there was a “natural evolution” of adding, redesigning or stopping programs.
Hernandez, who teaches entrepreneurship in the college’s Robert P. Stiller School of Business, noted that while an accounting program is no longer available, students are still offered accounting classes through the school’s new Business Administration major.
“We’re moving towards a more flexible approach to our business programs, where you can study things like entrepreneurship, finance, accounting underneath a broad business umbrella,” Hernandez said. “It’s just a different strategy.”
The college has added programs in years past, including an animation and sonic arts program, Hernandez said. The school’s Game Design major has been ranked by The Princeton Review as one of the top ten Game Design programs in the country, alongside institutions like the University of Southern California and New York University.
Champlain College was also one of the first in the country to offer an undergraduate cybersecurity major, Hernandez said, which has since been nationally designated by the National Center of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity and by the National Security Agency, according to the school’s website.
“Part of growing our community, growing our enrollment on the on-campus side, is really driven by this new curriculum and the vision for what experiential, hands-on, flexible learning looks like in this world of AI, in this world where students need experience when they go out into the job market,” he said.
He added that, “more than anything, we’re just trying to stay focused on, how does higher education, how can Champlain College, evolve to meet the moment that we’re in knowing that there’s a lot of challenges right now for the sector.”
But amid these trends, students and faculty members who spoke to VTDigger say they are uncertain of the college’s strategy.
With fewer professors and academics on staff, some fear it will lead to a worsening educational quality, which could further compound declines in enrollment.
One student, still in the college’s business school who requested anonymity to speak candidly out of fear of retaliation, said the college has relied increasingly on adjunct professors since faculty from the school were let go. The quality of teaching they’ve brought in, the student said, “has not been up to the standard it should be.”
“It’s not prepping people for what they need,” they said. “They have said that they are going to give us the same quality of education that we’ve had in the past — which I think that most people would agree that it hasn’t been.”
Pearl said the changes were not effectively communicated to the broader community, and the cuts to programs in 2024 led to worries among the student body.
“At that time, students were finding out about the layoffs and the departures, because those faculty and staff were messaging students and saying, ‘Hey, I’m leaving,'” he said. “The correspondence we got was very much not aligned with the severity of what was going on. Most students didn’t learn of the full extent of the layoffs until the fall.”
Hernandez and Junas pushed back on that criticism. A fact sheet provided to VTDigger stated the college “communicated its academic program adjustments clearly and directly to the campus community in June 2024, with specific outreach to students enrolled in affected majors.”

‘Climate of uncertainty’
Faculty members also expressed concern the college was not fully committed to its existing programs and faculty members.
According to records and minutes of the school’s Academic Affairs Committee obtained by VTDigger, some in the college were hesitant to eliminate a program like accounting. While the committee ultimately voted to approve the discontinuance, concerns remained.
“The thought of having a named business school without offering an accounting major may have negative effects on the school overall,” the committee wrote. “Given the evidence, and the college’s need to boost enrollment, this seems like a major that the college may want to invest in rather than cut.
“However, given the curricular transition that the college is currently experiencing, that opportunity may not fit the direction the college has chosen to pursue,” the committee wrote. “In such a climate of uncertainty, this was a very difficult decision for this committee.”
One former faculty member, who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation, said it was disconcerting to see “programs that had been there for a while, people who had been there for a while, sort of just being cast aside.”
Pearl said he agreed broadly the school should tighten its belts amid declining enrollment. “I will not defend that the law program should have stayed. The law program was declining,” he said.
But he worried programs with high career success rates, like accounting, were being eliminated. 
“We let good programs die that truthfully, had we put more investment into them, I think would have done the college a lot of good,” he said.
Hernandez disagreed, telling VTDigger that 90% of students who leave Champlain College “are employed or have a successful career outcome within six months of graduation,” while over 80% of students take jobs in the fields they studied.
But “if we don’t have enough students for a program, it’s challenging to run a program,” he said.
Hernandez is confident in the college’s ability to transform and “to really meet the moment that we’re in right now.”
“It’s no secret that higher education as a sector is experiencing a lot of different challenges,” he said. “We’ve been really intentional and strategic around that — we’re designing a new curriculum right now that is intended to be even more experiential, even more flexible.”
But faculty members worry that with fewer programs, declines in enrollment may only continue.
“You have to bring in a certain critical mass of students,” said another former faculty member who requested anonymity out of fear of retaliation. “And if those students aren’t there to bring in, you start running in the red.”

(Christopher Smith for KFF Health News)Four years before Kimberly Gallagher enrolled in Medicaid herself, the public health insurance program’s rules prompted her to make an excruciating choice — to give up guardianship of her son so she could work as his caregiver.
Now, another proposed twist in the rules could mean that, even though Missouri pays her to do that work, she might still have to prove to the state that she’s not unemployed.
The Kansas City resident has cared for her disabled son, Daniel, for all 31 years of his life. A rare genetic condition called Prader-Willi syndrome, in addition to autism, left him with an intellectual disability; a constant, excessive hunger; and an inability to speak. His needs left Gallagher, an elementary school teacher by training, with little opportunity to work outside her home.
As congressional Republicans consider slashing about $1 trillion in federal Medicaid spending, Gallagher is among the 18.5 million Americans who could be required to prove that they work enough to keep their health insurance.
Budget bills in the House and Senate would require 80 hours of work or community service a month for adults who are insured through the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion program, which has allowed states to extend Medicaid coverage to more adults with low incomes. Forty states, plus Washington, D.C., have expanded their programs, additions that now cover about 20 million Americans, including Gallagher.
She enrolled in the coverage in December 2023, after she could no longer afford her private insurance. Before her husband died of cancer in 2019, the couple paid for private insurance and supported themselves on the income he earned as a master watchmaker. After his death, Gallagher was left to earn a living and find insurance on her own. At 59, she’s too young to collect her husband’s Social Security survivor benefit.

The Medicaid program that pays for in-home care for Daniel and 8,000 other Missourians with disabilities allows family members to be compensated for caregiving, but only if they’re not the legal guardian of the person they care for. So, Gallagher went to court to give up her rights to make decisions for her son and transfer authority to her parents.
“I think it’s appalling that it’s required, but it was necessary,” she said. “There was no way I could work outside of taking care of Daniel.”
Republicans have touted Medicaid work requirements both as a way to reduce federal spending on the program and as a moral imperative for Americans.
“Go out there. Do entry-level jobs. Get into the workforce. Prove that you matter. Get agency into your own life,” Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a recent interview on Fox Business.
Democrats, meanwhile, have cast the requirements as bureaucratic red tape that won’t meaningfully increase employment but will cause eligible people to lose their health insurance because of administrative hurdles.
Indeed, the vast majority of Americans enrolled in Medicaid expansion are already working, caregiving, attending school, or have a disability, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
And while the Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement included in the House bill would cause 4.8 million Americans to lose their insurance, only about 300,000 of those people are unemployed because of lack of interest in working, according to the Urban Institute, a nonprofit research group. Recent history in states that have tried work requirements suggests technical and paperwork problems have caused a substantial portion of coverage losses.
Still, the provisions are generally popular among Republican lawmakers and the public. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), who has repeatedly cautioned against cutting people off from Medicaid, has signaled support for adding work requirements.
And 68% of Americans favor the requirement described in the House bill, according to a recent poll conducted by KFF. But support for work requirements dropped as low as 35% when respondents learned that most Medicaid recipients already work and could lose their coverage because of paperwork requirements.
That’s what happened in Arkansas, where 18,000 people lost their Medicaid coverage in 2018 after the state phased in a work requirement. Thousands more were on pace to lose coverage in 2019 before a federal judge halted the requirement, largely over concerns about coverage losses. In discussions with focus groups, KFF found that many Arkansas Medicaid participants did not fully understand the requirements, despite the state’s outreach efforts, and some people didn’t receive mailed notices. Others were confused because the work-reporting paperwork and separate forms to renew Medicaid coverage asked for similar information.
Many family caregivers would be exempt from the work requirements proposed in Congress, but Gallagher probably would not, since she had to relinquish guardianship of her son to be paid for the work. While the hours she already logs should be enough to satisfy the requirement, she’ll need to report them again — unless the state can identify her through its existing data. But Missouri has a history of procedural problems in the state agency that administers Medicaid.

In early 2022, for example, Missouri was taking more than 100 days on average to process applications for Medicaid expansion, a wait that prompted patients to put off needed care and was more than twice the processing time allowed by federal law.
And 79% of the more than 378,000 Missourians who lost Medicaid coverage when covid-era enrollment protections ended in 2023 did so because of procedural reasons.
The next year, a federal judge ruled that Missourians were illegally being denied food aid by the state, in part because insufficient staffing at call centers left eligible people without assistance.
“They’re historically understaffed,” Timothy McBride, a health economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said of the state agency that administers Medicaid and food assistance. “I think that’s really the underlying problem.”
McBride’s analysis of Missouri’s Medicaid recipients found that fewer than 45,000 of the people enrolled in expansion in 2023 were unemployed for reasons other than caregiving, disability, attending school, or retirement. But more than twice that many Missourians could lose their insurance if work requirements prompt disenrollment rates similar to Arkansas’ implementation, according to a study from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank that analyzes government policies.
The estimate assumes many otherwise eligible people would still lose coverage as a result of falling through the cracks, McBride said.
Hawley, who backed the Senate bill, declined to comment for this article. The senator previously told reporters that “we can sort that out” when asked about eligible people inadvertently losing Medicaid because of work requirements.
Gallagher worries about her coverage, because she recently was diagnosed with Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid gland. She said she had to search for her Medicaid card to fill the prescription that followed, having barely used it in the year in a half she’s been covered.
She also worries about her son’s Medicaid. A nursing home is not a realistic option, considering his needs. His coverage doubles as Gallagher’s only source of income and also pays for other caregivers, when she can find them, who give her breaks to tend to her own health and to her aging parents.
But nearly all in-home services like those Daniel receives are optional programs that states are not required to include in their Medicaid programs. And the magnitude of the cuts being proposed have prompted fears that the optional programs could be chopped.
“It would destroy our lives,” Gallagher said. “The only income we would have would be Daniel’s Social Security.”

(Photo by Jane Hawkey/ Integration and Application Network, UMCES)When they last signed a Chesapeake Bay cleanup agreement in 2014, officials from seven jurisdictions set ambitious targets and a hard deadline of 2025.
They didn’t quite make it.
So as they drafted the next agreement, which was released to the public Tuesday, they did things a little differently: Some targets shifted, deadlines were staggered and some goals have yet to be set, awaiting new computer modeling that will show the most up-to-date picture of bay pollutants.
The preliminary plan includes refreshed goals for oyster restoration, underwater grass acreage, public access sites and wetland plantings, among a host of other subjects. And that’s before terms like “diversity” and “climate change” were tweaked at the request of the Trump administration.
But officials think the plan, months in development and still months from completion, will be worth it.
“One thing we’ve heard over and over again — and frankly, for probably since the beginning of time with this agreement — is the need for it to be something that people actually can understand and see themselves in. And I think we worked really hard to make sure that each one of these outcomes did just that,” said Maryland Secretary of Natural Resources Josh Kurtz, who chairs the Chesapeake Bay Program committee that was behind Tuesday’s revisions.
For the first time since the Key Bridge collapse, oysters are being planted nearby

The draft plan includes different deadlines for different outcomes: Some goals are set for 2030, many are in 2035 or 2040. Kurtz said that allowed for a more individualized approach to each goal, making use of the latest science.
“That’s one of the places we’re most excited to get feedback from the public,” Kurtz said. “Is 10 years right? Is 15 years right? Do we want to set targets that are more interim?”
One of the key goals of the 2014 plan was to limit nitrogen and phosphorus runoff and sediment pollution, the villains behind the bay’s oxygen-deprived summer “dead zones” where crabs, oysters and fish can no longer survive. Sediment goals had been met by last year, but the six bay states and the District of Columbia had achieved only 92% of phosphorous reduction goals and 59% of the nitrogen target, despite billions being spent.
The new plan gives experts until 2030 to develop a goal for nutrients and sediment, as they await new data from an updated computer model that estimates pollution flow, said Anna Killius, executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which convenes lawmakers from Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia to discuss bay issues.
“That process of updating the model takes time, and has to be peer reviewed. And so, we’re not in a place where we can speed that up, and really still call it sound, good science,” Killius said. “We can’t really put new numbers in place — or ask the jurisdictions to plan around those numbers — until we’ve got that model up and running.”
The nutrient and sediment targets are not likely to change, since they were set in 2010 by the Environmental Protection Agency. The new plan will likely focus on a new timeline or methodology for achieving the total maximum daily load, or TMDL.
“We’re working with the how,” Killius said. “So, what is going to be our plan of attack in getting to what the TMDL tells us we need to do?”
The new computer modeling was originally expected January, but officials now expect about a yearlong delay before that’s done, said Lee McDonnell, acting director of the EPA’s Chesapeake Bay Program office.
Kurtz said Bay Program officials understand that the lack of new nutrient and sediment timelines may “lend a feeling of uncertainty” to the bay restoration effort.
“That’s why we’re going to be doing a lot of public outreach,” Kurtz said, including about the computer model.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Keisha Sedlacek, federal director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the number of “gaps and holes” in the 2025 draft are a concern — in some places, including goals for conserved lands, the draft includes blanks in lieu of specific numbers. She would also like to see a consistent deadline, such as 2040, with periodic check-ins along the way.
“If we set these interim targets and actually evaluate the program — not every 10 years, but every couple of years — to see what tweaks we need to make based on the best available science, we’ll have a stronger, more efficient program moving forward,” Sedlacek said.
The update comes at a time of uncertain federal support for bay cleanup programs. The Trump administration has moved to slash funding for agencies that assist with bay clean-up, including the EPA, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration — but it has so far proposed stable funding for the Chesapeake Bay Program, which Trump had targeted for elimination during his first term.
Kristin Reilly, director of the Choose Clean Water Coalition, which represents about 300 environmental organizations in the bay region, said the $92 million in funding for the Bay Program, while it is critical, is only “one piece of the puzzle.”
“These states and federal agencies are recommitting to the work and coming up with these revised goals and outcomes,” Reilly said, “when it’s being proposed that the infrastructure around achieving them could be gone.”
Mindful of the administration’s antipathy toward climate change and DEI, Reilly said some language in the document changed at the request of federal agencies. While the 2014 agreement cited “climate resiliency,” the 2025 version references “changing environmental conditions.” The 2025 draft also jettisons a reference to “diversity” in clean-up efforts, instead calling for a  “wide range of engaged individuals whose communities enjoy access to the waters and natural landscapes of the region.”
Killius said the committee wanted to bypass buzzwords and focus on “saying what we mean.”
Killius said the new bay agreement was also informed by a groundbreaking 2023 study, called the Comprehensive Evaluation of System response, or CESR. That report cited a number of reasons for the struggle to attain the 2025 goals — and for the bay’s lackluster response to the pollution reductions achieved thus far — including the possibility that the Bay Program’s current computer model could be overestimating phosphorus reductions.

But mainly, while jurisdictions were able to cut pollution from wastewater treatment plants and other “point” sources, they struggled to reduce pollution from “nonpoint” sources, including farm fields and city streets.
The report delivered a sobering message: Portions of the bay, especially the deepest reaches, may never meet standards for criteria such as dissolved oxygen. Targeting shallow-water areas, and triggering an ecosystem turnaround, could have more impact on the health of the bay than focusing on the total nutrient runoff and its impact on the deep channel.
Killius points to a section in the revised agreement about fish habitat, which calls for a focus on improving “the quantity and quality of shallow water fish habitat in tidal areas.” Kurtz points to revised oyster goals, which include mention of aquaculture and the native fishery, rather than on oyster sanctuaries — where no harvesting occurs.
But some observers worry that the agreement hasn’t gone far enough to address nonpoint source pollution and restore ecosystems. That includes Gerald Winegrad, a former state senator and vocal critic of current bay policy.
He noted that some goals were revised downward, including for forested lands and wetlands. While the 2014 agreement called for states to “create or re-establish 85,000 acres of tidal and non-tidal wetlands” by 2025, the draft calls for 3,000 restored acres by 2035.
“When you look at forest cover, and you look at [forest] buffers, and you look at wetlands — three very important things, like the heart, lungs, kidneys of the bay — it is a complete flop compared to what was already required,” Winegrad said of the draft document.
He was frustrated, too, that the agreement didn’t specifically mention the TMDL numbers for nutrient and sediment reductions — or set a new deadline.
“This has been kicking the can down the road, moving the goal post — all the worst little idioms you can use to say that there is no political courage to really restore the Chesapeake Bay with the hard choices that have to be made,” Winegrad said.
Targets for restoring submerged aquatic vegetation were also revised down from a goal of 130,000 acres by 2025, to interim targets of 90,000 acres by 2030 and 95,000 acres by 2035.

Leila Duman, Chesapeake and coastal bays restoration officer for Maryland DNR, said the ultimate goal is still to reach 196,000 acres of grass coverage across the entire bay.
“That said, that’s not something we can get to in the next 10 years,” Duman said. “Part of this revision process was really about making goals achievable.”
The agreement also includes altogether new goals, such as a first-time goal for freshwater mussels, calling for development of mussel conservation plans in five bay tributaries by 2035. Filter feeders, like mussels and oysters, remove harmful nutrients from the water, making them a critical piece of the effort to cut pollution in the estuary.
“The oyster goal is so important,” Kurtz said. “But that really is focused on the tidal part. And what mussels really gets us is more of that work in the freshwater space.”
On the bay’s beloved blue crabs, the draft agreement calls for keeping the fishery at sustainable levels, but defers to a baywide stock assessment, which is coming out in 2026, on what the population levels ought to be.
Kurtz acknowledged that not all parts of the draft plan use specific numbers just yet.
“But I think that’s also reflective of reality. We’re continually improving the science,” he said.
After revisions, the document will head to the Bay Program’s executive council, which includes state and federal leaders such as Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D), for final approval. Officials are urging interested parties to submit feedback as soon as possible — before a Sept. 1 deadline, Kurtz said.
“If you are a community that reads this and says: ‘Well, this isn’t for us,’ we need to know that,” Kurtz said. “Because we want this to be for every single person within this massive watershed.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/boat-in-the-bay-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 07:04:58.706672

Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who has entered the race to be the GOP candidate for Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — Former Omaha State Sen. Brett Lindstrom has entered the race to be the Republican nominee to defend the Republican held 2nd Congressional District open seat. 
“I’m running as a common-sense conservative to protect retirees and fight for working families … focused on the future and national security,” Lindstrom said. 
Lindstrom, 44, on Monday became the second Republican to join the race. 
He was long rumored to be one of the GOP candidates to jump into the Republican primary if Rep. Don Bacon chose not to run again in 2026. Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding announced his bid last week. Bacon’s 2024 GOP primary challenger, Dan Frei, is mulling a bid. 
Lindstrom emphasized that he doesn’t “really get caught up” in who’s in the race, but looks forward to people getting to know him and the other candidates, then deciding the best candidate to represent them. Lindstrom said he is a “proven candidate” with a “proven record” of getting things done.

The former state lawmaker who represented northwest Omaha in the Nebraska Capitol from 2015 to 2023 said he has a track record of a “pragmatic” and “common-sense” approach. Lindstrom was known for pushing bills that reduced state income taxes. He also voted to repeal the death penalty in the state, which was reinstated through a ballot measure in 2016.
Lindstrom pointed to his role in passing legislation that phased out taxes on Social Security income. He said he wants to bring that to the Hill. President Donald Trump’s recently passed “big beautiful bill” does provide new temporary tax deductions for Social Security, but it doesn’t eliminate the tax on the federal program. 
Lindstrom, a financial advisor, said he has been able to “meet the challenges” the district faced during his time as a state senator, and is looking to “continue to do that.” He said he wants to bring a different kind of leadership to Washington, an approach focused on “real results, not partisan fights, because that’s what Nebraska deserves.”   
He was one of the Republican lawmakers in the officially nonpartisan statehouse to survive the 2018 “blue wave.” This would be Lindstrom’s fifth campaign for elected office – he unsuccessfully ran to be the Republican nominee for governor in 2022. Most of his support during that bid came from Omaha.
 The 2nd Congressional District is the state’s most politically diverse and competitive — and could prove one of the most expensive races in Congress for the 2026 midterms.  
Democrats already have a crowded field in the primary. Omaha political action committee co-founder and business owner Denise Powell and Omaha State Sen. John Cavanaugh have announced bids. Democrats Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis are also running. Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, a Democrat, has said she is considering a House bid.
Lindstrom has endorsements from State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, State Sen. Christy Armendariz of Omaha and former State Sen. Tom Brewer of Gordon. 
Harding has the endorsements of U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, former Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman, and State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha. He also received the endorsement of former Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert, who endorsed Lindstrom for governor in 2022. 
Lindstrom said his time in the Nebraska Legislature has given him the experience to handle the “complexity” of Washington.
“The message and [my] work ethic will speak for itself,” he said.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, speaks at a confirmation hearing for Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer. (screenshot courtesy of C-SPAN via Investigate Midwest)I googled: “Josh Hawley SNAP,” a few weeks ago when I was looking for our Senator’s position on cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (aka SNAP, or food stamps).
The AI told me that “Josh Hawley SNAP” refers to a snap of Hawley on January 6th cheering supporters of his effort to overturn the 2020 election for Trump, or to the gif of Hawley running away from them later that day.
I laughed at the bad AI, but it was right. It put the violent images of January 6th in my head when I was trying to understand the likely fate of SNAP and Medicaid. Fair point, robot, these things are related.
Many people thought Hawley was being disingenuous all along about protecting Medicaid. I criticized his support for work requirements that Missouri is incapable of administering without depriving eligible people of their health care. But Hawley talked so much about protecting Medicaid that even I held out hope he would refuse to back the other massive cuts.
I’ve tried to imagine how Hawley could crusade as a defender of Medicaid, SNAP, and the working class, then go on vote for the largest transfer of wealth to the wealthy in U.S. history, including a trillion-dollar cut to Medicaid. 
There is a non-zero possibility that he remembers running from the MAGA mob, and it affected his ability to vote for what he told us he believed. 
U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska has said that when representatives speak out or vote against the preferences of Trump, it comes with “death threats or worse.” This is consistent with other Republicans reportedly telling colleagues they couldn’t vote to impeach Trump because they feared for the safety of their families. 
Murkowski, unlike Hawley, sounded the alarm about the fact that Republicans’ reams of red tape will gut Alaskans’ practical ability to maintain their benefits. Like Hawley, she explained that changes to the medical provider tax that states use to fund Medicaid will devastate rural hospitals. Then Murkowski and Hawley both voted for the devastation they’d loudly warned of.
U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, was reportedly told by the FBI of credible threats to his life when it looked like he might not vote to confirm Trump’s defense secretary, Pete Hegseth. Tillis ultimately voted to confirm.
But Tillis has long objected to the gutting of Medicaid and, unlike Hawley, he stood by those objections.
Trump excoriated Tillis on his Truth Social and announced Tillis would be primaried. Facing a tough re-election, Tillis said he wouldn’t run again so he’d be free to act in the interests of his constituents in the time he had left.
That took bravery. Tillis knows that when Trump puts a target on someone’s back, it isn’t just an electoral one.
Trump has a long history of endorsing violence, but he is now openly unapologetic about how central it is to his approach to governing: do what I say or get very badly hurt. It’s the antithesis of democracy, but it’s effective.
Trump has normalized political violence in ways I never thought possible, and I knew about his violent tendencies back in 2016. Trump said there were “good people on both sides” of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville where a counter-protestor was murdered. He joked about an assailant fracturing the skull of Paul Pelosi with a hammer. He pardoned even his supporters who attacked and injured police officers on January 6th. 
Last month, Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman were assassinated. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman were shot but were saved by surgeons. A manhunt followed that was harrowing for Minnesotans. 
In a normal world, the U.S. president would have given a national address condemning political violence. Trump refused to even call the governor. 
The undercurrent of violence is everywhere. Masked men who you can’t be sure are law enforcement are grabbing people off the street. Our immigrants are being sent to a gulag in El Salvador where they are starved and beaten. Or sent to local prisons, or the new domestic camp without due process. 
One January 6 rioter was on trial when Trump pardoned him. He had yelled at fellow rioters attacking the police to “Kill ‘em! kill ‘em!” That rioter has now been hired by the Department of Justice’s working group on retribution for Trump’s enemies.
Trump sicced his followers on a journalist because she reported the fact that U.S. intelligence agencies don’t believe his bombing campaign obliterated Iran’s nuclear program.
Hawley has a safe seat here in red Missouri. He would have had less electoral risk than Tillis or Murkowski if he’d chosen to stand by his principles and vote against Trump’s gutting of MO HealthNet and SNAP. But Hawley ran scared from the MAGAs once again, either because crossing Trump would end his presidential aspirations, or because he fears the more immediate kind of threat that he experienced on January 6th.
Asked about the bill he voted for, Hawley said that the Republican party needs to do some “soul searching” because they are “tak[ing] health care away from working people.” 
He should do his own soul searching.
Hawley is telling us that Trump was correct when he said: “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose any voters.”
An estimated 170,000 Missourians are going to lose their health care. That means many, many more Missourians than could pack into a block of New York’s Fifth Avenue will die. 
Trump was right. He’d never lose Hawley’s vote. Trump is free to shoot away.

While a separate piece of legislation to re-authorize the program has been introduced by Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point), the failure to provide added money in the budget has raised concerns that the program — which allows the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) to provide grant funding to acquire, conserve and maintain public lands — could fail to survive the political tumult of divided government and die. 
Even though the conservation of public lands is widely popular among both Democratic and Republican voters in the state, a handful of Republican legislators have grown increasingly hostile to the program, particularly since the state Supreme Court ruled last year that the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance doesn’t have the authority to hold up grants issued by the DNR through the program. Republicans complain that the acquisition of public land takes parcels off the property tax roles and prevents development projects. 
The Kurtz and Testin proposal aims to reach a compromise by re-authorizing the program while adding more legislative oversight by requiring that any land purchases over $1 million be approved through legislation. 
“While I recognize all that has gone into reaching this compromise budget, I must share that I am deeply disappointed that Republican leaders would not agree to reauthorize the Knowles-Nelson Stewardship Program — even for just one more year through 2027,” Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) said in a statement. “Here’s the situation now: Knowles-Nelson reauthorization expires on June 20, 2026, giving the Legislature one year to take action before the deadline, and Republicans have indicated they will bring this back to the agenda this fall. Trust that I will keep up the pressure on Republicans and hold them to their word. I will continue to be a strong advocate for this long-standing bipartisan promise.” 
The lack of stewardship program funds in the final state budget led Evers to use his partial veto authority to prevent spending money on five individual public lands projects that legislators had earmarked in the bill. 
“I object to providing an earmark for a natural resources project when the Legislature has abandoned its responsibility to reauthorize and ensure the continuation of the immensely popular Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program,” Evers stated in his veto message.  “Instead of renewing the program and helping the many, the Legislature has opted to benefit the politically connected few. The Legislature must do its job and renew the Warren Knowles-Gaylord Nelson Stewardship program.”
Timber strategic plan 
The DNR budget also includes funds for a $1 million grant to the Great Lakes Timber Professionals Association (GLTPA) and the Wisconsin Paper Council to craft a Forestry Industrywide Strategic Plan. 
This provision was included by the Joint Committee on Finance in its late night session last Friday and has raised concerns from some environmental groups that it is a giveaway to industry groups to push for increased extraction of resources from the state’s forest lands. 
“Taxpayers should not be made to underwrite private industry studies with no public benefit or input. Would they decide how to manage local, state, and federal forests in this study? Would it be published?” Andy Olsen, senior policy advocate at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said. “One million dollars is very generous with taxpayer dollars for a sketchy study  with no public benefit.”
The GLTPA has been involved in efforts in Wisconsin’s Northwoods to oppose conservation projects and move local land use policies to be more pro-extraction by encouraging increased logging and the expansion of the state’s mining industry. 
The association’s director, Henry Schienebeck, has been influential in Oneida County’s effort to rewrite its comprehensive plan to be friendlier to industry and worked with American Stewards of Liberty, a Texas-based right-wing anti-conservation group, to oppose land conservation such as the Pelican River Forest. 
DNR spokesperson Andrea Sedlacek said the department is “monitoring this and all other relevant DNR budget motions as the process plays out” but did not yet have information on what the development of the strategic plan would look like or if other people or groups would be involved in its development. 
But despite the grant being given only to industry groups, some environmental advocates say it’s a win. 
Fred Clark, former executive director of Wisconsin Green Fire, said the development of such a plan is something the organization has been advocating for over the past several years. Clark pointed to a study of the health of the state’s forests Green Fire published last year and said that because the state’s paper mills have largely been shuttered, there are fewer  places for the state’s foresters to bring their timber, destabilizing the industry. 
Without a plan to find new uses for the state’s timber, the economics of Wisconsin’s working forest lands could change, resulting in land sales and development that results in forests being cut down to use the land for other purposes — ultimately harming the health of Wisconsin’s forests. 
“The focus that we would like to see there is not necessarily on producing more timber, because we already grow a lot more timber than we harvest,” Clark said. “What we really think the state needs is a strategic focus on developing new forest products and helping expand and refine forest products markets so that we’ve got places for our wood to go.”
Clark said he foresees the development of the plan working through the state’s Council on Forestry, which includes members representing industry, environmental groups, state and federal agencies, legislators and landowners. He added that for the project to succeed it needs input from all those groups, including those with records such as the GLTPA. 
“We need everybody at the table for this, and there’s a wide range of points of view in the forestry community,” Clark said. “Great Lakes Timber Professionals have been an active member of the Council on Forestry almost since day one. We won’t succeed if we don’t have a pretty strong consensus all the way from the environmental groups to groups like Great Lakes Timber Professionals. So I think there’s a lot of common ground there. The most important next step for us is to see that there’s a really broad based committee within the Council on forestry that’s helping guide this work.”

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Amid struggles with data collection and participation, two Republican lawmakers want to probe the long-term effectiveness of a state program designed to nurture new small businesses.
Rep. Chris Banning, R-Bixby, and Rep. Mike Lay, R-Jenks, said they want to examine the effectiveness of the state’s small business incubator program to determine if it is having the intended long-term impact, if it is being marketed effectively and if any changes need to be made to it.
The incubator program, which was created in 1988 through the Oklahoma Small Business Incubators Incentives Act, provides startup businesses with state tax exemptions for up to 10 years with an aim of diversifying local economies.
Incubators offer a variety of services to startup entrepreneurs, like providing office space and financial advice, with the goal of helping small businesses become financially viable and freestanding. Some incubators may qualify for additional support from local governments, universities and business development organizations.
A 2024 annual report released by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce found that there were 26 certified incubators and that 152 small businesses leased space from those incubators. The program created a total of 374 full-time jobs, 112 part-time employment opportunities and 43 internships, according to an analysis by the Oklahoma Department of Commerce. The program focused on supporting startups owned by women and minorities as well as environmental projects and telecommunications, according to the agency’s website.
Tenants generated $66.6 million in revenue and qualified for $3.3 million in tax exemptions, according to a 2023 analysis released by the state’s Incentive Evaluation Commission. The analysis found that 14 of the 25 incubators were in urban counties with seven operating in either Oklahoma City or Tulsa
The state Department of Commerce did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Banning said the program would benefit from incorporating business analytics to improve data collection and reporting.
“If you’re going to accept this help, then somehow you would need to report back on how it helped you, so it can help others, just like how we do a 10-year census,” Banning said.
Lay said he would like to see the state refine its metrics to assess the program’s impact.
“Are these programs working, or are there improvements to be made?” Lay asked.
He said businesses may not be aware of the program’s existence, which raises additional questions about how well it’s being marketed by the Department of Commerce.
Brad Rickelman, secretary and treasurer of Oklahoma Business Incubator Association, said the program’s impact is difficult to measure due to challenges with data collection and reporting. His group focuses on the needs of Oklahoma’s entrepreneurs and works with startups in their early stages when they’re most vulnerable.
“The incentives are a nice way to raise visibility, not only causing interest but also helping grow businesses, even if there is a cost,” he said.
The National Business Innovation Association found that 87% of all businesses that graduated from incubator programs remained in existence after five years, the group said.
Oklahoma’s analysis found that over 780 small businesses have graduated from an incubator since the program’s inception over three decades ago. The state’s program website does not show how many are still in existence.
Rickelman said Oklahoma’s program needs a closer look. He said that better data reporting and collection would help increase the program’s visibility and showcase its successes. A lack of accurate data makes it difficult for lawmakers to assess the program’s effectiveness, he said.
Oklahoma’s incubator programs, meanwhile, need to better communicate the critical role they play in providing entrepreneurial support in communities outside of major cities and in bringing talent and skills into underserved areas, he said.
Janet Schwabe, a member of the Oklahoma Business Incubator Association and manager of the Pioneer Technology Center, a technical school incubator in Ponca City, said the current data collection process can result in incomplete or inconsistent information.
According to the Oklahoma Commerce Small Business Incubator annual report, the data reported comes from the incubator managers themselves.
Schwabe said this process can result in incomplete or inconsistent information.
“There are a lot of great stories about the tenants, but not enough statistical data,” she said. “We need to work harder to get better data.”
Another challenge is the lack of awareness, which limits the program’s effectiveness, and keeps many potential tenants unaware of what incubators offer, Schwabe said.
She said she is considering rebranding Pioneer Tech and changing the term “incubator” to something more easily understood.
“We’re hoping to build a new facility to bring in larger manufacturers and rebrand the name ‘incubator’ because a lot of people don’t know what it is,” she said.

(Courtesy of Blue Cross of Idaho)At 16 years old, Annette Tipton went to an early iteration of the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs’ youth events. 
She talked with students from around Idaho, learned about regional universities and even won scholarships for speech and talent competitions. 
In May, Idaho Gov. Brad Little appointed her as the Idaho Commission on Hispanic Affairs’ new executive director. She looks forward to building on the agency’s work and mentoring a new generation of young professionals.
“I hope in some way, I’ll be able to inspire, to mentor, to guide — whether it’s young people in high school starting their college careers, or those who are young professionals looking to increase their capacity and to augment what they’re doing in their careers as a newly young professional,” Tipton told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. “… It’s that sense of paying it forward.”
Idaho Hispanic commission director retires after 28 years with agency

Tipton is taking over the agency after its longtime executive director, Margie Gonzalez, retired after nearly three decades. The non-partisan state agency gathers and publishes statistics, bridges community and government entities, provides recommendations to policymakers and hosts youth summits. 
She most recently worked for the Idaho State Controller’s Office. She also ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Idaho Legislature last year, challenging Boise Democratic Rep. Steve Berch. 
In a statement, Little said he’s confident Tipton will serve Idaho’s Hispanic community well.
“Idaho’s Hispanic community is an integral part of the fabric of our state. For decades, Margie Gonzalez served Hispanic Idahoans and the state with remarkable dedication,” the governor said. “I am confident Annette will continue this legacy, building on the growth and energy within the community and serving Hispanic Idahoans with that same commitment.”
Last month, Little announced Idaho State Police would partner with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to transport immigrants who are convicted of a crime and are not authorized to be in the U.S. to ICE detention centers for deportation.
Asked how the Idaho Commission of Hispanic Affairs will represent Idaho’s immigrant community, Tipton said agency officials will be available to refer community members who need resources to other groups, like the Mexican Consulate Office or the ACLU.
“We don’t handle those things. But we are more than happy to connect to people who need support and to be directed to where they need to go. That’s the type of support our office is able to offer,” Tipton told the Sun.

 ‘My world started out in Idaho’

Tipton grew up in southern Idaho’s Rupert, raised by migrant farmworkers, she told the Sun. 
One of the things her mom “always instilled in her girls was hard work, service and education,” Tipton said. “It was never a question of if we were going on to college; it was when we do.”
She went on to work for U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and for large financial institutions like JP Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America-Merrill Lynch and CIT Group Inc. 
Then she met her husband and returned to Idaho.

“My world started out in Idaho, and I’ve come back home to do what I can here more locally — to serve our community overall,” Tipton said. 
Along the way, she also volunteered with the Idaho Hispanic Caucus, the Idaho Latino Scholarship Foundation and worked for a year in outreach and enrollment for Terry Reilly Health Services, a federally qualified health center in Idaho. 
In May 2020, Tipton joined the Idaho State Controller’s Office. She worked there for nearly five years, with Idaho’s largest cities and counties and some of the smallest local government entities — special districts for mosquito, sewer and water, she told the Sun.
At the State Controller’s Office, she led Idaho’s establishment of a statewide integrated data system called Insight Idaho. But whenever other work came up, she was quick to help, Idaho Deputy Controller John Iasonides told the Sun in an interview.
She was instrumental in helping Idaho deploy over $1 billion in federal CARES Act funding that stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic, he said. 
“I always like to use the term a great utility player,” Iasonides said. “Because it didn’t matter if her main focus was the Insight Idaho project. If we needed something, some help with something else … I could call on her and she could jump into it really easy.”
He described Tipton as a driven person who works well with limited guidance and “prides herself on doing good work.”
“She’s very much, like, ‘Just good enough is not enough’” Iasonides said.
 Idaho’s Hispanic population is younger. Tipton eyes opportunities for mentorship.

Tipton is already planning the agency’s next youth summit events. She wants to continue publishing statistics through the agency’s Hispanic profile data book. And the agency is undergoing a rebranding effort that involves a website overhaul, a new mission and logos, she said.
In academics and her professional career, Tipton said she leaned on guidance from mentors. That’s part of what she hopes to bring into her new role as agency director.
“A lot of why I believe this office has had success in the past is because of that capacity to let people know that we’re a resource for them,” Tipton said. 
Idaho’s Hispanic population is largely younger than the rest of Idaho’s population, with about 39% of Hispanics under age 20 compared to about a quarter of Idaho’s non-Hispanic residents, according to the commission’s 2024 report. 
“Whether it’s myself, (or) people on the commission — how do we mentor again our young people, our young professionals?” Tipton said. “And polish them, guide them, champion them, and give them those opportunities for them to grow and expand their capacity.”
She also thinks there’s opportunities to weave in best practices she’s learned along the way, like from her experience in investment banking and corporate finance. 
“I learned a lot about why it is those institutions are successful, or they have a bottom line that has proven to be successful,” Tipton said. “And for me, coming into the public sector space, I want to be able to to implement those same types of principles: How do we show our value? How do we show, in numbers, the success — how we’re moving the needle?”

(Getty Images)Every time I doubt the benefits of adding fluoride to drinking water, I find myself thinking about the iconic presidential portrait of George Washington in which he appears pursing his lips, and hiding his missing teeth.
While the legend that Washington had wooden teeth is fake, it is true that by the time our nation’s first president was inaugurated, he only had one real tooth remaining and relied on dentures. Starting in his 20s, he suffered from toothaches and decay due to a combination of disease, diet and genetics.
Just imagine what Washington would think of a nation more than 200 years after his presidency, where the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has named community water fluoridation “one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.”
That’s why it’s so alarming that Oklahoma’s own, Gov. Kevin Stitt, has apparently decided to shrug his shoulders at decades of reputable science and instead pander to a vocal minority that seems hellbent on rotting our teeth. Somehow Stitt in his bizarre quest to “Make Oklahoma Healthy Again” seems convinced that our state needs to revert back to the 18th century when Washington lived.  
Perhaps that’s why I found myself gritting my cavity-free and fluoride protected teeth as Stitt announced that thanks to him the state Health Department would no longer recommend the inclusion of fluoride in our public drinking water. This reversal could potentially lead to ill-advised decisions by water districts across our state or politicized fights over community water fluoridation at the local level.
Stitt’s harebrained plan is a clearly ill-educated attempt to pander to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., our nation’s health secretary, who has instructed the CDC to also stop recommending fluoride use in public water. Kennedy can’t outright stop fluoridation, but he can throw around his weight to influence the amount allowed to be added to water supplies. (Much like he has undermined the science of vaccines in our nation.) 
RFK Jr. stood behind Stitt clapping like a happy seal when Stitt announced the fluoridation switcheroo. This was just minutes after the health secretary brazenly called out our state’s 47th worst public health outcomes as several rows of adoring state leaders looked on.
Healthy levels of fluoride are added to about 66% of Americans’ drinking water as a passive way to help reduce cavities and tooth decay.
Up until the mid-1900s, many Americans suffered from debilitating dental issues such as abscesses, dental decay and tooth loss. Researchers discovered that adding appropriate levels of fluoride to water supplies helped preserve dental health with no side effects and that it passively protects people’s teeth even if they don’t brush or floss.
If you want a current example of what happens to dental health when you remove fluoride from public water supplies, you need look no further than Antlers, the county seat of Pushmataha County in southeast Oklahoma.
Antlers is an area that for decades has rebuffed calls to add fluoride to their water, said Dr. Twana Duncan, who for close to 30 years was the county’s only dentist.
Stitt’s abrupt decision to declare war on fluoride treatments left her “heartbroken,” she said, because she sees the resulting health effects on children and adults every day.

Duncan tells me that she has operated on 3-year-olds that needed 14 caps on their teeth, has made dentures as high school graduation presents, and that it’s not unusual to have patients come in with 12 to 20 cavities at a time. 
The technology may be better than during Washington’s days, but the options aren’t.  
The University of Oklahoma graduate acknowledges that some of this may be due to diet, but said she sees a noticeable difference in teeth quality from patients who grew up in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, which have long fluorinated their public water supplies. She can also tell when people have just moved to Pushmataha County because their teeth quality is so much better due to having access to fluoridated water in other communities.
The need for fluoride among Antlers residents is so acute that she encourages patients to swallow small amounts of toothpaste to get their daily dose. If they can afford toothpaste, that is. 
An estimated 1 in 4 residents in Pushmataha County, which has a population just under 11,000, receive food stamps, according to an analysis by the Oklahoma Policy Institute, a Tulsa-based think tank. People can’t use their food stamps to buy toothpaste and not all families can afford it. Sometimes patients only get fluoride exposure at Duncan’s practice.
“Oklahoma is going to be a third world country in a few years,” Duncan told me of Stitt’s push.
Oklahoma already has some of the worst dental health outcomes in the nation. The 2023 Oklahoma Health Report Card gave our state a “D” when it comes to 13 “key oral health indicators.”
And it didn’t take me long after having children to discover one reason why. Ours is a state that has embraced policies that make pediatric fluoride treatments insanely expensive.
Oklahoma strangely only requires private dental insurers to pay for one pediatric fluoride treatment a year. Medicaid requires the coverage of one pediatric fluoride treatment every 184 days, so essentially twice each year.
Once a year, I pay over $120 out of pocket — at least $60 per child — to cover the cost of what should be a preventative treatment during my children’s routine biannual dental cleanings.
If Stitt and our lawmakers truly wanted to make Oklahoma healthy, maybe they could start by requiring insurers to cover more preventative dental care.
Imagine that. A small investment that could strengthen overall dental health in the long term.
Duncan said most of her patients turn down fluoride treatments if they have to pay out of pocket for them, but welcome them if they’re free.
But I suspect Stitt — and any lawmakers who support this crazy fearmongering — actually don’t want to make Oklahoma healthy again. They are too focused on MOWA — “Making Oklahoma Worst Again.”
So let’s raise a toast to MOWA – and I’ll take mine with fluoride. After all, our governor has pledged to make Oklahoma top 10 in everything. He’s never said we have to be top 10 best.

(Courtesy photo)An Indianapolis business owner will lead the state’s new Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation, with a focus on supporting Hoosiers’ launching the next generation of Main Street businesses. 
Brian Schutt, the co-founder of Refinery46 — a co-working space and startup incubator in Indianapolis — and co-founder of Homesense Heating and Cooling, graduated from Purdue University’s business school in 2003. He said part of the office’s role includes featuring successful, homegrown startups in the Hoosier State.
“The most inspiring thing is to just know somebody else’s story. And I think we have a lot of those,” Schutt told the Indiana Capital Chronicle. “A big part of the job is connecting with some of the flourishing businesses that already exist and sharing those stories. Because I don’t think the state can force entrepreneurship — but we can help tell more stories that inspire people to recognize that they have gifts and they can be problem solvers.”
  Gov. Mike Braun leads an Indiana Economic Development Corporation meeting on Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
The Indiana General Assembly established the office earlier this year in conjunction with an Indiana Economic Development Corporation transparency effort, explicitly charging the director with “develop(ing) and administer(ing) programs to support the growth of small business, entrepreneurship and innovation.” 
Schutt noted that while starting a business in Indiana is relatively easy in the legal sense, he said he didn’t see the office as prescriptively telling businesses how to flourish, but rather finding “where we can come alongside and where (we can) get out of the way.”
“There’s some programs that already exist that we’re going to analyzing and seeing how they’re working,” said Schutt.
Gov. Mike Braun, who made the announcement Monday morning, has long lauded the office’s anticipated launch, tying it to his own experience as a business owner. 
“(First Lady) Maureen and I lived the American dream of growing Main Street businesses in our hometown, and I want every Hoosier to have that opportunity. Our goal is to make Indiana the best place in the country to start and build your own business, and the Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation led by Brian Schutt will be a nation-leading resource to help Main Street entrepreneurs,” he said in a release.
The office will report to Secretary of Commerce David Adams, also a Braun appointee. Schutt will also oversee the state’s certified technology parks. 
 The state of entrepreneurship in Indiana

The law creating Schutt’s new role also directs him to identify ways to support rural communities and other underrepresented socioeconomic communities as well as youth entrepreneurship. 
“There is no thriving community without a thriving entrepreneur base,” said Schutt. “… we’re not going to come through with this idea that central Indiana, Indianapolis has all the answers. Really, it has to be a collaborative effort. And a lot of solutions are, necessarily, community led.”

According to the Kauffman Indicators of Entrepreneurship, Indiana lags slightly behind its national peers when it comes to establishing new business opportunities. Though the national rate of new entrepreneurs in 2020 was 0.34% — meaning that 3.4 people out of every 1,000 adults became new entrepreneurs — Indiana’s was only 0.25%.
Additionally, those startups created just 3.5 jobs for every 1,000 people while the national average was five jobs. 
Schutt has considered how to curate the next generation of entrepreneurs before, including a 2022 commentary in the Indianapolis Business Journal on the role of parents, with a goal of helping Hoosier children “see problems as opportunities.”
“If you see problems as opportunities, there’s never going to be a shortage of opportunities,” Schutt said, highlighting Innovate WithIN and High School Hustle programs. “These are programs that already exist that really focus in on that mindset … the capacity to see a problem as an opportunity and not necessarily look around for someone else to be a problem solver.”
In particular, lemonade stands are a longtime favorite for Schutt — though an effort to protect those stands from local interventions has repeatedly failed — and he spent six years as a board member of Lemonade Day in Indianapolis, a program geared toward children, according to his LinkedIn. 
“Lemonade stands are a great foundation. There’s something catalytic when a kid is given the opportunity to create something on their own and earn that first dollar,” said Schutt.

With tables spread across several distinct dining rooms at the storied Commander’s Palace restaurant, managers must calculate precise labor needs and open up the reservation list for just the right number of rooms at the right time for each dinner service.
“If I spread the reservations out too much, it feels like you’re sitting in church,” said operations manager Steve Woodruff. “We have an old saying: Nothing dresses up a dining room like customers.”
In recent years, emerging third-party online platforms selling hard-to-get dinner reservations have created headaches for popular restaurants like Commander’s Palace. New platforms such as Appointment Trader auction off the most desirable tables for hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
And unlike other platforms that contract with restaurants, such as OpenTable, the reservation trading apps work outside of a restaurant’s control: Anyone can make a reservation (often for free) and sell it for a profit, with the platform taking a commission on the sale.
During this year’s Super Bowl weekend in New Orleans, one table at a French Quarter restaurant went for more than $2,100.
When customers spend that kind of money before the meal, Woodruff said, it heightens expectations and alters a diner’s perception of value without restaurants even knowing. He said the apps also can force restaurants to run a service with empty tables if those online platforms don’t find buyers — putting the risk on the business, not the customer.
“If you resell a concert ticket, you had to risk something to buy the ticket. There’s no risk here,” he said.
The issue is increasingly gaining the attention of state lawmakers.
Commander’s Palace and the Louisiana Restaurant Association successfully lobbied for a new law banning the resale of reservations without the consent of restaurant operators. Earlier this month, Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed the bill, which gained unanimous approval in every committee and floor vote.
The Louisiana law follows the signing of bills by New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. A similar measure passed by the Illinois legislature is awaiting action by the governor. California and New Jersey are also eyeing such protections.



“I know what it takes for people to build a brand,” Republican state Rep. Troy Hebert, who sponsored the Louisiana bill, said in an interview. “I mean, think about it: You’re making money off of my brand, and I didn’t even know about it.”
He said online reservation platforms can use automated technology to quickly secure reservations, holding them hostage from other customers. Hebert noted that restaurants can still choose to work with any of the online reservation trading systems.
“We’re not preventing people from running those types of models,” he said. “They just need to get the permission of the establishment. That’s it.”
The new law allows the attorney general to issue platforms a $1,000 daily fine for each restaurant they’re selling reservations for without permission.
Appointment Trader founder Jonas Frey told Stateline that lawmakers are only hearing from powerful restaurant associations and the reservation platforms they contract with like OpenTable and Resy, which have pushed for these new laws.
Frey said restaurants often show no availability online even when they have free tables.
“It’s one of the reasons why Appointment Trader works so well, because people with the relationship to the restaurant generally get these tables,” he said. “We didn’t make this problem — the restaurants are doing that.”
He said the site can actually help restaurants avoid no shows because most trades occur on the day of the reservation. And many restaurants require a credit card for a reservation, meaning a consumer could be charged even if schedules change and they can’t use their reservation.
“In my mind, it’s atrocious: You’re liable for something, but then you’re not allowed to sell it,” he said.
Consumers completed 50,000 transactions on the platform last year, he said, with a no-show rate of only 1%. While restaurants have raised concerns about people making lots of reservations to flip a few online, Frey said his site blocks sellers who list too many openings without selling them.

So far, these “black market” restaurant reservations have been most problematic in the nation’s hottest dining destinations, including Chicago, Las Vegas, Miami, New Orleans and New York City, said Mike Whatley, vice president for state affairs and grassroots advocacy at the National Restaurant Association.
“It’s the places where there are those reservations that if you aren’t logging on right at midnight a month out to get the reservation, you’re not getting them, where these challenges have arisen, where you’re seeing piracy take place,” he said.
Whatley added that this wave of state legislation is reminiscent of one that followed the rise of third-party delivery services such as DoorDash. In some cases, delivery platforms posted restaurant menus and sent drivers to pick up orders without permission.
“And restaurants were going, ‘Hey, why am I on this website? I didn’t give authorization for that,’” he said.
Whatley said some restaurants have responded to reservation traders by requiring deposits to make reservations, decreasing the likelihood of no-shows.
“There’s a lot of interest in states where this isn’t a problem yet, getting ahead of it and just passing something on a bipartisan basis so that it never becomes a problem down the road,” he said.
Commander’s Palace first learned of these platforms early last year when a customer asked why he couldn’t get a table on the restaurant’s website but saw one for sale on Appointment Trader. Woodruff said the new law is important because the restaurant and its reservation vendor struggled to tell which reservations came directly from customers and which came from reservation traders.
“It didn’t feel like we could fight it effectively on our own in house, because it’s like a game of Whac-A-Mole,” he said.
Located among historic mansions and Victorian homes in the city’s Garden District, Commander’s Palace is more of a campus than a single restaurant. Nicknamed “Big Blue” among the staff for its striking teal paint job, the restaurant sprawls across nearly 12,000 square feet and is known for dishes like turtle soup and gumbo.
In business for more than 130 years, Commander’s Palace is among the city’s most famous spots. Reservations can be difficult or impossible to land, especially between October and May when tourists and conventions fill the Big Easy.

Proponents of reservation trading platforms argue they can provide customer flexibility. But Woodruff says it’s only those websites that are winning — while consumers and restaurants lose out.
In the foyer of the restaurant, Woodruff pulls up a big screen at the podium displaying the tables for every meal service. The restaurant is a must-stop for many tourists, but it’s the locals that keep the place running year-round.
Wearing a white shirt and black braided leather suspenders, Woodruff scrolls back to the recent Mother’s Day brunch service. The screen shows the history of each customer. Some have dined here dozens of times, some more than 110.
“These people spend every family special occasion with us,” he said. “There’s an awful lot of local goodwill that I try and cultivate.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
 Reconvening legislatures

Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
 Grants for hospitals

Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

Simple erosion-control technique named after scientist Bill Zeedyk fortifies ecologically valuable riparian zones all around the western U.S.
The post Safeguarding the sagebrush’s rich wet meadows, one Wyoming gulch at a time appeared first on WyoFile .","SOUTH PASS—Tom Christiansen drew a parallel to the human body as he described the purpose of the low-tech rock structures he’s been building for years within the creases of western Wyoming’s sagebrush sea. 
The malady? Erosion. The treatment: A carefully placed stone.  
“Each of these is a stitch on what we don’t want to become a sucking chest wound,” Christiansen told a group of rock-moving volunteers on Saturday in late June. 
The group was assembled on the White Acorn Ranch, a picturesque cattle operation south of the Lander Cutoff Road that’s within the spectacular Golden Triangle — a 367,000-acre region along the flanks of the Wind River Range that houses the best remaining sagebrush habitat on Earth.

The high desert’s sagebrush-steppe has enormous ecological value. That’s evidenced by the struggling species that depend upon the embattled biome. But it’s an arid environment, and certain nooks and crannies play an outsized role in nourishing the landscape’s native and domesticated inhabitants. High on that list are the grassy wet meadows that convey precious water, like arteries pump blood, through the contours of the sagebrush-covered hills.
“These areas are pretty small, but they’re very important,” said Christiansen, a retired sage grouse coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “These are the grocery stores.”

But those bottomlands can become barren of the biomass that feeds insects, sage grouse chicks and on down the food chain. Erosion, although a natural phenomenon, can be hastened by factors like overgrazing and extreme weather events made more likely by climate change. When erosion runs out of control into grassy gulches, they become incised gullies. Out goes the vegetation. 
That’s where the simple rock structures come in.

“Prevent that erosion, get more water into the soil, keep the water table up, keep the green vegetation — that’s the intent of these structures,” Christiansen said. 
Known as Zeedyk structures, after their inventor, Bill Zeedyk, the stone assemblies come in different shapes and sizes. At the White Acorn Ranch and numerous other corners of the West, there are “one rock dams,” “zuni bowls,” “rock mulch rundowns” and other hand-built structures intended to arrest vertical “headcuts” in ephemeral streambeds.
By facilitating the flow of water and slowing it down, the structures can prevent erosion from spreading uphill. Although the ecological do-gooding tactic relies on simple concepts and materials — essentially well-placed rocks — building it out requires hard physical labor.

A bevy of volunteers flocked to South Pass on June 21 to erect new Zeedyk structures and shore up old ones. 
Jared Oakleaf, Liz Lynch and Lindsey Washkoviak ventured up from Lander. Mark Kot, bad back and all, came from Rock Springs to move rock. Christiansen made the drive from Green River alongside his granddaughter, Camryn Christiansen-Fieock, of Big Piney. On a day off, Wyoming Game and Fish Department habitat biologist Troy Fieseler made the trek from Pinedale and with his son, Cooper.

The rocks were donated, too. Robert Taylor, an avid sage grouse hunter from Washington state, ponied up for the materials the volunteers carefully placed. 
Several of the bunch devoting their Saturday to moving rocks up on South Pass were seasoned. Fieseler even learned the ropes from the technique’s namesake himself. 
“The very first time I did it, we had Bill Zeedyk come out,” he said. “He taught us to read the landscape.”

That 2021 workshop, held at Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge, imparted Fieseler with lessons he hasn’t forgotten. Protecting uneroded wet meadows is a far more efficient use of time and resources than trying to restore those that have already washed out, he recalled.
Over the last decade, Zeedyk’s erosion-control tactics have gained traction in Wyoming and well beyond. The Natural Resources Conservation Service’s Sage Grouse Initiative gave the concept its legs, Christiansen said. Now there are thousands of structures dispersed across hundreds of projects, he said.
“Each of these, what’s its significance?” Christiansen said. “An individual one, it’s not so much, but when you start doing thousands of these across the West, there is significance.”

Enough time has passed since the technique’s inception that restoration specialists know it works, thanks to long-term monitoring. 
The White Acorn Ranch’s Zeedyk structures also have proven hardy and able to withstand the worst that the harsh Wyoming environment can throw their way. Christiansen and his fellow volunteers labored in a corner of the state that got walloped during the winter of 2022-’23 by an unusually hefty snowpack. 
“This ensured the runoff from the heavy snow,” Christiansen said. “They dealt with a lot of energy, and handled it. Very few rocks moved.”
Christiansen spoke of the rock structure’s resilience on the front end of a day of labor. From a section of state land, he motioned down a draw. 
“There’s over 20 structures between here and where that slope toes off,” he said. 
Every one of them had been erected by Christiansen, the crews of Zeedyk structure-building volunteers and agency folks that have also chipped in.

Casper resident’s experience illustrates how the U.S. foster care system doesn’t uniformly screen and treat children who are at risk.
The post Suicide is prevalent among foster youths, yet there’s a systemic failure to address it appeared first on WyoFile .","Elliott Hinkle experienced depression and suicidal thoughts even before entering the foster care system in Casper at age 15. 
At the time, Hinkle struggled with their sexual identity and gender issues, and their difficulties continued in foster care. They felt like they had no one to confide in — not their foster parents, not church leaders, not their caseworker.
“To my knowledge, I don’t remember ever taking a suicide screening,” Hinkle said. “No one ever said: ‘Are you having thoughts of taking your life? Do you feel hopeless?’”
With their psychological and behavioral health needs left unaddressed, Hinkle’s depression and suicidal thoughts worsened.
“Do I stay in the closet and feel terrible and want to end my life?” Hinkle, who is transgender, said. “Or do I come out and lose all my supports, which also feels dangerous?”
Children in foster care are significantly more likely to have mental health issues, researchers say. They attempt or complete suicide at rates three to four times that of youths in the general population, according to several studies.
LGBTQ+ people in foster care, like Hinkle, are at an even higher risk of having suicidal thoughts. 
Yet despite the concentration of young people at risk of serious mental illness and suicide, proactive efforts to screen foster children and get them the treatment they need have been widely absent from the system. And now, efforts underway to provide widespread screening, diagnosis and treatment are threatened by sweeping funding cuts the Trump administration is using to reshape health care programs nationwide. 
In June, federal officials announced they would shut down a suicide hotline serving LGBTQ+ youths as part of those cuts.
Children in foster care use a disproportionate amount of Medicaid-funded mental health services. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump’s massive budget package, which he signed into law on Friday, contains substantial shifts in Medicaid funding and policies that are projected to drastically reduce services in many states.
“I think anybody who cares about kids’ well-being and mental health is concerned about the possibility of reduced Medicaid funding,” said Cynthia Ewell Foster, a child psychologist and clinical associate professor in the University of Michigan psychiatry department. “The most vulnerable children, including those in foster care, are already having trouble getting the services they need.” 
A lack of federal standards and other system-level issues create barriers to psychological and behavioral care in the child welfare system, said Colleen Katz, a professor at Hunter College’s Silberman School of Social Work in New York.
“When you’re talking about anyone getting screened for suicide ideation upon entrance into the system, it’s inconsistent at best,” she said.  
Katz said all children entering foster care should have a brief, standardized suicide screening embedded into their initial medical assessment. And more screenings need to be conducted throughout a foster care stay, she said, because youths getting ready to transition out of the system are also vulnerable.  
Hinkle, now 31, said the summer before they aged out of the system was “one of the darkest periods, because I was coming to terms with the church not wanting me to be gay and I was about to lose stable housing and whatever foster care support there was.”
Katz studied transition-age youths in foster care in California, which has the highest number of placements in foster care nationwide. According to her analysis, 42% of study participants had thoughts of taking their lives and 24% had attempted suicide, and she expects findings would be similar in other states.
Katz also examined suicide screening tools and found many that already exist could work and be easily administered by trained child welfare workers or alternative frontline service providers, or embedded in existing mental health services.
Still, the quality of services varies by state and locality and can hinder attempts to curb suicides. 
Julie Collins, vice president of practice excellence at the Child Welfare League of America, which advocates for improvements to the child welfare system, said the gap in suicide prevention in foster care mirrors the overall nationwide void of behavioral health services for children and adolescents. “The preparation of people coming into the field isn’t what it needs to be,” Collins said of the lack of training for caseworkers.
Ewell Foster is trying to change that. 
She worked with the state of Michigan to redefine and update the competencies required to earn an undergraduate certificate in child welfare in the state. Eighteen colleges and universities that offer certificate programs in child welfare in Michigan now teach about suicide prevention. 
“It’s something the workforce has asked for,” Ewell Foster said. “They need real clear guidance on what to do when they are worried about someone.”
So far, Ewell Foster’s effort to change the wider system has not run into any roadblocks. Her work with Michigan’s child welfare agency is still being funded under a grant administered by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 
Agency spokesperson Danielle Bennett said such grants will continue for up to three years. 
However, the future of the federal agency has been in question for months. The Trump administration has laid off hundreds of its employees and has proposed folding its functions into another agency. 
Some states have made changes to address the foster care gaps on their own, but often it has taken legal action to spark changes in suicide prevention efforts.
In Kansas, officials made several changes after the state settled the McIntyre v. Howard class action lawsuit in 2021 on behalf of foster children who, the suit alleged, were subjected to inadequate access to mental health resources and moved from home to home frequently.

April Miller entered the foster care system in Minnesota at age 3 and said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. “The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” she said. (April Miller)
The state increased salaries for social workers in the child welfare system and reduced their caseloads, among other things. 
Other states, including Texas, have implemented similar changes after facing lawsuits.
Still, experts caution that the changes taking place in foster care systems are not enough to steer outcomes. 
Lily Brown, an assistant professor of psychology and director of the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, said moving the needle in suicide prevention will require implementing a universal risk assessment for children in state care. 
Brown recently sought a grant to fund and implement free, universal suicide risk screening in foster care throughout Pennsylvania. She had several counties agree to the project, but not enough to support her application — the study wouldn’t have had enough participants to work statistically, she said.
Without such studies, foster care systems nationwide can’t meet the needs of children, she said. 
April Miller, 27, entered the system in Minnesota at age 3. As a Native American, she is part of a group that is overrepresented in foster care. 
“The child welfare system as a whole neglected me,” said Miller, who said she endured several traumatic events in her early life, including witnessing a murder. 
“I did a lot of self-harm and had thoughts of suicide but didn’t have access to means, which is why I am still alive,” she said.
Today, Miller is a social worker and suicide prevention coordinator in Bemidji, Minnesota.
Similarly, Hinkle’s experience in the system made them driven to change the trajectory of other young people.
Hinkle provides training, consultation and policy development services at Unicorn Solutions in Oregon in support of youths and young adults affected by systems such as child welfare, with a particular focus on the LGBTQ+ community. 
They said they are committed to making sure that sexual identity and gender topics are not avoided in the system.
“I think every young person should feel loved and cared for,” Hinkle said.

(Jim Peaco/National Park Service)With many national parks facing huge backlogs of deferred maintenance — Yellowstone National Park alone is estimated to have more than $1 billion — the federal government is proposing a new fee on foreign visitors to address some of the shortfall.
The idea, which has long been championed by a Bozeman nonprofit, is part of preliminary 2026 budget documents for the U.S. Department of the Interior that simultaneously includes vast budget cuts for various departments, including the National Park Service.

The National Park Service budget shows a request for just $2.1 billion, cutting roughly a third of the agency’s 2025 budget.
But among the streamlining efforts listed in the budget documents, the federal government is proposing to establish a new fee for foreign visitors to some National Park Service sites, estimated to generate upwards of $90 million “to keep national parks beautiful.”
“An international surcharge is a compelling point because you can raise prices for that cohort, who by definition are spending a lot of money to travel to our country to see these ‘bucket-list’ destinations,” said Tate Watkins, a research fellow at the Property and Environment Research Center. “If you think of the overall trip budget, the gate fee is a small portion of that. It isn’t likely to deter a huge number of people.”
 National Park Service sites report record number of visitors

Last year was the busiest on record for the park service, with more than 331 million visitors spending time at the 433 National Park Service units, including historic sites, battlefields and monuments, in addition to the 63 national parks.
The increased traffic at the nation’s crown jewels have added to a deferred maintenance backlog of nearly $23 billion to maintain roads, buildings, utility systems and other facilities across the park system.
One method to address that backlog at individual park sites is to consider changing the fee structure charged for visitors at the entrance gates.
Only 106 of the 433 sites managed by the National Park Service charge entrance fees, ranging from $10 per person to $35 per vehicle, with annual pass options available. There is no differentiation between U.S. residents and foreign visitors.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said during a House Committee on Natural Resources hearing earlier this month that the Park Service is “way undercharging” international visitors.
“We’ve done a study on what gets charged if you’re going to go see the gorillas in Rwanda or go to the Galapagos Islands … there could be a billion-dollar revenue opportunity, without discouraging visitors,” Burgum said. “That revenue, if it could be redirected back towards deferred maintenance, staffing, a number of things we could do, that would be fantastic.”
 Potential revenue streams to maintain national parks

The Galapagos Islands cost $200 for foreign tourists, while Ecuadorian adults pay $30.

Watkins said PERC, a Bozeman-based a “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank, has advocated for changes to the fee structure for years.
“There’s a lot of common models where we do this kind of thing anyway,” he said.
Watkins pointed to states that charge different resident and nonresident fees for hunting and fishing licenses and similar structures for accessing state parks.
In Montana, residents pay a $9 fee with their annual vehicle registration, which covers access to all state parks for the year. Nonresidents, however, are charged an $8 daily entrance fee with a vehicle ($4 to walk or bike in) or $50 for an annual pass. Camping at a state park costs $12 more per night for nonresidents.
The same model could easily be applied nationally.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Watkins told the Daily Montanan. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
In a report released in 2023, Watkins looked at potential revenue streams from charging international visitors additional fees.
Using National Park Service data showing baseline entry fee revenue of $349 million, PERC calculated a $16, $25 and $40 surcharge for foreign visitors, with an estimate that the surcharge would correspond with a roughly 3% decrease in visitation.
The smallest surcharge would generate an additional $211 million annually, while the highest would bring in $528 million — more than doubling the current revenue.
The current system is relatively blunt — there are lots of margins you can refine in a logical way,” Watkins said. “That’s where I think you can see big changes happen.”
 Doubling Yellowstone’s fee revenue

A new report, authored by University of Wyoming economist Steve Newbold and published by PERC last week, focused on that nation’s oldest national park, Yellowstone, which saw 4.7 million visitors last year, roughly 15% of which came from other countries.

The park’s entry fee is $35 per vehicle, per week, with 80% of fee revenues retained at the park to be spent on visitor experience improvements. Park Service data shows entry fees generated roughly $14.2 million annually for the park in recent years.
The report looked at six different fee structure scenarios and compared the elasticity of demand — how much impact a higher fee will have on visitation — with the increased revenue.
Scenarios included charging all visitors an additional $5 to enter the park; exempting locals but charging all other visitors an extra $10; and various levels of international fees.
Charging foreign visitors a $20 surcharge is estimated to decrease visitation by 13,000, but generate an additional $11.9 million — an 84% increase from 2024 gate revenue.
Bumping the international fee to $100 per person would rake in $55.2 million, with a roughly 57,000 decrease in visitors.
Adding just a $5 per person fee to all visitors to Yellowstone would more than double the revenue from entrance fees.
“In some places you’re hard pressed to find a cup of coffee for five dollars,” Watkins said.
And while that doesn’t make up for the park’s $1.5 billion maintenance backlog — the most of any national park according to the report — it would help, Watkins said.
“I think you could probably ask the superintendent, and he’d say if we can get closer to the maintenance backlog with fee revenue, that would be great,” he said.
Watkins said that PERC is excited that the federal government is considering different models of fees for national parks, and that it might take some time to get it right.
“You’re probably not going to get something that works perfectly the first time,” he said.
But the whole point is the status quo is not sustainable, Watkins said, and the agencies in charge need to think about what they can do to put the future of the park system in a better position.
“A well-funded park that can maintain its trails, protect its wildlife, and conserve its natural wonders will continue drawing visitors for generations—securing the economic lifeline that sustains surrounding communities,” the report states. “The choice is between short-term thinking and long-term prosperity for both the park and the region.”

Sen. Lummis would rather serve Trump than her state, endangering those who have risked their lives for this country, writes her former intern Aidan Jacketta.
The post Wyoming politicians have failed to protect veterans appeared first on WyoFile .","During the 2023 fall semester, I interned with U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis, not because I agreed with her political stances, but because I wanted to gain experience with federal policy. As a college student in Washington, D.C., but from Wyoming, there weren’t many options for me to work with the politicians who represent my home state. 

Opinion

I felt comfortable working with a lawmaker I don’t entirely politically align with because” hillterns,” the nickname for Capitol Hill interns, are responsible for constituent correspondence, drafting hearing memos and giving tours of the Capitol Building — not supporting or impacting any policy decisions in the office. But as President Donald Trump has taken to his second term, I no longer want to be associated with a politician who is willingly causing so much destruction to my home state. 
Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis and Rep. Harriet Hageman all claim to value the lives of Wyomingites who have served this country, but their actions belie that assertion. A simple compare and contrast shows how Wyoming’s federal politicians would do anything to please our fascist president, but nothing to protect Wyoming veterans. 
With veterans being named as a top issue for Lummis, it should come as no surprise that she believes that: 

“The transformation that has occurred at the Veterans Affairs Department in recent years has been essential to improving the quality and timeliness of services and I pledge to hold the department accountable for their actions taking care of the men and women who have given so much to keep us safe.” 

But my problem and disappointment with this is that Lummis is supporting policies that directly harm the Veterans Affairs Department, impacting all Wyoming veterans. Lummis has applauded President Trump, Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency for revealing millions in taxpayer dollars spent on government waste. But what government waste has exactly been cut under the Trump administration? 
Would that be the more than 80,000 employees at the Department of Veterans Affairs?  The VA already had a severe staffing shortage, Military.com reported, but VA Chief of Staff Christopher Syrek wishes to make that worse. This absurd, indiscriminate firing spree is endangering veterans’ access to benefits and care, ranging from disability claims to funeral expense reimbursements. 
With 9.4% of residents being veterans, Wyoming has the second-highest share of veterans in the United States. Cuts to the VA would have a massive and irreparable impact on our state, but our politicians simply do not care. Our senators have made it clear that they do not want to make Wyoming a better state or help support the people who live here, but rather serve a political agenda that benefits them. 
Trump has fired staff supporting the Veterans Crisis Line, a confidential crisis support for veterans and their loved ones, with no regard for the impact it will have on these veterans. As well as VA researchers, staff essential to understanding treatment options for PTSD, opioid addiction, cancer that was caused by veterans’ exposure to toxic chemicals and countless other vital studies have been cut in the name of government waste. 
And what have Wyoming politicians done to oppose these dangerous cuts? Congratulate the man behind these harmful acts as a great leader who is only trying to help this country. Lummis repays the Americans who have served and sacrificed for our freedom by supporting cutting an already understaffed and underfunded government department dedicated to providing physical, mental and financial aid to those who need it. All while celebrating a $45 million parade for the president’s birthday, masquerading as a celebration of the exact military that is being damaged by the administration. 
But I suppose it is my fault for not realizing that Lummis has a long history of harming veterans before I took a job to buff my resume. She voted against the PACT Act of 2022, a bill that would “Provide mental health services, counseling and other forms of medical care through the Department of Veterans Affairs.” With his complete and total endorsement, Trump has bought her allegiance and now she must support his decisions regardless of the negative impacts they will certainly have on Wyoming.
But Lummis is not solely complicit in the harm inflicted on veterans across the state and nation. Barrasso and Hageman have continued to be staunch supporters of an administration that is endangering soldiers and hurting veterans. Just because Wyoming is one of the most conservative states does not mean our politicians should blindly follow every demand of our Republican president. 
Our politicians have continued to show that they serve the agenda of the White House, not the needs of Wyoming. Wyoming veterans deserve better than this. Wyoming deserves better leadership and the people of this state have the power to demand it. 
So demand it, Wyoming.

This week the Department of Corrections will finally take up a 2014 law that aimed to do just that.  | Getty ImagesThe Wisconsin Department of Corrections (DOC) will hold a public hearing this week on Act 196, legislation that received bipartisan support and was signed into law in April 2014 by then-Gov. Scott Walker. The law aimed to create sanctions for people who violate the conditions of their parole, probation and extended supervision as an alternative to revocation, which sends people back to prison sometimes for small infractions that violate the terms of their release. The hearing on implementing a new rule, 11 years after the law was signed, will finally take place on Tuesday, July 8 at 10 a.m.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The public can join the virtual hearing by going to a DOC link and selecting the “hearing information” section. The text of the rule is also available online at the same hearing link.  
Act 196 states the intent to “Develop a system of short-term sanctions for violations of conditions of parole, probation, extended supervision, and deferred prosecution agreement (an agreement not to prosecute pending the accused meeting requirements such as drug treatment).”
A sentence for a criminal violation, besides fines and fees, typically includes a period of incarceration and supervision outside incarceration via parole, probation, or extended supervision.
If a condition of supervision, such as the requirement to remain sober or stay away from minors, is not meant, the probation officer has the option of requesting a revocation hearing before an administrative judge that could result in the person serving a portion or the remainder of the “supervised” sentence behind bars.
Act 196 states “short-term sanctions” should include “examples of high, medium and low level sanctions and what factors to consider when determining which level of sanction to apply.”
The law is not  just punitive. Act 196 also says the DOC is to determine “how to reward offenders for compliance with conditions of parole, of probation, of extended supervision or of the agreement (such as deferred prosecution).”
The 2014 law also states the DOC should “minimize the impact on the offender’s employment” and also minimize “the impact on an offender’s family.”
The 2014 law would appear to meet the stated goals of the DOC and Gov. Tony Evers to lower the revocation rate for Wisconsin that has resulted in thousands returning each year to prison.
WISDOM, a statewide network working on reform of the prison and criminal legal systems and other social justice issues, is pleased the DOC is finally taking steps to implement the 2014 law into a rule.
“A system of short-term sanctions has the potential to significantly reduce the number of people revoked back to prison each year,” said Mark Rice, transformational justice campaign coordinator for WISDOM. “Sending people back to prison for a rule violation, not a conviction of a new crime, is what is fueling the overcrowding of Wisconsin’s prisons, along with the accompanying humanitarian crisis and deaths because of inadequate conditions.”
Tom Gilbert, a father whose son has been incarcerated and had supervision revoked and returned to prison, has led WISDOM’s efforts to get the DOC to implement Act  196.
“It is way past time for Wisconsin to transform its supervision program of people who have been released from their original sentence,” said Gilbert. “Revoking people back to prison for rule violations is counter-productive. Other states have moved to better methods of supervision and are closing prisons.”
But WISDOM officials also have concerns that DOC will use current practices of sanctions, such as 90-day jail confinements, that WISDOM say don’t meet the intent of ACT 196 to “minimize” the impact on employment and the family.
Wisdom officials are also concerned the DOC has not fleshed out how to implement ACT 196 by describing the actual “system of short-term sanctions.” The proposed rule to be considered at the July 8 hearing merely replicates language stated in Act 196 without specifying the actual short-term sanctions or the rewards for meeting the conditions of supervision.
“If the Department of Corrections truly implements both the letter and spirit of Act 196, we see the potential transformation of its community corrections programs to one that focuses on healing individuals and communities affected by crime,” said Gilbert.

(Photo: John Partipilo)Responding to criticism about Tennessee’s applications for private-school vouchers, Gov. Bill Lee said this week the state doesn’t need to know whether students were enrolled in private schools before seeking the funds.
Lee told reporters this week the Department of Education created the rules and application based on the bill lawmakers passed this year. The governor’s administration is coming under fire for subsidizing private schools with the $146 million program.
The applications for 20,000 vouchers don’t ask where students previously attended school or were enrolled in a private school. Nor do they request financial information from parents applying for “universal” scholarships, those without income restrictions.
The governor said in a press conference last week the data is not required by the legislation and noted “it’s not necessary to have, particularly because what we hope for is universal school choice, where every family regardless of their child’s past educational history has access to a scholarship.”










The Department of Education and the governor’s refusal to ask for critical data on private and previously participating schools is deeply troubling – especially when other states with similar voucher schemes have faced significant fraud and abuse.


– Rep. Caleb Hemmer, D-Nashville


Families of more than 38,000 students applied for the funds this spring, nearly $7,300 each, to pay for tuition and other private-school costs after lawmakers narrowly passed the voucher program. Those were divided almost evenly between families without income limits and those at 300% of the poverty level with an estimated income of $175,000 for a family of four.
Another 5,000 slots could be offered next year.
Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson, a vocal critic of the program, told the Lookout the legislature should require a state study to determine whether students are using the money to continue attending private schools and where they live so lawmakers can decide if the program should be changed.
Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville, who is trying to obtain information about the program’s applicants, called it the “educational equivalent of Cash for Clunkers,” a 2009 federal rebate program designed to boost the economy and encourage people to buy fuel-efficient cars.
In light of Lee’s comments, Hemmer said Tennessee residents “deserve full transparency” when funds are being “diverted” from public schools.
“The Department of Education and the governor’s refusal to ask for critical data on private and previously participating schools is deeply troubling – especially when other states with similar voucher schemes have faced significant fraud and abuse. We can’t afford to blindly walk into a system that lacks oversight and accountability,” Hemmer said in a statement.
  Republican Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson is calling for
Reports on Arizona’s private-school vouchers show the state’s budget ran into problems because funds had to be diverted from other programs to pay for the education program.
The legislature passed Lee’s main initiative even though the state’s own financial impact analysis showed 65% of the students who receive the vouchers would be enrolled in private schools already. Students from private schools surrounded the governor when he signed the bill into law at the State Capitol.
The governor further defended his initiative by saying, “Tennesseans broadly of multiple backgrounds and economic diversity want to have this for their kids.”
Data such as previous enrollment and income level for “universal” scholarships is “not helpful,” Lee said.
The state’s Education Savings Account program for low-income students in Memphis, Nashville and Chattanooga requires applicants to report their household income.

(Elise Plunk/Louisiana Illuminator. Aerial support provided by SouthWings.)
Bayou Sauvage Urban National Wildlife Refuge, an area of marshland at the eastern edge of New Orleans, is — in biological terms — considered an area full of wetlands.
One of the last remaining marshes around lakes Ponchartrain and Borgne, the wildlife refuge contains estuaries and freshwater lagoons, where young fish, crabs and hundreds of species of birds find safe haven and food. Visitors and locals kayak in the bayous and hike through the marsh, while the city itself enjoys an added layer of flood protection provided by the presence of nearby wetlands.
But Bayou Sauvage no longer fits the legal definition of protected wetland under a new Louisiana law. The new definition excludes areas surrounded by levees, now called “fastlands.”  Also excluded are wetlands that are naturally separated from what’s known as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), the navigable rivers and lakes protected under the federal Clean Water Act.
Much of Bayou Sauvage was sealed behind levees in the 1950s, said Matt Rota, senior policy director for environmental advocacy group Healthy Gulf.
“A reading of this law … could say that all of Bayou Sauvage, thousands of acres of wetlands, are now not protected,” Rota said.
Act 105 became law when Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed it June 8, making Louisiana the latest state to roll back protections from development in isolated wetlands. The new policy is inspired by the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case Sackett v. Environmental Protection Agency. Justices ruled, in a 5-4 vote, the EPA does not have the authority under the Clean Water Act to require a federal permit to dredge and fill wetlands isolated from WOTUS.
While Bayou Sauvage is still protected as a national wildlife refuge, other wetland areas with strong environmental value may now see openings to unfettered development under Louisiana law.
Tennessee and North Carolina have also redefined wetlands in their state laws following Sackett. Though the three states differ in how they now regulate building in wetland areas, all have the same goal: allowing more wetland development.
Jumping the gun
William Sutton, a wildlife ecologist and assistant professor at Tennessee State University, said isolated wetlands in his state play a vital role in preserving biodiversity and habitat for species such as the mole salamander, acting as “islands” of habitat spread across the region. It’s evolved in conjunction with isolated wetlands like those in Tennessee, said Sutton, and can’t just pack up and leave when development moves in.
“It’s not like these animals all of a sudden shift their life history to live in these different types of wetlands once you remove these isolated wetlands,” he said. “Once you remove that wetland, these animals can’t adapt to other wetlands that have things like high fish abundance or also things like high heavy metals or high nutrient loads.”
Rota said isolated wetlands areas are “still vital to the environment.” They can soak up millions of gallons of stormwater and runoff that would otherwise flood homes, he said.
The Environmental Protection Agency had previously considered isolated wetlands to be under their jurisdiction, requiring permits to fill or otherwise develop them. But the Sackett decision held that only wetlands with a continuous surface connection to WOTUS fall under Clean Water Act protections from draining and filling.
Clear guidance as to what “continuous” surface water connection means is something the Sackett decision didn’t provide. The EPA, now tasked with rewriting the definition of WOTUS, recently held a series of listening sessions across the country to gather guidance from stakeholders.
But Louisiana and other states are not waiting for a new federal definition.
Wetland advocates and law experts are concerned that approving state legislation that redefines wetlands before the EPA comes up with a national definition is hasty, with the potential to introduce flooding risks and water quality issues in newly developed areas.
“We would prefer that they wait until the EPA makes a clear definition,” said Angelle Bradford with the Sierra Club’s Louisiana-based Delta chapter.
“We are constantly fighting and worrying about flooding in coastal Louisiana,” Rota said. “Wetlands that are cut off by levees that are filled in, that’s going to reduce our flood protection and our storm resilience, not to mention reducing vital habitat.”
Basin battles
Throughout the Mississippi River Basin, states are taking different approaches to governing wetlands post-Sackett.
What might be biologically considered a wetland, using indicators such as the type of soil and plants in the area as well as water saturation on and below the surface, is now different from what is legally defined as a protected wetland area in Louisiana.
The state’s new law attempts to restrict the legal definition of wetlands to only cover areas with a “continuous” connection to rivers, lakes or other navigable bodies of water. Areas isolated from navigable waters or cut off by levees are now considered “fastlands” under the law, and don’t require a government permit to build on them — even if they have the biological features of a wetland.
But just like the Sackett decision, Louisiana’s law doesn’t clearly define what “continuous” means. Environmentalists say this sows confusion.
“It just doesn’t provide people with a clear understanding of what is going to be protected and what is not,” said Brennan Spoor, staff attorney with the environmental advocacy group Atchafalaya Basinkeeper in Louisiana. The new law “gives too many outlets” for “lack of consistency” in enforcing which areas need permits and which don’t, he added.
The new measure also tries to restrict the definition of wetlands under what critics say is the wrong part of Louisiana law. The new definition falls under the Louisiana Pollutant Discharge Elimination System, but in question is a developer’s ability to fill a wetland, not pollute it. The state relies on the federal Clean Water Act’s rules to regulate wetland fill and for now the federal rules are up in the air.
“If this is meant to narrow Louisiana law, it can’t without federal approval,” said Mark Davis, a Tulane University environmental law professor.
Louisiana’s new law also tries to erase the need for permits to build in wetlands cut off by existing or future legal levee construction. Even if that levee is built illegally, there’s a possibility that after-the-fact permitting will disqualify more wetlands from protections, Spoor said.
“It’s just going to be whatever a judge thinks, and a judge in some parish that supports wetlands might feel differently than a judge who thinks all industry should get to do whatever they want,” Spoor said.
Rota also worries the law could spur illegal construction or pollution by infusing “misguided” attempts to narrow the state’s definition of wetlands.
“If it’s not clear what a fastland is, I think that’ll give people a lot more impetus to just [decide] ‘if in doubt, dump, and then ask for forgiveness later,’” said Rota.
States start to update regulations
In Tennessee, relatively robust state wetland protections were repealed earlier this year. The state used to require developers to mitigate new development on wetlands as a tradeoff for building in swampy, water-saturated areas. Instead, it now uses a scoring system for isolated wetlands, classifying them into one of four categories: low-quality, moderate-quality, high-quality or artificial wetlands.
‘Low-quality’ isolated wetlands under one acre don’t need a permit to drain or fill, while ‘moderate-quality’ wetlands need to be under a quarter-acre. ‘Artificial wetlands’— created by either humans or animals — aren’t subject to any regulatory oversight for draining or filling.
About 80% of Tennessee’s isolated wetlands are smaller than one acre, said Grace Stranch, CEO of Tennessee environmental group Harpeth River Conservancy.
While regulations for building in low or moderate quality wetlands increase with their size – and “high quality” wetlands are subject to stricter standards – Sutton said magnitude doesn’t really correlate directly with a wetland’s value to the ecosystem.
“Isolated wetlands can be very small but can have really, really rich biodiversity,” he said.
Smaller, isolated wetlands are also harder to create artificially than larger systems, so it’s difficult to restore them after they are damaged, Sutton said.
“There’s really no way to guarantee it because the hydrology is just so hard to control in these wetlands, once you actually have to come back and reconstruct.”
The law now also gives Tennessee’s conservation commissioner a lot of power to independently expand acreage requirements for low- to moderate-quality wetlands. If the commissioner decides to broaden the law to larger parcels, it could leave the final fate of even more wetland areas uncertain.
Developers also no longer have to consider the cumulative impact of altering these wetlands on surrounding areas or water quality before dredging or filling them.
“Wetlands are directly connected to our river sources,” said Stranch, adding that many wetlands geographically isolated from one another can be connected in other ways, such as hydrologically or ecologically.
“They’re just not connected on the surface, and so that’s one of our biggest issues,” she said.
Water also flows across state boundaries; one state with stronger wetland protections may be impacted by things like nutrient runoff or increased floodwaters as a result of a different state’s’ wetland protection policy.
“It opens the floodgates,” said Jon D. Bumpus, spokesman for the environmental advocacy group TennGreen Land Conservancy.
“Going from a state that very staunchly protects wetlands to sending the message to developers … that this land is no longer off limits just sets a really, really dangerous immediate precedent that’s going to change a whole lot of things very quickly,” Bumpus said.
While there are ways to promote responsible development with tools like land easements and buffer zones built between houses and wetland areas, Bumpus said the new law doesn’t promote these types of adaptive strategies.
North Carolina, where rivers in its western region feed into the Mississippi River Basin, rolled back wetland protections so that only wetlands with WOTUS connection qualify for protection from being dredged or filled.
Lawmakers in the North Carolina General Assembly overrode a veto from Gov. Roy Cooper in order to update their law, which specifies the new EPA definition of wetlands, once established, will replace the state definition.
Other states in the Mississippi Basin, such as Indiana, have also passed laws to narrow the definition of wetlands and strip protections.
Some states, including Minnesota and Illinois, have extended wetlands protections.
Wisconsin has extended protection for non-federal, isolated wetlands, but the state’s authority doesn’t extend to federal wetland areas. That means the Prairie Pothole Region, comprising thousands of small wetlands in the state, and other isolated marshes are left without Clean Water Act protection after Sackett.
Given its history of flood control issues and valuable wetland habitat, Davis suggested Louisiana would be better off among the states expanding protections rather than rolling them back.
Louisiana Sen. Michael Fesi, who introduced Louisiana’s legislation to redefine wetlands, thinks easing wetlands regulation post-Sackett could incentivize levee construction and aid in flood protection. But legal experts and environmental advocates say that’s a red herring.
“One of the easiest ways to help with flood protection is to be careful about what you build in flood-prone areas,” Davis said, adding that tools such as building codes are an easier legal avenue to codify flood protection.
“Louisiana should not be one of those states that says, ‘Well, the Supreme Court says the Clean Water Act doesn’t apply as widely as it had before, so we shouldn’t do anything either,’” he said. “The real question is: What needs doing and how do we do it?”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)Class dynamics influence the environments in which humans live, yet when this topic arises, it’s almost always framed as a global issue. For example, anthropologist Jason Hickel recently published a now-viral map displaying how, by the year 2070, two billion people will be residing in regions exposed to extreme, potentially unlivable heat.
Approximately 99.7% of those people will be in the Global South, a grouping of poor, formerly colonized nations primarily in Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia that are responsible for less than 20% of historical carbon dioxide emissions, meaning the people who have contributed the least to planetary warming will be the ones who suffer the most from it.
Though the United States is a wealthy country firmly entrenched in the Global North, there are rarely discussed yet very similar class dynamics playing out within our nation’s borders, including in Memphis.
What’s happening in Memphis?
Once a green energy advocate, tech billionaire Elon Musk shifted his focus to the artificial intelligence arms race and established “Colossus” in Memphis in 2024. An xAI supercomputer facility designed to power and train Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, Colossus is slated to be the world’s largest supercomputer.
But at what cost? The facility is currently operating 33 methane-powered gas turbines to fuel its AI technology despite holding a permit for only 15. The supercomputer facility is located in a poor, predominantly Black Memphis community with historically high rates of pollution-related illness and disproportionate rates of industrial pollutants.
The magnitude of the energy draw — and resulting pollution — at Colossus is, well, colossal. According to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), the facility draws enough electricity to power approximately 100,000 homes while consuming 1.5 million gallons of water per day to cool its equipment.
Those inputs are alarming, but the outputs are even worse. The facility’s behemoth methane gas turbines increase Memphis’s smog by 30-60% as they belch planet-warming nitrogen oxides and poisonous formaldehyde around the clock, pollutants linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Quoting SELC, “xAI has been operating dozens of unpermitted methane gas turbines without public notice, permits, or air pollution controls. The number of turbines and extent of
  “Colossus,” the Elon Musk supercomputer in Memphis, will use 1.5 million gallons of water per day to cool its equipment. (Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)
It’s worth mentioning that clean air is both a Constitutional right, according to the 9th Amendment, and a human right, as per the United Nations; yet, Memphis leadership has looked the other way as Colossus produces more nitrogen oxides than Shelby County’s Draslovka chemical plant, the Valero refinery, TVA’s Allen power plant, and the Memphis International Airport combined.
South Memphis is becoming a sacrifice zone
“It’s no coincidence that if you are African American in this country, you’re 75% more likely to live near a toxic hazardous waste facility,” said state Rep. Justin J. Pearson, a Memphis Democrat, in a recent interview. “It’s no accident that in this community, we’re four times more likely to have cancer in our bodies. It’s no accident that in this community, there are over 17 Toxics Release Inventory facilities surrounding us — now 18 with Elon Musk’s xAI plant.”
Despite vocal opposition from South Memphis residents and their defenders, these neighborhoods are beginning to look like “sacrifice zones,” or poor, predominantly Black communities that are willfully poisoned and polluted for the interests of power and wealth. 
How long before South Memphis looks like Louisiana’s Cancer Alley, a stretch of communities along the Mississippi River where a slew of dangerous petrochemical facilities have led to the predominantly African American neighborhoods presenting cancer rates at up to 50 times the national average? Or Flint, Michigan, where the preventable 2014 water crisis caused lead contamination that disproportionately affected the region’s mostly low-income population, leading to several deaths and thousands of lifetime disabilities?
The people who contribute the least to environmental harm often suffer the most from it
Although it varies by region, poor Americans produce approximately 10 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. In contrast, wealthy Americans have significantly larger carbon and pollution footprints due to their consumption patterns, investments, and lifestyle. One study found that the wealthiest 10% of Americans account for at least 40% of emissions. 
Yet, despite their disproportionate contribution to the problem, the wealthy can afford to insulate themselves from the harms associated with living on an increasingly warm and polluted planet.
For example, Musk’s private jet flights alone produce approximately 5,497 tons of carbon dioxide per year, which is equivalent to the amount produced by around 550 residents of South Memphis in a year. Every time Musk’s SpaceX launches another rocket (currently about 140 per year), add another 3,189 tons of CO2, or the annual carbon footprint equivalent of 319 South Memphis residents. Musk’s Boring Company, initially pitched as a sustainable alternative to above-ground automobile traffic, is likely to produce tunnels that, car for car, produce eight times more CO2 emissions than roads.
Yet Musk will never have to suffer the environmental harms created by his businesses and lifestyle.
Memphis’s future should be decided by those who live there, not an out-of-state billionaire
Laws like the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used to make a not insignificant attempt at insulating poor American communities from the environmental implications of class dynamics, but all of that could change with Supreme Court rulings gutting environmental laws and DOGE-mandated cuts to the EPA.
What’s happening in Memphis is a painful example of America’s shift to a law-of-the-jungle society in which a billionaire can flaunt already gutted and barely enforceable laws and then operate an unpermitted, clandestine, mass-polluting supercomputer facility simply because no one has the resources, power structures, or political will to stop him.
I hope, and still believe, that Tennesseans won’t take that lying down.

The largest tract of public land in the United States is a wild expanse of tundra and wetlands stretching across nearly 23 million acres of northern Alaska. It’s called the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, but despite its industrial-sounding name, the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, or NPR-A, is much more than a fuel depot.
Tens of thousands of caribou feed and breed in this area, which is the size of Maine. Migratory birds flock to its lakes in summer, and fish rely on the many rivers that crisscross the region.
The area is also vital for the health of the planet. However, its future is at risk.
The Trump administration announced a plan on June 17, 2025, to open nearly 82% of this fragile landscape to oil and gas development, including some of its most ecologically sensitive areas. The government accepted public comments on the plan through July 1.
I am an ecologist, and I have been studying sensitive ecosystems and the species that depend on them for over 20 years. Disturbing this landscape and its wildlife could lead to consequences that are difficult – if not impossible – to reverse.
 What is the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska?

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska was originally designated in 1923 by President Warren Harding as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy.
In the 1970s, its management was transferred to the Department of Interior under the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act. This congressional act requires that, in addition to managing the area for energy development, the secretary of the interior must ensure the “maximum protection” of “any significant subsistence, recreational, fish and wildlife, or historical or scenic value.”
The Bureau of Land Management is responsible for overseeing the reserve and identifying and protecting areas with important ecological or cultural values – aptly named “special areas.”
The Trump administration now plans to expand the amount of land available for drilling in the NPR-A from about 11.7 million acres to more than 18.5 million acres – including parts of those “special areas” – as part of its effort to increase U.S. oil drilling and reduce regulations on the industry.
I recently worked with scientists and scholars at The Wilderness Society to write a detailed report outlining many of the ecological and cultural values found across the reserve.
 A refuge for wildlife

The reserve is a sanctuary for many Arctic wildlife, including caribou populations that have experienced sharp global declines in recent years.
The reserve’s open tundra provides critical calving, foraging, migratory and winter habitat for three of the four caribou herds on Alaska’s North Slope. These herds undertake some of the longest overland migrations on Earth. Infrastructure such as roads and industrial activity can disrupt their movement, further harming the populations’ health.
The NPR-A is also globally significant for migratory birds. Situated at the northern end of five major flyways, birds come here from all corners of the Earth, including all 50 states. It hosts some of the highest densities of breeding shorebirds anywhere on the planet.
An estimated 72% of Arctic Coastal Plain shorebirds – over 4.5 million birds – nest in the reserve. This includes the yellow-billed loon, the largest loon species in the world, with most of its U.S. breeding population concentrated in the reserve.
Expanding oil and gas development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska could threaten these birds by disrupting their habitat and adding noise to the landscape.
Many other species also depend on intact ecosystems there.
Polar bears build dens in the area, making it critical for cub survival. Wolverines, which follow caribou herds, also rely on large, connected expanses of undisturbed habitat for their dens and food. Moose browse along the Colville River, the largest river on the North Slope, while peregrine falcons, gyrfalcons and rough-legged hawks nest on the cliffs above.
A large stretch of the Colville River is currently protected as a special area, but the Trump administration’s proposed plan will remove those protections. The Teshekpuk Lake special area, critical habitat for caribou and migrating birds, would also lose protection.
Indigenous communities in the Arctic, particularly the Iñupiat people, also depend on these lands, waters and wildlife for subsistence hunting and fishing. Their livelihoods, food security, cultural identity and spiritual practices are deeply intertwined with the health of this ecosystem.
 Oil and gas drilling’s impact

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska is vast, and drilling won’t occur across all of it. But oil and gas operations pose far-reaching risks that extend well beyond the drill sites.
Infrastructure like roads, pipelines, airstrips and gravel pads fragment and degrade the landscape. That can alter water flow and the timing of ice melt. It can also disrupt reproduction and migration routes for wildlife that rely on large, connected habitats.
Networks of winter ice roads and the way exploration equipment compacts the land can delay spring and early summer thawing patterns on the landscape. That can upset the normal pattern of meltwater, making it harder for shore birds to nest.
ConocoPhillips’ Willow drilling project, approved by the Biden administration in 2023 on the eastern side of the reserve, provides some insight into the potential impact: An initial project plan, later scaled back, included up to 575 miles (925 kilometers) of ice roads for construction, an air strip, more than 300 miles (nearly 485 kilometers) of new pipeline, a processing facility, a gravel mine and barge transportation, in addition to five drilling sites.
Many animals will try to steer clear of noise, light and human activity. Roads and industrial operations can force them to alter their behavior, which can affect their health and how well they can reproduce. Research has shown that caribou mothers with new calves avoid infrastructure and that this impact does not lessen over time of exposure.
At Alaska’s Prudhoe Bay, the largest oilfield in the U.S., decades of oil development have led to pollution, including hundreds of oil spills and leaks, and habitat loss, such as flooding and shoreline erosion, extensive permafrost thaw and damage from roads, construction and gravel mining. In short, the footprint of drilling is not confined to isolated locations — it radiates outward, undermining the ecological integrity of the region. Permafrost thaw now even threatens the stability of the oil industry’s own infrastructure.
 Consequences for the climate

The National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and the surrounding Arctic ecosystem also play an outsized role in regulating the global climate.
Vast amounts of climate-warming carbon is currently locked away in the wetlands and permafrost of the tundra, but the Arctic is warming close to three times faster than the global average.
Roads, drilling and development can increase permafrost thaw and cause coastlines to erode, releasing carbon long locked in the soil. In addition, these operations will ultimately add more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, further warming the planet.
The decisions made today will shape the future of the Arctic – and one of the last wild ecosystems in the United States – for generations to come.

(Sam Nichols | West Virginia University)For two hours every Thursday and Friday, Randall Brown gathers a handful of people in front of a whiteboard. They sit on a couch or armchairs on either side — the walls filled with colorful drawings while coffee brews in a nearby pot. These are Brown’s weekly group therapy sessions.
Everyone is going to speak during Brown’s group today; nobody gets to opt out by saying, “I don’t want to talk.”
Since October 2024, Brown has been working at Lauren’s Wish where he holds these twice-weekly sessions of his Addictive Behavior Awareness (ABA) program for people with substance use disorders. Lauren’s Wish is a nonprofit organization and triage center in Morgantown, West Virginia, helping people with an addiction or in recovery find treatment and connect with necessary resources. 
Brown said that while incarcerated, in 2001, it became clear to him that people experiencing addiction needed guidance in four key areas: manipulation, irresponsibility, a non-caring attitude and self-esteem. So he created the concept for ABA based on his personal experience. 
After his release, Brown decided he wanted to help people with substance use disorders lead a better life, so he trained to be a peer recovery coach and put his plans for ABA into action. 
Today, he sees his mission at Lauren’s Wish as giving people hope. Lauren’s Wish is like a “gateway” for people getting ready to transition into society, Brown says, whether they’re seeking sober living or returning to their families.

“The saying is, in recovery, we keep what we have by giving it away. And I’m always wanting to give it away. I’ll talk to anybody about recovery,” Brown said.
Programs like Lauren’s Wish are typically kept afloat through fundraising and donations; however, they’ve recently received funding from a new source: opioid settlement funds. 
These funds are the result of a global settlement, agreed to in federal court, of a class action lawsuit brought by states, counties and cities across the country against opioid distributors, manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies and others, in the wake of the country’s opioid epidemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 720,000 people died from an overdose in the U.S. between 1999 and 2022 
West Virginia will receive about $980 million from the settlement, split into payments over 18 years. The West Virginia First Foundation — a nonprofit created by the state Legislature — will control the spending of 72.5% of the funds, local governments 24.5%, and the West Virginia Attorney General’s Office 3%.  
The state Attorney General’s Office created a Memorandum of Understanding in 2022, under then-Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, that dictates what the funding can be spent on – like increasing access to treatment or prevention-education programs.
How local governments oversee that money, however, including the process through which they take applications, make awards and account for spending, is fully within the control of city and county governments. An investigation into these processes conducted by journalism students at West Virginia University’s Reed School of Media shows the oversight and accountability built into local spending can be markedly inconsistent from county to county — with some doing very little to collect the advice and opinions of addiction experts or people with lived experience.
Detailed reporting, vague decision-making
Lauren’s Wish is an organization almost fully staffed by people in recovery. It has applied for and received opioid settlement funding from both the state and local level, and Brandon Wise, who provides grant writing assistance to nonprofits and wrote both applications for Lauren’s Wish, says the experience at each level is drastically different. 
  Brandon Wise, who writes grants for nonprofit organizations, stands in front of Lauren’s Wish, Morgantown, W.Va. (Sam Nichols | West Virginia University)
According to Wise, the application process for state funding from the West Virginia First Foundation was significantly more involved and lengthy compared to Monongalia County, where Lauren’s Wish is located. He compared the WVFF application to applying for federal grants, noting that it required strict adherence to formatting and content guidelines, specifying what needed to be included without providing a rigid layout. Failure to follow these directions “to a T” could lead to almost immediate rejection.
In Lauren’s Wish’s WVFF application, Wise provided objectives, strategies and a budget narrative with accompanying documents. Wise estimated the application was 50 to 60 pages when finished. 

As of June 6, the WVFF had $19.2 million to award statewide in the four areas outlined by West Virginia’s MOU: diversion programs, youth prevention and workforce development, child advocacy centers/neonatal abstinence syndrome programs, and transitional/recovery housing expansion.
Lauren’s Wish was awarded roughly $168,000 to jumpstart its outreach department by hiring more staff to provide additional aftercare and outpatient services for clients. Their grant period runs from Feb. 1, 2025, through Jan. 31, 2026, and during that time, they will pay for outreach services provided to clients past, present and future, with a focus on individuals dealing with the court system.
Derek Hudson, the founder and executive director of the Neighborhood S.H.O.P. in Charleston, West Virginia’s West Side neighborhood, said it took him almost a week to fill out his WVFF application.
The S.H.O.P. is a basic needs site that offers groceries for people with and without housing, a mini laundromat, showers, a locker program and clothing. These services, located at Bream Memorial Presbyterian Church, are described as no-barrier, allowing people to access what they need at any time.

Hudson described his experience with WVFF as requiring precision, but said some of the process is unclear. In the first round of statewide applications awarded in December 2024, Hudson said his organization was eliminated for not including a page stating “not applicable” where a section did not apply to them, but later resubmitted. 
He applied for $200,000 to fund a re-entry program to house people coming out of incarceration and help them integrate back into society to prevent recidivism and homelessness.
Hudson says he was awarded $80,000 in his second attempt at funding from WVFF and was not provided an explanation as to why he received less than half of what he requested.
According to Hudson, WVFF ​​reporting requirements were “very vague.” For successful applicants, quarterly reports are required to show how the funds are being spent and whether or not they’re completing the objectives set out in their application.
In October 2024, Wise completed and submitted a WVFF application for Jacob’s Ladder as well — a six-month, long-term residential treatment program for men in Aurora, West Virginia — which met the initial requirements and moved into the second evaluation phase. The second phase involved a vote by a five-member board appointed by the governor. The application requested funding for scholarships that would help offset the cost of treatment at the facility not covered by an individual’s insurance. Board members voted against their application.
One settlement, 55 systems
Compared to WVFF’s process, Wise said the Mon County application he completed on behalf of Lauren’s Wish was not as lengthy and more straightforward.
The county uses an online portal with boxes for applicants to fill in the requested specific information. Applicants were required to submit a project summary, proposal details and organization information. For every reimbursement or drawdown, proof of purchase must be submitted and must align with the proposal.
Mon County Commission President Tom Bloom says they largely modeled their application after Kanawha County, the state’s largest county in population and home to its capital city.
In distributing its funding, the Kanawha County Commission has taken some measures to be transparent, posting all applications to their website for the public and other organizations to review.

To date, the county has received a total of $3,905.023.09 in its opioid settlement payments, and so far, has funded eight organizations for $1,088,208. The Neighborhood S.H.O.P. requested $49,500 to help establish a new staff position but was denied funding on Oct. 1, 2024.
Applications in Kanawha County are accepted on a rolling basis. Every expenditure and funding request is voted on by the three elected commissioners in a public meeting that allows for community input.
The commission did not sponsor community conversations to discuss the funds, but community groups in Charleston did hold town halls, bringing various groups together to discuss the distribution of opioid dollars and communicate those recommendations to county officials. At the Kanawha County Public Library, about 60 people attended one of these town halls in March.
Kanawha County Commissioner Lance Wheeler said the commission avoided funding new organizations or those without a “proven track-record.”
When asked if the Kanawha commissioners consulted experts in the field before making final funding decisions or if they made the decisions based on their own experience, Wheeler said it was a combination of both.

He said they have relationships with the local Kanawha-Charleston Health Department and Recovery Point Health, whom they provided funding to from the county budget, and also have experience in responding to funding requests.
In Monongalia County, the application, which is based on a general format and questions used by Kanawha County, asked organizations to provide an executive summary of their proposal, its details, budgeting and organization information, including current funding sources. The majority of questions have a 10,000-character answer limit.
Where Wise at Lauren’s Wish said his WVFF application was 50-60 pages, his final application for Monongalia County amounted to seven pages, plus additional tax and financial documents.
As of May 1, Monongalia County has received $1,221,683.89. According to meeting minutes from July 2024, the commission had been working to create a process to award opioid settlement funds for months, but has chosen not to hold public forums to gain community insight into the need, like some counties did.
Bloom said commissioners did not consult experts in evidence-based treatment during the application creation, review or awarding process, but rather relied on their own experience and research.
On July 31, 2024, the three-person Monongalia County Commission approved 12 of 17 applications for a total of $576,900, according to Bloom. Before funding organizations at the July meeting, he said he and the other two commissioners spent close to 30 hours reviewing the “huge” applications.
Lauren’s Wish was awarded $37,500 that day to fully integrate Brown’s ABA program into its peer recovery support services.
Mon County commissioners say they focused on selecting specific, established programs that could further provide their services to the community while also looking for new approaches that could assist people with opioid use disorders, with “the key being that we didn’t want to duplicate the services that are out there,” according to Bloom.

Bloom was a guidance counselor for 34 years and has been a county commissioner since 2013, and with some additional research, said he felt confident in the commission making funding decisions.
While county commissioners are not required to have expertise in substance use disorders or follow a specific application, review, or awarding process, Laura Lander, addiction therapist and associate professor at West Virginia University’s Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute, said this thinking confused her.
“That’s great that they have experience writing grants, but it’s who gets the grant or what are you targeting the grant towards that is of concern,” she said.
When asked about the accountability of county commissions distributing the funds, Wise said, “I would say the county does their due diligence.”
But without input from external sources and stakeholders, Lander said funding awards are subject to a commissioner’s individual bias.
 “Clearly, in other counties, based on what I’ve seen, the money used for law enforcement has the county commissioner’s ear, and we see lots of money going towards police vehicles,” she said.
Although she was not familiar with one of the 12 applications approved by the commission, Libera Inc., Lander said that Monongalia County’s awardees are “great allocations” of the funds and are directly involved with substance use disorder treatment and advocacy.
One county tries a more inclusive approach
In contrast to many counties in the state, the Preston County Commission seems to be taking a more deliberate approach to its spending. As of June 6, the county has received $803,603.42 of settlement funds as part of the local share and decided to put this money into a one-year certificate of deposit (CD) to earn interest.
This decision was influenced by the model adopted by Raleigh County, which invested its initial funds while conducting a year of planning, Preston County Commissioner Nathan Raybeck said.
Because they felt they “didn’t know enough about the issue to make a decision” themselves, especially given that “everybody under the sun is going to want a little piece of a little something,” the Preston County Commission created its own Opioid Settlement Advisory Board, Raybeck explained.
“We got a board together of the people who are most directly affected by it, the people who see this day in and day out,” Raybeck said.
The board is composed of individuals selected from the general public who have lived experience with opioid use disorder and representatives from offices such as community corrections, probation and the sheriff’s department. Currently, the board is identifying the best uses for the funds, focusing primarily on improving access to treatment and long-term prevention while researching how to tailor solutions to the specific causes and barriers.
The board’s main focus is treatment and prevention, said Dr. Lola Burke, prescribing provider and medical director for the Preston Recovery Care Program in Kingwood, who serves on the board.
“This is our chance to actually come up with some long-term solutions for this problem that has been plaguing us for a couple of decades now,” Burke said.
Raybeck said it was important not to spread the money too thin, “Because giving you $13,000, and you $30,000, and you $40,000 ain’t gonna get us anywhere.”
Absent oversight, future spending could face accountability gaps
On May 20, in Sutton, West Virginia, WVFF celebrated its first grant recipients, with a total of $17 million awarded to 94 organizations. 
Although the timeline for the next grant application cycle has not yet been determined, organizations like Lauren’s Wish and the Neighborhood S.H.O.P. will be eligible to apply for a second round of funding. Applicants who were denied, like Jacob’s Ladder, are also able to reapply.
At the local level, county commissions are left to their own timelines and decision-making processes. Some, like Preston County, are only beginning to create these procedures, while others, like Monongalia and Kanawha counties will have another go after learning from their first rounds.
Although Lauren’s Wish was awarded funds at both the state and county levels, Monongalia County Commission President Bloom questions if the WVFF’s state-chosen reviewers truly know enough about local programs to make informed decisions.
There are regional boards that also make recommendations to the state WVFF reviewers during the selection process, but Bloom said regional boards are still “not local.” 
Each of the six regional panels were initially supposed to be made up of two individuals from each county, but WVFF “changed the rules” during the process, according to Bloom, and now are made up of six individuals who each represent six categories of interest, like treatment and prevention.

Bloom said a lack of oversight and direction from WVFF was also an issue, but understands that this was its first attempt at the process.
While a chunk of settlement money has been spent, this only marks the start of a statewide effort to leverage these funds for change in West Virginia. Lander hopes to see this money go into not only existing programs, but new ones as well.
“So many of the grants that were funded were just funneling money into existing programs, which is not without merit. That can be very valuable,” Lander said. “But I wish we would really think about the big picture and how to build affordable housing infrastructure in this state, because it is hard to get sober if you do not have a place to live.”
She said more representation from various stakeholders who are impacted and understand the effect of substance use disorders on the community could make a significant difference.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement June 30.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota)New budgets for state agencies and commissions in North Dakota went into effect July 1 and one commission will see a 20% increase over the next two years — the Commission on Legal Counsel for Indigents.
The commission has a budget of nearly $27.2 million through the 2025-27 biennium, a $4.5 million budget increase over its 2023 budget.
Travis Finck, executive director for the commission, said the budget increase is a step in the right direction on fair pay for attorneys that assist defendants who can’t afford to pay for a lawyer.
“We’re still not where we need to be, but we also understand the position the state is in. There was a lot of uncertainty with federal funds and obviously property tax was a big issue this session,” Finck said. “We’re really grateful to legislators … They were listening and understanding of our situation that we’re in and did commit to helping support us and our mission moving forward.”
The commission’s public defenders are set to begin a new tiered pay scale and defense attorney contractors will see a pay raise this year, but they will still earn less than prosecutors and attorneys working for other state agencies. Finck said the defense attorney contract rate for indigent defense increased on July 1 from $80 to $90 per hour because of the increased budget.
“That’s still a good increase for us, but we’re still significantly behind what the federal rate is,” he said. As of Jan. 1, the defense attorney contract rate for federal, non-capital cases is $175 per hour, according to the U.S. Courts website.
“We just want to be in the same ballpark because we think we offer an opportunity where if you go to law school and you want to make a difference in someone’s life, we provide that opportunity,” Finck said. “The problem is, before, we weren’t even in the stadium. So at least now, we’re getting a lot closer.”
Public defenders underpaid, overworked, North Dakota report says

The increased budget will also allow the commission to hire two additional investigators, bringing the total number of investigators to three, to help with the defense of their clients. Finck said, if prosecutors need more information about a case, they can send out a sheriff’s deputy or a police detective and they can go out to interview more witnesses, or gather more evidence.
“On the defense side, if we have an issue pop up … a lot of the time, unfortunately, that’s my attorneys out there taking those pictures or trying to track down witnesses,” Finck said. “With the use of investigators now, we can have people who are trained specifically in investigations to go out and interview witnesses … and a lot of the time it’s verifying our client’s story.”
Aaron Birst, executive director for the North Dakota Association of Counties and a former prosecutor, said adding two additional investigators to be used by public defenders will help ensure the correct outcomes occur in these cases.
“Law enforcement and prosecutors are also overworked and any time you have another set of eyes looking at something, that’s helpful to the system and not just to the defendants,” Birst said.
During the legislative session, Finck told lawmakers that employee turnover has been a problem for their offices in recent years. He said the six largest counties in North Dakota allocated about $39 million to prosecutors during the previous biennium while the commission’s budget for the whole state was $22.6 million.
The commission has an administrative office in Jamestown and regional public defender offices in Fargo, Bismarck-Mandan, Grand Forks, Minot, Dickinson and Williston. 
Finck said it will be interesting to see how the counties respond to the 3% property tax levy caps that passed as part of property tax reforms as it relates to prosecutor pay in the future.
During the 2023-25 biennium, 18 of the commission’s 41 total employees left their positions, including 10 attorneys, which led to cases being reassigned to an already stretched public defender workforce or contracting services to private defense attorneys. Those reassigned cases are typically paid at a higher rate than normal, Finck said.
North Dakota laws address avoiding criminal charges, improving life after jail

In fiscal year 2024, the commission handled 16,671 court cases, a new record for public defenders in the state, and an increase of more than 400 cases from the previous year. The commission has seen more than 16,100 cases each year since 2021. According to the 2024 North Dakota Court System annual report, more than 168,000 cases were filed in district court last year, which includes both civil and criminal cases.
State law requires the commission to contract out at least 50% of its cases to private defense attorneys. Finck told lawmakers that 73% of its cases were contracted to defense attorneys outside of the commission public defenders in 2024.
Rep. Lawrence Klemin, R-Bismarck, an attorney, sponsored and passed a series of criminal justice reform measures during the legislative session aimed at improving the state’s judicial system, Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation and reducing recidivism. One of the new laws eliminated the $35 application fee for indigent defense and instead replaced the revenue from those fees with an allocation from the state’s general fund.
Klemin praised Finck for the job he is doing running the commission with its high case load. He also said the way to prevent the turnover of public defenders is obvious.
“Pay them more money and they’ll stay. It is that simple,” Klemin said. “We have a constitutional obligation to provide a defense for somebody who is alleged to have committed a crime, if they can’t afford an attorney.”
He added the budget increase will help the commission and its public defenders, but there is still plenty of room to keep going.
“It’s going to help, but it’s still not enough,” he said.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas is collecting signatures for its proposed ballot measure slowly and deliberately as the group navigates lawsuits and new requirements for gathering petitions. 
The nonpartisan, grassroots organization and its ballot question committee, Save AR Democracy, is collecting signatures for a constitutional amendment aimed at protecting Arkansans’ right to direct democracy and preventing legislative interference in this process, which allows people to propose laws and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
After the attorney general certified the ballot measure in late May, Michelle Wolchok, president of the League of Women Voters of Washington County and a member of Save AR Democracy, said the group had to wait a few weeks to begin collecting signatures because the state hadn’t yet written directions for how to comply with about a dozen new state laws affecting the initiative process.
New requirements include requesting a photo ID from potential signees, informing them petition fraud is a criminal offense and having them read a petition’s ballot title or have it read to them. Proponents said the laws will protect the integrity of the process, while opponents argued they’ll make it nearly impossible for Arkansans’ proposals to qualify for the ballot. 
The League of Women Voters of Arkansas officially kicked off its petition gathering campaign in mid-June, and Wolchock said the new laws have presented some issues. While canvassing, Wolchock said she’s lost some signatures because people didn’t have a photo ID with them. She’s also concerned about the time it takes to comply with the new laws.
“It is a harder ask to ask people of their time if they’re running into the grocery store or they’re in line to go see a concert at the AMP, to take up that little bit of extra time with them, it just takes longer to get each signature,” she said.

At this time, canvassers are all volunteers and the League has been focused on scheduling training so people can begin collecting signatures. During the Northwest Arkansas Pride festival in late June, five volunteers collected nearly 600 signatures in 10 hours. 
While Wolchock is excited by this initial support, she said she’s also feeling daunted because it’s just “a drop in the bucket” of the nearly 91,000 signatures that need to be collected from 50 counties to qualify for the 2026 ballot. 
The League collected a few more signatures Wednesday night at a meeting of the Washington County chapter. Members packed the patio at Crisis Brewery in south Fayetteville to learn more about upcoming training and canvassing events.
They also heard from guest speaker Bill Kopsky, executive director of the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and a member of the Protect AR Rights coalition, which has proposed its own direct democracy ballot measure that has yet to advance to the signature-gathering phase. 
Attorney General Tim Griffin last week rejected the group’s measure for a second time for failing to meet a new state law that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. Kopsky said Protect AR Rights is working on revisions and intends to resubmit its proposal soon. 
While Protect AR Rights and Save AR Democracy share the goal of protecting the initiative and referendum process in Arkansas, the language of their proposals differ in some respects and only the League’s has been certified by the attorney general. 
Kopsky told the crowd one of the biggest differences between the two measures is his group’s proposal would require the state to notify voters if their signature is rejected and give them 10 days to correct any problems. Ballot measure sponsors would also be given time to correct errors, he said. 
Members of both groups acknowledged Wednesday that their greatest chance of achieving their shared goal is by working together and said they plan to meet in the coming weeks to discuss what that might look like. 
“Our ultimate goal is to protect the process for citizens, and we’re going to ultimately do what’s in the best interest of that,” Kopsky said in an interview. “I think ultimately we’re all going to have to consolidate around one. What that is, I think it’s too early to say.”

In hopes of qualifying for the 2026 ballot, Wolchock said the League is pursuing a multipronged approach. The group filed a lawsuit in April challenging several of the new direct democracy-related laws. 
Protect AR Rights filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit in May so they can challenge additional laws. If a judge denies the motion, Kopsky said they’ll file a separate lawsuit. Both groups are hoping a judge will block the new laws so they can collect signatures under previous rules.
The League is also awaiting a ruling in a separate case over a 2023 law that increased the threshold for gathering signatures from 15 counties to 50. The attorney general’s office filed a letter with the court Wednesday requesting a hearing with the new judge that’s been assigned to the case. 
Meanwhile, members of the League of Women Voters like Wendy Finn are eager to support the democratic process by engaging in the organization’s initiatives. Finn, a board member of the League’s Washington County chapter, said she joined the organization two years ago because she was “really ticked off” after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. 
Joining the League and participating in its efforts is a great way “to channel anger and frustration with systems that are not functioning for us into positive civic action,” she said.   
“You can rage in the streets all you want to, and we should rage in the streets if you’re upset about what your government’s doing,” Finn said. “It’s one of our freedoms that we have and we should exercise that, but the real work, the day-to-day work of democracy happens at the League.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.
House, Senate push along bills to attract nuclear developments to Indiana

In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.
“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
Lawmakers passed legislation easing the path to nuclear and Gov. Mike Braun has indicated his strong support.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.
In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
Ramping up
The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”

The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.
Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
‘What Henry Ford did for cars’
John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.
Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Amanda Berg for the Capital-Star)Public school districts across Pennsylvania faced a deadline of June 30 to approve a budget for the coming fiscal year. Many balanced their budgets, banking on the legislature’s approval of a proposal that would save their districts more than $600 million in cyber charter school tuition.
But if the legislation to cap taxpayer-funded tuition for online charter schools doesn’t become part of the next state budget, it would send some districts, such as Delaware County’s William Penn School District, scrambling to close million dollar gaps in their spending plans.
William Penn and about 370 of the commonwealth’s other districts are also counting on the second installment of $526 million to correct the unconstitutional disparity in state funding between the wealthiest and poorest districts.
“Both of those items are factored into the budget, and those items are allowing us to balance our budget,” William Penn Superintendent Eric Becoats told the Capital-Star. “If the state does not pass those items or approve those items as they are, we are really going to have to go back to the drawing board and begin to look at art, music, athletics, as well as transportation.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
William Penn passed a $134.6 million budget last week that includes a 3.9% increase. That’s equivalent to about $185 a year for the owner of a property assessed at $150,000. The district’s tax rate of $32.86 per $1,000 of assessed value already ranks among the highest in Delaware County. 
“The proposal is asking the community to do everything that we can ask them to do,” Becoats said.
Without a cap on cyber tuition, William Penn would need to plug a $2 million gap in its budget.
This situation is not unique. The School District of Lancaster’s board passed a 4.25% tax increase. That means another $172 a year for an owner of property assessed at the district’s median of $166,000.
“That’s a savings that would be passed along to our taxpayers,” School Director Dave Parry said.
Like William Penn, Lancaster balanced its budget, in part, by holding off on hiring for new positions or allowing jobs to stay open through attrition.
It’s unclear how many of the state’s 500 school districts approved a tax increase or included projected cyber charter reform savings in their budgets this year. The Pennsylvania Department of Education does not post aggregated school district budget data until later in the year.
State lawmakers have been unusually tightlipped about budget negotiations this spring, as Senate Republicans have sparred internally over new revenue sources and face pressure to compromise with the Democratic-controlled House and Gov. Josh Shapiro to provide more money for struggling transit agencies.
The General Assembly recessed for the July 4 holiday after missing its June 30 budget deadline and the Senate has no session days on its calendar until September.

Last month, the House passed a bill to cap cyber charter tuition at $8,000 per student next year. It would also establish a statewide formula for special education tuition. That would save public school districts across the commonwealth an estimated $616 million a year, according to a House analysis of the bill’s fiscal impact.
The Senate has not acted on the measure, but Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) has said criticisms of cyber charter schools, such as lack of oversight and transparency, have merit. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia) said last week he believes there’s a “good chance” that it will be part of the final budget package.
Lancaster and William Penn were among six school districts in a historic lawsuit against the state. It culminated with a 2023 Commonwealth Court decision declaring the state’s reliance on property taxes to fund public education unconstitutional.
They argued the state had failed for decades to account for the disadvantages dealt to students in impoverished school districts. 
School leaders in cities such as Johnstown, Lancaster and Wilkes-Barre, and rural districts like Shenandoah Valley and Panther Valley in the state’s coal region, have struggled to generate sufficient tax revenue by levying higher rates on less valuable property. Wealthier districts, such as Lower Merion in Montgomery County and Fox Chapel in Allegheny County, achieved per-pupil spending among the highest in the state with similar or lower tax rates.
After the Commonwealth Court decision, the legislature and the Shapiro administration convened the bipartisan Basic Education Funding Commission to assess the level of need across the state. It determined the gap between districts with adequate funding that achieved the state’s educational assessment goals and those that did not was $4.5 billion. And the legislature resolved to pay that out over nine years.
Last year, the state budget provided $526 million, or about 11% of the total, as the first installment of adequacy funding to be distributed through a new fair funding formula. That was on top of another $574 million increase in education funding distributed to all districts.
But Pennsylvania school districts pay about $1 billion a year in cyber charter school tuition calculated through a formula that critics allege doesn’t reflect the actual costs of providing an exclusively online education.
In a report earlier this year, Republican Auditor General Timothy DeFoor’s office found the money paid to cyber charter schools resulted in five of the largest accruing excessive surpluses. It also noted “uncommon” spending for taxpayer funded schools. Examples include $22 million in employee bonuses, $2.4 million in fuel stipends, $1.3 million for a vehicle fleet and $70,280 for a “Family Funfest Event.”
The cyber charter schools examined in the audit responded by pointing out that DeFoor’s office found no financial mismanagement, waste, fraud, or abuse of taxpayer dollars.
Susan Spicka, executive director of Education Voters PA, said cyber charter tuition eats into the gains that school districts could achieve through adequacy funding. She added that the state’s increases in basic education and special education funding have barely kept pace with inflation.
“If the legislature punts on cyber charter funding reform without increasing basic and special education funding they’re going to really harm a lot of students and a lot of districts,” Spicka said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/20230530_Cap_Star_Edu_Funding_643_EDIT-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-07 06:03:29.050707

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)BOWLING GREEN — When the Family Enrichment Center was established in 1977 with the goal of addressing child abuse, staff immediately set aside an open — free — seat for a child in need. 
Despite tumultuous challenges facing the child-care industry, that seat stays open thanks to grant funding. Staff say it’s a key tool in fighting child abuse in Warren County, where around 20% of children live in poverty and food-insecure homes, according to the 2024 KIDS COUNT County Data Book. 
Thanks to the program, if Bowling Green parents can’t care for their child — because of a job interview, doctor’s appointment, court appearance or the need for a self-care day — and have nowhere safe to leave their child, they can bring that kid to the Family Enrichment Center’s crisis drop-off for free, explained Nickie Jones, the executive director. 
“The very first program we did was the crisis drop-off center,” Jones said. “The group of people here in our area wanted to do something to address child abuse, and they were smart enough to realize that a crisis unit or crisis drop-off or drop-in service was a need to support families.”

The program is open to children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old — “because they are most at risk from dying from child abuse,” Jones explained. 
Usually, children who come to the center through the crisis drop-off are a year old, said Jennie Watt, the director of the Wee Care child care branch of the center. 
“Most abuse — it happens at home,” and the center’s staff is deeply aware of that reality, said Watt. Sometimes, parents and guardians just need a mental health break, she said. 
The crisis drop-off children spend their day in a play-based classroom with other toddlers and get a breakfast snack and a free lunch, which includes a protein, vegetable, fruit, grain and dairy.  
“We just try to be a safe place,” Jones said. “We’re just unique. Nobody else around here does this.”  
‘Vital to our community’

In 2024 Kentucky’s child care industry — which some would like to rebrand as “early childhood education” — lost COVID-19 relief dollars that helped stabilize the industry during the last few years. This left many centers to cut pay for their workers, raise tuition for parents, cut services and even close, the Lantern has reported. 
As fewer child care centers operate and prices for quality care increase in a state with high rates of child abuse, experts said having quality, affordable — which sometimes means free — child care has never been more important. 
Jennifer Bailey, the director of development and marketing at St. Teresa Ministries in Bowling Green, which supports the Family Enrichment Center with a $20,000 grant, said the crisis drop-off program is “vital to our community.” 
“Oftentimes, parents have to choose who to leave their children with to go to a job interview or go to work or go to a class,” Bailey said. “And sometimes it’s not always the best decision, and sometimes it can be that they are left alone at a young age.” 
Kosair for Kids, a Louisville-based organization that advocates for children’s wellbeing, also helps fund the program with a $50,000 grant. 
“What we don’t want is — we don’t want that 4-year-old to be left at home with their 8-year-old older sibling,” said Barry Dunn, the president and CEO of Kosair for Kids. “That’s child neglect, and it’s not that there are bad people out there in those kinds of instances who necessarily want to do that, they just don’t have anywhere else to turn.” 
In addition to the crisis drop-off program, the Family Enrichment Center provides parenting classes and supervised visitations. The center also partners with senior volunteers through The Foster Grandparents Program, in which people 55 and older work with children in classrooms on counting and  other intellectual skills. 
One such volunteer, Faye McKeage, works with pre-K children and is assigned to help two students with reading and counting. 
“I want them to grow up to be responsible adults and if I could put a little love in their heart for them to love others, that’s what gives me joy,” she said. “They’re precious.”

‘Human capital’  
Jones and the staff at Wee Care always aim to transition their crisis drop-off kids — who are limited to 30 crisis drop-off days per year and 10 hours per week — into full-time care at the center. 
They also know that expense is often a barrier for families. 
On average, child care in Kentucky costs $8,756 a year, or $730 per month, according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute. 
“I definitely think that the state needs to fund and help support child care, not only for low-income but middle-income families as well,” said Bailey with St. Theresa’s. “Maybe the state could help in and start off setting some of the cost of the overhead. And you need to pay your workers a good wage. There’s always room for improvement that the state can do to help with child care.” 
Kentucky’s Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) also offers assistance to eligible families. In 2023, about 35,000 children attended a child care program thanks to CCAP, according to the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy. That accounted for about 21% of the state’s child care spots. 
Kentucky also needs “preschool for everyone,” Bailey said. In June, Gov. Andy Beshear signed an executive order that established an advisory committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
“Preschool for everyone, definitely at age 4, would be a win-win” Bailey said. “Really, you’re getting those kids in there and getting them ready and prepared for school, where some daycares don’t do that.” 
Child advocates said that while the two-year budget approved by the General Assembly in 2024 included valuable investments in child care, it was not enough to stabilize the industry. In 2026, lawmakers will pass a new budget. 
“Lawmakers sometimes may not see that those early years are the most instrumental for kids,” Jones said. 
  Nickie Jones poses for a photo at the Family Enrichment Center in Bowling Green, June 16, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)
Because of that, she said, “the babies have to be seen as human capital.” 
“This is an economic issue,” she said. “Who’s going to be the one that gives the life saving surgery? Who’s going to do that? These kids. They have to have the very best start in life — quality care, quality programming.” 
Watt said there are lots of ways to improve and support the industry, starting with public perception.
“This isn’t just coming in and playing with kids all day,” she said. “You’re coming in here and you’re teaching them, and you’re teaching them how to engage, and the language that you use is important.” 
Jones agreed, saying the state’s focus on economic development must also include child care. 
“Can we tout that we have really good early childhood programming in our area to draw people here? They think about jobs. Who’s going to work those jobs if they don’t have child care?” she said. 
There’s a “growing need for child care,” Jones said, and centers will have to adjust to meet those needs. 
But she’s determined to keep one seat in every classroom open for a child in need. So far, she hasn’t had to turn away paying clients in favor of the program. 
“Not only do we want to help keep the room open, but we’ve also tried to raise quality,” Jones said of the drop-off program. “It’s still something I see very important.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Dan McKee vetoed legislation that would have offered credit for the time still remaining after a vehicle registration is canceled. (Getty image)Of the 513 bills the General Assembly sent to Gov. Dan McKee this year, only two pairs have been blocked at the governor’s desk — both aimed at giving Rhode Island drivers partial credits for fees on canceled vehicle registrations.
McKee vetoed the two sets of bills opposed by the Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) on Wednesday, July 2, when his office announced his final decisions on legislation from this year’s session, which ended June 21.
The legislation sponsored by Rep. Gregory Costantino, a Providence Democrat, and Senate Majority Whip David Tikoian, a Smithfield Democrat, would have allowed drivers who cancel their vehicle registration before its expiration date to receive a credit for the unused portion of the fee they paid to the DMV. That credit could have been used toward future registration fees.
The registration period for renewals of motorcycles, passenger vehicles and camper RVs is two years. Fees are based on vehicle weight.
In letters to legislative leaders, McKee wrote the bills would “impose significant implementation burdens on the DMV” and could have negative fiscal impacts under the language approved by lawmakers.
Indeed, the DMV in its written testimony to lawmakers stated that the state would have lost between $1.3 million and $1.6 million based on registration cancellations in 2023 and 2024.
“Because the fees for many vehicles are more than $60, the actual amount of lost revenue could be much higher,” Walter “Bud” Craddock, the administrator of the Rhode Island DMV, wrote to the House Committee on Finance May 6.
McKee voiced concerns about provisions in one of the bill sets that would have allowed 36-month vehicle leases to renew for a third year to align with the end of the lease.
He wrote that the DMV does not track the terms of any leased vehicles because dealers and motorists are not required to submit a copy of their lease agreement at the time of initial registration.
“As a result, it would be impossible for the DMV to know the lease term at the time of renewal since most registrations are renewed online or through mail,” McKee wrote.
The governor can choose to sign a bill as a form of explicit endorsement, veto it, or can simply allow the bill to become law without a signature. 
Vetoed bills return to the chamber where they originated and the Rhode Island Constitution allows the General Assembly to override the governor’s decision if three-fifths of members in each chamber votes to affirm the bill’s passage. That vote would need to take place before the start of the new law making session in January. 
McKee’s veto messages are being reviewed by House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and President Valararie Lawson, their respective spokespeople said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
In 2024, McKee vetoed five sets of bills. The governor does not intend to strike down any other pieces of legislation this year, McKee spokesperson Andrea Palagi said in a text message.
“There aren’t any [bills] left — desk is cleared,” she wrote.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Tom Loftus)FRANKFORT — The Republican Party of Kentucky Building Fund raised another $375,000 in the past three months, bringing the total it has raised to pay for the expansion of its headquarters to more than $4 million.
Nearly all the money came in a few big contributions by special interest corporations that lobby in Washington and/or Frankfort.
The largest donation during the recent quarter was $150,000 from worldwide whiskey giant Sazerac Inc., which has its principal office in Louisville, according to a disclosure report filed with the Kentucky Registry of Election Finance.
Three other donors gave $50,000 each during the recent quarter: Airbnb Inc., of San Francisco; Keeneland, of Lexington, and The Barbara R. Banke Revocable Trust, of Geyserville, California.
Kentucky Lantern first reported in early 2023 that the state Republican Party had launched the fundraising drive to expand its headquarters in Frankfort — a drive that got off to a spectacular start with a donation of $1 million from pharmaceutical giant Pfizer —apparently the largest donation ever made to a political party in Kentucky history.
State and federal laws limit the amount any person can give to a state political party to $15,000 per year. And before 2017 state law banned corporations from making contributions.
But that year the Kentucky General Assembly passed a law to make it easy for the GOP to raise the millions it would need to build a new headquarters. That law let political parties establish separate building funds that could accept donations of unlimited amounts from corporations or people.
The Republican Party of Kentucky (RPK) has its headquarters in south Frankfort, about five blocks from the Capitol. It is called the Mitch McConnell Building in honor of Kentucky’s senior senator who is credited with leading the party from decades of minority status to its current dominance in Kentucky politics.
The expansion project calls for connecting the headquarters to a new 6,800-square-foot structure on an adjacent vacant lot, designed to conform to the residential nature of the neighborhood. The new building includes a 160-seat auditorium.
Ground was broken for the project last summer, construction has moved at a fast pace.
“We expect the building to be completed sometime this fall. We’re very excited about the construction wrapping up. It will be great to finally use the new space,” Andy Westberry, spokesman for the RPK, said in response to an email asking questions about the project. “We’ll continue fundraising as well. Like with any facility, there will be ongoing costs for upkeep and maintenance.”
Westberry did not address an emailed question seeking comment on the funding of the project by special interest donors. 
Reports filed by the RPK Building Fund since early 2023 with the election registry show that a total of $4,022,500 has been raised for the project since late 2022, and that through June 30 about $2.7 million has been spent.
Those reports show nearly all of that has been paid to three contractors: $2,273,000 to Branscum Construction, of Russell Springs; $244,000 to Stengel-Hill Architecture, of Louisville, and $165,000 to Haney Consulting for fundraising consulting. Haney Consulting is headed by Laura Haney, McConnell’s longtime fundraising consultant.
The Kentucky Democratic Party has not used the 2017 law to launch any major fund drive. In the recent quarter it reported $142 in receipts, $20,613 in expenses, and a fund balance of $286,497 as of June 30.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Growing up on the northside of Denver, I was surrounded by a diverse community with a rich history. There, I learned about resilience, about neighbors looking out for each other, and about the importance of always standing up for what’s right. This lesson has guided my 20 years of progressive activism throughout Colorado, from my work to protect reproductive rights to my work to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all Coloradans. 
As someone who fights for a fairer and just society, I paid attention when big box retailers began speaking the language of diversity and equity several years ago. Companies like Walmart, Target and Home Depot positioned themselves as allies of marginalized communities. The stores launched supplier diversity programs, implemented DEI training, and claimed to share our values of inclusion and justice. Walmart even founded its nonprofit to advance racial justice. Corporate America finally understood that it also had a role to play in helping us build stronger, more inclusive communities. 
However, my years in progressive organizing have also taught me an important lesson: Watch what someone does, not just what they say.

When Donald Trump returned to the White House and demanded an end to diversity initiatives, the big retailers bent the knee. Walmart stopped funding its racial justice nonprofit. Target abandoned its supplier diversity program, taking away opportunities from minority businesses that are often overlooked. Even Home Depot dropped mentions of diversity from its website and its annual report to investors. As a result of the anti-diversity push, events like Denver Pride have lost significant funding this year. 
The retailers betrayed our communities, hoping we wouldn’t notice, but we did. That’s why the Rocky Mountain NAACP encouraged shoppers in our state to take their business to the retailers who refused to cave on diversity issues, and consumers all over the nation launched boycotts of Walmart and Target.
What makes it worse is that in many marginalized and rural communities, big box stores are often the only place to shop. People rely on them for everyday essentials. When these companies cut diversity programs or raise prices, it harms those who need them most. It shouldn’t be too much to ask these companies to consider their customers. 
Diversity isn’t the only issue where the retailers are failing us, though. Every Coloradan has seen the cost of groceries skyrocket. As of 2023, Coloradans pay 19% more than the national average for groceries. Why? During COVID, it was because some retailers took advantage of supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic to jack up prices on consumers. A Federal Trade Commission report last year found that food and beverage retailer revenues increased more than 7% over total costs in the first three quarters of 2023. A senior executive at a major grocery chain even admitted that the store raised prices on basic necessities beyond what was necessary.
This summer, Trump’s tariffs are giving the stores an excuse to play the same pricing tricks. Many believe the stores will use the economic chaos caused by tariffs as cover for yet another chance to pad their bottom lines at our expense. It may have already started. Walmart and Target have announced price increases to varying degrees, even as tariffs have been removed or paused.  
Also troubling, the stores have new technology that they can deploy to trick consumers. Across the nation, Walmart, Kroger, and other stores are rolling out digital price labels, which replace paper shelf prices with electronic screens. With digital price labels, stores can change prices on goods storewide with a few keystrokes. Democratic members of Congress, including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have voiced concern that this technology could lead to “surge pricing” for groceries on days with high demand or when stores feel like they can squeeze a little more from their customers. Some states have moved to ban or limit this technology. Colorado ought to consider the same.  
As retailers prepare once again to manipulate prices, our elected leaders in Washington, D.C., and Denver need to pay close attention. They need to demand transparency in pricing practices to make sure consumers aren’t being exploited in times of economic uncertainty. 
Big box retailers have made clear they will shift with the political winds and use every trick in the book to maximize their profits. Our leaders should not let them get away with it.

Sarah Huckabee Sanders at the March 8, 2023, signing of the Arkansas LEARNS Act. The wide-ranging law created a statewide minimum teacher salary of $50,000 and a school voucher program, among other things. (John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Gov. Sarah Sanders’ school vouchers program has taught us once again a self-evident lesson about human nature: Free money is popular.
For the upcoming school year, all parents in Arkansas qualify for about $6,800 in state subsidies for private school tuition or homeschool expenses, no matter how much money they make or the test results of the public schools their children attend. So not surprisingly, as of this writing, 45,500 applicants have stepped up to the trough, blowing through not only the $187 million legislators appropriated for the program in the state budget but another $90 million in reserve funds set aside just in case the appropriation ran out.
Arkansas Department of Education officials recently insisted to legislators that there will be enough money this year to hand out vouchers to every parent who qualifies, although the Arkansas Times did the math and made a compelling case that some parents are likely to be put on a waiting list.
Whether the money runs out this year or not, what’s clear is that the vouchers program, Sanders’ pet project, has become a voracious consumer of taxpayer dollars, with more than $374 million spent in the first three years — on a program that hasn’t, doesn’t, and won’t improve a single public school anywhere in Arkansas and which research shows will actually negatively affect educational outcomes for students who use it.
More than a few taxpayers might also be chagrined that voucher money has been used to subsidize enrichment activities for homeschool students that include horseback riding, ninja warrior training, cooking classes, and archery — activities that parents of public school students must pay for themselves. Or that vendors getting money from the program operate largely on an honor system when it comes to complying with program rules.
To their credit, Arkansas legislators didn’t set up the vouchers program as an entitlement with open-ending funding, which led to a budget meltdown in Arizona. Instead, they limited participation based on annual appropriations. When the money runs out, priority is given to students already in the program, and new students go on a waiting list.
 Funding alternatives?

But with expenditures now approaching $300 million a year, the fiscal cliff caused by the vouchers program will soon force lawmakers to start making difficult choices.
They could pay for vouchers by raising taxes, clearly a nonstarter for the Republican supermajority. They could also keep costs in check by limiting the number of participants. However, telling parents no after promising them free money would create intolerable political pressures, given that the point of the program is to allow parents with ideological opposition to public schools to escape from them. 
The third and most likely alternative: Find more money for vouchers by tapping into revenue growth or raiding existing programs in the state budget. Unless legislators discover a money tree growing on the Capitol grounds, they’ll have to prioritize vouchers over other things they might like to finance, including Sanders’ own often-stated desire to eliminate the state income tax.
And before legislators indulge the governor with hundreds of millions more dollars of voucher spending, they might want to more closely scrutinize how some of that money is being spent, as I did by filing a FOIA request for applications submitted by all 569 voucher vendors approved for the 2024-25 school year.
While voucher money handed out to parents of private school students mostly goes toward tuition, homeschool parents can use their vouchers with any vendor approved by the state.
Last fall, there was a public kerfuffle when a horseback riding stable in Fayetteville posted on Facebook that it was accepting voucher money. After the state’s own data showed just 44% of the voucher money given to homeschool parents went for education-related expenses, legislators limited voucher spending on extracurricular activities to 25% of the voucher amount, which is still about $1,700 a year.
Many of these vendors do offer educational services, including books, classroom materials, and tutoring, including specialized services for kids with learning disabilities. But the money is also being used for lessons in jiu jitsu and krav maga (an Israeli combat technique), musical training for aspiring rock stars, and specialized athletic training, in addition to the aforementioned horseback riding lessons, cooking classes, and ninja warrior instruction.
This is not to say that these vendors aren’t offering legitimate services, or that students aren’t benefiting. Dressage and ninja warrior training perhaps have their place. But why should the hardworking taxpayers of Arkansas be paying for any of this?
Parents certainly have the legal right to opt out of public schools and educate their kids themselves. But if they forsake the educational opportunities provided by law and financed by taxpayers, they should also assume the financial obligations that go with that decision, including paying for their kids’ extracurricular activities.
Vouchers instead create a perverse system that’s akin to going to a birthday party, turning up your nose at the cake on offer, and then asking the host to give you money to buy your own cake.
 Vetting vendors

Equally troubling is the ease with which someone can become a vouchers vendor, which requires going online and responding to 18 questions. Many of the applications, when printed out, come to just three or four pages;  once submitted, the review process by the Arkansas Department of Education takes just 10-15 days, which doesn’t leave much time for in-depth vetting before vendors start tapping into state funds.
Vendors also operate on an honor system. For example, they have to acknowledge, with their initials, that the services they provide meet program rules, but they are only required to “describe” the services, rather than provide detailed documentation of them. I found descriptions – in approved applications – that were as brief as a single sentence.
They must also acknowledge that they’ve done background checks on any employees who work directly with students, but the application does not require them to submit those background checks unless the education department asks to see them — one of the many scandals waiting to happen with this loose level of regulation.
 Vanity projects

State school voucher programs have become a new political fad, vanity projects pushed by right-wing governors looking to create a legacy. But the legislators going along with these schemes are paying scant attention to the long-term financial implications, which loom ever larger in Arkansas.
At some point in the future, Sanders will ride off into the sunset; the legislators who shoved through her vouchers program in less than three weeks will drift away. But vouchers will remain — a giant maw gobbling up taxpayer dollars that will bedevil future governors and lawmakers, while doing precious little to improve educational outcomes.
Which brings up another self-evident lesson for us to relearn: Free money may be popular, but it isn’t actually free.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)I’m a 31-year-old single professional, born and raised in Providence. Having spent more than half of my life shifting through foster care, I now work full-time for the State of Rhode Island and have over a decade of human and public service experience. And yet, despite my steady income and deep roots in this community, I find myself increasingly concerned about my housing stability. I’m struggling to find a safe, affordable place to live in the city I’ve always called home.
A part of the housing crisis we don’t talk about enough is the growing number of middle-income Rhode Islanders who are falling through the cracks. People like me — earning between $65,000 and $75,000 a year — are often excluded from affordable housing programs and don’t qualify for most public assistance. But the private market is simply out of reach.
I earn approximately $73,500 annually. After taxes, health care premiums, retirement contributions, and other deductions, my take-home pay is just under $4,200 a month. I live in a 400 square-foot studio because a modest two-bedroom apartment in Providence easily costs over $2,000 a month. That’s nearly half my income — far above the recommended 30% threshold for housing affordability.
And it’s not just the rent. It’s the rising cost of groceries, utilities, transportation, and student loan payments. For regular wage earners like me, the math simply doesn’t add up. We are trapped in what many call the “missing middle” — making too much to qualify for help, yet not enough to afford a basic standard of living in the city we serve.
My housing challenges are made even more difficult by a limited rental history. I lived in on-campus housing while attending Rhode Island College, followed by years of unstable or temporary living arrangements after I ran out of Federal Student Aid. This reality, coupled with a credit score that has been a consistent work in progress, creates significant barriers to accessing quality housing — barriers that are often invisible in policy frameworks but deeply felt in practice.
This isn’t just a personal hardship — it’s a structural failure. Middle-income workers like me are often invisible in housing policy conversations. But we’re not a fringe case. We’re the case managers, teachers, social workers, nonprofit staffers, and early-career nurses who are doing everything “right” and still getting left behind.
If Rhode Island is serious about solving its housing crisis, we need to stop treating middle-income earners as if we don’t need support. We need new strategies that include:

Expanding income eligibility thresholds to serve people earning 80% to 120% of Area Median Income;
Developing mixed-income housing models that reflect a broader range of lived experiences;
Adjusting credit and rental history requirements to account for the realities of those who’ve experienced systemic barriers;
Drafting a robust statewide housing plan — including a separate, targeted strategy to prevent homelessness.











Middle-income workers like me are often invisible in housing policy conversations. But we’re not a fringe case. We’re the case managers, teachers, social workers, nonprofit staffers, and early-career nurses who are doing everything “right” and still getting left behind. 


Housing is a human right — and one that must be extended to more than just those at the extremes of need. As a full-time public employee, I contribute daily to the well-being of my neighbors, and yet I’m on the verge of being priced out of the very community I serve. The fear of living in my car is not distant or dramatic — it’s real and immediate.
This isn’t a theoretical problem. It’s happening right now, to people you work with, rely on, and care for. Rhode Island’s housing crisis isn’t just about poverty — it’s about the collapse of affordability across the entire working class. We need housing policies and solutions that reflect the full range of our economic realities.
I share my story not to ask for pity, but to demand action — because this problem isn’t mine alone. It belongs to all of us. If we want to build a just and livable Rhode Island, we must ensure that housing honors the full spectrum of the people who live and work here.

(Photo courtesy of Norfolk International Airport)As scrutiny of flight safety intensifies nationwide, Norfolk International Airport officials say their shared airspace remains “safe,” thanks to close coordination with commercial airlines and military partners.
Questions about Norfolk’s airspace surfaced after a January collision between an American Airlines Bombardier jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter over the Potomac River.  The crash, which killed all 64 people on board the jet, occurred as the plane prepared to land at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.
Reagan operates under restricted airspace to prevent aircraft from flying near high-risk areas and must accommodate heavy military and government air traffic. It’s located near the Pentagon, the White House, and Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling.
Like Reagan, Norfolk works closely with the military — especially  the Navy and Air Force — to manage constrained airspace and ensure helicopter traffic remains safely separated from its commercial runways.
“I think we are in a better situation,” said Mark Perryman, president and CEO of Norfolk International Airport, at the May 15 meeting with leaders in Hampton. “We’re not quite as congested (as DCA), although we do have a very congested airspace for an airport in a region our size, given all of the military installations, but it’s something that we have very good cooperation with the DoD and the FAA. We are safe.”
Perryman told the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization (HRTPO) that Norfolk has earned a reputation as one of the best domestic airports, expanding its nonstop flight offerings significantly over the past decade.
Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, who sits on the HRTPO, acknowledged the heightened public  interest in aviation safety. She said Norfolk’s advantage lies in the region’s long-standing civil-military  coordination — something that travelers should take comfort in. 
“Our airspace is safe because Hampton Roads has the strongest records of civil and military coordination in the country,” Anthony told The Mercury. 
She pointed to efforts in the 1990s to install advanced radar systems and transfer control tower operations as examples of the region’s aviation leadership. Anthony, who served on the engineering team at the time, described the transfer process as intense and technically complex.
Perryman also addressed helicopter traffic in the airspace north of Norfolk’s Runway 5/23. Unlike Reagan Airport, where helicopters operate closer to the flight paths, military choppers in Norfolk fly farther north, over the Chesapeake Bay. 
That distance provides “far greater vertical separation,” said airport spokesman Chris Jones — several hundred feet more than what’s typical in airspace near DCA.
In May, the FAA reduced the size of three designated helicopter operating areas near Norfolk’s approach paths, further enhancing safety.
Norfolk International Airport, originally a military field, has operated for 85 years. Within 20-miles are three military installations with runways used for fixed-wing aircraft: Naval Station Norfolk Chambers Field, Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach, and Joint Base Langley-Eustis on the peninsula in Hampton. 
Virginia Beach’s Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek-Fort Story lacks a runway but supports military helicopter traffic, Jones said.
With multiple facilities nearby and Newport News operating its own commercial airport, Hampton Roads remains a “busy region for aviation,” Jones noted, emphasizing the importance of continued collaboration. 
“In a region with so many airports and air bases, this is to be expected,” Jones said. “Despite this, the conditions and practices now in place are such that they do not elicit safety concerns for travelers or military aviators.”



 $5 million headed to Virginia airports

Seven airports in Virginia are set to receive a combined grant total of $5 million to support infrastructure improvements. The grants come through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration Airport Infrastructure Grant program.
U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, D-Va., have long supported improving Virginia’s airports.
“Investing in our airports means investing in safety, connectivity, and economic opportunity for communities across the Commonwealth,” said in a joint statement on June 27. “We’re proud to support these improvements that will help ensure Virginia’s airports continue to serve travelers and local economies for years to come.”
The grant awards
$2,948,555 to the Roanoke Regional Airport Commission to upgrade taxiways B, B1, B2, B3, and B4 at the Roanoke Regional Airport;
$730,000 to the City of Suffolk to expand the terminal apron Suffolk Executive Airport to allow for a wider variety of aircrafts;
$661,200 to the Chesapeake Airport Authority to remove trees obstructing operations at the Chesapeake Regional Airport;
$260,000 to the County of Halifax to install runway end identifier lights and a precision approach path indicator system at Halifax Stanfield International Airport;
$190,000 to the Town of Farmville to reconstruct the precision approach path indicator system for Runway 3/21 at Farmville Regional Airport;
$159,000 to the Dinwiddie County Airport and Industrial Authority to construct a new hanger for aircraft storage at Dinwiddie County Airport;
$110,000 to the Town of Tangier to reseal taxiway and apron pavement prolonging their lifespan at Tangier Island Airport.

Kelly Ayotte signed the law removing the income cap. (File photo by Annmarie Timmins/New Hampshire Bulletin)Well before Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed a bill last month to make New Hampshire education freedom accounts available to all income levels, school choice supporters were preparing to get the word out.
On June 10, Ayotte signed Senate bill 295, and a multi-prong awareness campaign kicked into gear. 
The conservative advocacy group Americans For Prosperity NH dispatched social media ads informing New Hampshire residents that the previous income cap on the voucher-like program had been eliminated. 
Supportive state senators like Victoria Sullivan, the Manchester Republican who authored the bill, began directing interested constituents to the sign-up portal for the program, which allows New Hampshire residents to receive state funds toward public and private school expenses. 
And the Children’s Scholarship Fund, the nonprofit organization that administers the education freedom accounts, blasted emails to every parent, school and provider currently participating in the program to tell them about the change.
The awareness campaigns worked. Within a week of Ayotte signing the bill, the Children’s Scholarship Fund had seen 2,000 additional people apply, according to the Concord Monitor.
“I got inundated with emails,” Sullivan said in an interview with the Bulletin. “It just became impossible to actually respond to everybody individually. So I used X and my Facebook page to give people the information as to where they could go to fill out the application.”
Ayotte signs universal EFA bill, parental bill of rights

And as of July 2, about 9,000 families have either completed or started an application for an education freedom account, Kate Baker Demers, the executive director of the fund, said last week. Not all of those families will finish and turn in those applications, Baker Demers said. But the numbers suggest the program could exceed lawmakers’ estimates of 7,500 students in the program next school year.
For newly eligible families, there was incentive to move quickly. While the law removes the income limits for the program, which previously sat at 350% of the federal poverty level, lawmakers included an annual cap on enrollees to mitigate some of the anticipated costs. That cap applied to families making more than 350%; the sooner those families submitted an application, the sooner they could guarantee themselves a spot.
Supporters of the program say the large surge in interest validates the Legislature’s push to make the program open to all income levels.
Democrat decries funding to wealthy 
But Democrats, who have opposed the education freedom account program from the beginning, say the preliminary numbers show that the program is already likely to exceed its budget. Democrats vociferously opposed Sullivan’s bill during the session, arguing that people in higher income brackets should not receive state support for private schools.
“The voucher scam proponents really underestimated the impact on purpose, I think, deliberately to deceive legislators to vote for the bill and to deceive Granite Staters,” said Rep. David Luneau, a Hopkinton Democrat. 
Report: New Hampshire’s public school state spending levels lowest in U.S.

As part of making the program universal, lawmakers imposed a 10,000 student cap in the program’s first year, though a number of categories of students are not subject to that cap. It is unclear whether the state will hit that cap this year, though Baker Demers is dubious. She has predicted 8,500 voucher recipients in the coming school year once all applications are submitted and approved.
Supporters of the program say the large number of applications this summer are a reflection of the high number of families who wanted to use education freedom accounts but were just barely outside of the income limits. 
Sullivan said many parents of children with disabilities, who have been dissatisfied with the individualized education plans at their public school, have expressed excitement at the opportunity to explore alternative options with some state funding.
“I knew there were a lot of families that were just outside of the income cap last time, but there have been a lot of families with kids in special education that are not having their needs met in the public school that have reached out to me about it,” she said. “So that part was surprising to me.”
And Sarah Scott, field director of Americans For Prosperity NH, said the removal of the income limit could also be a boon for single parents.
“Single parents often have rough lives and the kids have struggled,” she said. “…A lot of those families weren’t eligible because when you look at 350% of the federal poverty line for a family of two ($74,025), it’s very low.”
More outreach planned
While the outreach in the last month has been relatively successful, proponents say many eligible families still likely do not know about the program. Scott said the online ads, for which the organization has paid about $10,000 so far, are designed to reach families who may not follow state politics closely enough to know about the change. 
“I think that prior to June 10, most of the families that were aware of the program were the people that are following what’s going on in their town in local politics,” she said. “Now I think we’re definitely seeing more and more of those families that are so wrapped up in, you know, driving their kids to afternoon sports, taking them to tutoring or you know Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts.”
Sullivan added that though she is a believer in the education freedom accounts, which her children have received, private school or homeschooling may not be the right choice for many families.
“I don’t think it’s a program for every family,” she said. “A lot of families are happy with their public schools, and I wouldn’t want to be pushing people into an education that wasn’t right for them.”
The total tally of education freedom account students in the 2025 to 2026 school year will not be known for months. Families are allowed to apply throughout the year, but the bulk of applications happen before mid July. The Department of Education releases a report based on those numbers in November.
Luneau says he and other Democrats will continue to campaign against the education freedom accounts to turn voters against the idea of giving state funds to wealthy families. How wealthy those families are will not be clear. The families who say they are above the 350% poverty level do not need to submit income verification, or state their income at all.
And Luneau says he would also like more accountability over where the money is going and how the program vendors are approved. 
“This is a program that very quickly is going to be over $100 million a year, over a billion bucks — billion with a capital B — over a 10-year period,” Luneau said. “And that’s a billion dollars that isn’t going to be helping cities and towns or reducing property taxes. Essentially it’s a billion dollars that is going to be sitting on top of everyone’s property taxes.” 
Baker Demers and Scott counter that demand for the program will likely level out, and they say the state will be able to sustain the funding levels.
“I think that in the first couple of weeks, there’s always a lot of talk about it,” she said. “…But over the course of the next year, I think a lot of the families that really want to take advantage of it will be aware of it and will already have taken the steps to do that.”

Firearm suicides constituted an astounding 58% of all gun slayings in the United States in 2023, the most recent year for the available data, according to a new report from the Center for Gun Violence Solutions and Center for Suicide Prevention. Both centers are based at Johns Hopkins University.
In fact, suicides have accounted for the majority of all firearm deaths every year since 1995. That’s nearly three decades.
You wouldn’t know those facts from the outsized attention gun-related homicides receive. This includes coverage of mass shootings in which suspects mow down complete strangers or – as happened in Virginia – co-workers and fellow university students.
Guns were the weapon used in 46,728 deaths nationwide in 2023. Of that total, gun suicides reached a new annual high of 27,3000. The CDC also noted more than half of all methods of suicides that year involved a gun. Gun suicide rates among Black and Latino people ages 10-19 surged from 2014 to 2023.
The commonwealth’s gun suicide rate per 100,000 people was 8.38, 29th among the states. In 2022, of 1,316 gun deaths in Virginia, 723 were suicides and 556 were homicides.
Meanwhile, gun homicides in 2023 accounted for 17,927 deaths nationwide, falling almost 9% from 2022, the report said. But they still remain at near-record levels.
The COVID-19 pandemic saw a huge spike in gun sales in Virginia and nationwide, putting more guns within easy reach of more Americans. It’s a recipe for danger in too many households. 
“There hasn’t been an increase in suicide attempts. They just have become more fatal because there are more guns in houses,” Dr. Paul Nestadt told me. He’s the medical director of the Center for Suicide Prevention at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and a co-author of the new study.
Guns are also the most common method for “completed” suicides, he said. Even though firearms are used only in 5-6% of suicide attempts, they result in more than half of all suicides, according to a 2019 study cited in the Johns Hopkins report.
Such lethality means when someone thinks of ending his life, and then fires a gun, he probably won’t get a second chance.
Yet, “it’s a myth that if someone survives a suicide attempt, they’ll inevitably try again or simply find another method,” Nestadt said in online comments with the report. “ … The majority of people — about 94% of people who survive a suicide attempt — will continue to survive.”
Officials at Johns Hopkins and the nonprofit organization Brady: United Against Gun Violence, suggest several ways to intervene to prevent gun suicides. They include voluntary out-of-home gun storage for those with a higher risk of harming themselves, and assessment and counseling by health care providers regarding gun ownership.
Brady President Kris Brown told me her group began the “End Family Fire” campaign in 2019 to emphasize safe storage of firearms, including using a biometric safe or storing guns remotely when family members are thinking about ways to kill themselves. Those actions help prevent people from getting guns who are having a mental health crisis or suffering from depression. Firearm accessibility, Brown said, has played a role in increased teen suicides.
The United States, at just 4% of the world’s population, has 35% of the firearm suicides globally, she noted. “It’s horrific,” Brown said. “The thing to understand is that this is entirely preventable.”
Nestadt said Virginia is one of nearly two dozen states that have extreme risk protection orders, also known as “red flag” laws. The measures allow law-enforcement authorities to temporarily seize guns from people deemed dangerous.
He said studies show these laws save lives. A Duke University professor, for example, estimated in 2024 that one suicide death “could be prevented for every 17 or 23 issued” extreme risk protection orders. The research was published in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.
Journalists also have a role to play.
For too many years, we shied away from covering suicides for fear of increasing relatives’ pain, seeming too intrusive or inspiring potential copycats. We employed euphemisms and couched phrases instead of saying plainly how folks died.
That made the subject of suicides – no matter the method – taboo. It meant the causes of such self-harm weren’t examined in detail.
One unforgiveable example was the way my then-employer, The Virginian-Pilot, initially reported on the death in 2004 of reporter Dennis O’Brien.
He and I had been colleagues at both the (Newport News) Daily Press and The Pilot. O’Brien, 35, had made a name for himself during his dispatches from the Iraq war while embedded for months with a Marine unit.
The paper didn’t initially report the cause of death, leading to many justifiable questions from readers. As I recall, we violated our own newsroom guidelines because his body was found hanging in a public place – near some railroad tracks. That should’ve forced us to be candid.
It wasn’t until a few years later that The Pilot reported O’Brien had suffered from depression for much of his life.
Nestadt, the Johns Hopkins doctor, recalled talking to a family where the son had killed himself. Another family in that community had lost a child to cancer around the same time. Neighbors responded differently to the two families because of those circumstances.
“It should really be focused on,” he said. “One downside to not reporting on (suicides) is that families often feel so alone.”
My colleagues and I have a responsibility to do better. We should, along with all people concerned about firearm suicides, fight to end this underreported scourge.
It would help save lives.

(Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire median home prices hit a record high in June, soaring to $565,000, according to the New Hampshire Association of Realtors, in the latest sign that the state’s housing market has yet to cool off. 
The increase, which came at the start of the typically-busy summer season, continues a more than five-year streak of climbing home prices in New Hampshire, which kicked off during the outbreak of COVID-19, according to the association. 
Last month was the first time the state has broken its price record since June 2024, when median prices hit $540,000. 
In comparison, the state broke the $300,000 median home price barrier only in 2019.
According to the association, there were 2,431 single family residential units for sale in New Hampshire at the end of June, a 66% decrease from the same month in 2016, when there were 7,112 homes for sale. According to the association, 2016 was the last year the state housing market was “balanced.”
The prices suggest that high demand for available housing, a slowdown in construction of new houses, and the reluctance of some homeowners to sell amid high interest rates are suppressing the ability of the state’s housing market to recover from the surge in sales from out-of-state buyers during the pandemic. 
“The idea of owning a home is becoming more challenging for too many New Hampshire residents, especially young families and first-time home buyers,” said Susan Cole, the association president, in a statement. “Demand for housing in our state is still very high, and these numbers suggest that trend is not going away soon.”
Nick Taylor, director of Housing Action N.H., an advocacy group for affordable housing, said the price increases indicate more legislation is needed next year to spur development. 
“When teachers, first responders, and hardworking Granite Staters can’t find homes they can afford, it threatens the strength of our communities and economy,” he said. “A bipartisan group of lawmakers took meaningful steps this legislative session to allow more attainable housing options, but with record high prices, it’s clear the work is far from done.”

(Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)Of the many gun bills that went before the Maine Legislature’s Judiciary Committee this past session, only one was signed into law, while others that passed both chambers will have to wait until next year to determine their final outcome. 
The committee advanced legislation regarding the state’s 72-hour waiting period for gun purchases that is currently tied up in court, serial numbers on ghost guns and a variety of other firearm-related measures. While the attempts to reform the state’s concealed carry laws and redefine “machine gun” were a bust, a few bills won’t be decided on until the next legislative session, which starts in January. 
One proposal did make it over the finish line with Gov. Janet Mills’ signing of an amended version of LD 1174. That legislation will limit the liability on gun shops that enter into firearm hold agreements. That law will take effect on Sept. 24, like all non-emergency laws passed this session. 
In late May, the committee decided it would wait to take action on any legislation regarding the 72-hour waiting period for firearm purchases until the next session, in order to let the ongoing lawsuit play out. 
Lawmakers will also wait until next year to revisit LD 1867, which seeks to prohibit financial institutions and merchants from using firearm codes to track purchases. The measure passed both chambers, but was left for the budget committee to decide whether it could fund the bill’s $185,000 price tag and ultimately was carried over to next session.
Another bill currently in limbo is LD 1126, which would require serial numbers for so-called ghost guns that are assembled at home or those made with a 3D printer, was sent to Mills in the final hours of the session. Since it was passed but unsigned when the Legislature adjourned sine die, the governor will have three days after the next session begins in January to sign it, allow it to become law without her signature or veto it. 
Red flag proposal going to voters without competing measure
A proposal for a red-flag law, which stemmed from a citizen-led initiative, did not pass the Legislature but will instead appear on the November ballot for voters to weigh in on. 
The Judiciary Committee didn’t end up holding a work session for LD 1378, despite it having an 11th hour public hearing after insistence from Republicans. 
The proposal would allow a family member, household member or law enforcement officer to petition for an extreme risk protection order if someone is posing a significant danger to themself or another person, which would prohibit them from purchasing, possessing or controlling a “dangerous weapon.”
Some gun rights proponents wanted to put an alternative on the ballot that would beef up Maine’s current yellow flag law, which allows law enforcement to take guns away from people after a mental health evaluation. However, that proposal, which identified ways to strengthen the current law while also expanding mental health services to rural areas, never made it to a work session or a vote, so it will not appear on the ballot as a competing measure for voters to consider.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The giant tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law over the weekend includes the biggest health care spending cuts in U.S. history. In response, states are scrambling to shield their hospitals from the looming loss of hundreds of millions in federal funding.
In Georgia, a key state panel late last month took steps to send more state Medicaid money to hospitals, hoping to maximize federal matching dollars before the cuts take effect. Other states are considering new grant programs that would funnel additional money to rural hospitals. Some state legislatures likely will reconvene to discuss how to fill holes in their Medicaid budgets.
The tax and spending bill cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. Under the measure, payments to hospitals or nursing facilities would probably decrease in at least 29 states, according to an analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy group.
Facing such budget shortfalls, states may have to stop offering optional Medicaid benefits such as vision and dental, reduce the rates they pay providers — which could shrink access for Medicaid enrollees — and change eligibility requirements so that fewer people qualify for coverage.
State policymakers and health experts worry the loss of funding also will endanger hospitals, particularly those in rural areas, driving up uncompensated care and forcing them to cut services or close entirely.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

“Ultimately, when these hospitals close, what happens? People have to now travel longer for care. They might not even make it,” Dr. Anahita Dua, a vascular surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center, told reporters last week during a news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched to oppose Trump administration policies.
“This is ultimately not only going to affect the lives of the people that are not going to get the care, but also the majority of the hospitals that provide this care, and the people that are employed by those locations,” she said.
Earlier this month, an analysis by the State Health and Value Strategies program at Princeton University estimated that hospitals would lose 18% of their Medicaid funding, nearly $665 billion over the next 10 years.
Republicans have hailed the megabill — officially titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — as one that will cut waste, fraud and abuse in federal programs, secure the U.S. border and spur economic growth. The measure will add at least $3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and has been scored by some independent economists as likely having little impact on growth. Dollars diverted from Medicaid will go toward the tax cuts prioritized by Trump, along with new spending on immigration control and defense projects.
Reconvening legislatures
Health policy experts anticipate at least some states will have to pull their legislatures back into session to address gaping budget holes due to the Medicaid cuts.
States can expect to lose 3%-18% of their federal Medicaid funding over 10 years under the law, according to the State Health and Value Strategies program report. Arizona, Kentucky and Virginia would see the largest shares of their Medicaid dollars evaporate.
Republicans target a tax that keeps state Medicaid programs running

Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has said he’s likely to reconvene the legislature.
“Almost certainly if some of these big cuts to Medicaid go through … we would likely need to reconvene, depending on what Congress does,” Polis said at a news conference in May.
Policymakers in some states have tried to get ahead of expected shortfalls.
In late June, the Georgia Department of Community Health’s advisory board held an emergency meeting. In a unanimous vote, the board approved several measures aimed at increasing the state’s federal Medicaid reimbursement rate.
For example, the state wants to significantly increase Medicaid payments to hospitals that achieve certain goals, such as training Georgia doctors and delivering babies. The move would draw down an additional $2.1 billion per year in federal money.
“We’re doing our best to be responsive to the Medicaid conversations in Washington,” department Commissioner Russel Carlson told the board at the meeting. “Not overreacting in this 24/7 news cycle, but gathering the best information we can, reading the political environment the best we can, and acting responsibly.”
Other states have filed similar requests with the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and received approval in recent months.
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

“Of all the Medicaid discussions happening in Washington,” Carlson said, “one of the policy decisions that could potentially, depending on how it ultimately lands, impact Georgians the most is the discussion surrounding directed payment programs.”
Grants for hospitals
Some of the biggest federal savings in the new law come from limiting states’ use of a financing tool, known as a provider tax, that enables them to draw down more federal dollars. States use the extra money to boost reimbursement rates for hospitals and to expand coverage.
Some congressional Republicans have decried the maneuver as a “money laundering scheme,” but lowering provider taxes will likely punch big holes in state Medicaid budgets.
Meanwhile, some state legislatures are looking at alternate ways to shore up funding for hospitals. A bipartisan bill still under consideration in Pennsylvania would create a rural health care grant program to help pay off student loans for rural doctors, nurses and dentists. Indiana and Oklahoma also considered bills this session to create grant programs for rural hospitals.
In April, Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott announced the state would release more than $6 million in grants to support struggling rural hospitals.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)ABILENE, Texas — Bolstered by $3.2 million from a former Midland oilman, this West Texas city of 130,000 people is helping the Lone Star State lead a national nuclear energy resurgence.
Doug Robison’s 2021 donation to Abilene Christian University helped the institution win federal approval to house an advanced small modular nuclear reactor, which might be finished as soon as next year. Small modular reactors are designed to be built in factories and then moved to a site, and require less upfront capital investment than traditional large reactors.
The company Robison founded, Natura Resources, is investing another $30.5 million in the project. Only two small modular reactors are in operation, one in China and another in Russia. Natura Resources is one of two companies with federal permits to build one in the U.S.
“Nuclear is happening,” said Robison, who retired from the oil business and moved to Abilene to launch the company. “It has to happen.”
Robison’s words are being echoed across the country with new state laws that aim to accelerate the spread of projects that embrace advanced nuclear technology — decades after the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl calamities soured many Americans on nuclear power.


Arkansas lawmakers this year directed the state’s Department of Energy and Environment to hire a consultant to conduct a feasibility study for establishing nuclear power generation in the state.
Act 707 of 2025 took effect upon the governor’s signature in mid-April, meaning the department should pick a consultant by late July or early August. The law also requires a feasibility report no later than 15 months of the effective date.
Earlier nuclear power-friendly legislation in Arkansas has included studying the feasibility of recycling spent nuclear fuel rods in the state.


In the past two years, half the states have taken action to promote nuclear power, from creating nuclear task forces to integrating nuclear into long-term energy plans, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, which advocates for the industry.

“I’ve been tracking legislation for 18 years, and when I first started tracking, there were maybe five or 10 bills that said the word ‘nuclear,’” said Christine Csizmadia, who directs state government affairs at the institute. “This legislative session, we’re tracking over 300 bills all across the country.”
The push is bipartisan. In New York, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul last month directed the New York Power Authority to build a zero-emission advanced nuclear power plant somewhere upstate — her state’s first new nuclear plant in a generation. In Colorado, Democratic Gov. Jared Polis in April signed legislation redefining nuclear energy, which doesn’t emit a significant amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases, as a “clean energy resource.” The law will allow future plants to receive state grants reserved for other carbon-free energy sources.
But no state is more gung-ho than Texas, where Republican Gov. Greg Abbott last month signed legislation creating the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office and investing $350 million in nuclear expansion.
“Texas is the energy capital of the world, and this legislation will position Texas at the forefront of America’s nuclear renaissance,” Abbott wrote in a statement.
In addition to legislative action, the Texas A&M University System has invited four nuclear manufacturers to build small modular reactors at the school’s 2,400-acre RELLIS campus in the city of Bryan.
In Texas and other fast-growing states, rising electricity demands are fueling the push. Tech companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon that require a tremendous amount of electricity to power vast data centers are teaming with nuclear developers to provide it.
Last October, Google signed an agreement with nuclear energy producer Kairos Power to deploy multiple small modular reactors capable of generating a total of up to 500 megawatts by 2035. Meta, the parent company of Facebook, announced in December that it is also looking to reach a similar deal. Some of the largest data centers require more than 100 megawatts of power capacity, enough to power around 100,000 U.S. households.
Constellation Energy announced last September that it would reopen Three Mile Island, shuttered since 2019, as part of a deal with Microsoft to power the tech giant’s AI data centers. One of the two reactors at the plant, which is located south of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, partially melted down in 1979. But the remaining reactor reliably produced electricity for the next four decades.
“Folks shouldn’t sleep on nuclear,” Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said as he welcomed back workers to the plant last month. “They should be aware of the important clean role it plays in our energy portfolio.”
But opponents say the renewed interest in nuclear energy is misguided.

In Colorado, a coalition of two dozen environmental groups, including the state chapter of the Sierra Club, urged Polis to veto the bill.
“The idea that nuclear power is a clean energy source could not be further from the truth,” the groups wrote in a letter to the governor. “Nuclear power is the only energy resource that generates dangerous waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years.”
Some critics say small modular reactors are actually more expensive than traditional reactors, when they are judged per kilowatt of the energy they produce. And one 2022 study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University and the University of British Columbia, concluded that small modular reactors will produce more radioactive waste than traditional reactors.
“There’s a pretty healthy skepticism about advanced nuclear projects,” said Adrian Shelley, who heads the Texas office of Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. Shelley said many environmental groups “are just deeply concerned about Texas’ ability to responsibly manage nuclear storage and especially nuclear waste in the long term.”
 Ramping up

The United States currently has 94 nuclear reactors at 54 plants in 28 states. The oldest began operating at Nine Mile Point in New York in 1969; the newest reactors, Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in Burke County, Georgia, began operating in 2023 and 2024.
Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission, said that between the mid-1990s and 2005, there were “no applications at all” for new reactors. In 2007, there was a surge of a dozen applications when the federal government began offering tax incentives. But interest in new reactors plunged again when the fracking boom boosted fossil fuels as an economical power source.
Over the past several years, activity has ramped up again. “There are a number of factors that we are seeing drive this increased interest,” Burnell said. “Probably the biggest one is the growth in data centers.”
The commission has approved three new nuclear projects in the past three years, including the one at Abilene Christian University. It is reviewing three other applications and is discussing potential projects with a dozen other nuclear developers, Burnell said.

Texas currently has two nuclear plants — Comanche Peak near Glen Rose in North Central Texas and the South Texas Project in Matagorda County on the Gulf Coast. The two plants, each of which has two reactors, provide about 10% of the state’s electric power, according to the Texas comptroller. The new small modular reactors would face the same safety standards as these plants.
The project at Abilene Christian began when Robison’s Natura Resources established a research alliance with that school, the Georgia Institute of Technology, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas at Austin. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the project in 2024.
The reactor will be constructed at a laboratory at a different site, but its home already awaits in a trench at the bottom of a cavernous room at Abilene Christian’s Dillard Science and Engineering Research Center. The trench is 25 feet deep, 80 feet long and 15 feet wide, with a radiation shield made of concrete 4 feet thick. When the 40-ton reactor is finished, possibly by the end of next year, it will be transported to its home on a flatbed truck.
“The future is uncertain, but we’re ahead of the pack and moving at an amazing clip,” said Rusty Towell, an Abilene Christian engineering and physics professor who is working on the project. “So I think that there’s a great reason for optimism.”
Towell asserted that the project will produce only “small amounts of low-level waste” and that storing it safely will not be a significant challenge.
 ‘What Henry Ford did for cars’

John Sharp, the outgoing chancellor of Texas A&M University, said he invited nuclear companies to build small modular reactors at the school to help meet the country’s desperate need for more power. He said it made sense to give developers access to the faculty and students at the university’s nuclear engineering department.











We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars.


– M, Aaol Atomics



Sharp said his pitch was simple: “Hey, we got some land. We got it next to some really smart people. Would you like to come and build a plant?
“And four folks said, ‘You betcha.’”
Matt Loszak, the 34-year-old CEO of Austin-based Aalo Atomics, one of the companies that answered Sharp’s call, said he had two employees 18 months ago. Now he has more than 50.
“We want to do for reactors what Henry Ford did for cars,” Loszak said, “which is really make them mass manufacturable and make it economical to deploy around the world.”
Robison said he’s been speaking at town halls in Abilene, a conservative community that is home to Dyess Air Force Base, for about five years. He claims the residents are “overwhelmingly excited” about having the small modular reactors at Abilene Christian, he said.
“Texas is an energy state,” he said. “We understand energy and what happens when you don’t have it.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
North Dakota lawmakers to hold hearing on security concerns after Minnesota attacks

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters last month. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Man tried to retrieve gun before sending threatening email, prosecutor says

Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio’s food banks are strained as it is. Huge cuts to the safety net signed into law in recent days could overwhelm them, the director of a Columbus food bank said last week.
President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” cut trillions in taxes — mostly for the richest Americans — added trillions to the federal debt, and it cut more than $1 trillion in spending on Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
In acknowledgement of the program’s unpopularity, some of the most painful of the benefit cuts won’t take effect until after the 2026 midterms. But some, such as administratively burdensome work requirements, could cost large numbers their food benefits.
In addition, the state budget Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed on June 30 provides $7.5 million less for food banks compared to last year.
Those cuts are on top of other recent cuts and as more families are in need because of the expiration of covid-era benefits, said Kathy Kelly-Long, director of the food pantry at the Broad Street Presbyterian Church in Columbus.
“As the pandemic credits expired, our numbers kept growing,” she said one morning last week as volunteers bustled in and out of the pantry.
While the pantry served an average of 35 families a day at the height of the pandemic in June 2021, it served an average of 58 last month. That’s a 66% increase.

Among the cuts pantries have already suffered, one was the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s cancellation of the Local Food Purchase Assistance Program on June 30. That program enabled food banks to buy directly from nearby farmers. It fell under the budget axe of an unofficial agency that Trump assigned the world’s richest man to run.
“A lot of those farmers relied on those funds — built some of their business around that,” Kelly-Long said. “A guy who was here yesterday said they lost $25,000 worth of business when (the program) went out. So there’s an economic cost because that’s $25,000 worth of fresh, locally grown produce that’s not being distributed to low-income families who don’t have access to it.”
But her main concern is for the clients the pantry serves.
“We can’t even begin to calculate what the loss of SNAP dollars and Medicaid will mean to people,” Kelly-Long said. “Because the system is already broken, we can’t get enough food in now. If the numbers go up, we don’t know how much food people will be able to get from us. Will it be anywhere near enough to feed their families?”
Among those clients are many hard-working people.
“There’s a lovely woman who’s been shopping here for years,” Kelly-Long said. “She’s raised multiple grandchildren. She works a full-time job on second shift. She comes here to have enough food to get by for the week.”
Not only has the woman worked to carry her own weight and raised two generations of children, “she’s the one the neighbors always turn to when they need help,” Kelly-Long said.
As people lose health insurance and food benefits — and as food banks are less able to serve them — they’ll turn to cheaper, less nutritious sustenance, Kelly-Long said.
“It leads to heart disease, diabetes, hypertension,” she said. “We already have diet-related disease in this country. If you have more people eating cheap food because they need the calories, but don’t get the nutrients, it’s going to be compounded.”
She said she was frustrated by a lack of interest from U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted. Both are Ohio Republicans who voted for the deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
“I’ve made multiple phone calls and have yet to talk to a real person,” Kelly-Long said. “Sen. Moreno, Sen. Husted, all of the emails I’ve sent, I get the same email back from the two of them, which indicates that somebody on their staff may have read it, but maybe not.”
She added that lawmakers in Washington, D.C. and Columbus fail when they pass bills that only benefit the few.
“To me, our legislators are not doing their job,” Kelly-Long said. “They were elected to represent the people in their districts — all of the people in their districts. And when they make decisions that benefit just a few people and harm the majority, that’s not doing their jobs.”

(Getty Images.)A group trying to repeal Ohio’s ban on gay marriage in the state’s constitution is one step closer to getting on the 2026 ballot. 
Ohio Equal Rights, a grassroots movement, submitted 2,000 signatures to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose on June 30 and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost certified the title and summary language on July 3. They needed to submit 1,000 valid signatures from registered Ohio voters.

“This certification should not be construed as an affirmation of the enforceability, constitutionality, or wisdom of the proposed amendment,” Yost said in a response letter to the petitioners. “Those matters are left for a different forum and another day.”
The Ohio Equal Rights Amendment would protect citizens from discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression regardless of sex assigned at birth, pregnancy status, genetic information, disease status, age, disability, recovery status, familial status, ancestry, national origin, or military and veteran status, according to their website.  
“This is about securing the fundamental right of every Ohioan to be treated with dignity, fairness, and equality under the law,” said Liz Schmidt, a lead organizer for Ohio Equal Rights. “Our state constitution should reflect the values of inclusion and justice that Ohioans hold dear. This amendment ensures no one can be singled out or left behind because of who they are.”
Organizers say the proposed amendment would be the most comprehensive equal rights amendment in the country. 
Ohio’s constitution includes a ban on same-sex marriage after 61.7% of Ohio voters approved an amendment in 2004 that says marriage is only between one man and one woman. The United States Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in 2015. 
The Ohio Ballot Board must now determine if the proposal contains only one constitutional amendment. If the board certifies the proposal, organizers can start collecting signatures. They would need to collect 413,487 signatures from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties — 10% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures would then need to be verified by the Ohio Secretary of State’s Office. 
A 2023 Public Religion Research Institute study showed 76% of Ohioans are in favor of non-discrimination LGBTQ+ laws.

The Ohio Senate put using the state’s unclaimed funds to help pay for the Browns stadium in their version of the budget, which was introduced on June 3.

“The Division (of Unclaimed Funds) saw an approximately 80% increase in claims initiated the week of June 3 compared to the previous week,” said Franklin Freytag, spokesperson for the Ohio Department of Commerce. 
About 133,250 claims were initiated from June 3-26, he said. To put this in perspective, there were 14,111 claims initiated the week of May 25-June 2, Freytag said. 
Ohio’s unclaimed funds is money that is property of Ohioans held by the state for things like forgotten bank accounts, rent or utility deposits, or uncashed insurance policies. An initiated claim is when someone submits a form to claim their funds. Additional documents are needed to prove ownership of the funds. 
The Division of Unclaimed Funds received approximately $528 million in unclaimed funds in fiscal year 2024 and 26,420 claims were approved for payment totaling approximately $149 million, Freytag said.
Ohio’s unclaimed funds is worth close to $5 billion, according to the Ohio Department of Commerce. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine recently signed the state’s two-year operating budget, which included giving the green light to spend $600 million of unclaimed funds on the Browns’ new domed stadium in Brook Park. The budget allows the state to take existing unclaimed funds that are at least 10 years old as of Jan. 1, 2026. 
“My criteria is it had to be holistic and universal, but it also would not spend money out of the general fund that directly competes with education (or) directly competes with mental health,” DeWine said. “Stadiums should not compete with mental health. Stadiums should not compete with education. And this budget, while it didn’t do it the way I originally designed it, does that. And those two things were my first priority.” 
DeWine and the Ohio House had different ideas for how to pay for the Browns stadium, but lawmakers ultimately went with the Senate’s plan during conference committee. 
“That was not my first choice,” DeWine said. “I had another way of doing it. But, you know, governors don’t get everything they want. Nobody gets everything they want.” 
DeWine had proposed doubling sports betting taxes while the Ohio House wanted to borrow $600 million by issuing bonds and repaying the debt, with interest, over 25 years, at a cost of about $1 billion. 
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost urged DeWine to veto the use of unclaimed funds for the Browns stadium.
“Billionaires should finance their own stadiums—full stop,” Yost wrote in his June 27 letter. “The $600 million handout for a single professional sports facility raises serious concerns about fiscal sustainability and fairness. … Most Ohioans will never set foot in the proposed Brook Park stadium or similar venues—whether due to lack of interest, team affiliation, or the unaffordable cost of attending professional sporting events.”
Two former Democratic lawmakers — former state Rep. Jeff Crossman and former Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann — said they are going through with a class action lawsuit against the stadium funding plan.

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Allow me a prediction: At some point, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility planned by CoreCivic in Leavenworth will imprison a man or woman on baseless charges. That person will be a legal resident of the United States, or perhaps even a full citizen.
It won’t matter. Because of inept federal law enforcement, because of racist executive orders, because of some awful event that we don’t yet know, this man or woman will be behind bars.
And all of us — because of the taxes we pay the federal government — will pay for it.


This might seem like an outrageous claim, depending on what news sources you follow. But it’s based on the unfortunate reality that our country’s government has already been doing this regularly since President Donald Trump’s return to office in January. You may support the president’s hardline views on immigration and the southern border. You may believe that everyone who has entered the country the “wrong way” should be deported. But his administration’s approach shows that no legal resident or U.S. citizen can be confident or comfortable either.
Some explanations might be in order. Many who oppose illegal immigration into the United States believe that there are two categories of people: legal and illegal.
That’s not true.
There are actually a wide array of immigration statuses. That can includes people who are in the United States as legal permanent residents — green card holders — and those who are here under various types of visa claims of asylum. I count at least 11 broad categories, with some in varied stages of legal flux.
In past months, we have seen the Trump administration repeatedly incarcerate and attempt to deport people who have a legal status. Their actions aren’t mistakes either: the administration has claimed it has the right to expel these residents, as surely as it has the right to expel those without a shred of legal protection.
I can list some of these people, if you like.

Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder and student activist at Columbia University.
Rümeysa Öztürk, a Tufts University student who wrote an op-ed critical of college administration.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland father whose “withholding of removal” legal status was ignored.
Cynthia Olivera, a Canadian citizen with a U.S. work permit who was pursuing a green card.
Mahmoud Khalil, also a green card holder, also a Columbia student.

You get the picture.
You don’t have to agree with what any of these people said or did or believed. You don’t have to believe that they’re good people or bad people or middling people (the government has gone out of its way to persecute Abrego Garcia, for instance). What we do know is that they were all, to various degrees, lawful residents of the United States. That offered no protection when the masked agents arrived.
Likewise, citizenship offers no protection. The Trump administration has offered an interpretation of the Constitution at odds with the 14th Amendment to deny birthright citizenship. It has also deported U.S. citizen children with their noncitizen parents. From 2015 to 2020, at least 70 potential U.S. citizens were wrongly deported, according to the Government Accountability Office. Just last week, the administration announced that one of the Justice Department’s priorities would be denaturalization — in which citizenship is stripped from people for various infractions.
To summarize: Those here illegally aren’t safe. Those here legally aren’t safe. Citizens aren’t safe.
No one is safe.
Given these facts, it’s worth asking what people who claim to care about illegal immigration really want from the United States. Do they really want to stop people who came here the “wrong way” and welcome people who came here the “right way”?
Or do they instead want to create a racially pure nation in which Caucasian people hoard rights and privileges, while Latino people from Central or South America are accorded second-class status or expelled altogether? I’m sure many would deny any such desire. They might want to have a word with the government.
All of which brings us to Leavenworth. The longtime prison town has tussled with private operator CoreCivic over plans to reopen its facility. A judge once called the prison a “hell hole,” but sordid history fades at the prospect of cold, hard cash. CoreCivic has inked a deal with ICE to the tune of $4.2 million a month.
The reopened facility could house up to 1,000 inmates. Their care and the prison’s overall operations will be funded by you and me. That’s right, our federal tax dollars will go to support ICE and this very contract. Indeed, thanks to the passage of Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill,” huge new financial resources will flood immigration enforcement operations.
Americans and Kansans chose this contemptible path. They voted for the president, and they voted for senators and representatives who made this new funding a reality.
We now have to live with the consequences. Our government is abusing its people, stripping them of residency and citizenship on the flimsiest of pretexts. It will continue doing so. And the money that all of us earn doing our jobs will support those efforts.
In Leavenworth. In Kansas. In these United States.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Last week, Gov. Mike DeWine signed Ohio’s two-year budget into law. Before doing this, he issued 67 vetoes, significantly reshaping the budget that was sent to him by the General Assembly. While he made many changes to the budget, the following three stood out to me as potentially having a significant effect on Ohio’s economy.
Tightening fiscal policy for public schools
Ohio lawmakers have been looking for ways to reduce the impact of property taxes on property owners and renters for a couple of years now. One of their solutions was to impose new rules on school districts that limited the amount of cash they could hold from year to year, mandating property tax decreases to make up for cash not being spent.
The perverse incentives in this policy should be clear to a reader. While it could lead to lower property taxes, it could also lead to school principals making mass purchases of unneeded equipment at the end of the year rather than saving funds for more useful purchases the year after. 
Ensuring public school districts aren’t dealing with arbitrary limits on their reserve funds will allow for fiscal flexibility that will benefit public schools making tough decisions around long-term financial planning.

Reduction of Medicaid coverage for children under age four
Medicaid is another category of state spending that legislators have been eyeing. Medicaid is the top insurer of Ohioans and even though the federal government picks up a large portion of the tab for Medicaid, the state still spends billions of dollars on it per year. One way legislators were planning to reduce state spending on Medicaid was to require families with young children to do more paperwork, increasing the chance they will miss a deadline and lose their health coverage. 
While this is a way to save money, it would also lead to lower health insurance coverage rates and more fiscal instability for families with young children. This also would happen at a crucial moment in child development. This veto has the potential to keep coverage for more households with young children, getting them off to a good start with health and family resources.
Limiting voters’ ability to fund local services
Another strategy state lawmakers have adopted to reduce property taxes is to empower county lawmakers to reduce local property taxes at will, even overturning levies passed by voters. This would allow county leaders to reduce property taxes, lowering rates for property owners and renters, but also reducing resources for local schools and human services. If this provision was left in the budget, it could have led to lowered property tax rates across the state and less resources for local governments that rely on these property taxes.
Ohio’s state budget is a long, labyrinthine document. It also is the main tool policymakers use to set public policy in the state. The decisions in this document have wide-reaching implications that impact the future of our economy, poverty, inequality, education, health, and well-being of Ohio and its residents. Now the ball is in the court of the General Assembly to see how many of these 67 vetoes will stand.

The U.S. Department of Education’s decision this week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts early this week and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico this week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom this week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

Among the many remarkable news reports that emanated from Washington last week as Congress put the finishing touches on President Trump’s massive budget bill, one was truly shocking.
The day before its final passage, Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers that the bill should not touch Medicaid if the GOP hoped to win in the 2026 elections.
But, of course, as one of the members told Trump, quote: “We are touching Medicaid.”
Indeed, the word “touching,” is an all-time understatement. The so-called “big, beautiful bill” doesn’t just touch Medicaid, it utterly wrecks it.
The White House tried to put a fig leaf on the president’s stunningly uniformed comment, saying that the bill would only cut waste fraud and abuse, but as has been repeatedly documented, that’s simply false.
The bottom line: Millions of Americans on Medicaid are about to lose their health insurance as a result of the massive cuts the legislation inflicts and the Republicans who voted for it – including the entire North Carolina GOP delegation save for Sen. Thom Tillis – are going to rue making it happen.

Yes, that’s the word.
Even so, the focus was diffused because Bacon’s decision came amid the process of Congress passing and the president signing the “one, big beautiful bill.” Sure we’re not taxing tips (up to a point), Social Security (well, for a couple years) and the winners tell us peace and prosperity are on the horizon. 
That characterization is a cruel irony, however, because at its core the new law is not beautiful but rather ugly on its face, a design to disfigure wide swathes of America as we know it. 
Real impact
The following are some lowlights from this Big Ugly, all of which Nebraska’s delegation — including the departing Bacon —thought were good ideas:

Take away Medicaid coverage for an estimated 17 million, including an estimated 40,000 Nebraskans.
Reduce SNAP food support for hungry children and disabled vets.
 Create a huge domestic police force and build ominous “camps” eerily reminiscent of horrid human history.
 Give tax breaks to those who need them least while cutting benefits for those who need them most. 
 Balloon the deficit by nearly $4 trillion.
 Eliminate funds for contempt of court orders, effectively restricting the judiciary from enforcing its rulings.
 Jeopardize rural health care facilities with Medicaid cuts. Last Thursday, the day the Big Ugly passed, a Nebraska clinic closed in Curtis, citing the anticipated loss of support.

How does any of that better the lives of Nebraskans — or the rest of the country for that matter? 
Supporters in Congress and the White House press room gaslighted us or simply lied about the effects of the law. 
For example, Medicaid cuts, they argued, were necessary because of “waste, fraud, and abuse,” which, aside from a few harrowing anecdotes, never became specific numbers. Some said Medicaid would not be cut, even when every credible economic forecast, including Congress’ own research at the CBO said otherwise.
The deflection is on brand. The Big Ugly is not only carbuncle unattractive; it is unpopular. Polls showed it underwater, both as a whole and in its individual parts. 
Nor was the bill particularly popular in the House or the Senate, where Vice President J.D. Vance had to cast the deciding 51st vote. Several senators, most notably Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, spoke bravely and boldly against the bill … then voted for it after securing some carveouts for her state. So much for the brave and the bold.

Nevertheless, it passed. Bacon joined Nebraska’s U.S. Reps. Adrian Smith and Mike Flood, plus U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Rickitts as dependable rubber stamps in the face of massive unpopularity. 
In a rural state like Nebraska, the specter of small hospitals closing is just one potential horror story that the hits to Medicaid could produce. Next year, Nebraskans have a chance at the ballot box to express themselves. 
Trump whipped votes
The current iteration of politics that Bacon is choosing to leave was in clear relief as I watched the PBS NewsHour last week. During a segment called “Politics Monday,” Amy Walter, the well-respected political reporter and poll watcher from the Cook Political Report was discussing the conundrum for GOP members in the House and Senate who had misgivings about the Big Ugly. 
She said they faced either the wrath and retribution of the president if they voted against the bill or the wrath and retribution of Elon Musk (yes, him again) who had joined the fray against the Big Ugly. Walters said that politically they were better off pleasing the president for fear of being called out on social media or “primaried,” apparently the modern equivalent of political doom.
Really? This is where we are? What about the wrath and retribution of voters? Are members of Congress not there to solve problems or move America forward or pay attention to constituents’ aggregate concerns but rather to keep their jobs, please their party and serve the president —no matter the price? Today that’s the cost of the nation-changing Big Ugly. 
Some argue congressional term limits would solve that problem. Maybe, but the loss of institutional knowledge and increased influence of PACs and lobbyists would arrive with term limits, creating a different set of  problems. Besides, the issue isn’t structural.
I’m not suggesting Jimmy Stewart’s naive, platitude-spouting Jefferson Smith return to Washington. Or maybe I am. I do wonder, though, what has happened to independent political voices? To statesmen and stateswomen? To profiles in courage?
We’ll see if Nebraskans and Americans want to find some in 2026.

Photos contributed by the candidatesTwo Georgia Democrats are facing off to secure the party’s nomination for the District 3 seat on Georgia’s Public Service Commission. Keisha Sean Waites, a former state representative and Atlanta City Councilwoman, is competing against Peter Hubbard, a clean energy advocate, on the July 15 ballot. 
The runoff election comes after last month’s statewide special primary where no candidate received 50% of the vote, although Waites came close. With 58,022 votes, Waites won over about 46% of voters in the primary, and Hubbard trailed 16,110 votes behind her with about 33% of the vote. Robert Jones, a third challenger, accounted for the remainder of votes. Daniel Blackman also campaigned as a District 3 Democratic candidate but was disqualified last month for failing to meet residency requirements, and any votes cast in his favor were not counted.
District 3 includes Clayton, Fulton and DeKalb counties, but commissioners are elected statewide and must live within the district for 12 months to be eligible. 
Despite being the frontrunner in last month’s primary, Waites is a newcomer to the realm of utility rates and energy demands. But the Georgia native argues her experience at the statehouse and city hall would help her if elected to the commission. Waites left the council in 2024 for an unsuccessful run for the Fulton County Clerk of Superior Court last year. She is also a former candidate for the Fulton County Commission and U.S. Congress. 
“I think when you look at my legislative record, when you look at my history and work of community service, all of those things clearly set me aside from my opponent,” she said.
Hubbard, who has lived in Georgia for the past decade, has dedicated his career to energy policy and politics. He ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia House of Representatives in 2022. 
In 2019, he founded the Georgia Center for Energy Solutions, a nonprofit aiming to fight for clean energy and lower power bills. On behalf of the nonprofit, Hubbard has provided testimony at numerous commission hearings over the years. 
“I’ve presented increasingly detailed, sophisticated analysis, so I don’t have to learn on the job. I’m ready to hit the ground running,” Hubbard said.
Waites acknowledged Hubbard’s experience but questioned his effectiveness.
“I’m trying to figure out if Peter was so effective, then why are we even having the conversation we’re having right now?” Waites said, referring to the uptick in utility bills. 
Rising utility bills and increased energy demands have emerged as top concerns for voters across the state. Democratic candidates have seized on that voter angst and are vowing to work to lower utility bills.
“Like the 10.8 million (other) Georgians, I’ve had one of these colossal skyrocketing bills, and so has my mom, and so has my dad and the people that I love and care about in the community that I live in,” Waites said.
Waites said she is concerned about Georgia Power’s profit margins over the last decade, and she has also proposed a tiered rate system to help combat rising rates that would provide relief to lower income Georgians. She also wants to ensure that the financial burden from data centers does not affect Georgia families. 
Hubbard argued that commissioners cater to large corporations and has cast himself as the candidate who can best recenter the commission’s focus on Georgians.
“There’s a larger commitment to address the injustice and inequity that we’re seeing in how power prices are set,” Hubbard said. “In particular, I think there’s just a true lack of accountability and disregard for the public at the Public Service Commission and I think that that is truly what distinguishes me as the nominee, as someone who is going to go in and fight for Georgians.”
While both candidates support lowering utility bills, they both share concerns about the effectiveness of a recent rate freeze. Since 2023, the average Georgia Power customer is paying $43 more each month. Last week, current commissioners unanimously approved a plan from Georgia Power that will freeze current rates through 2028, though customers’ bills could still rise next year.
With storm clean-up fees and fuel cost adjustments likely awaiting Georgia Power ratepayers in the future, Waites compared the freeze to purchasing an airline ticket and still being stuck with additional baggage and seat charges. 
“The fees, the riders and the fuel cost adjustments are still there and can fluctuate at any time,” Waites said. “So Georgia Power can come back and say, ‘hey’, they can submit a proposal and ask for it to be reviewed. So the rate freeze is really disingenuous.”
Hubbard says the freeze “locks in” six rate increases approved by commissioners over the past three years. He said the promise of at least $2.89 of monthly relief on power bills in previous long-term plans have since been abandoned.
“They’re saying, ‘hey, look, we’re going to freeze rates so there’s no downward pressure,’ which is really a fiction, from the point of view of the Republican policy,” Hubbard said. “They just have never delivered on downward pressure on rates.” 
The future of nuclear energy in Georgia has also dominated campaign messages. 
Worried about the potential health impacts of toxic coal ash ponds, Waites said she does not see a problem with nuclear energy. With confidence that the sun and wind are both constant renewable resources, she would like to see increased conversation surrounding wind and solar energy.
“When you look at the $296 million that we’ve given out of incentives to incentivize data centers to come to Georgia, I think that we can start to put some programs in place to introduce more families to solar,” Waites said.
While Hubbard’s nuclear support corresponds with its carbon-free nature, he said he is acutely aware of the costs associated with the energy source. He says that while Plant Vogtle helped reduce the state’s carbon footprint, this was not a cheap accomplishment. The expansion project was years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget when it was completed last year. 
“Once you have the nuclear plant, it’s cheap to dispatch, it’s cheap to run, but it’s very expensive to build,” Hubbard said. “So that’s the part that concerns me, is if we’re proposing to build any new nuclear (plants) there must be strict cost controls.”
Both candidates hope to advance to November’s general election for a chance to face appointed Republican Commissioner Fitz Johnson. Commissioners typically serve six-year staggered terms, but a long-running legal challenge targeting the system for electing commissioners means that the District 3 winner will serve a one-year term and be back up for election next year.
A lawsuit challenging the at-large voting method for the district-based commission seats is pending with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That case, originally filed in 2020, argues that the statewide elections dilute the voting strength of Black voters. Only one Black commissioner has ever been elected under the system. Johnson, who is Black, was appointed to the seat by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021.
The District 3 race will be on the November ballot with the District 2 race between Republican Commission Tim Echols and Democratic challenger Alicia M. Johnson. District 2 represents a wide swath of southeast Georgia, stretching from Hart County to Savannah. 
There will be one week of early voting that will start Monday, July 7. With only a 2.5% turnout in the June primary, the Democratic runoff is also projected to see low turnout. Some counties will only operate a single early voting location to accommodate an anticipated limited number of voters. Voters can check their registration status and polling place location at the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.
If this year’s Georgia Public Service Commission election stays on track, it will be the first time since 2020 that voters have been able to elect members to the panel.

CT Democrats might want to look in the mirror,Rob Sampson,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/07/no-kings-ct-democrats-might-want-to-look-in-the-mirror/,"While Connecticut may not have kings, it certainly has a ruling class. And someone needs to stand up to them.","As the 2025 legislative session sprinted to its conclusion on June 4, legislative Democrats turned to Republicans for help in moving hundreds of bills before the deadline— part of a final, frantic push to pass legislation before the midnight deadline.
 It’s chaotic, rushed, and often deliberately opaque. But even while we are in the minority, Senate Republicans still hold a powerful tool: time. And when used wisely, time exposes everything the majority would rather you not see.

State Sen. Rob Sampson
This year, we used our toolkit to full effect. We challenged bad bills, demanded answers, and forced real debate. Along the way, we revealed exactly why Connecticut continues to suffer from high costs, intrusive government, and a lack of accountability.
One of the most troubling examples was Senate Bill 1370, a piece of legislation that should alarm every taxpayer. It would dramatically expand the state’s prevailing wage law —requiring not only that union-level wages (often two to three times higher than the competitive market rate) be paid for labor on public job sites, but also for off-site fabrication of any materials used in those projects.
This means that small manufacturers and shops —many of which are family-run and barely staying afloat— would be forced to inflate their bids because of government-imposed wage mandates, even when the work happens nowhere near a construction site. It also means that much of the “off-site” fabrication will now also occur “out-of-state.”
The consequences? Massive cost increases for local governments, which are already required to pay prevailing wage on most infrastructure and construction projects. Towns and cities across Connecticut will face a simple but painful choice: raise local property taxes or cut core services like education. And make no mistake—SB 1370 doesn’t spare anyone. It hurts contractors, taxpayers, and schoolchildren alike.
Not surprisingly, Democrats couldn’t get this bill passed on its own merits. So, they did what has become their go-to move: they buried it in the 700-page state budget at the last minute, avoiding direct debate and public scrutiny.
As Chair of Policy and Screening, I made sure it didn’t go unnoticed. I forced open debate and demanded transparency. And what did Democrats do in response? They doubled down —but not without revealing their own hypocrisy. They exempted the state’s own Department of Transportation from the new mandate, silently acknowledging —without saying so— that the policy would be financially disastrous.
This is the kind of legislative sleight-of-hand that erodes public trust. And sadly, SB 1370 is just one example.
The $56 billion budget passed this year represents a nearly 14% increase in state spending, one of the largest in recent memory. Yet Democrats continue to insist there will be “no new taxes.” That claim is implausible on its face. The money must come from somewhere, and Connecticut families already shoulder one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Bookmark this column. We’ll revisit that promise when the tax hikes arrive.
Worse still, many of the budget’s line items amounted to a political patronage list than a responsible fiscal blueprint. Hidden within the fine print are dozens of earmarks—many vague or inexplicable —allocating taxpayer funds to entities with little public oversight. That’s why I’ve initiated a deeper review of these items. Accountability isn’t optional; it’s essential.
Much has also been made of my role in slowing down the session’s final days. Senate Republicans, under the leadership of Sen. Steve Harding and with me in a key role as Policy and Screening Chairman, used every procedural tactic we had —debate, amendments, and pointed questions —to make sure bad bills didn’t pass in darkness.
In response, House Speaker Matt Ritter claimed that I referred to myself as “the king” during the final days of session—a mischaracterization he invented. That’s not only false, but it’s also a stunning bit of irony.
While Democrats held rallies proclaiming “No Kings” and accusing others of authoritarianism, they were the ones bypassing committee hearings, rushing through last-minute bills, and packing unrelated policy into giant omnibus measures with no real accountability. In reality, no one exercises more unilateral power in this state than the progressive Democrats in charge of our legislature.
Their supermajorities give them the ability to pass virtually anything if they consider it a priority. If a bill didn’t make it to the finish line, it’s because they didn’t fight for it—not because Republicans stopped it. We can bring issues into the light, offer tough amendments, and use time to force the majority to choose what matters most— but at the end of the day, they still get to choose. Blaming me is nothing more than political scapegoating. And frankly, it proves we’re being effective.
Now, even as the regular session ends, Democrats are threatening a special session to force through their extreme housing bill—a proposal that amounts to a statewide takeover of local zoning authority. Even Gov. Ned Lamont seems hesitant to sign it. He should be.
The people of Connecticut are frustrated—and they have every right to be. They’re tired of being told one thing and seeing another. Tired of skyrocketing costs, vague spending, and legislative tricks that put government control above common sense.
That’s why I’m here. That’s why I’ll keep fighting —on the floor, in committee, in special session, and in every column like this one.
Because while Connecticut may not have kings, it certainly has a ruling class. And someone needs to stand up to them.

Just as King George III declared war upon the colonies for what he called “open and avowed rebellion,” and called upon British loyalists to “disclose and make known all treasons and traitorous conspiracies,” the current President of the United States has similarly declared a political war against all those who oppose his power and who refuse to pledge their loyalty, not to the Constitution, but solely to him.  Like King George, he has divided the electorate, calling upon American citizens to turn against each other politically, socially, and economically to consolidate unbridled power.
He signed into law his Big Beautiful Bill, a financial boon to America’s wealthiest but a bill of goods paid by America’s most vulnerable with increased poverty, suffering, and lost lives.
He bragged “Promises made, promises kept,” after signing a bill that cruelly reneged on his promise to protect Medicaid.  His bill will cause at least 17 million Americans to lose their health coverage, according to the Washington Post.
Instead, he has allocated billions of dollars toward immigration enforcement measures that have already proved exorbitant, cruel, unlawful, and arbitrary.  Or, in the words of the Founding Fathers, he has obstructed “the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither.” It’s already clear to American farmers that migrants are vital to American agriculture.
He has reduced America to a veritable police state by empowering Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, the national guard, U.S. marines, local police and even neighbors to aid in the arrest, detention, and deportation of both illegal immigrants and U.S. protesters without due process.  Indeed, Trump’s response to protestors in Los Angeles may as well have prompted this grievance from the Founding Fathers: “He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.”
He has threatened, intimidated, bullied, and attacked politicians, legislators, judges, and corporations that have participated in the prosecution of his crimes, or that have opposed his executive orders, policies, political ambitions, frivolous lawsuits, and blatant lies.
He has attempted to undermine law firms that prosecuted him for his crimes or represented his political adversaries, by restricting their access to government buildings and cancelling government contracts with the firms’ clients.
He has sued media outlets that he considers political adversaries, and he’s stalled government approval for media mergers unless they capitulate to his demands.
He has arrested and transported to jurisdictions amenable to deportation protestors and activists opposed to the President’s policies.  He has deported immigrants to foreign prisons and to lawless places where their lives are endangered.  He has delayed or defied court orders that overruled illegal deportations and detainments.
He has turned a nation, which once proudly stood as a beacon of freedom, opportunity, and compassion, that welcomed the oppressed–“Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,” — into a detention prison aptly called Alligator Alcatraz.
As part of his racist agenda, ICE has racially profiled Latinos for arrest, detention, and deportation without just cause.  His military has closed the border to refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution. Meanwhile, he has welcomed white South African “refugees” claiming they face discrimination and violence at home, despite denials by the South African government.
He signed an executive order, on Martin Luther King Day, ending federal Diversity, Equity, and Equity programs.  He has threatened and financially penalized businesses and schools that support DEI programs designed to redress two centuries of systematic racial exclusion and inequality.
He has opposed the teaching of critical race theory or any classroom discussion that makes white students aware of, or uncomfortable about, past or present racial discrimination in America.
He has withheld government funding to universities that practice and protect free speech, free thought, and free assembly when curriculum, staff, or students oppose the president’s policies.
He has signed an executive order to impose patriotic education upon school children as a means of indoctrinating them to view American history and policies in a strictly jingoistic light.
The Founding Fathers duly noted that “mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.”
Indeed, while Americans celebrate America’s great fight for independence, I fear we no longer recognize the repression that ignited it, understand the freedom gained by it, nor possess the resolve to continue it.

(Photo by Ronaldo Bolaños/The Texas Tribune)Search and rescue efforts continued Sunday morning for 10 missing girls and one counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian camp for young girls at the center of the catastrophic floods that swept the Texas Hill Country, local officials said at a news conference.
At least 68 people were killed by the flooding in Kerr County, Sheriff Larry Leitha said. At least 11 additional deaths were confirmed in surrounding counties, pushing the storm’s overall toll to at least 79. That surpassed the estimated 68 deaths directly caused by Hurricane Harvey in southeast Texas in 2017.
The National Weather Service issued another warning Sunday afternoon for Kerr County, indicating that more flash floods would be possible in the area until 10 p.m.
More than 400 first responders from over 20 agencies were on the ground combing the area Sunday, Leitha said.
Among the dead in Kerr County were 28 children and 30 adults.
“We have increased our number of personnel who are navigating the really challenging shores along the bank line, but we’re continuing to make progress,” said Dalton Rice, city manager of Kerrville.
[In Texas region prone to catastrophic floods, questions grow about lack of warning]
Friends and families posted desperate messages online seeking help locating the missing campers. Many more people could still be unaccounted for, officials warned, noting that visitors to the area for the July 4th weekend make it difficult to assess an exact number of people unaccounted for.
“We will be relentless in going after and assuring that we locate every single person who’s been a victim of this flooding event,” Gov. Greg Abbott said during a news conference held earlier in the day with state and federal officials.
At a press conference Sunday afternoon, Abbott said he visited Camp Mystic the previous day and saw the aftermath of the flood’s devastation.
“It was nothing short of horrific to see what those young children went through,” he said. “We know that parents and families, they want information, they want closure, and we want them to know that we are working as swiftly as possible to get them accurate information that will provide that closure.”
Colonel Freeman Martin, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, said officials expect the death toll to rise between Sunday and Monday.
Abbott expanded the disaster declaration he issued Friday night to include Bexar, Burnet, Caldwell, Guadalupe, Travis and Williamson counties given continued rain and ongoing flooding. And on Sunday, President Donald Trump approved Abbott’s request for a federal disaster declaration, making Kerr County eligible for federal aid. The move opens up grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals recover from the effects of the disaster.
U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on Saturday said that the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Border Patrol had already been involved in rescue efforts while U.S. Customs and Border Protection were assisting with coordination.
In the span of 36 hours, first responders have rescued more than 850 people, some clinging to trees to stay safe amid the rising water, Abbott said.

In response to criticisms of the warning provided by National Weather Service ahead of the flood, Noem said upgrading their technology was among the reforms Trump sought to make at the department.
However, the agency has been dealing with staffing shortages after cuts by the Trump administration led to nearly 600 layoffs and retirements. Whether those cuts had any effect on the National Weather Service’s ability to predict or warn people of the oncoming flood remains an open question. Though, the agency itself said it had adequate staffing.
As floodwaters receded in the Kerrville area, the damage was becoming clear. Dozens of tree trunks were snapped in half, some at 90 degree angles. Black and silver power lines were tangled with branches along the side of the road. A few tree trunks appeared to have been stripped bare of their bark from the rushing water.
At Cross Kingdom Church, Pastor Justin Carpenter started collecting clothing, nonperishable food, toiletries and cat and dog food Friday afternoon. They had reached capacity with donations and were turning other potential helpers away. So far, only about half a dozen people had shown up seeking help. Because the areas most affected has lost cell service, it’s been hard to reach people in need.
“The biggest thing would be to get the word out into the community that we’re here and ready to give everything out,” he said.
Billy Lawrence, a 73-year-old San Angelo man, has dealt with this type of tragedy before. During flooding in the summer of 1987, he spent more than 30 days looking for bodies. The first one he found was of a child in a tree, 20 feet up.
But he said this flood is twice as bad as it was in 1987. On Saturday, he was back patrolling the river for bodies. A former volunteer with the Red Cross, he said he’s gotten used to the morbid practice.
“I’m used to death. I’ve been around it a lot,” Lawrence said.
He noted there are about 20 camps along the river in this area and said the camp counselors should receive training to check the weather every night.
“I’m not blaming them. They just have to do that,” he said.

President Donald Trump expressed his condolences in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.
“Melania and I are praying for all of the families impacted by this horrible tragedy,” Trump wrote. “Our Brave First Responders are on site doing what they do best. GOD BLESS THE FAMILIES, AND GOD BLESS TEXAS!”
About 10 inches of rain fell within a few hours, causing flooding along the Guadalupe River which rose 26 feet in 45 minutes.
The death toll in an area historically prone to major flooding has raised questions about whether people near the river, including many vacationers in town for the Fourth of July weekend, received sufficient warning.
The private forecasting company AccuWeather and the National Weather Service sent warnings about potential flash flooding hours before the devastation.
“These warnings should have provided officials with ample time to evacuate camps such as Camp Mystic and get people to safety,” AccuWeather Chief Meteorologist Jonathan Porter said in a statement that called the Texas Hill Country one of the most flash-flood-prone areas of the U.S. because of its terrain and many water crossings.
Local officials defended their actions Friday while saying they had not expected such an intense downpour that was the equivalent of months’ worth of rain for the area.
One National Weather Service forecast earlier in the week had called for up to six inches of rain, said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. “It did not predict the amount of rain that we saw,” he said.
However, Porter emphasized that people and officials should always take safety precautions when there is a potential for flooding.
“People, businesses, and governments should take action based on Flash Flood Warnings that are issued, regardless of the rainfall amounts that have occurred or are forecast,” Porter said. “Flash Flood Warnings indicate an immediate risk to life and property in the warned area.”
At the Sunday afternoon news conference, Abbott said local officials in Kerrville faced a tough decision about whether to order residents to evacuate after the flash flood warnings.
“It’s a difficult decision about whether or not to begin evacuating people, because if you have a warning telling everybody to evacuate, you could actually lead them to their death,” Abbott said. “But we know that some deaths in Kerrville were people … who got swept away who were trying to evacuate, and so local officials know best about the terrain, the danger spots and things like that.”

In response to pharmacy closures across Delaware stemming from Rite Aid’s Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, state officials are taking swift action to safeguard residents’ access to essential medications.
Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro has issued Bulletin No. 153, outlining steps that health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) must take to reduce disruption and ensure continuity of care.
“Minimizing disruptions in pharmacy services is vital to ensuring the health and safety of Delawareans,” said Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro. “Insurers and PBMs should ensure access to and coverage for emergency prescription refills, streamline the prior authorization and prescription transfer process, ensure fair reimbursement rates for pharmacies absorbing displaced patients, maintain adequate pharmacy networks, and communicate with affected policyholders.”
The closures could potentially leave thousands of patients without convenient access to their medications, prompting calls for both insurers and patients to act quickly.

Navarro urged residents to proactively transfer prescriptions and encouraged healthcare providers to reach out to patients about switching pharmacies.
According to the Department of Insurance, a surge in prescription transfer requests is expected as displaced Rite Aid customers seek alternative pharmacies.
To address this, the Board of Pharmacy has authorized one-time emergency prescription refills, which insurers are now required to cover—even in cases where a prescriber is unavailable due to the closures.
Prescription records or pharmacy databases may be used for verification in these cases.
Insurers are also required to streamline the prescription transfer process and notify policyholders about closures, offering clear instructions and dedicated support—such as hotlines or web portals—to help facilitate the transition.
The bulletin also mandates automatic transfer of prior authorizations for medications tied to closed Rite Aid locations.
That includes expedited handling for specialty drugs and controlled substances, ensuring patients don’t face delays or added administrative burdens.
PBMs are directed to provide fair reimbursement rates to pharmacies taking in displaced patients and to avoid policies that steer patients toward specific providers or mail-order options—practices that are prohibited under Delaware’s Pharmacy Access Act.
Officials stressed the need to preserve access, especially in rural and underserved communities.
The emergency measures authorized by the Board of Pharmacy will remain in effect for 120 days unless extended or modified.
The Department of Insurance said it will monitor compliance closely and may issue additional guidance as the situation develops.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-06-at-3.38.25-PM.png,,,2025-07-06 16:02:04.238496

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education’s decision last week to hold back $6.8 billion in federal K-12 funds next year has triggered alarm among state education officials, school leaders and advocacy groups nationwide over how the lack of funds will affect their after-school, enrichment and language-learning services.
The Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funding has put states in “triage mode” as they scramble to decide what programs may be cut without that funding, said Mary Kusler, senior director for the Center for Advocacy at the National Education Association. The money was approved by Congress to support education for English language learners, migrants, low-income children and adults learning to read, among others.
As of July 1, school systems are unable to draw down funding, jeopardizing summer programs, hiring and early-year planning for the 2025–26 school year.
The funding freeze affects several core programs: Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school), as well as migrant education and adult education and literacy grants. Trump has proposed eliminating all those programs in his proposed budget for next fiscal year, but that proposal hasn’t gone through Congress.
State superintendents sent out missives to school districts and now are scrambling to make choices.
“This is not about political philosophy, this is about reliability and consistency,” Alabama state Superintendent Eric Mackey said to Politico last week. “None of us were worrying about this.”
The administration says it is reviewing the programs.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the U.S. Department of Education wrote to states in its announcement Monday.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

Historically, the department releases allocations by July 1 to ensure schools can budget and plan effectively for the coming school year. Withholding the money could result in canceled programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential support for English learners, migrant children and other high-need populations, education and state officials told Stateline.
“America’s public school leaders run district budgets that are dependent on a complex partnership between federal, state, and local funding,” said David R. Schuler, executive director of the School Superintendents Association in a statement. “For decades, school districts have relied on timely confirmation of their federal allocations ahead of the July 1 start of the fiscal year — ensuring stability, allowing for responsible planning, and supporting uninterrupted educational services for students.”
The states facing the largest withheld amounts include California ($810.7 million), Texas ($660.9 million), and New York ($411.7 million), according to data from the NEA and the Learning Policy Institute, an education think tank.
For 17 states and territories, the freeze affects over 15% of their total federal K-12 allocations, according to the Learning Policy Institute. For smaller jurisdictions such as the District of Columbia and Vermont, the disruption hits even harder: More than 20% of their federal K-12 budgets remain inaccessible.
Colorado Education Commissioner Susan Córdova urged school districts to begin contingency planning in case funds are not released before the federal fiscal year ends on Sept. 30. California State Superintendent Tony Thurmond hinted at possible legal action, which has become a trend as states fight the second Trump administration’s funding revocations or delays.
“California will continue to pursue all available legal remedies to the Trump Administration’s unlawful withholding of federal funds appropriated by Congress,” Thurmond said in a statement.
The NEA and the NAACP have filed for a preliminary injunction, calling the administration’s delay an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.
Education advocates warn the recent decision by the Trump administration to withhold funding reflects a broader pattern of federal disengagement from public education.
Community nonprofits said the withholding could devastate their programming too. The Boys and Girls Clubs of America could have to close more than 900 centers — bringing the loss of 5,900 jobs and affecting more than 220,000 children, said President and CEO Jim Clark in a statement.
The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
A White House statement shared with States Newsroom last week said “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”
“Kids, educators, and working families are the ones losing,” said Kusler, of the NEA. “We need governors and communities to step up — now.”

(Provided/Gullah Traveling Theater)When George Washington goes to heaven in the Gullah Traveling Theater’s telling of the American Revolution, Saint Peter stops him at the pearly gates.
The country’s first president and commander-in-chief of the Continental Army must first reckon with his ownership of slaves and their lives before he can pass, Saint Peter tells him.
Though that’s obviously a fictional scenario, some historians say Washington did struggle internally with the juxtaposition of securing freedom for a new country while enslaving people. His will, signed six months before his death in 1799, ordered enslaved workers at Mount Vernon freed when his wife, Martha Washington, died, though fewer than half actually were.
In the play, the Virginia planter does make it into heaven.
Through Washington and other famous Revolutionary figures looking back at their lives, the nonprofit theater company tells the often-overlooked story of enslaved people in South Carolina during the Revolution, said director Anita Singleton Prather.


How to see the show
An excerpt of the show will play at 4 p.m. July 9 at Christ Lutheran Church in Hilton Head Island. Tickets are free.
Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience will play at 2 p.m. July 19 at May River Theater in Bluffton. Advance tickets for adults are $45. Youth ages 7 to 17 are $15. Children age 0 to 6 are free. All tickets include a rice tasting. The show will be part of a mini festival taking pace from noon to 6 p.m. at the theater.


“They say behind every great man is a great woman, but I knew behind every great Revolutionary hero was probably some Black folks,” Prather said.
SC250, which is tasked with celebrating the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding, asked the Beaufort theater troupe’s director last year if she would be interested in putting on a show about the Gullah Geechee experience during the Revolutionary War.
Prather jumped at the chance to tell the story, she said.
“A lot of our history has not been included in your normal textbooks or archives,” Prather said.
Research was Prather’s first step.
She, like many people, knew much of the history that has been compiled of enslaved people during the Civil War, but the Revolution remained a dark spot in that history. That wasn’t for lack of trying. Not nearly as much has been written about slaves during that era, she said.
Prather knew that many people were enslaved in Barbados and brought to Charleston, so she visited the country in the Caribbean Sea in January. There, she got a better sense of the slave trade during that time.
She read accounts of the people enslaved to well-known figures during the war in South Carolina, including “Swamp Fox” Francis Marion and “Fighting Gamecock” Thomas Sumter.
Because the play is fictional, Prather used historical accounts as the bones of the stories and filled in the gaps with her own writing, she said.
The play, called Da’Gullah American Revolution Experience, heavily features music, which was another challenge.
Scott Gibbs, the company’s music and art director, wanted to include traditional Gullah Geechee songs from the era, knowing some from the Civil War had survived the years, but he couldn’t find much. So, he rearranged other spirituals to fit the scenes, he said.
“I’ve learned that sometimes [music] lightens the telling of the story,” Gibbs said. “You still have to tell the story. You still have to tell the truth, but it’s how you tell the story and how you tell the truth.”
While the story grapples with an ugly part of history, the point is not to take away from the major contributions and sacrifices the heroes of the Revolutionary War made in founding the country.
Principles of the Declaration of Independence they signed, such as liberty, freedom and the pursuit of happiness, were generally good, Prather said.
The Founding Fathers should have recognized that those principles should have applied to all people in the country, including those who were enslaved, she said. To do that, the play humanizes the people denied the right to freedom for which the heroes of the Revolution fought, she said.
At a time when references to slavery at places such as national parks are being removed, Prather wanted audiences to grapple with the difficult parts of the past, she said.
“If you leave out the Gullah Geechee, then South Carolina history is not complete,” Prather said. “If you leave out South Carolina history, American history is not complete. Without American history, world history is not complete.”
“We have to tell the stories, and history is not good or bad,” Prather continued. “It’s just what happened.”
Those contradictions were what made Prather decide to frame the story through characters looking back on their lives at heaven’s gates as opposed to using a more traditional linear narrative, she said.
A person like Washington, seen as a symbol of freedom during the Revolution, can face the people he enslaved as he never would have in life, she said.
In this version of the afterlife, enslaved people confront the people who owned them. During one act of the play, the characters read fictionalized letters to their masters, saying everything Prather imagined they might have said if given the chance.
For instance, Oscar Marion — who was enslaved by the general who’s the namesake of a South Carolina city, county, and public university — is able to ask Francis Marion how he could enslave him despite them reportedly being friends as children and fighting side by side during the war.
“‘You don’t think I deserve the same freedom I fought for you to have?’” Prather said Oscar Marion asks. “‘You don’t think I deserve the same thing?’”
The play, which showed an abridged preview in May, is only able to tell the story of a handful of enslaved people. Prather wants people to take away a broader curiosity of their role in the war.
“There are so many untold stories that need to be told,” Prather said. “We won’t get to tell them all, but hopefully we’ll give people enough of a taste that they will go and do some of their own research.”

Swaths of western South Dakota are considered legal deserts, where barriers such as poverty, lack of transportation and internet access, combined with a lack of attorneys, make it difficult for people to access legal help.
The new effort helps immediately address the problem while work continues on longer-term solutions, such as the state rural lawyer recruitment and retention program.

Dakota Plains Legal Services used a $125,000 state grant to launch its Justice Bus program. The bus is used to connect South Dakotans with legal aid for civil cases, such as custody, abuse and neglect, or protection orders.
The money came from the Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts, which awards grants funded by a $25 filing fee applied to some court documents.
An inability to access civil legal aid has consequences for South Dakotans, said Jana Gray, director of development and special projects for Dakota Plains.

“They might not be able to gain custody of their children, get a protection order or they might just give up,” Gray said.
The bus has stopped in Pierre, Winner, Gregory and other rural towns in western South Dakota. Gray said the organization plans to attend tribal powwows, known as wacipis in Dakota, Lakota and Nakota, and other community events this summer.
So far, the nonprofit has collected five applications for legal aid at community stops this year. That’s promising, Gray said.
People can fill out applications and receive legal aid on the spot, inside the outfitted vehicle. Gray hopes to regularly schedule visits to communities in the future and provide clinics on specific, prevalent legal issues in a community.
The Justice Bus will be at Eagle Butte’s Hometown Days on July 17, according to the Dakota Plains Legal Services calendar.

One less-known, missing part of many of these communities is legal representation, Peters said, which leaves people without recourse to handle problems of that nature or even the knowledge of when a lawyer is needed.
Peters, joined by two ISU students and future lawyers, conducted a study into lawyer shortages across the U.S. to identify where there is most need and go over practiced and possible solutions to ensure even those living in remote areas have access to the legal help they need.
“Not having enough lawyers puts rural people at a disadvantage because the legal system only really works if you have a lawyer that can either assert your rights or (provide) a mechanism to seek redress,” Peters said.

Emma Bartling graduated from ISU in the spring with a degree in agricultural and rural policy studies, and has enrolled in the University of South Dakota for law school with hopes of returning her home turf in Hardin County to practice. Emily Meyer still has one year of school left before graduation, but Bartling said both of them hope to return to rural areas to practice when they’re ready.

With this in mind, Bartling said she and Meyer got involved in the study to further their understanding of what they were getting into and why others weren’t following their path.
“To us, it was just an opportunity to better our learning and to kind of open a door that we would be going into, but just a little bit sooner,” Bartling said.
Peters was researching population decline in small towns when he came across the lack of private-practice attorneys, even in county seats where many residents go for their health care needs and other services they can’t find in their area.
Rather than just looking at the total population of counties and comparing it to the number of lawyers practicing there, Peters said they used 2022 Census data to find out how many private-practice attorneys are located in each county and held it up to estimated demand for their services. These numbers helped determine if a legal desert exists in a given county and how severe it is.
Looking at more than 2,300 counties across the U.S., the study found that 11% of rural counties are critical legal deserts, with the largest gap between lawyer supply and demand for their services.
One example Peters gave was of Lee County — Iowa’s only county listed as a critical legal desert — where he said around 30 lawyers are practicing. Based on the county’s town populations, employers and other factors, the researchers found the county should have closer to 55 lawyers. Lee County is a “micropolitan county,” Peters said, as it has at least one town of between 10,000 and 50,000 people.
The majority of Iowa counties in the study were classified as having average levels of lawyers or higher, according to the study, with 10 counties identified as having emerging legal deserts. Most of these cases are in southern Iowa, Peters said, where farmland is less expensive and areas are more impoverished.

Bartling said that many counties with legal deserts are clustered together, so those looking for a lawyer might need to travel even farther. This could be especially scary and difficult to deal with for those experiencing domestic violence and the like.
“If those micropolitans, even, don’t have enough lawyers, then that just puts rural counties adjacent to that micropolitan (at an) even bigger disadvantage,” Peters said.
It surprised Peters to learn this, he said, and another shock came when the team learned pay for lawyers in rural areas was fairly similar no matter whether they were practicing in a legal desert or not, and the real pay gap is between urban and rural practices. This shows that using financial incentives to move lawyers into rural markets wouldn’t be very effective, he said.
Bartling and Meyer also looked into existing policy to try and solve this problem and identified their own solution.
Finding solutions to fill the gap
Legal work is not the first thing people think of when they think of industry workforce shortages, Peters said, and in reality it is quite different from what is being experienced in the fields of health care and manufacturing, among others. There are surpluses of lawyers in some urban areas, and there is no federal push to address the issue.
South Dakota has seen success from a rural attorney recruitment program, Bartling said, which lets law students practice in rural counties before they have completed their schooling. The program has seen success, she said, but it won’t fit in every situation, just like other initiatives the team reviewed, like mobile legal clinics and external fellowship programs.
One program they identified as viable is a licensed legal paraprofessional program, Bartling said, where the state would allow those with legal training but not a full degree to practice independently in certain areas, like family law.
It would allow people from rural communities who have some legal training but another profession to fill a need without having to leave for years to get the highest licensure, and still be able to complete their other work when legal help isn’t needed, Peters said.
“I think it’s definitely up to states discretion how they want to implement it, but we saw that that would probably have the most impact, direct impact to the rural community members,” Bartling said.

DemasA barge that has twice sunk into Lake Michigan, has been successfully relocated, the Michigan Department of Attorney General announced Thursday, laying to rest years of environmental concerns and legal proceedings. 
The barge’s owner, Donald Lewis Balcom, 90, of Traverse City, pled guilty last April in the 13th Circuit Court in Leelanau County to one count of Water Resources Protection Violation for Discharge of Injurious Substances to Waters of the State, a two-year felony. The charge stemmed from an incident in November 2020, when the barge sank and released oil into Lake Michigan. 
Under a deferred sentencing agreement, Balcom was given until June 27, 2025 to relocate the barge to a legal location, converting his felony conviction into a one count of Watercraft Pollution – Littering from Vessel, a misdemeanor punishable by up to 92 days in jail. 
According to a press release from Attorney General Dana Nessel. On June 23, the barge was moved to a legal location in West Grand Traverse Bay and has been partially dismantled over the past week. It no longer resides on the state-owned bottomlands of Lake Michigan. 
“After years of environmental concerns and legal proceedings, I am pleased the barge has finally been moved and to announce the resolution of this case,” Nessel said in a statement. “We have made it abundantly clear that the bay cannot be treated as a personal junkyard. My department remains committed to working with the Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy to protect the Great Lakes whenever they come under threat.”
While Balcom is entitled to a reduced sentence, the Court has yet to amend its ruling, according to the department.
