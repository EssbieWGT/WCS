(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Health administered no immunizations at seven of the 11 special measles vaccine clinics it publicly announced recently, and a total of 14 vaccinations were administered at the other four clinics.
The department announced the locations, dates and times of the special clinics in a news release on June 18, and announced an amended schedule in another news release on June 20.
Of the 11 cities where clinics were scheduled, nine clinics were single days and two were multiple days.
The news releases did not say whether the vaccinations were free. The department has since told South Dakota Searchlight via email, “Vaccines are provided at no cost when insurance isn’t an option, with eligibility assessed to ensure everyone can get vaccinated without barriers.”
When the department announced the schedule for the special clinics, the state had detected four measles cases since the beginning of the year. That number has since risen to 12, including one hospitalization. Ten of the cases are unvaccinated people. The vaccination status of the other two is unknown.
Prior to last year, the state hadn’t experienced a confirmed measles case since 2015. Measles vaccination rates among South Dakota schoolchildren have fallen since then from 96% to 90%.
Similar trends in some other states have contributed to the worst measles year in the United States since 1990. This year’s nationwide numbers now stand at 1,333 cases and three deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
It took South Dakota Searchlight three weeks to obtain the results of the special vaccination clinics from the state Department of Health. The department, which declined multiple requests for an interview and communicated only by email, initially refused to provide the numbers. 
“In certain locations, the number of clients served is small enough that confidentiality laws prevent us from releasing those specific vaccine counts,” the department wrote.
The department did not respond to Searchlight’s request for a specific law citation supporting its position.

After Searchlight submitted another request for the information, this time through a state records request portal instead of by email, the department responded with data.
“We’ve discussed this request in detail internally and with our legal counsel,” the department wrote. “We believe we can share these numbers as long as they are provided simply as counts of people vaccinated, with no additional patient information.”
Searchlight had never asked for additional patient information.
The data provided by the department included additional cities and days beyond those announced in the June news releases. Searchlight had to perform its own analysis of the data to determine the results of only the announced clinics.
The department sent a written response when asked to explain the inclusion of the extra data, and pointed to a webpage containing information on measles vaccination clinics.
“First, some clinics took place before the release was distributed,” the department wrote. “Second, clinic schedules and locations continued to shift after the release was issued. While our team worked diligently to keep the website as current as possible, the details were changing daily.”
The department also said it offers immunizations daily at its public health nursing offices around the state. There have been 6,092 measles vaccinations so far this year in South Dakota, the department said, compared to 4,868 at the same time last year.

Northfield, Vermont
Died July 30, 2025
Boise, Idaho
Details of services
There will be a memorial service at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery in Boise at a later date.


Kathryn Louise Maloney Youngerman was born in Northfield, Vermont on January 26, 1929 to Floyd A. and Freda E. (Wheeler/Riley) Maloney. She died on July 30, 2025.
Kay grew up in a loving family on a farm in Berlin, VT with her older brother, Bill, and her three younger siblings Bob, Betty, and John as well as many foster children who came and lived with the family. She attended a one room school house just up Cox Brook Road and was the first person in her family to graduate from high school (Northfield High School, class of 1947). Kay attended and, in 1950, graduated from the Mary Fletcher School of Nursing as a Registered Nurse. Her first nursing job was at the Green Mountain Clinic in Northfield where she met a handsome Norwich University cadet who delivered laundry. They fell in love and she and Stephenson Searles Youngerman Jr. were married on June 9, 1951, a union that lasted 69 years.
Steve graduated from Norwich the day after their wedding. He and Kay moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina as Steve was in the U.S. Army and stationed at Fort Bragg. While living in North Carolina, Kay was a hospital nurse as well as a new mother to Stephanie and Sydney. When Steve was discharged, they moved to Connecticut, Northfield and Cabot, VT, Alturas, CA and eventually, in 1957, to Hyde Park, VT where they lived for six years. While in Hyde Park, Steve III was born and Kay worked at Copley Hospital in Morrisville, VT. In the summers, she vaccinated children against polio all over the State of Vermont as a mobile vaccination clinic nurse. 
In 1963 the family moved to Strafford, VT. Kay worked as a private duty nurse and for two summers as the nurse at Camp Wihakowi in Northfield. In 1967, the family moved to Michigan. Kay was a public health nurse in Flint and a hospital nurse for the Veterans Administration in Ann Arbor. In 1969 the family moved to Boise, ID and Kay began a 28 year career with the State of Idaho Health and Welfare Department. She found her true calling as a public health nurse and especially enjoyed the time she spent working with new mothers and their babies. Wherever Steve got a new job, Kay transferred to that location and worked for offices in Boise, St. Marie’s, Twin Falls, and Nampa, ID before their final move back to Boise in 1989. She retired in 1997 as a nursing home examiner. 
Above all, Kay was devoted to her family and loved her children unconditionally. She and Steve enjoyed having large, family dinners in their home at every holiday. No matter where they lived, they created a welcoming, safe, warm, and sustaining place and made lifelong friends. Kay and Steve hosted their niece, Lucinda Powers (Walker) when she was a page in the Idaho Senate, two Rotary foreign exchange students from Australia, as well as any number of friends their children brought home, many of whom stayed for a few months to a year. 
Kay loved coffee, chocolate, and apricot pie. She was a great cook and she gave her children free rein in the kitchen so that they could learn to cook too. When living in Flint, MI she signed the girls and herself up for a cake decorating class and really got into it, buying all of the supplies to create beautiful cakes. She always had a batch of chocolate chip, snickerdoodle or ginger cookies in the cookie jar and her brownies were famous. She was a 4-H volunteer and taught her daughters as well as the neighborhood girls how to sew.
Kay laughed easily, had a great sense of humor, and was fun to be with. She loved to play board games, but Scrabble was her favorite. She couldn’t resist a crossword puzzle or an Avon catalog. She grew dahlias, iris, and Christmas cactus that were the envy of every neighborhood she lived in. During her retirement, Kay was active in PEO hosting many luncheons, working at and donating her homemade jams and jellies to the PEO Christmas bazaar and enjoying the camaraderie of her PEO sisters. 
Snow skiing was her favorite outdoor sport. For as long as they lived in the Treasure Valley, Steve and Kay had season passes at Bogus Basin and purchased them for their children and grandchildren. In her retirement years, Kay honed her skiing skills, participating in many Prime Timer slalom events and coming home with more than one medal. She and Steve spent many years basking in the sun in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico in January and June, canoeing at Wade Lake, MT in August, and attending high school, college and family reunions in Vermont in October.
Kay is survived by her daughters Stephanie (Robert Jahn) and Sydney (Steven Cole), her son Steve (Julie Herndon), her grandchildren Riley (Sara Spencer), Kyle, Gretchen, and Stevie Youngerman, Morgan (Shawn) Keating, and Hadley (Josh) Goff, her great grandchildren Kennedy, Cason, Paige, Boden, and Jordi, her sister, Elizabeth Maloney Powers, and numerous nieces, nephews, and second cousins. She was preceded in death by her husband, Stephenson, her half sister, Ruth Riley, her three brothers, William, Robert, and John Maloney and great granddaughter, Dani. A huge thank you goes out to the staff at CornerStone Senior Living: Memory Care who took great care of “Nurse Kay” for the past seven and a half years and to Keystone Hospice who provided additional care for nearly five years. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Cottey College: P.E.O. Foundation, Giving Opportunities – Cottey College or the Idaho Foodbank: Donate – The Idaho Foodbank. There will be a memorial service at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery at a later date.

Kaohly Her announced on Monday she’s running for mayor of St. Paul.
Her previously worked as policy director for St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, whom she’ll challenge on Nov. 4, during his first term and has served in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 2018.
“We need a mayor who is ready to step up, engage with the community, and provide focused leadership that will move our city forward,” Her said in a press release announcing her candidacy. “My story is the story of the American Dream – but for many, that dream is no longer attainable.”
With so little time before the election, Her will have to move quickly to raise money and assemble a campaign to challenge a two-term incumbent.
Her recently drew nationwide attention during the Minnesota Legislature’s June special session when she said she was “illegal” on the House floor.
“I am illegal in this country. My parents are illegal here in this country,” Her said.
In an interview with the Reformer, Her later said she was trying to inspire empathy in her Republican colleagues who were about to vote to take away state-funded health insurance for undocumented adults in Minnesota. She said that she and her parents are U.S. citizens who came to the U.S. as refugees from Laos.
In 2024, Her was chief author of a bill to pass the Minnesota Equal Rights Amendment, a proposed constitutional amendment that would protect Minnesotans from discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, ancestry, disability and sex. The DFL-controlled Legislature failed to pass the bill.
In the press release, Her criticized President Donald Trump’s immigration and tariff policies and said that St. Paul residents “need leadership that meets this challenging time.”

Having a loved one in prison or jail is estimated to cost families across the United States nearly $350 billion each year, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)U.S. families lose nearly $350 billion each year due to the incarceration of a loved one in jail or prison, according to a recent report from the criminal justice advocacy group FWD.us. The estimate includes both direct expenses and long-term losses in household income.
The findings are based on a national survey of just over 1,600 adults conducted in partnership with researchers at Duke University and the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago.
Families reported losing an average of $1,803 in income per month when a loved one is incarcerated. That includes the loss of the incarcerated person’s wages and may also reflect reduced work hours by family members to manage court proceedings or provide child care, according to the report.
The researchers also found that families spend an average of $4,200 annually per incarcerated relative.
These expenses include phone and email communication, travel for visits, child care and commissary purchases — such as food, hygiene products and clothing — some of which are marked up as much as 600% above retail prices, according to the report.
New York becomes latest state to offer free phone calls in prisons

The burden is especially acute for Black families, who reported significantly higher expenses, according to the report. Black families reported spending an average of $8,005 per year supporting incarcerated loved ones — 2.5 times more than white families with an average of $3,251.
One in 5 family members reported being forced to move due to a loved one’s incarceration, including 1 in 3 children of incarcerated parents, according to the report. Overall, 9% of family members said they experienced a period of homelessness, a figure that rose to 18% — or roughly 1 in 6 — among those who had an incarcerated parent.
Low wages for incarcerated people, often just cents per hour, only deepen this strain, leaving families to fill in the financial gaps, according to the report. Meanwhile, extended prison lockdowns, staff shortages and overcrowded conditions have further limited access to basic services, including phone calls, visitation, medical care and rehabilitative programming.
Researchers also identified long-term economic consequences after incarceration. Collectively, formerly incarcerated individuals lose an estimated $111 billion in wages each year due to limited job opportunities, according to the report. The report also found long-term financial consequences for children of incarcerated parents, who collectively lose $215 billion in annual earnings — an average of nearly $4,500 per adult child each year.
The survey has some limitations. Many of the cost estimates were self-reported and rounded by participants. Still, previous research has reached similar conclusions. A 2017 report from the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit and nonpartisan research organization, estimated that mass incarceration costs governments and the families of incarcerated people at least $182 billion annually.
In 2023, the most recent year available, state governments spent more than $66 billion on corrections, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Annual Survey of State and Local Government Finances. That total does not include the additional financial support provided by families of incarcerated people.
Preliminary national data from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics shows the U.S. prison population is once again on the rise. At the end of 2023, there were more than 1.25 million people in state and federal prisons, a 2% increase from the previous year. The vast majority were serving sentences longer than one year and were held in state prisons.
The male prison population rose by 2% in 2023, while the number of incarcerated women rose by 4%. Still, both figures remain below their 2013 levels.
Researchers projected that if incarceration rates remain steady, families could face $3.5 trillion in cumulative financial losses over the next decade.

CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas talks with reporter Jennifer Smith about a series of stories parsing the sprawling Trump tax and spending bill. They discuss why it’s so hard to know if Opportunity Zones have been effective, and why affordable housing advocates are mixed on the administration’s approach to low-income renters.
The post The[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Michael Jonas
GUEST: Jennifer Smith







A FEW PROPOSALS aimed at boosting investment in low-income communities came buried in the sprawling Trump tax and spend bill, which on the whole has been scorned by Democrats for its assaults on social services funding like Medicaid and SNAP benefits.  
President Trump signed the almost 900-page bill into law on July 4, after Republican leadership wrestled the bill through the House and Senate on largely party-line votes. 
On The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas and reporter Jennifer Smith discuss a few provisions of the tax package that are not straightforwardly reviled in Massachusetts – expansion of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and making permanent the Opportunity Zones program. Smith recently wrote about the two provisions here and here.  
Both give tax breaks to developers who build projects aimed at low-income areas or populations, with the almost 40-year-old Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program set for its largest expansion in decades after years of bipartisan support. Affordable housing advocates and supply-side building boosters alike cheered the change, which they say could open the door to more than a million more homes aimed at low-income households in the next decade. 
The Opportunity Zones changes are more of a mixed bag, touted as a way to encourage investors to back projects in low-income census tracts by reducing their capital gains tax burden if they stay invested in those projects. Yet the limited data on the 2017 program found the zones that got new investment didn’t look all that different afterwards in measures like job creation or education attainment. Those areas had also already been on a slight upswing in the years before the program took effect.  
“There are two ways to read this,” Smith said. “The charitable read is that the zones are helping smooth the process for developers in areas that are getting better but aren’t still great investments. And the less charitable read is it’s giving these tax break for projects in areas that may have been more likely to attract them anyway while leaving distressed or rural or stagnated areas out.” 
While the two provisions in the sprawling domestic policy bill offer some hope to those on the bottom rungs of the economy, they do so through an approach Trump has long viewed favorably – tax breaks to well-off investors. When it comes to direct government spending to help those struggling to make ends meet, it’s been a very different story.  
Trump has proposed cuts to federal rental assistance programs like Section 8, which are sometimes crucial to low-income tenants being able to cover the rent in the affordable housing developments made possible through tax credits. 
All of that, Matt Noyes, of the Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association, told Smith for her recent story on the housing tax credits, adds up to policies that “are not rowing in the same direction.”  
During the episode, Smith and Jonas discuss Opportunity Zones (3:00), low-income housing (14:45), and the administration’s tax-cut-first philosophy (20:00).

(Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird said her office was going to shed “sunlight” on the University of Iowa’s DEI policies through her office’s investigation following a request from Gov. Kim Reynolds earlier this week.
Bird spoke on the issue at the annual “Bird Barn Bash,” a fundraiser for the attorney general as she looks ahead to running for another term in 2026. Bird, who was first elected in 2022, spoke about her time challenging federal policies during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, but also spoke on a more recent issue – investigating UI for potential noncompliance with state and federal policies banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
Fox News published an “undercover” video Tuesday of a person identified as Andrea Tinoco, the assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development, who said her department was still committed to working on DEI despite directives from university leadership.
After the video was posted, Reynolds issued a statement saying she was “appalled” by the comments made in the video and would be filing a complaint to the Attorney General’s office for further action. On Friday, a second video was posted by Townhall, a conservative outlet, of another UI employee identified as Cory Lockwood, senior associate director of the Iowa Union Memorial, making similar comments about continued work on DEI initiatives.
Both employees featured in the videos have been placed on administrative leave.
At the fundraiser Saturday, Bird said her office has launched an investigation into the situation and “is going to get to the bottom of it” – but asked the crowd for patience.
“Please know – the investigation’s going to take a little bit,” Bird said. “I know all of us want it to be fast — and we will not make it be slow — but I’ll tell you, to do something right, it takes time. And we’re going to do it right, we’re going to do it by the book and by the law.”
She also reiterated her commitment to upholding the ban on DEI at Iowa’s regents universities, saying ”here in Iowa, our taxpayer-funded universities are supposed to be about education, not indoctrination.”
Talk radio host Simon Conway, who spoke in support of Bird at the event, said the UI investigation shows the importance of having Bird in office – and reelecting her for another term. He said former Attorney General Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic incumbent who Bird defeated in 2022, would not have followed up on Reynolds’ request to investigate the university if he was in office.
“If we had Tom Miller, or a Tom Miller, in the attorney general’s chair right now, with what is going on in our state in regards to DEI — I think first of all, there’d be a really good chance that regents universities would be losing federal funding,” Conway said. “They still might, by the way. But I think it’s an absolute given if he was there. And you don’t want to see that, do you?”
Cruz, Schmitt stay in D.C.
U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Eric Schmitt of Missouri were also scheduled to speak at the event, but both were unable to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Saturday, with Senate Republicans aiming to confirm more than 100 of President Donald Trump’s nominees despite a breakdown in negotiations with Senate Democrats.
Bird said she was disappointed the two Republican senators could not be at the event, but that she told them on behalf of attendees, “we want you to do your job like you’re doing, confirming President Trump’s nominees.”
Schmitt will be back in the state later in the month, Aug. 23, for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.
Bird was considered a top choice to become the next Republican nominee for governor in the 2026 election cycle, following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. But in July, Bird announced she would not run for governor, instead running for reelection for her current position.
At the event, Bird said she had spoken with many people in the crowd about her plans in 2026 – and that her decision to run for reelection was because she believed there was still more she had to accomplish in the role.
“We’ve done some good things in the attorney general’s office to help Iowa but we are not done,” Bird said. “The work is not done. And I’m not going to leave that unfinished to run for something else.”

It worked on Matthew Morrison. In mid-July, the 69-year-old former psychiatric nurse supervisor quietly fled the United States.
Morrison had been threatened by an aggressive government before. When he was a teenager, he fought against what he and others in the Irish Republican Army saw as an occupying British government that discriminated against marginalized Catholics in Northern Ireland.
For his efforts then, Morrison said he was beaten by interrogators and wound up in prison, where some of his comrades died in a hunger strike protesting the revocation of their political status. 
 
This article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project – St. Louis, a nonprofit news team covering Missouri’s criminal justice systems. Subscribe to their email list, and follow The Marshall Project on Instagram, Reddit and YouTube.


Upon his release in 1985, he feared for his safety. He came to St. Louis, married his American pen pal and had two children. Eventually, he overstayed his tourist visa, divorced his pen pal and remarried. He’s had the spectre of deportation hanging over him for decades. His family has endured the highs and lows of his battle along the way.
Now, Morrison leans on a cane. He’s had several strokes. He said that the fear and uncertainty that he might be picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was more than he could bear.
“I would bite the dust in an ICE holding cell,” Morrison told The Marshall Project – St. Louis before he left the U.S. “There is nothing to stop them from deporting me to Ecuador, South Sudan or whatever. It’s really gotten insane here. It’s crazy what they are doing now, the Trump administration. You know what I mean?”
Many noncitizens have faced similar unknowns in hiding. Morrison has been in the public eye for a long time. He’s been in and out of the news since the 1990s. He was even the grand marshal of a parade. But the U.S. government denied his petition for an adjustment in immigration status because of crimes he was convicted of during “The Troubles” conflict in Northern Ireland. Morrison had omitted those from his original tourist visa application.
In 2000, the Clinton administration terminated the deportation process against Morrison and five other named “deportees,” as the group of former Irish Republican Army prisoners was called, after the American spouses of the Irish men testified before Congress. The president himself weighed in on the issue.
“While in no way approving or condoning their past criminal acts,” Bill Clinton said then, according to a Washington Post story at the time, “I believe that removing the threat of deportation for these individuals will contribute to the peace process in Northern Ireland.”
The deportees were momentarily relieved. But because they weren’t on a path to citizenship, the six men still had to live with restrictions and regularly check in with the government. 
In May, Noel Gaynor, who had a heart condition, died at home in Olean, New York. Waiting months without annual work authorization approval, his Medicare and Social Security benefits were cut off, according to a video of statements made at his wake. In June, Gabriel Megahey received a letter from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that The Marshall Project – St. Louis reviewed. It began: “It’s time for you to leave the United States.”
Morrison expected a similar letter. Though his work authorization expires in October, he didn’t want to sit around waiting and worrying. 
On July 21, he limped onto a one-way flight from Cleveland to Dublin, Ireland, with his wife, leaving behind a life that he’d built in the St. Louis area, including grown children, grandchildren and many friends. 
“I’ve come full circle,” Morrison said while still in the United States. “I came here as an immigrant and I am leaving as an immigrant, despite everything in between. The whole thing is a crazy, stressful situation.”

There’s a city in Northern Ireland with two names. Protestants call it Londonderry. Catholics, like Morrison, call it Derry. 
Catholics felt discriminated against there. Without better options, Morrison said his childhood home didn’t have an indoor bathroom or hot water. He said the cramped home was raided by British soldiers stationed there to keep the peace between Protestants and Catholics and to ensure Northern Ireland remained part of the United Kingdom.
To resist, he helped build barricades around his neighborhood. On Jan. 30, 1972, 16-year-old Morrison and his father joined thousands of others in the streets of their city. The march for Catholic civil rights became known as Bloody Sunday after British troops fatally shot 14 unarmed people and injured others. 
To fight back, Morrison said he joined the Irish Republican Army. 
“There was no way to be indifferent,” he said.  
Three years later, while in college, he said he was arrested with two others for trying to gun down a Royal Ulster Constabulary officer. Again, there were two ways to look at it. To Morrison, it was an act of war. Others saw it as terrorism. 
Later, he’d claim he was choked and beaten during police interrogations, which left him deaf in one ear. Convicted of attempted murder, he was sent to a prison outside Belfast that became widely known for a hunger strike where 10 people died. 
Released in 1985, Morrison fled to St. Louis, where he soon married Francie Broderick, an American pen pal who’d protested in Northern Ireland. They had a son, Matt, then a daughter, Katie. For years, the family and their supporters rallied to bring awareness to their own troubles with immigration authorities.  
In 1998, CBS featured the Morrison family in a documentary titled “Before Your Eyes: Don’t Take My Daddy.” 
“I always felt that our campaign was an extension of the hunger strike,” said Broderick, now 77. 
They had a major breakthrough in 2000 when then-Attorney General Janet Reno said in a prepared statement that she had been advised by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to drop deportation proceedings against the deportees to “support and promote the process of reconciliation that has begun in Northern Ireland.”

The men could stay, but they still couldn’t apply for a green card, let alone U.S. citizenship, because of their deferred immigration status. 
“People don’t realize how much of a minefield U.S. immigration law is,” Morrison said.
Over the years, delayed work authorizations sidelined him from his job for months at a time, he said. He worked about 20 years as a nurse in Missouri, including stints at a children’s hospital and several state mental health facilities. He said he presented at the St. Louis County Police Academy on topics including mental health and deescalation tactics. 
“It doesn’t matter what I did, Immigration gave me no credit for it,” Morrison said. 
Homeland Security and ICE officials didn’t respond to requests for comment.
In June, before Morrison self-deported, a scheduled check-in with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in St. Louis put him and his family on edge. Their fears were heightened by stories about immigrants being detained at routine appointments, regardless of legal status. At the appointment, authorities took a photo of Morrison and he was free to go. 
“We were terrified that they were just going to take him right there,” said his son, Matt, 37. 
He said the uncertainty weighed on his father more than he’d ever seen. 
“He has to live under that fear of somebody knocking on the door and dragging him out of the house, just like they did in Derry when he was young,” Matt said. “I hate it. I am just worried about him. Until recently, I hadn’t heard him cry about it.”
He has mixed feelings about his father’s departure. 
“He’s got brothers and sisters over there, but we are all here — and his grandkids,” Matt said. “He spends a lot of time with his grandkids.” 
Morrison’s daughter, Katie Bradley, 34, said a recent farewell gathering, held in a backyard, felt like a funeral. She panicked because her U.S. passport had expired.
“Even though he’s still alive, I feel like I am grieving,” she said. “It’s a huge loss for me and my children.”
Morrison’s wife, Sandra Riley Swift, has a house in St. Charles, Missouri, as well as her mother and many grandchildren. After helping Morrison transition into an apartment in the town where he grew up, she said in a social media post that she’s going to straddle both countries for a while. 
“This was not an easy choice, but a necessary one for his health and safety,” she wrote a few days after they left the U.S.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nJF6_KWg.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 10:58:55.447120

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist, has upended the way covid vaccines are approved and for whom they’re recommended, creating uncertainty where coverage was routine.
Agencies within HHS responsible for spelling out who should get vaccinated aren’t necessarily in sync, issuing seemingly contradictory recommendations based on age or risk factors for serious disease.
But the ambiguity may not affect your coverage, at least this year.
“I think in 2025 it’s highly likely that the employer plans will cover” the covid vaccines, said Jeff Levin-Scherz, a primary care doctor who is the population health leader for the management consultancy WTW and an assistant professor at Harvard’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. They’ve already budgeted for it, “and it would be a large administrative effort to try to exclude coverage for those not at increased risk,” he said.
With so much in flux, it’s important to check with your employer or insurer about coverage policies before you roll up your sleeve.
Here’s what we know so far, and what remains unclear.
Q: How have the recommendations changed?
What used to be straightforward is now much murkier. Last year, the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech covid vaccines were recommended for anyone at least 6 months old.
This year, the recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is narrower. Although the vaccines are broadly recommended for adults 19 and older, they are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people or for healthy children 6 months through 17 years old.
Kennedy announced the changes in a video in May, citing safety risks for young people and pregnant people as justification.
But his claims have been widely disputed by experts in vaccines, pediatrics, and women’s health. An analysis by FactCheck.org found that the secretary “misrepresented scientific research to make unfounded claims about vaccine safety for pregnant people and children.”
In addition, recently announced changes to the vaccine approval framework have further chipped away at eligibility.
Moderna announced July 10 that the FDA had fully approved its Spikevax covid vaccine — but approval is restricted to adults 65 and older, and for people from 6 months through 64 years old who are at increased risk of developing a serious case of covid.
Two other covid vaccines expected to be available this fall, Novavax’s Nuvaxovid and Moderna’s mNexspike, are also restricted. They are approved for people 65 or older and those 12 to 64 who have underlying health conditions that put them at higher risk of developing severe covid.
Notably, Pfizer’s Comirnaty covid vaccine is still approved or authorized for people 6 months of age and older without any restrictions based on risk factors for covid — at least for now. But the FDA could change that at any time, experts said.
Increasing restrictions “is definitely the direction they are moving,” said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at KFF who authored a KFF analysis of vaccine insurance coverage rules. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
HHS did not provide an on-the-record comment for this article.
Q: How might these changes alter my insurance coverage for the vaccine?
That’s the big question, and the answer is uncertain. Without insurance coverage, people could owe hundreds of dollars for the shot.
Most private health plans are required by law to cover recommended vaccines, whether for covid, measles, or the flu, without charging their members. But that requirement kicks in after the shots are recommended by a federal panel — the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices — and adopted by the CDC director, according to the KFF analysis. The committee hasn’t yet voted on covid vaccine recommendations for this fall. Its next meeting is expected to occur in August or September.
Still, employers and insurers can opt to cover the vaccines on their own, as many did before the law required them to do so. But they may require people to pay something for it.
In addition, the narrower recommendations from different HHS agencies might result in some health plans declining to pay for certain categories of people to get certain vaccines, experts said.
“I don’t think an employer or insurer would deny coverage,” Kates said. “But they could say: You have to get this product.”
That could mean a 45-year-old with no underlying health conditions raising their covid risk might have to get the Pfizer shot rather than the Moderna version if they want their health plan to pay for it, experts said.
In addition, up to 200 million people may qualify for the vaccines because they have health conditions such as asthma or diabetes that increase their risk of severe disease, according to a commentary published by FDA officials in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Health care professionals can help people determine whether they qualify for the shot based on health conditions.
Tina Stow, a spokesperson for AHIP, which represents health plans, said in a statement that plans will continue to follow federal requirements for vaccine coverage.
Q: What are the options for people who are pregnant or have children they want to have vaccinated?
Many parents are confused about getting their kids vaccinated, according to a KFF poll released on Aug. 1. About half say they don’t know whether federal agencies recommend healthy children get the vaccine this fall. Among the other half, more say the vaccine is not recommended than recommended.
Meanwhile, Kennedy’s recommendation that healthy children not get vaccinated has a notable caveat: If a parent wishes a child to get a covid vaccine and a health care provider recommends it, the child can receive it under the “shared clinical decision-making” model, and it should be covered without cost sharing.
Some policy experts point out that this is the way care for kids is typically provided anyway.
“Outside of any requirements, vaccines have always been provided through shared decision-making,” said Amanda Jezek, senior vice president of public policy and government relations at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
There’s no similar allowance for pregnant people. However, even though Kennedy has stated that covid vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy pregnant people, pregnancy is one of the underlying medical conditions that put people at high risk for getting very sick from covid, according to the CDC. That could make pregnant people eligible for the shot.
Depending on the stage of someone’s pregnancy, it could be difficult to know whether someone should be denied the shot based on their condition. “This is uncharted territory,” said Sabrina Corlette, co-director of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms.
Q: How will these changes affect access to the vaccine? Will I still be able to go to the pharmacy for the shot?
“If far fewer are expected to be vaccinated, fewer sites will offer the vaccinations,” Levin-Scherz said. This could be an especially notable hurdle for people looking for pediatric doses of a covid vaccine, he said.
In addition, pharmacists’ authority to administer vaccines depends on several factors. For example, in some states they can administer shots that have been approved by the FDA, while in others the shots must have been recommended by the ACIP, said Hannah Fish, senior director of strategic initiatives at the National Community Pharmacists Association. Since ACIP hasn’t yet recommended covid shots for the fall, that could create a speed bump in some states.
“Depending on the rules, you still may be able to get the shot at the pharmacy, but they might have to call the physician to send over a prescription,” Fish said.
Q: What do these changes mean long-term?
It’s impossible to know. But given Kennedy’s vocal skepticism of vaccines and his embrace of long-disproven theories about connections between vaccines and autism, among other things, medical and public health professionals are concerned those views will shape future policies.
“The recommendation changes that were made with respect to children and pregnant women were not necessarily made in good science,” Corlette said.
It’s already a challenge to convince people they need annual covid shots, and shifting guidelines may make it tougher, some public health experts warn.
“What’s concerning is that this could even further depress the uptake of the covid vaccines,” Jezek said.

(Photo courtesy of the U.S. Coast Guard)A large cash infusion to the U.S. Coast Guard’s budget and recent comments by President Donald Trump are stoking optimism that the country’s limited icebreaker fleet might soon greatly expand. 
That’s according to shipbuilders, other businesspeople and some diplomats who spoke at the Arctic Encounter Symposium in Anchorage this week. Icebreakers are particularly important to Alaska, especially in the Bering Strait region where a narrow strip of water separates Alaska and Russia, a remote place where foreign vessels are often known to stray.

	The United States has three polar-grade icebreakers capable of navigating the frigid waters of the Arctic Ocean, a waterbody that is rapidly warming due to climate change and seeing  new shipping routes opening in the process. The U.S.’s modest fleet compares to Russia’s hefty arsenal of some 40 icebreakers, including the world’s only nuclear-powered ones. 
As sea ice melts and vessel traffic increases in Alaska’s northern waters and elsewhere in the Arctic, fear of oil spills, vessel collisions and national security threats from foreign adversaries is on the rise. Against this backdrop, the U.S. and two allies, Canada and Finland, are trying to boost the production of icebreakers capable of navigating and protecting the Arctic. Their goal is to build between 70 and 90 icebreakers within the next decade, according to published reports.
The trilateral cooperation effort is spelled out in a guidance document called ICE Pact, which stands for Icebreaker Collaboration Effort. This memorandum of understanding was signed at a NATO summit in Washington last year.

	During a Thursday panel discussion at the Arctic conference, Paul Barrett of the Canadian shipbuilding company Davie noted that the Trump administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” builds off of ICE Pact in that it contains some $8 billion for the Coast Guard to expand its icebreaker fleet. 
Trump has said he wants the U.S. to build or acquire 40 new icebreakers to close the gap with Russia and to counter the growing influence of both Russia, and more recently China, in the Arctic. 
Barrett said his company is committed to helping make that happen. He outlined a $1 billion investment Davie is making to start building icebreakers at shipyards in Galveston and Port Arthur, cities in Texas. 
“This is about really equipping the U.S. shipbuilding sector for the decades ahead,” said Barrett, the company’s chief communications officer. “Our analysis is that we can help the Americans to build these ships that they need and we can create many thousands of jobs, good jobs, in America.” 
The massive spending and tax bill that Trump signed on July 4 contains $4.3 billion for the Coast Guard’s Polar Security Cutter program, to pay for three heavy icebreakers. There’s also $3.5 billion in the bill for three or more medium-grade icebreakers and about $800 million for light icebreakers.
The Coast Guard currently has two polar-grade icebreakers, and is getting a third, the Storis, which is scheduled to be commissioned in Juneau later this month. The Storis is the first polar icebreaker to be acquired by the Coast Guard in more than 25 years. 
During a question-and-answer period at Thursday’s session, Dennis Young, who heads the Alaska Division of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, asked why shipyards in Texas were chosen — as opposed to Alaska — for icebreaker construction. 
Building a generational workforce of shipbuilders in Seward, Ketchikan or another Alaska port town would be a “tremendous asset for our communities,” Young said.
William Henagan, U.S. strategy lead for Davie, said many factors played into the decision but an important one was that Texas has a much larger existing workforce of skilled shipbuilders.
“From my experience down in Galveston, they do a lot of fabrication work, so they’re already building steel for the existing contracts,” Henagan said. 
That said, Davie is “open for business” in Alaska and elsewhere.
“Paul and I are up here looking for opportunities and ways to collaborate with Alaska shipyards,” he said. 
Henagan noted that icebreakers are “50-year assets” that require a lot of ongoing maintenance. So even if the ships are built in Texas, there might be plenty of work for Alaska to capture once the icebreakers start operating in the Arctic.
There’s no doubt that Alaska and the U.S. need more icebreakers for security reasons, said former Alaska Lt. Gov. Mead Treadwell, a panelist. But he said the country needs to focus on the commercial aspects of the Arctic Ocean and step up its role in capturing rapidly emerging global commerce opportunities.

	“Let’s move forward with the concept of a marine seaway in the Arctic and figure out what the U.S. role is in helping convene the players to make that happen,” said Treadwell, a businessperson and former chair of the U.S. Arctic Research Commission.  
There’s talk that the U.S. secretary of transportation may visit Alaska this summer.
“Let’s all talk to him about it,” Treadwell said. “The fact is, we did this with Canada with the Saint Lawrence.”
He was referring to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway System, built as a binational partnership between the U.S. and Canada. Administered by both countries, the seaway allows vessels to travel from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. 
During Friday’s session on ICE Pact, Ambassador David Balton, who served as U.S. deputy assistant secretary for oceans and fisheries during the Biden administration, said while there’s clearly a need for more U.S. icebreakers, he’s skeptical about the effectiveness of the trilateral partnership.
“Relations between the United States and Canada at the moment are not great,” Balton said.
The 35% U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods that went into effect on Friday have a chilling effect and have disrupted one of the largest and most successful trading relationships in the world, he said.
And it’s not just tariffs that are straining bilateral relations.
“Let’s not forget that President Trump has spoken multiple times about how Canada should be part of the United States, and it hasn’t gone down very well with our Canadian friends,” Balton said.
Arctic shipping represents a “paltry fraction” of oceangoing global trade, he noted, and Balton said he’s doubtful that’s going to radically change anytime soon.
Even under the most aggressive climate change models, the Arctic Ocean remains ice-covered for most of the year. 
There’s little existing land-based infrastructure to support large-scale Arctic shipping. Balton said it’s not clear to him that major shipping companies are going to retrofit their fleets to handle Arctic conditions for just a portion of the year, especially in a forbidding ocean that is poorly charted.
“There’s also unknown environmental consequences to large-scale Arctic shipping that we might want to stop and think about before embracing this brave new world that you’re imagining,” Balton said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)GRINNELL — “Everything’s gone.”
Grinnell City Administrator Jewel Maier is visibly shaken weeks later when she repeats the words her best friend said minutes after a tornado struck this western Kansas town.
“She called me, and the first question out of her mouth was ‘Are you OK?’ I immediately start complaining about my patio table that got flipped over and just demolished,” Maier said. “Then she kind of choked up and she said, ‘Everything’s gone.’ ”
It was the moment Maier, who lives on a farm south of town, understood the devastation wreaked on her friends and neighbors in Grinnell.
On May 18, an EF-3 tornado swept into the small town of just over 240 people around 6:30 p.m., leveling a west-side neighborhood with more than 28 houses and outbuildings. The elementary school and a city-owned golf course were damaged, along with a Frontier Ag grain facility. 
  Rubble from the May tornado could still be seen on July 9, 2025, in Grinnell. The town has continued cleaning up and making repairs but it will take months to recover.

The National Weather Service reported 13 tornadoes that day in Kansas, six of them rated EF-3, which means winds 136 to 175 mph.
The destruction runs to millions of dollars. But Maier and Grinnell residents tend to focus on the lack of injuries in the stories they tell.
“There were a couple of people who just got beat up,” said Tristan Bixenman, a restaurant owner in nearby Grainfield whose family all lives in the area. “But nobody got seriously injured.”


 
Kansas resilience
Bixenman had been closely watching the weather and canceled a planned family dinner in town when the sky darkened.
“My parents were not very smart, and they were checking ground and happened to come up behind it,” she said, shooting a look at her mother, Christy Rathgeber, who just smiled.

“I was calling them and warning them to go to the basement, because they were in the path of it,” Rathgeber said.
She said she and her husband didn’t realize the storm’s strength until they turned a corner and saw power poles collapsing on the road in front of them.
“That’s when we stopped and backed up,” she said. “There’s so much debris. My husband barely rolled the window down, and it sucked the hat off his head. We’ll never see that hat again.”
Once she realized the tornado was heading to Grinnell, Rathgeber said she contacted family members in the path.
“We called them, and they had no intentions of going to the basement,” she said. “They didn’t think it was anything. Had we not called, I don’t know as if they would have gone to the basement in their house.
“Their house was demolished, but the china hutch was still sitting, and there were still dishes in it,” Rathgeber added.
Kenny Robben also lost his home. In his 80s, Robben had knee surgery and was sitting in his recliner, Bixenman said.
“Sirens are going off, (Robben was) watching the news. Wasn’t too concerned until the last second,” she said. “He stands up with his walker and then the wind just starts coming through his windows. He sits down and literally rides it out in his recliner.”
Bixenman shook her head. Robben was uninjured.
 
Rallying to rebuild
The list of work to be done is long. The local Catholic church lost its roof. Headstones were damaged at the VFW cemetery. The elementary school won’t reopen in time for the start of school.

Contractors are difficult to find, Maier said, but are filtering in to do the work.
A missionary team from the First Baptist Church in Dighton arrived July 21 and framed and sided a house in five days, said the Rev. Ken Bowden.
“We just asked if there was anybody we could help out specifically, and the city nominated one of the families in town to get their house rebuilt,” he said. 
The church team of 20 included a contractor, who helped teach the others, Bowden said. They put walls up the first day, trusses the second and then finished decking it.
The town found a contractor to work on the elementary school, but all classes there are being moved to the middle school when the session starts Aug. 13, Maier said. 
“We’re such a small school, so they’re just going to move some things around and make everybody fit for the year,” she said. “And God bless our lunch lady. She’s going to make the lunches and then hot box them down the street — they have a hot box on wheels — so they get breakfast and lunch. Prior to this, the middle schoolers would come down to eat lunch at the grade school.
“It’s been amazing to see the backbone of people,” Maier added. “Grinnell has some true grit in us. I’m so proud of our little town.”
On July 23, President Donald Trump approved disaster funding for Grinnell and Gove County, along with other Kansas counties affected by the May 18 and 19 storm. Public assistance funding is a cost-sharing federal program to pay for emergency work and repair and replace facilities damaged by storms, said Ryan Lowry-Lee, FEMA Region 7 spokesman.
The assistance will pay for debris removal and emergency protective measures, as well as permanent restoration of facilities such as roads, culverts, bridges and public buildings, he said.
“It’s been a very steep learning curve of what do you do to keep a town safe,” Maier said. “We have two paved roads in town, and everything else is sand road. We might have to dig up these roads, pull up to four inches off them and re-sand them, for safety reasons. Your kids can’t ride a bike if they’re full of nails.”
Maier, who worked in the insurance industry for 13 years, worried the town wouldn’t qualify for support because it had to show $5.8 million of damage to city-owned property. But state and FEMA staff helped her assess damages, and they made the threshold.
Along with damages to the school and the golf course, Maier said 40 water meter pits were damaged or completely gone, costing $1,000 to $1,500 each to replace.
A separate city insurance policy doesn’t cover roads and major infrastructure, and Maier didn’t expect to make the $10,000 deductible. 
Meanwhile, the Grinnell grain facility owned by Frontier Ag will take about $6 million to rebuild, said CEO Stan Remington. They have insurance of $3.5 million to $4 million, he added.
“We lost approximately 750,000 bushels of storage,” he said. “We’ll be lucky to be in operation a year from now. Contractors aren’t easy to find, and it takes time to build that kind of complex back.”
Remington said his company’s other facilities are too far away to be of use for the upcoming fall harvest. The storm damaged storage bins full of grain and forced the company to store wheat under white tents on the ground, a practice they’ll continue. But that drives costs up.
  Darrell Garner, a grain elevator supervisor at Frontier Ag in Grinnell, said the facility lost its storage bins in a tornado in May. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
“Labor costs go up because it takes about two times the labor to put it on the ground,” he said.
Darrell Garner, a grain elevator supervisor at the facility, said they were shut down for about four days after the storm, but welders have been coming in to remove broken metal and make repairs.
“We’re doing pretty good,” he said.
 
So much help
While some residents are rebuilding their houses, others have chosen to sell their lots instead, Maier said.
“I think it’s going to change us forever,” said Lisa Bixenman, a Grinnell resident and a cousin of Tristan Bixenman. “I don’t think a lot of them are going to build back, maybe we’re up to half. I just don’t think it’s ever going to be the same.”
Dolly Theobald’s family chose not to rebuild, but they didn’t leave town. Instead, a local woman offered to sell them her home, and they moved in last week.
The night of the storm, Theobald had just gotten home when her sister-in-law messaged to ask if they were in the basement. After a second call from her mother, Theobald said she gathered her two children and the pets and went to the basement.
“It was crazy loud, and it was probably done in less than 30 seconds,” Theobald said. “You could hear the windows breaking. You could hear debris hit.”
Their house was a total loss. Theobald said she’s grateful her family photos were in a center room in the basement, where they were safe.
Pieces of family history were scattered throughout the area, hung up in trees, and wrapped around jagged edges of aluminum siding. The town set up three tables at the VFW where people put things they found so they could be returned to owners, Rathgeber said.
Concern from small communities poured in through financial donations, boots on the ground, offers of an apartment complex to house people short term and hotels donating free rooms, Maier said.
Volunteers arrived by the hundreds. The day after the tornado, an estimated 1,500 to 1,800 people arrived to clean up, said Grinnell resident Shari Burks.
“Farmers were all supposed to be planting, and they just parked their tractors for a week,” Lisa Bixenman said. “Or they brought them to town to help. I mean, literally it put everybody behind for a week or a week and a half, because they all just dropped everything to come. It’s incredible.”
The VFW, initially the hub of emergency activity and a storm shelter, transitioned to a community center for meals, organizing volunteers, collecting donations and bringing everyone together.
Volunteer Melissa Shupe said donations quickly came from across the country. A semi-truck of new clothing was delivered. People who had been through the Joplin, Missouri, tornado drove in with supplies. Rathgeber, who owns Broken Handle catering, and Tristan Bixenman, who owns Meraki Market, both served dinners.
Nearby restaurants donated hundreds of pizzas and sandwiches, Pepsi donated 400-plus cases of Gatorade and soda, and other companies donated chips and pallets of water, Tristan Bixenman said.
“It was an overwhelming blessing type of thing,” she said. “It can be really challenging to keep all that organized in the aftermath of a disaster. It just kept coming in.”

Long-term recovery
Trish Gruber, Grinnell’s emergency operations manager, said short-term recovery after the storm is over. That included checking for injuries, removing debris and reporting what had happened to appropriate agencies, including utility companies that moved in to clean up downed power lines, she said. 
Gruber also had to address the tornado siren in town that didn’t go off that night. 
The two sirens were tested about 30 minutes before the storm in a regularly scheduled test that occurs every day at noon and 6 p.m., she said.
“It was just when we tried to set it off manually, it was not catching that signal,” Gruber said.
The working siren was located on the west side of town where the tornado hit, Gruber said, adding that emergency vehicles drove through town with their sirens screaming to warn residents.
Today, the siren is fixed, and the long-term recovery, expected to take two years, is underway.
Gruber said the city has applied for a grant to update its tornado shelter. Maier is looking at other grants to help homeowners and the city rebuild.
Sitting on a bench downtown, she is hopeful for Grinnell’s future. 
“It all came together so fast and really, so smoothly,” Maier said of the recovery. “We had an amazing group of people that really stepped up to the plate. As overwhelming as it was, it was a lot of love.”

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.

Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”

Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, says the National Transportation Safety Board hearings on the January midair crash in Washington, D.C., of a commercial jet out of Wichita and a military helicopter based in Virginia revealed failure to address known safety challenges. The accident killed 67 people, including Kansans. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate YouTube channel)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran castigated the Federal Aviation Administration for failing to respond to warning signs and improve safety of airspace in the Washington, D.C., area before American Airlines flight 5342 and an Army Blackhawk helicopter collided in January.
Moran, a Kansas Republican who chairs the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation, Space and Innovation, said three days of National Transportation Safety Board hearings indicated unresolved staffing issues and a record of near misses were contributing factors in the Jan. 29 accident.
“Despite numerous warning signs of serious problems over the last several years, little was done to try and correct them, and these failures by the FAA, the Army and air traffic control cost 67 lives,” Moran said.
The airliner departed Wichita and fell into the Potomac River after slamming into the helicopter near the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, known as DCA.
“I know the last few days have been painful for the families of the victims, and I assure them that Congress will not let these failures go unanswered. We cannot undo the tragic loss of life, but we can work to make certain it never happens again,” the senator said.
During the hearings, federal investigators said air traffic controllers responsible for the busy airport were pressured to “make it work.” Former DCA tower operations manager Clark Allen said the system was “pushing the line” on safety.
FAA administrators said the national shortage of traffic controllers had to be considered. On the night of the midair collision, one DCA tower controller was handling both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopter traffic. Typically, two controllers divided that workload.
“The NTSB uncovered long-term staffing issues at the control tower that were compounded by a culture of distrust among DCA air traffic controllers and a toleration for unacceptable risks,” Moran said. “It is alarming that FAA failed to act on years of data and near misses indicating serious problems with the design of the mixed airspace around DCA.”
Before the accident, FAA staff said a concern had been raised about Army helicopters taking a route in proximity to commercial jet landings at the airport.
The Army helicopter involved in the collision flew above its ceiling of 200 feet, possibly due to an imprecise altimeter. The impact occurred at 278 feet and killed the three-person helicopter crew as well as 60 passengers, two pilots and two flight attendants on the American Airlines jet.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Moran-on-USAID-3-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-04 09:56:14.122789

A Bay Area lawmaker wants to ban companies from charging prices based on information stored on customers’ phones, laptops or other hardware devices. The bill, which sits before the Assembly after advancing through the Senate in May, is one of the 30 measures the Legislature introduced this year to regulate artificial intelligence technology, writes CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Sen. Aisha Wahab’s proposal would curb AI-powered price discrimination by prohibiting companies from using AI to increase prices based on, say, how much battery life is remaining on a phone, what apps are installed on the device and more.
The Fremont Democrat cites a report by the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog that said that ride-hailing apps charged higher prices to riders whose phone batteries were low. A ProPublica report also found that the test prep company Princeton Review charged higher prices for online SAT tutoring to customers who lived in zip codes where there was a high percentage of Asian residents.

But the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft have denied unfairly manipulating prices. Other business groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce, and some Republican legislators, also oppose the measure.

Other happenings at the state Capitol: Gov. Gavin Newsom revealed more details last week about a potential plan to redraw California’s congressional maps to counteract Texas’ current redistricting efforts. 
At the urging of President Donald Trump’s advisers, Texas Republicans are attempting to redistrict so that the GOP can maintain its control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026’s midterm elections. 
To help shift the balance of power in the House while sidestepping California’s requirement to bring in an independent commission for redistricting, Newsom is considering calling a special election in November to allow voters to approve an alternative map that would implement more Democratic-leaning districts.

Look up CA police misconduct records 🔍


A screen shot of the Police Records Access Project database, which has been made available to the public.




Starting today the public can access a first-of-its-kind database that allows users to search documents and other police-misconduct records from nearly 700 California law enforcement agencies. 
Until now, these were only available by filing specific requests to individual agencies. The database contains about 1.5 million pages of records from 12,000 officer-misconduct and use-of-force cases. It does not include crime scene photographs, audio recordings or videos.

Tiffany Bailey, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California: “Critically, families who have lost loved ones in California will now have direct access to the information they need to seek meaningful accountability that has too often been denied.”

UC Berkeley and Stanford University created this tool over a span of seven years with the help of state funding. The database is being jointly published by CalMatters, the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and KQED.

Trump suspends UCLA research grants

The Trump administration is freezing hundreds of science research grants at UCLA due to the U.S. Department of Justice’s findings that the public university did not do enough to stop antisemitism during last year’s pro-Palestine protests.
As CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn explains, nearly 500 National Institutes of Health grants and 300 National Science Foundation grants were suspended. These grants have received $225 million and $170 million, respectively, from the federal government to date, according to Mikhail’s analysis.
The Justice Department found that “Jewish and Israeli students at UCLA were subjected to severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive harassment” during the encampment protests. Unless UCLA agrees to a voluntary settlement by Aug. 5., Justice Department officials plan to file a complaint against UCLA in a federal court in September.
In a separate lawsuit, UCLA settled last week with several Jewish plaintiffs over claims that anti-Israel sentiment displayed at the encampments last year violated their religious rights. That settlement, totaling more than $6 million, was slammed by a lawyer representing five pro-Palestinian students and professors, two of whom are Jewish and participated in the encampment.

The Police Records Access Project database, now available to the public, contains roughly 1.5 million pages of records from 12,000 officer-misconduct and use-of-force cases in California.


The public can now search internal affairs documents and other police-misconduct records from nearly 700 California law enforcement agencies through a database created by UC Berkeley and Stanford University. 
The Police Records Access Project database, which contains roughly 1.5 million pages of records from 12,000 officer-misconduct and use-of-force cases, is being jointly published today by CalMatters, The Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and KQED. 
The database is the first of its kind in the nation and will allow the public to search for particular types of misconduct or uses of force. It will also allow police departments to better research potential job candidates and can help researchers identify policing trends.
“The creation of a public facing database is critical for all of the stakeholders in the criminal legal system: whether public defenders, innocence organizations, prosecutors, police departments or academics,” said Barry Scheck, co-founder of the Innocence Project and a professor at Yeshiva University‘s Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law. 
Seven years in the making
The database took seven years to produce. It was compiled by journalists, data scientists, lawyers and civil liberties advocates working with the Berkeley Institute for Data Science, UC Berkeley Journalism’s Investigative Reporting Program and Stanford University’s Big Local News. 
The ACLU Foundation of Southern California, California Innocence Coalition, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, UC Irvine law school’s Press Freedom Project and UC Berkeley law school’s Criminal Law & Justice Center also collaborated on the project.
The project began after California legislators approved a series of laws aimed at improving law-enforcement transparency. Senate Bill 1421, approved in 2018, and SB 16, approved in 2021, granted public access to use-of-force and other misconduct records.
However until now, those records were only available by filing a specific request to an individual agency. 
“This living database makes the transparency and accountability aims of SB 1421 a reality,” said Tiffany Bailey, senior staff attorney at the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, which will contribute an additional 200,000 records to the database from its own efforts to obtain public records.
“Critically, families who have lost loved ones in California will now have direct access to the information they need to seek meaningful accountability that has too often been denied.”
The documents in the database were released by law enforcement agencies, district attorneys offices and other organizations and were redacted in compliance with California’s public records laws. The database does not include crime scene photographs, audio recordings or videos.
Police Records Access Project team members further redacted personal information about sexual assault and domestic violence victims. 
The team used emerging technologies such as generative AI to collect, organize and vet the records and build the database.
Money for the project came from the state, with additional funding from the Sony Foundation and Roc Nation.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/080125-Police-Database0804_CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

California lawmakers want to ban companies from using data about consumers’ devices like battery life, model and geolocation to set fluctuating prices. Proponents say such “surveillance pricing” is discriminatory.


It’s late at night, and you badly need a ride. Your cellphone’s battery is dangerously low. 
Should a ridehailing company such as Uber or Lyft be able to charge you more because its artificial intelligence programming thinks you’re desperate since it knows your phone is about to die? 
Not if Hayward Democratic Sen. Aisha Wahab has her way.
Her Senate Bill 259 would prevent retailers from using artificial intelligence to jack up prices using the information stored on customers’ phones. That could include the phone’s battery life, whether it’s an older model, what apps are installed, what time of day it is, where its user is located and where they live.
“Our devices are being weaponized against us in order for large corporations to increase profits, and it has to stop,” Wahab told the Assembly Judiciary Committee last month.
Wahab’s bill to limit surveillance pricing that’s coasting through the Legislature is the latest example of California lawmakers trying to reign in the explosion of AI technology this year. Their 29 other legislative proposals this year include a ban on using algorithmic systems to set rent prices and a measure to protect people from automated discrimination by AI models that make critical decisions about a person’s employment, education, housing, health care, finance, criminal sentencing and access to government services. 
Wahab’s measure has been an easier sell than some of the other AI proposals that have already failed thanks, in part, to it being billed as part of Democrats’ post-election pledges to cut costs for Californians.It also has the backing of the state’s influential labor unions, which tend to get their way in the Legislature.Its labor supporters include the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and the California Labor Federation. In total, those labor groups have donated at least $8.5 million to lawmakers in the last 10 years, according to CalMatters Digital Democracy database.
‘A high-tech assault on working people’
The unions argue that using algorithms and AI to generate higher prices for customers is inherently discriminatory and should be illegal.
Ivan Fernandez, a lobbyist with the California Labor Federation, called the practice of surveillance pricing a “high-tech assault on working people” during a hearing before the Assembly privacy committee in June. He argued that people are already struggling to afford the high cost of living in California, and companies should not be able to “use our data to squeeze every cent they can.”
“Using data such as a person’s geolocation or their phone battery to determine how much to upcharge them for a good or service further exacerbates this issue of affordability for our affiliate members and for workers,” Fernandez said.
On the other side are business and tech groups that also have donated heavily to legislators but tend to get their way less often than labor does.
Opponents include the California Chamber of Commerce and the Silicon Valley lobbying organizations TechNet and Chamber of Progress. The 17 groups opposed to the measure have given at least $11.7 million to legislators since 2015, according to Digital Democracy.
The opposition argues that the bill is unnecessary under California’s existing data privacy laws, would stifle innovation, cut into tech company profits and lead to higher prices. 
“The bill would unfairly cause companies to overhaul their pricing models and strategies at significant cost, to the detriment of both the businesses themselves and their consumers,” wrote Ronak Daylami, a policy analyst with CalChamber, in an opposition letter to the Assembly Judiciary Committee. That committee voted 10-4 to send the bill to the Assembly floor.
CalChamber spokesperson John Myers declined to comment further. 
So far, the bill has faced little resistance from lawmakers. Only Republicans have voted against it as it easily passed the California Senate and as it made its way through the Assembly. 
“This overregulation is impeding how we do business and how people want to do business,” said Assemblywoman Diane Dixon, a Republican who represents the Huntington Beach area, during an Assembly judiciary committee hearing. “I just believe that the market resolves these issues.”

A few Democrats, such as assemblymembers Chris Ward of San Diego and Lori Wilson of Suisun City, asked about enforcement and also some exceptions for “legitimate uses” of geolocation data, but Wahab has mostly received kudos.
“It’s modern-day redlining,” Assemblymember Liz Ortega, a Democrat who represents the Hayward area, told the Assembly privacy committee, referring to racist lending practices that relegated Black and other non-white families into less safe and less desirable neighborhoods prior to the Fair Housing Act of 1968. Proponents of SB 259 argue that without additional guardrails, companies could use consumers’ data to engage in similarly racist price discrimination. 
“It was not OK then, and it’s not OK today,” Ortega said.Notwithstanding her concerns about equitable pricing, Ortega’s support for the union-sponsored proposal isn’t surprising. She is the former statewide political director for one of AFSCME’s local unions. Since 2023, she voted with AFSCME and its affiliate unions’ positions on legislation 100% of the time in 127 opportunities, according to Digital Democracy. She’s also received $77,800 in campaign donations from AFSCME and its affiliates.
Testing Newsom’s tech loyalty 
As she pitched her proposal, Wahab has frequently referred to herself as “a former tech worker in Silicon Valley” and leaned on her experience working with tech companies as a business IT consultant. Yet she is also strongly aligned with labor and unions, voting their way more than 90% of the time. Since 2021 she has received nearly $50,000 in campaign contributions from the California Labor Federation and AFSCME, according to the Digital Democracy database.
Wahab painted the companies in her former industry as profit-hungry villains that unscrupulously use Californians’ personal data to pad their bottom lines.

Wahab pointed to a ProPublica report that exposed the test prep company Princeton Review charging higher prices for online SAT tutoring to customers in zip codes that had a high percentage of Asian residents, even in neighborhoods with low median incomes. 
“You are being discriminated against based on your perceived socioeconomic status,” Wahab told CalMatters.
She also cited reporting from SFGate that alleged hotel booking platforms would upcharge users whose devices showed they were browsing from the Bay Area, sometimes up to $500 a night more than users in other parts of the country. 
And she highlighted a report from the advocacy group Consumer Watchdog that alleged ridehailing apps such as Uber and Lyft charged higher prices to riders whose phone batteries were low – a claim that the companies deny.
“Suggestions that our systems manipulate pricing unfairly or discriminate are simply false and not supported by evidence,” wrote Zahid Arab, a spokesperson for Uber, in an emailed statement. Shadawn Reddick-Smith, a representative for Lyft, said in an emailed statement that the company “does not base fares on battery percentage.”
At least one expert on tech says the critiques from business groups that the bill would stifle innovation and lead to profit losses are inaccurate, specious and “wildly overblown.” 
“Industries have built a business model around systematically violating our privacy in ways that we do not want, and generally do not consent to,” said David Evan Harris, a former research manager at Meta and a lecturer at the UC Berkeley Haas School of Business. “People shouldn’t have to be misled into consenting to things.”
Robert Boykin, a representative for the trade group TechNet, noted that California’s privacy law already gives consumers “meaningful rights,” such as the ability to opt out of the sale of precise geolocation and protection from discrimination should they choose to do so. 
He said the law also allows companies to offer customers “benefits like loyalty programs and pricing discounts, as long as they’re tied to the value of the data and meet strict standards.” 
Wahab’s measure is likely to be heard by the full Assembly when lawmakers reconvene from their summer recess in mid-August. It could end up on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk soon after. 
The governor has a friendlier relationship with tech companies than the Legislature does. Last year, Newsom vetoed a handful of bills that sought to regulate AI. They included bans on self-driving trucks and weaponized robots as well as a comprehensive measure compelling testing of AI models. 
In July, Newsom convened a panel of California tech executives to identify inefficiencies in state government operations, a nod to Trump’s deployment of Tesla CEO Elon Musk to remake the federal bureaucracy. He reportedly even sent “burner” phones to nearly 100 tech executives so they could contact him confidentially.

Monica Rivera
Monica Rivera is a real estate sales manager and serves as chair of the Gateway Cities chapter of Abundant Housing LA.


Working families across California are getting pushed further away from opportunity — from cities and job centers with schools, health care facilities and amenities. Nowhere is this more evident than where I live, Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest metro area and one of the wealthiest regions in the world.
Thousands of Angelenos are stuck with costly, exhausting commutes because they can’t afford to live near their jobs, burning through more than $14,000 a year on transportation — much of it on car payments, gas and maintenance. This isn’t an accident. For decades, our cities have systematically banned apartments and condos, preventing working people from living near jobs and transit systems their taxes fund.
The solution is simple: reform land use and housing policies to allow more homes near transit.
I’ve spent my career helping people find homes — not just for the right square footage, but for homes that allow them to connect the rest of their lives. As a real estate sales manager, I’ve supported agents through over 1,000 home sales and seen the same struggle play out: families who want to live close to their jobs, childcare or aging parents — and can’t.
In L.A. County, families earning the median income of $88,000 can’t afford sky-high rent, much less a median home price approaching $1 million. They move farther out, sacrificing time, money and quality of life to keep a roof over their heads.
Meanwhile, taxpayers have spent billions expanding our transit network, adding stations in places like South Pasadena, Redondo Beach and East Long Beach. Yet red tape blocks housing near these stops, making it nearly impossible for working families to live near the infrastructure they’ve already paid for.
A bill in the state legislature, SB 79, offers a commonsense fix: requiring cities to allow more housing near transit — up to seven stories near subways and mid-rises near less frequent Metrolink stops. Projects that meet these standards would be streamlined for approval.
This approach puts money back in peoples’ pockets. Families not reliant on cars save thousands yearly, which is often the difference between barely getting by and putting money towards their dreams — a college education for their kids, a retirement plan or even a GED or vocational certificate to change their career path.
My nieces are a clear example of what’s at stake. My 19-year-old niece would wake at 3 a.m. to walk to the bus stop, transferring across four buses to make it to her 7 a.m. class at Rio Hondo College, often on little sleep. Her younger sister, working toward her degree at Cal State Long Beach, was balancing a part time job to afford $50-$60 each way on rideshares because of the lack of reliable transit near home.
We don’t always call this displacement, but that’s what it is. They weren’t just priced out of housing — they were nearly priced out of access to education, work and opportunity.
More homes near transit reduces the risk of displacement. California’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office found that Bay Area neighborhoods adding the most housing experienced half the displacement rates of areas that blocked development.
It’s also critical for climate action. Cars and trucks account for 30% of the state’s climate pollution, a figure that remains stubbornly high because so many Californians are forced to drive long distances. Research shows people who live near reliable transit or in walkable neighborhoods, drive half as much as those in car-dependent areas, reducing traffic, commute times and air pollution.
I’m old enough to remember when teachers lived near schools and nurses near hospitals. That didn’t change because of their preferences — it changed because we banned the housing they could afford.
We’ve let perfect become the enemy of good, and working families pay the price. SB 79 is a step toward fairness: it lets people live near the infrastructure we’ve already built, and ensures good housing doesn’t die in endless meetings.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/041320-LA-Metro-Train-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

A request by Musk’s company to operate while the application is pending was denied by then-Nevada Transportation Commissioner David Groover, who was removed from his appointed position last month, according to sources. 
The effort by Paradise Transportation Company, LLC, a subsidiary of Musk’s Boring Company, is intended to let Vegas Loop, a project that could take decades to complete, take immediate advantage of traffic at Harry Reid International Airport. 
Thanks to Musk’s deep pockets, the above-ground service seeks to undercut competition with fares other modes of transportation can’t match: $5 for trips up to three miles, $10 for four to six miles, and $12 for trips of more than six miles.
While rideshare rates vary, a two-mile Lyft ride runs about $11 while a 13-mile trip is roughly $23, both about twice as much as Paradise’s proposed fare. Taxis charge a base fee of $3.50 plus about $2.75 per mile, according to the Taxicab Authority.  
Musk’s application says there is “currently a gap in the market and no regular transportation servicer between the Harry Reid International Airport (and other resorts) and the Vegas Loop,” as well “a gap in service to properties with approved entitlements for Vegas Loop stations.” 
Paradise is seeking licenses to transport passengers “between definite points of origin and destination, at a per capita rate,” according to state regulation. Whether the points of origin and destination are confined to the airport, resorts, or any of 104 tunnel stations approved by local governments, as outlined in the application to provide service, and whether the stations would have to be operational, are points of contention, according to insiders. 
“Our only concern is that they get properly licensed,” said Jonathan Schwartz, Director of Yellow Checker Star Transportation (YCS) and Newcab, whose companies collectively put about half of the cabs in Southern Nevada on the streets. “They’re essentially operating a taxicab company, and they need to be licensed and permitted as such. They need to charge a compensable rate.”
Industry insiders, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation, say Musk is willing to lose money by undercutting competitors and potentially putting them out of business in order to prove his underground transit concept works.
An initial, heavily-redacted application filed by Paradise with the Nevada Transportation Authority (NTA) in September 2024, attempted to conceal from the public the project’s connection to the Vegas Loop. A revised version filed two months later revealed the relationship between Musk’s Boring Company and Paradise, its subsidiary. 
Groover, the former state transportation commissioner, approved a bid from Musk’s company in April for interim authority to shuttle passengers on surface streets between the airport and 4744 Paradise Road (a proposed Vegas Loop station that has yet to be built) while the application is pending, but denied the company’s interim request to provide transportation for special events, according to a document obtained by the Current.
Groover confirmed Friday he is no longer with the NTA, and as the former hearing master in an ongoing case, declined to comment.
Gov. Joe Lombardo, who appointed Groover to the NTA, did not respond to requests for comment.
Paradise has not complied with NTA requirements and interim authority for airport transit has not been issued, NTA official Liz Babcock said via email.
The airport is the holy grail for the Vegas Loop. It’s the reason Strip properties are eager to set aside valuable property for Loop stations. But unlike pliant local officials, who have largely allowed Musk’s Boring Company to tunnel without impediment, the Federal Aviation Administration and federal environmental reviews stand between the proposed airport tunnel and some 58 million passengers a year.
‘Soul-destroying traffic’
Steve Hill, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, has hailed going underground as a means of alleviating traffic congestion since 2019, when the LVCVA granted Musk’s Boring Company a $52.5 million contract to connect its expanding convention facility via tunnels. Hill also planted the seeds for expanding the labyrinth to run beneath Strip and downtown casinos, with Musk footing the bill and collecting the revenue.
“This project is exceptionally important to Las Vegas. It’s really an opportunity to make a dent in traffic congestion,” Hill said in a 2024 LVCVA news release. 
Boring Co. wants Vegas Loop expansion

Now, traffic concerns are taking a back seat to accelerating Boring’s plans to augment ridership at its only publicly operating project in the U.S. The Vegas Loop currently moves more than 30,000 passengers per day across five stations and 2.2 miles of tunnel, the company says. When fully constructed, daily ridership is expected to reach 90,000.
“It’s not going to be a transportation system that they rely on,” Hill said during a phone interview of the surface street version of the Vegas Loop. “It’s just intended to provide them some flexibility while the system’s being built. They’ll stay in the tunnels to the extent they are available. This just gives them some options in the event that they are not complete.” 
It took Boring one year to dig 1.7 miles for two convention center tunnels. At that rate, it could take 40 years to complete the entire 68-mile system and 104 stations. 
“There is no way mathematically that this could be the kind of grand solution to a city’s transportation problems that they’re pitching,” Jarrett Walker, an international public transit planning consultant told Bloomberg in a story published last week.
Even Boring’s employees, according to Bloomberg, are feeling frustrated working “on a downgraded mission to develop an underground taxi network in Sin City.
Hill says only about 15 to 20 of the 104 locations approved by local governments for tunnel stations have agreements with Boring. “It’s not the kind of thing you do until you are ready to build,” he said. 
The NTA declined to comment on whether Paradise’s lack of entitlement to all station locations would affect the application.
The company and its subsidiary, Paradise, did not respond to requests for an interview.  
“The Boring Company just doesn’t talk,” said Hill. “It’s not you, it’s everybody”
Cars, taxis, and tunnels
The LVCVA’s 2019 deal with Boring came as the Regional Transportation Commission coped with rideshare-induced cuts to bus revenue along the Strip, once its bread-and-butter route.
“We certainly don’t feel the Boring Company’s system in the community would be exclusive or crowd out others,” Hill said at the time.
Paradise’s application notes the company “is providing affordable point-to-point transportation service to supplement existing transportation in Las Vegas and meet the expected growing demand for these services.” But common carriers fear Musk’s endeavor will supplant, rather than supplement, existing services. 
“It’s going to put me out of business,” said a Lyft driver, who noted ridership is down and driver earnings, determined by the platform’s algorithm, are on the decline.  
Visitation to Las Vegas was off by more than 11% in June, according to the LVCVA. 
“If they’re going to operate as a taxicab company, they should be licensed as a taxicab company,” Schwartz says of the entire Vegas Loop, above and below ground. “They’re operating cars. It’s not a rail. They’re just operating cars through a tunnel. It’s no different than a taxicab.”
The company’s projections for ridership, revenue, and expenses are redacted in its application for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) from the NTA. 
Hill contends the NTA intends to regulate the above-ground Loop as a Transportation Network Company (TNC), the same designation as a rideshare. The NTA, however, says the above-ground Loop would operate as a special service and airport transfer service.
Hiil acknowledges the Vegas Loop “is competitive with taxis and rideshares, but the vast majority of what they’re going to do is in the tunnels.” He says it’s up to the NTA to determine whether the Loop’s above-ground component will pose too much competition to taxis and rideshares. 
Nevada law permits the NTA to grant a CPCN if, in addition to other requirements, the applicant is financially viable and the approval “will foster sound economic conditions within the applicable industry” and “will not unreasonably and adversely affect other carriers operating in the territory.”
“The reason we have the statute that says these companies need to be financially viable is so you don’t have a business model where you build it out, use pricing power like that, and then you’re the only game in town,’ said the industry insider who asked not to be identified. “Musk can undercut everybody for as long as he wants. He’s financially viable. But does the business model work?”
An NTA spokesperson says the state is mostly concerned with the applicant’s “fitness to operate within the regulatory framework.” Interested parties can file a petition to intervene regarding the applicant’s impact on the market. 
“We do not do market impact studies,” NTA attorney Yoneet Wilburn said via email. “We do not have studies on the financial impact.”
Musk has long hailed tunneling as the answer to the “soul-destroying traffic” in metropolitan areas. 
Several industry experts suggest that If reducing traffic congestion is the true purpose of the tunnels, Boring Company should allow all electric vehicles to use them. 
“That’s silly,” Hill said in response to the suggestion. “The Boring Company built the tunnels. They own them. Whoever has that idea has a misunderstanding of how that works.”
Clark County and the City of Las Vegas, Hill noted, have revenue sharing agreements with Vegas Loop. 
But toll roads are popular in a number of states, including California. Boring, experts say, could easily impose a toll tunnel on unaffiliated drivers, with local governments getting a cut of the action.    
The city and Clark County have franchise agreements with TBC that entitle the governments to revenue from rides originating in their jurisdictions. Clark County receives .5% of quarterly gross revenue up to $17.5 million and 5% of gross revenue in excess of that amount. The city has a similar agreement. 
Public transportation experts suggest Paradise’s application is a fait accompli and is likely to be approved by the NTA, which some suggest is subject to regulatory capture. 
Musk enjoys unofficial “favorite son” status in Nevada, where his Tesla Corporation is reaping the benefits of more than $1.6 billion in tax breaks. Hill shepherded the initial portion of that deal in his former job as executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development, where he worked with Kris Sanchez, director of the state’s Department of Business and Industry, which oversees the NTA. 
Boring again did not respond to requests for comment. 
“I notified the attorney for Paradise Transportation yesterday that you requested the applications,” NTA attorney Wilburn said Wednesday, adding that doing so is her personal practice. Asked if she’d notify the attorney that the Current is trying to get in touch, Wilburn declined. “I’d never do that.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/newvloc.webp,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)This month most counties in Utah will oversee primary elections for local offices ahead of the Nov. 4 general election. With a portion of a new election law now effective, clerks will have less time to receive mail-in ballots. But, those planning to vote in advance can still cast their votes in various methods.
Every county — except for Daggett, Grand, Morgan, Piute, Rich and Uintah — have at least one primary race for mayors offices and city councils happening on Aug. 12, according to the Utah Lt. Governor’s Office. Utah County residents are also electing candidates for school board.

“A lot of these people that we’re electing at the local level are making decisions on things like roads, parks, schools in some cases, and zoning, and permits, and libraries, and police and fire, and setting your tax rates and fees,” Cambria Cantrell, elections coordinator at the lieutenant governor’s office said. “So local elections matter as much as, if not, sometimes more than any other.”
The deadline to register to receive a by-mail ballot has passed. However, voters can still send in their ballots by mail. Unlike other elections, there isn’t a specific last day to postmark a ballot, but Cantrell warns, voters should send them in as soon as possible.
That’s because a phase of HB300, an election law the Utah Legislature passed this year, now requires clerks to receive any votes sent by mail by 8 p.m. on election night. 
“We are encouraging people, if they plan to mail their ballot, to do it early, just to allow plenty of time for it to get through the Postal Service system,” Cantrell said.
Dropboxes in every city across the state are also a good option to submit the ballots that may not make it on time in the mail. 



Let us know what you think...


 


This is also the first election under HB69, a 2025 law banning clerks from accessing and disclosing voter records for personal purposes.
Utahns may also notice a change in their ballot envelope design. Utah County and other jurisdictions that hadn’t made the change yet implemented privacy tabs to prevent individual ballots from being traced back to voters’ personal information. 
In another change, while it isn’t required yet, some counties started adding a spot where voters can provide the last four digits of their social security or driver’s license numbers for verification, a phase of HB300 that will officially become effective statewide in 2029.
Voters who are registered to vote but haven’t received their ballots in their mail have until Tuesday, Aug. 5, to request one, Cantrell said. The deadline for voters using the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act is Aug. 11. 
Same-day registration is also available for those voting in person. Voters may visit the state’s election website to read more about the candidates running for public office in their cities. Early voting times vary depending on the county. 
Municipal primaries like these are generally less popular among voters. Turnout in most counties is often in the 20% to 30% range, Cantrell said. That’s a little lower than turnout in primary elections for statewide offices, which last year was in the 46% to 47% range.
Because some races lack candidates in opposing parties, meaning offices will be decided in party primaries, state election officials encourage Utahns to participate.

(Left: Courtesy Cindy Myrex; Right: Courtesy Clint Hollingsworth)Republican voters in Cullman County will choose their nominee for the House District 12 special election for the Alabama House of Representatives on Aug. 12.
Voters narrowed their options from four candidates to Cullman City Councilman Clint Hollingsworth and realtor Cindy Myrex on July 15. Myrex received 49.81% of votes and Hollingsworth got 43.24%, according to election results. 
The district covers part of Cullman County and is solidly Republican. Former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. He resigned in April after not being present for much of the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.

The candidates

Hollingsworth, 47, said he is trying to get to places that he did not make it to before the July primary.
“I just try to get in front of as many people as I can possible,” Hollingsworth said in a phone interview Tuesday.
Myrex said she is prioritizing spending personal time with voters to listen to their concerns and accurately represent them.
“I just feel like I’m more in tune with the people,” Myrex said in a phone interview Thursday. “It’s about being a strong conservative voice in Montgomery, for our county, and represent the voice of the people and what they want.”
Both candidates have a long list of priorities and ideas if they are elected to office, most of which stem from community concerns. Hollingsworth, who has served on the Cullman City Council for 17 years, said a lot of concerns he hears are local.
“You go to different areas and some people were wanting a traffic light. Some people are wanting road work done,” Hollingsworth said. “I’ve got one place that needs an AC for their volunteer fire department.”
Myrex, a Smith Lake realtor, has heard similar concerns, but is prioritizing being a strong voice in the state legislature and reducing government overreach. 
“My priority is always going to be to be the voice of the people. I don’t know that you can prioritize this many needs,” she said.
Myrex said Friday that voters are concerned about some land on Smith Lake in Cullman County that will be annexed to the City of Cullman, a result of SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills.
“The bigger topic has been the annexation of Smith Lake property into the City of Cullman, and the fact that Poarch Creek Indians owns a portion of that property. And their concern is, could there be gambling, a casino, or whatever on Smith Lake,” Myrex said. “So that’s been more of the issue is, ‘Please work hard to keep that out of our community, and please work hard to stop the any kind of annexation.'”
An amendment in the bill’s final version prohibits building a casino or another place for gambling activities.
In the primary, 4,274 people voted, 12.4% of registered voters, according to results. Myrex is expecting most of those to return for the primary runoff. 
“When I say, exercise your right, I don’t care what side of the aisle you’re on,” Myrex said. “That’s your voice when you mark that box.”
The Cullman Tribune, a local news outlet, plans to host a debate on Aug. 9 at Wallace State Community College. Myrex said she would not attend, but would not say on-the-record why.

Campaign Finances

More than $270,000 have been raised in the primary race, according to campaign finance records. Hollingsworth has raised $147,741.73 since the beginning of his campaign and spent $112,301.75. Almost two thirds of his donations come from political action committees (PACs), where the SV&B and SVBII PACs donated the most at $14,000 between two separate PACs that are operated by the same consulting firm: Swatek, Vaughn and Bryan.
PACs donated $89,483.75 (60.6%), individuals gave $42,719.64 (28.9%) and businesses gave $13,750 (9.3%), according to campaign finance records. A message seeking comment from Hollingsworth about his donations was left Friday.
Myrex has raised $142,302.20 since the beginning of her campaign and spent $111,395.21. Myrex has self funded almost 40% of her campaign with more than $56,000. Businesses have contributed $42,000 (29.5%), individuals have given $35,726 (25.1%) and PACs have given $6,600 (4.6%), according to campaign finance records. The Veterans PAC and the fundraising arm of ALFA contributed a combined $6,100 and the Alabama Christian Citizens PAC gave the other $500.
Myrex said in a phone interview Friday that she wished she had gotten more support from PACs, but is glad that the voters are funding her campaign more.
“To be honest, I’m not the chosen one. I’m not the Montgomery pick,” Myrex said. “I’m thankful that my community has rallied around me and believe enough in me and donated for the win, because that tells me that my community believes in me.”

How to vote

District 12 voters can choose between Hollingsworth and Myrex for the Republican nomination on Aug. 12. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. The winner will face Democratic nominee Matthew Glover, a 40-year-old former Good Hope City councilman on Oct. 28.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A longtime Alaska fisher who was sentenced in May to a year in jail for illegally exporting crab, much of it disease infected, has now been ordered to pay $1.18 million in penalties for unrelated water pollution charges.
Corey Potter and the companies he managed  — the vessel Knot EZ, Aleutian Tendering LLC and the Alaska Tendering Company LLC — were ordered to pay the combined penalty in a default judgment issued on Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason.
The penalty was for repeated discharges of oily bilge water, which violated the Clean Water Act, according to court documents.
Potter had not responded to the charges, which were detailed in a complaint filed on Oct. 24, or appeared in court on the case, according to the U.S. Coast Guard and federal prosecutors. That triggered the default judgment by Gleason.
Potter’s previous case concerned thousands of pounds of king crab he and his partners harvested in Southeast Alaska and took directly to Washington state. Alaska law requires that all crabs commercially harvested in waters off Alaska be landed and processed within the state. Part of the reason for that is to ensure quality and marketability.
 

  The Knot EZ, seen in this undated photo, had been illegally discharging oily bilge water over multiple fishing seasons, federal prosecutors said. The vessel operated as a tender, delivering harvested fish from catcher vessels to processors. It was owned by Corey Potter, a longtime Alaska fisher sentenced in May to jail time for illegal out-of-state shipment of king crab, much of which was infected with bitter crab syndrome. (Photo provided by the U.S. Coast Guard)
 

	Instead, a significant percentage of the catch that Potter and his associate brought to Washington state was infected with bitter crab syndrome. The parasitic disease, which is linked to warming waters, kills crabs and makes their meat unpalatable, though not toxic to humans.
The water pollution case against Potter is separate. It stems from a Coast Guard rescue of the Knot EZ, which was sinking in Kodiak Harbor in July of 2022. The Knot EZ operated as a tender, a vessel that delivered fish from harvesters to processors, according to court documents.
Guardsmen who responded to the Knot EZ’s distress call discovered that the vessel had an illegal discharge system that was pumping oily bilge water directly into the sea, according to the complaint. Crew members hired by Potter admitted that the illegal bypass system was used daily, according to the complaint.
The vessel was declared to be unfit for service, and subsequent investigation discovered a long-running pattern of such violations in past fishing seasons as well, according to the complaint.
While neither Potter nor his companies responded to the Clean Water Act charges, a public defender representing him in the crab case asked for leniency, based on his age and on the financial hardships he has already endured. Potter, 64, “has been reduced to relying upon family for assistance and has no viable means to support himself,” said the defense presentencing memorandum in that case, which was filed on May 6.

Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) is shown on the floor of the New Mexico Senate during the 2025 legislative session. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)A state senator wants New Mexico to adopt a more rehabilitative model for incarcerating and treating young people who are accused of crimes and whom the state deems in need of mental health treatment.
As young people await trial in their delinquent or criminal cases, New Mexico holds them in four county-run youth detention centers in Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Farmington and Roswell.
Sen. Linda Trujillo (D-Santa Fe) told the Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee on Wednesday this leaves communities in northeastern New Mexico, including her district, without any youth detention centers. As a result, the county transports children from Santa Fe who are charged with crimes all the way to Farmington, she said.
“It’s so far away for our families, and it’s just not good for them to be so far away,” Trujillo said. “I think that we, as a state, should take responsibility for ensuring that we have detention centers that meet a standard and that provide the resources that we need to, and that are local and in our communities.”
The problem is statewide, according to Fifth Judicial District Attorney Dianna Luce and Law Offices of the Public Defender Deputy Chief of Operations Jennifer Barela, who discussed juvenile justice and treatment with the committee on Thursday.
Luce and Barela told the committee it’s difficult if not impossible to place children facing criminal charges into mental health treatment. Barela said public defenders who represent children in courts across the state tell her there’s nowhere to place young people for treatment.
“We need to look at more localized treatment,” Barela said. “These kids need to be close to their families.”
Trujillo said she wants to see the state government start building small, non-institutional youth detention facilities close to home. She said she wants a system inspired by the state of Missouri’s Division of Youth Services, which she called a national model and said considers not only a young person’s alleged crime but also their treatment needs.
New Mexico’s own child welfare agency, the Children Youth and Families Department, hired a contractor to implement the Missouri model in 2007, according to Trujillo’s presentation to the committee.
State officials in 2010 adopted a plan to implement the Missouri model which included creating regional youth detention centers, according to Trujillo’s presentation, however, she said counties still haven’t built the facilities because they can’t afford to.
After courts resolve young people’s cases, CYFD provides mental health treatment to girls and boys held in the Youth Development and Diagnostic Center in Albuquerque and boys in the John Paul Taylor Center in Las Cruces, if they meet the criteria to get in, Luce said.
“I’m proposing that we have more of those, and that they look more like a home,” Trujillo told Source NM in an interview on Friday. “It’s not just to detain youth — it’s to provide them intense therapy, to provide them the resources they need.”
The facilities Trujillo is proposing would have the same security measures any detention center would, but would hold smaller numbers of children and be built to not “look so institutional.”
Trujillo’s two proposals are part of a larger package of juvenile justice reforms she wants Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to consider in the 30-day legislative session next year.

Federal officials from the Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management held one of their first public meetings on the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport Wednesday– a project nearly three-decades in the making.
The airport would be one of the largest in the nation by land area, sprawling across 23,000 acres of public land in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm. 
Nearly a hundred people attended the meeting to provide public comments on the proposed airport – input that will help guide the federal government as they work through the environmental review process. 
That review will likely center on the airport’s potential impact on two endangered species who call the area home: the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon, a small pink bell-shaped flower.

Early maps of the project show that desert tortoises will likely need to be relocated to accommodate the construction of the airport. However, recent studies have suggested that relocating desert tortoises can be detrimental to their survival.
One long-term study by the U.S. Geological Survey found that in the first three years of relocating 158 desert tortoises less than 10 miles from their habitat about 50% died, mostly due to predators.
The airport would also encroach on one of the sole known populations of the white-margined penstemon. A 2021 study commissioned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found a 50% chance of extinction for the wildflower in the next 50 years due to climate change and habitat destruction.
The Center for Biological Diversity and the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter held a press conference outside the meeting to speak on the airport’s potential impact on desert habitat and wildlife.
“If we destroy our desert for sprawl, we will end up harming our ecosystems, harming our air quality, diminishing our water supplies, and affecting people here in Las Vegas very substantially,” said Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity.
Critics of the project said the airport was a sign of reckless sprawl in Southern Nevada, a region experiencing severe long-term drought. 
State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.
“We cannot afford to sprawl all the way down to Jean. We cannot afford the wildlife impacts or the water impacts or the air quality impacts from adding a second gigantic commercial airport,” said Vinny Spotleson, the president of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter.
Several locals who spoke at the meeting questioned the need for a second airport, noting the development of high-speed rail between Nevada and California, and the presence of several other airports in southern Nevada that could be expanded to meet demand.
James Chrisley, the senior director for the Clark County Department of Aviation, said the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport. 
According to estimates by the agency, the Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030. The airport would accommodate both passenger and cargo flights.
Decades-old decisions have also left the county with limited options when it comes to the location of an additional airport.
“We’re landlocked,” Chrisley said. 
The Harry Reid Airport was initially built in 1942 outside the city of Las Vegas, in a relatively undeveloped area. However, the rapid growth of the Las Vegas metropolitan area over subsequent decades led to the city’s suburbs surrounding the airport, effectively landlocking it.
The Clark County Department of Aviation has evaluated several locations and looked into potentially modifying smaller airports to meet their needs, but concluded Ivanpah Valley was the only feasible option.
More than a dozen sites were evaluated by 2005 as potential locations for the airport before being whittled down to four: Apex, Eldorado Valley, Moapa Reservation, and Ivanpah Valley.
Nellis Air Force Base, Moapa Reservation, and Apex were eventually eliminated due to airspace constraints. Between Eldorado Valley and Ivanpah Valley, the latter won out.
“We’ve revalidated that study recently and continue to look at it just to make sure this is truly the only feasible site,” Chrisley said.
Plans for the airport were first initiated in 2000 when the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Act, championed by U.S. Senator Harry Reid and signed into law by President Bill Clinton, transferred about 6,000 acres of public land to Clark County for a new airport.
The Clark County Department of Aviation submitted their first draft by 2006, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the federal government to suspend any work on the environmental review.
Chrisley said things changed this year after the Harry Reid International Airport recorded 58.4 million passengers last year, a 1.39% increase over 2023’s previous high.
“We’ve been planning this for 25 years, and I personally have been on this for the last almost 10 years. It’s time. The Valley continues to grow and we need to support the innovation of this community,” Chrisley said.
Preliminary plans show the airport would include a central terminal, two runways, a taxiway system, and an air traffic control tower. The plan would also require an expansion of the Interstate-15 and a new dedicated interchange.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/airport-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

(Alander Rocha/Alabama Reflector)A horrific crime leads to get-tough policies to ensure the tragedy never happens again.
That happened in 2018, after a failure in Alabama’s criminal justice system led to the mistaken parole of a man who later murdered three people, including a 7-year-old child, during a series of robberies in Guntersville.
Gov. Kay Ivey and Attorney General Steve Marshall called for major changes to the parole system. Lawmakers delivered. The Board of Pardons and Paroles was soon staffed by people largely skeptical of inmates.
As a result, parole rates plummeted into the single digits. Incarcerated people who made earnest rehabilitation efforts remained trapped in a system racked by violence, which made enrollment in training programs behind bars seem pointless, adding to the chaos. The board made dozens of cruel and ridiculous decisions, including, per al.com, denying parole to a quadriplegic man. State officials now seem to be backing away from the approach.
Today we have another horrific crime that, I fear, may lead legislators acting in good faith to enact policies that could have terrible unintended consequences.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, a former prosecutor of child abuse cases, is reintroducing a bill he filed last year to impose the death penalty on those convicted of sexual assault of children younger than 12.
In support of the legislation, Simpson and his supporters are citing what can only be described as an atrocity in Bibb County. Authorities have charged seven people with running a child sex trafficking ring involving victims ranging from ages 3 to 15.
The details are hard to process. Anyone convicted of these crimes needs to be locked away and never wander outside a prison wall again. And believe me, I understand the desire to go even further and subject people who commit these evil acts to the most severe punishments we can imagine.
But extending the death penalty in this manner is a bad idea. Not because it would be bad for the abusers. Because it would be bad for the victims.
Simpson and his supporters want to overturn a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Kennedy v. Louisiana, which prohibited capital punishment for child rape. In that case, the court voted 5-4 to overturn the death sentence of a Louisiana man who had been convicted of brutally raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter. This Supreme Court may do what Simpson hopes.
But they should pause before taking that step. In his majority opinion in Kennedy v. Louisiana, Justice Anthony Kennedy made sure to convey the horror of the crime. But he also noted that pursuing the death penalty meant the traumatized victim, a child, had to discuss her ordeal at length — first with law enforcement, and then at a public trial.
“Capital cases require a long-term commitment by those who testify for the prosecution, especially when guilt and sentencing determinations are in multiple proceedings,” Justice Kennedy wrote. “In cases like this, the key testimony is not just from the family but from the victim herself. During formative years of her adolescence, made all the more daunting for having to come to terms with the brutality of her experience, (the victim) was required to discuss the case at length with law enforcement personnel.”
Kennedy also noted concerns raised by social worker organizations. Child abuse is already an underreported crime, in part because people fear the repercussions for a family member so charged. Imposing the death penalty for child assault could further suppress reporting. Even worse, the justice wrote, making abuse a capital crime “may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim.”
And then there’s the fact that the death penalty is not a deterrent. Alabama has accelerated capital punishment in recent years. Six people died in the Atmore death chamber in 2024, the most in the country.
Despite that, Alabama has nation-leading rates of homicide. In 2022, over 700 Alabamians died at someone else’s hands, a rate of 14.9 per 100,000, the fourth-highest in the country. This isn’t a fluke, either. Since 2014, Alabama has been one of the top-five states in the country for homicide deaths every single year.
Some people may see all this and decide that whatever the consequences, a crime like this can only end in death.
“If it sends even one child predator to an early grave, well, that works too,” Sen. April Weaver, R-Alabaster, said at a Thursday press conference.
It could do that. But only decades after the original crime. And following rounds of appeals where the victim may be forced to relive that horror, over and over again.  While potentially discouraging reports of other assaults.
Is it worth subjecting the victim to that trauma? Is it worth risking a further decline in child abuse reporting? Or putting victims in potentially greater danger?
Anyone convicted of sexually assaulting a child needs to be locked away for life.
But we can’t let our outrage take precedence over the welfare of the victims. If we do, there may be terrible outcomes we don’t intend and never see.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PXL_20250731_1606042462-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 08:56:09.079602

Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.

Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

Mace has officially announced her run for governor in 2026. (File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina’s coastal 1st Congressional District became the fifth GOP candidate to enter the 2026 governor’s race Monday.
Mace, the first woman to graduate from The Citadel, officially launched her campaign during an early morning event at her alma mater. She has been teasing an impending bid for months on social media and talking to voters across the state to prepare for a launch.
“I’m running for governor because South Carolina doesn’t need another empty suit,” Mace told supporters. “I’ve walked into firestorms and come out swinging. … I came to draw the line today and hold it.”
Mace joins an already crowded field for the primary. Republicans who have already announced bids over the last month are Attorney General Alan Wilson, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette, and most recently, U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman of Rock Hill.
Attacks and accusations
While the 47-year-old single mother only just made it official, she has been sniping at the competition, both on social media and in front of voters.
Mace has taken shots at Evette as a “glorified ribbon cutter” who only smiles and waves.
“She’s a nice lady,” Mace wrote on social media in June. “No edge. No guts. No shot.”
But Wilson, who’s in his fourth term as South Carolina’s top prosecutor, has been the primary focus of Mace’s criticism. At the start of the year she began calling Wilson a “do-nothing attorney general.”
Then in February, Mace took to the House floor and accused four men, including her ex-fiancé, of “some of the most heinous crimes against women imaginable” during a nearly hour-long prepared speech.
Mace accuses 4 men, including ex-fiancé, of being sexual ‘predators.’ SLED is investigating.

The congresswoman said she discovered thousands of photos taken with hidden cameras as well as recordings the “predators” made of themselves sexually assaulting women over years. She was among the victims.
The State Law Enforcement Division confirmed after her speech that it was investigating at least one of the men for assault, harassment and voyeurism. The investigation started Dec. 14, 2023, after SLED was contacted by U.S. Capitol Police.
Mace also accused Wilson of not addressing the crimes against her and other women.
All four men accused have denied the accusations and one has sued for libel and defamation.
Wilson said neither he nor anyone in his office had any knowledge of the accusations until her speech. It also is not the attorney general’s job to start a police investigation, his office said in a statement.
Since then, Mace has sued one of the other men for defamation. And a woman, identified as Jane Doe, who says she was a victim of three of the men has filed her own civil suit.
All of those lawsuits are ongoing.
Mace’s political career
Mace’s political career began in January 2018 when she won a special election to the South Carolina House representing parts of Charleston and Berkeley counties. She replaced a GOP legislator who resigned amid a yearslong Statehouse corruption investigation.
In 2020, Mace ousted one-term Democrat Joe Cunningham for the 1st congressional seat, flipping the district back into Republican control. The district was then redrawn as part of the Legislature’s redistricting process following the 2020 census to favor a Republican and Mace easily won re-election with more than 58% of the vote.
Mace easily wins GOP primary in 1st District; 3rd District heads to a runoff

Mace won her last GOP primary with the endorsement of President Donald Trump. But during her early days in Congress, the two had a rocky relationship.
Mace condemned Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol and was among House Republicans who voted to impeach him in the aftermath. In her first re-election bid, Trump backed her GOP challenger, though Mace ultimately won that primary.
She’s since become one of Trump’s most fervent allies.
“I think that anyone that wants to run statewide or any election, really, in 2026 or 2028 beyond, will need the President’s support,” Mace previously told reporters.
More controversy
Mace has also made headlines for her conflicts with multiple transgender people.
It began with the election last November of Delaware’s Rep. Sarah McBride, the first openly transgender member of Congress. Mace introduced a resolution to ban transgender women from using women’s restrooms in the U.S. Capitol and House office buildings, later seeking to expand that to all federal property.
Congresswoman Mace doubles down on offensive language to transgender USC student

She was then criticized for using a slur to the LGBTQ community during a House Oversight Committee hearing in February.
In April, Mace got in a conflict with a transgender student at the University of South Carolina when the student asked Mace to apologize for using the word “tranny” during an April event hosted by USC’s chapter of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit that advocates for conservative viewpoints on high school and college campuses across the country.
Following that exchange, an Upstate transgender woman threatened on social media to kill Mace. The woman was arrested and charged with threatening the life of a public official. That case is still pending.
Town hall series announced
Ahead of officially launching her campaign, Mace also announced a statewide series of speaking engagements that her team is calling “the Mother of All Town Halls,” starting in Myrtle Beach Wednesday.
“No questions off limits, no topics too tough,” Mace’s spokeswoman Sydney Long said in a statement to NBC affiliate WCBD News 2 . “She’ll be traveling across South Carolina to speak directly with residents.”
Mace has previously been criticized for not holding in-person town halls, including a profanity-laden conflict with a man in an Ulta Beauty store who questioned her for her lack of events.

But it won't take effect for at least a few years.","President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill” will make changes to how some people qualify or remain eligible for either Medicaid or food assistance over the next couple of years.
One of those revisions is the implementation of new work requirements — more people will need to work, train or volunteer at least 80 hours a month for access to these programs in the coming years, though there are various exemptions.
Those rules will apply to Medicaid, which is known as HUSKY in Connecticut, as well as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as SNAP.
Supporters say it encourages participation in the workforce and ensures people aren’t taking advantage of safety net programs. But critics argue a majority of people who access these programs are already working and it imposes an extra layer for them to prove they’re engaging in the workforce or in a training program.
Since the “big beautiful bill” was enacted into law only a month ago, states are still figuring out what the changes will look like for applicants and beneficiaries as well as the agencies that’ll need to administer and enforce the new standards.
Here’s what we know so far.
What are work requirements and does Connecticut currently have them?
Public assistance programs may impose rules for some enrollees to be able to access and keep benefits. Such a requirement doesn’t necessarily mean an individual needs to get a job. A person can usually volunteer or participate in a training program to qualify.
Connecticut and most states don’t currently have any for Medicaid, and it will be a first when the new law kicks in on this front.
There are a set of nationwide rules already in place for SNAP benefits: general work requirements and additional ones for able-bodied adults without dependents.
The general requirement means you must register for work, participate in a SNAP Employment and Training program, take a “suitable job” if offered one and must not voluntarily leave a job or change hours to less than 30 hours a week “without a good reason.” There are exceptions for those who are pregnant, in school, as well as for caretakers of young children.
Able-bodied adults without dependents between the ages of 18 and 54 need to work or be involved in community engagement for at least 80 hours a month. If you don’t meet that requirement, you can lose SNAP benefits after three months and may need to wait the three-year period to get them again.
For SNAP, a dependent is currently defined as someone under the age of 18, but it is subject to change as part of the new law.
Who is exempt under the current and new work requirements?
Under SNAP’s current format, you don’t need to meet the work requirement for able-bodied adults without dependents if you are pregnant, have physical and mental limitations, have someone under the age of 18 living in your home, or are already excused under the general work requirement like for those in alcohol and drug treatment programs or if an enrollee is studying or in a training program at least half-time.
There are few groups of able-bodied adults without dependents who are currently excused from work requirements but will lose their exemptions under the new law: veterans, those experiencing homelessness, young adults aging out of foster care and parents and guardians who have someone 14 years and older living with them.
Once work requirements are enacted for HUSKY, there will be nearly a dozen exemptions: those who are pregnant and postpartum, foster youth, disabled veterans, those with alcohol and substance use disorders, beneficiaries who already meet the requirement through other federal programs, individuals with a short-term hardship waiver, recently incarcerated people, parents and caretakers of a dependent under the age of 14 or with a disability, and individuals who are medically frail.
When will the new rules go into effect and will it apply to me?
The exact timing and number of people work requirements will affect is still up in the air, unless you fall in one of the exempted categories listed above.
This is the first time Medicaid will be subject to work requirements in most states. The earliest it’ll go into effect is the beginning of 2027. But states like Connecticut may be able to delay it for another two years until 2029 if they show they are making good faith efforts to implement them.
The new rules will apply to the Medicaid expansion population, known as HUSKY D in Connecticut, which includes coverage for low-income adults without dependents.
For this population, to qualify for Medicaid as an adult under 65, a recipient will need to work or participate in training, education or community service at least 80 hours a month. That criteria will also apply to parents or guardians who have children ages 14 and older.
The state doesn’t know yet how many people in Connecticut could get kicked off Medicaid or won’t be eligible when applying because of work requirements specifically. But early reports about the “big beautiful bill” from Connecticut’s Department of Social Services and the state comptroller’s office estimate more generally that between 100,000 and 200,000 residents could lose their HUSKY coverage in the future for various reasons.
For SNAP, it will expand the work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents with the same minimum hours of work or community engagement for those on HUSKY. It is not clear when the stricter standards will go into effect and a DSS preliminary report said the effective date is “pending federal guidance.”
The law raises the age limit for able-bodied adults without dependents from 54 to 64. And it will also apply to able-bodied adults who have children 14 and older living at home. The bill lowered the age of a dependent, which is currently under age 18.
How will CT implement work requirements?
Connecticut’s Department of Social Services, which oversees HUSKY and SNAP, is in the process of working out how it’ll address the uptick in verifying eligibility and enforcement around both sets of work requirements.
Officials predict Connecticut could see new expenses ranging from $20 million to $50 million, according to a report from the state comptroller’s office. Those costs will likely be used for new technology and increased staffing levels to see which residents on HUSKY are complying with the work requirements and who is exempt.
In Connecticut, 73% of adults on Medicaid are working, according to the nonprofit KFF. But state officials are warning some enrollees who are already working or those who are eligible for an exemption may lose coverage if they fail to provide the necessary paperwork that they’re meeting the qualifications for benefits.
“Many people who are meeting the requirement are projected to lose coverage due to the new compliance paperwork,” the state comptroller report stated in July. “Many of those not working, for example, due to caregiving responsibilities or a disability, would qualify for an exemption, but even significant numbers of those who should be exempt are expected to be disenrolled due to the new bureaucracy involved with proving it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/snap-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 07:57:10.850049

Vermont should not simply follow the rest of the nation in a backward direction on worker protection. We should be a model state in terms of labor laws.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Casey Jennings: Workplace protections in the Trump administration.","This commentary is by Casey Jennings of Lunenburg. He has a master’s degree in forestry and has worked a variety of jobs outdoors, ranging from the U.S. Forestry Service to the private sector.


With the Trump administration attempting to destroy the National Labor Relations Board and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., introducing a bill in Congress to abolish the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, I am calling on the Vermont Legislature to expand worker protection in the state to counter any fallout. 
I ask that private sector employees be allowed to bring their claims to the Vermont Labor Relations Board, that steps be taken to ensure VOSHA will not be impacted by any federal changes, and that H.348, a bill aimed at protecting workers from extreme temperatures, be passed.
I believe it reasonable that employers be required by statute to provide workers with opportunities to warm up when working in winter temperatures. I have witnessed coworkers in single-digit temperatures and subzero wind chills outdoors allowed only one or two short bathroom breaks for 8-hour shifts. One coworker’s nose was frostbitten while others experienced borderline hypothermia. This is unacceptable.
Vermont has also experienced record-high temperatures this summer, with temperatures hitting the upper 90s. It is probable that Vermont will continue seeing these extreme summer temperatures due to climate change.
I remember years ago working in a factory when it was merely in the 80s outside, and over 100 inside. It was quite unbearable, but normal production was still expected — and the one time I expressed concerns to management as well as to OSHA, it was rather callously brushed aside. 
It shouldn’t be accepted as normal when there are reasonable ways of addressing this problem, including extra breaks and better ventilation. A federal proposal was issued by OSHA under the Biden administration to better protect workers from hot temperatures, but it seems unlikely that the Trump administration will follow through with the ongoing rulemaking process.
Vermont should not simply follow the rest of the nation in a backward direction on this subject. We should be a model state in terms of labor laws, and protecting workers from our increasingly extreme weather should be a top priority.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)About 200 new laws that Colorado lawmakers passed this year go into effect Aug. 6, ranging from comprehensive updates to wage theft protections to smaller tweaks in state statutes.
Here are some of the new laws that Coloradans should know.
Stronger voter protections
Colorado lawmakers passed stronger voter protections this year in anticipation of federal rollbacks of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The new law protects access for voters in jail and allows the attorney general to enforce voting rights. It bans efforts to limit someone’s right to vote based on gender identity, gender expression or sexual orientation.
Updated wage theft law
A new wage theft law will impose fines on employers that misclassify employee types that affect their compensation. Fines range from $5,000 to $50,000 for multiple violations that are not fixed within two months. The new law will also reduce the time the state needs to wait before paying an aggrieved employee out of the state’s Wage Theft Enforcement Fund from six months to four months, so those people will get their earned money faster.
The new law will also protect contractors from retaliation for taking protection under wage and hour laws. It also makes illegal efforts to use an employee’s immigration status against them to impact their pay and responsibilities at work
Starting next July, the state Labor Department will adjudicate wage theft claims up to $13,000, double the current threshold.
Free state park access to tribal members

	
Enrolled members of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe are now able to enter any of Colorado’s 43 state parks for free with a current tribal identification card. During the bill’s legislative process, the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation in northeastern Utah attempted to amend it to include their members.
By next June, Colorado Parks and Wildlife will need to expand its efforts to engage with the state’s indigenous communities about state parks, according to the bill.
Protection for transit workers

	
It is now misdemeanor harassment to interfere with a transit worker, such as a bus driver or train operator, while they are doing their job. Additionally, the Regional Transportation District that covers the Denver metro area is now eligible to receive part of the $350 million voters approved last year for law enforcement agencies and personnel.
Official state mushroom designation

	
Colorado officially has a state mushroom: the Agaricus julius, also known as the emperor mushroom. The bill behind the designation was a project from the politics club at Horizon High School in Thornton. Colorado joins seven other states with official state mushrooms.
Labeling for gas stoves

	
Retailers will need to affix warning labels on gas stoves for sale in the state that read “Understand the air quality implications of having an indoor gas stove,” with a link to a webpage from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment about the health impacts of gas stoves. Research has shown that gas stoves can lead to respiratory conditions and cancer.
Limit on public pet sales

	
It is now illegal to sell a pet, advertise the sale or offer a pet for adoption on the side of the road, in a parking lot or in a public market. People and businesses licensed under the Pet Animal Care and Facilities Act are still able to sell animals in public spaces. The new law does not apply to livestock sales or hunting dogs.
Privacy for ranchers

	
The information of people who request compensation for destruction caused by wildlife, such as wolf killings of livestock, are not subject to open records requests. That includes the person’s name, phone number, home address, business address, personal email address and business email address.
Information about conflict mitigation, the number of damage claims and the amount of money paid out to claimants are still subject to requests.
The bill’s legislative declaration states that ranchers have been reluctant to file claims following wolf depredations out of fear that people will contact them or go to their property to view the wolves. Colorado voters approved gray wolf reintroduction in 2020, and Colorado Parks and Wildlife began relocating wolves to the state in December 2023. Since then, there have been numerous livestock killings in Western Slope counties.
Punishment for AI generated pornographic photos

	
Realistic, sexually-explicit photos created by artificial intelligence are now covered under Colorado’s existing child pornography laws. It is also a crime to post computer-generated explicit photos of someone without their consent or with the intent of harming them. The new law creates a pathway for the subject of an obscene AI-generated photo to sue the person who posted the image.
Dog breeds in rental insurance

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gunfire has echoed near Indiana’s K-12 campuses more than 2,700 times over the past decade — a trend that researchers, child advocates, and school safety experts say demands expanded training, stronger trauma support systems, and greater investment in community-based resources.
Data compiled by The Trace’s Gun Violence Data Hub found at least 2,771 shootings within earshot — about four city blocks — of an Indiana school between 2015 and 2024. The data includes traditional public, charter and private schools.
These “school-adjacent” shootings don’t often occur on school grounds, but instead unfolded during or shortly after school hours in surrounding communities, forcing school leaders to cope with trauma that starts beyond their fences but often ripples into classrooms.










Just hearing a gunshot in your neighborhood, knowing that violence is nearby, changes how young people interact with the world.


– Lauren Magee, assistant professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine


Data shows gun violence disproportionately affects majority-Black campuses in the urban core. The five Hoosier schools most affected — all serving majority-Black students — have each endured more than 40 nearby shootings in the past 10 years alone.
“Just hearing a gunshot in your neighborhood, knowing that violence is nearby, changes how young people interact with the world,” said Lauren Magee, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the Indiana University School of Medicine. “These aren’t isolated moments — they ripple through communities, through school culture, and into the homes of every student who walks past a memorial on their way to class.”
Neighborhoods most affected
The Trace data shows most shootings are concentrated in a handful of Indiana cities — especially Indianapolis, which accounts for more than half of the incidents recorded during the 10-year span. Other heavily impacted areas include Gary, Fort Wayne and South Bend. 
Within those cities, several schools were more affected by repeated gunfire.
Indianapolis’s Brookside Elementary School 54, for example, was within four blocks of at least 48 separate shootings between 2015 and 2024, topping the list of schools statewide.


Several other schools saw similar numbers, including Gary Middle College with adjacent 45 shootings; Holy Angels Catholic School, in Indianapolis, also with 45 shootings; 21st Century Charter School of Gary with 43 shootings; and Ralph Waldo Emerson School, in Indianapolis, additionally with 43 adjacent shootings.
At least 22 schools were within earshot of 20 or more gunshots in the 10-year period, according to the data. Nearly 50 Hoosier schools experienced at least 15 nearby shootings.
“But these aren’t just isolated incidents,” said Meisha Wide, executive director of the Children’s Policy and Law Initiative of Indiana. “We’re looking at systemic issues where families are struggling to meet basic needs, and youth are often unsupervised after school.”
She pointed to The Trace’s data showing that many shootings occur in the after-school window — between 6 p.m. and midnight — when students are leaving school, in transit, or unwinding in their neighborhoods, and when students often lack structured activities and adult supervision.


Wide emphasized, too, that communities experiencing more frequent shootings are disproportionately affected by profound economic challenges.
“If you’re not able to meet your basic needs of finances, this results in finding alternative ways to survive,” Wide explained. She noted that poverty, eviction, and limited job opportunities compound cycles of violence in these neighborhoods.
“It’s deeper than just the proximity of the school,” Wide continued. “It’s going to require pulling back and having a broader lens to understand what resources are like in that area.”
‘Preparedness’ key for schools
Julie Quesenbery, a school resource officer in Columbus and president of the Indiana School Resource Officers Association, warned that preparedness is “critical” when violence occurs near a campus. 
“A plan is only so good if people don’t know what’s in the crisis plan,” she said. “When it’s time to perform, the time to prepare has passed.”

Quesenbery stressed the importance of clear protocols for lockdowns, communication, and reunification. She emphasized the need for controlled building access, well-marked evacuation routes, and routine training for all staff.
Indiana law currently requires schools to conduct at least one manmade disaster drill each semester and maintain a safety plan. The Indiana Department of Education and Department of Homeland Security also recommend schools form safety committees, work closely with local law enforcement, and conduct active shooter training. Still, implementation varies widely between districts.
Quesenbery said “effective” school safety requires a collaborative approach involving the entire school ecosystem — not just officers, but teachers, administrators, families and community partners.
“Safety is not just up to me, it’s not just up to you, it’s up to all of us,” she said. 
She also underscored the significance of mental health services and community partnerships in addressing and preventing violence near schools.
“We can’t just react to the problem,” Quesenbery said. “We have to be part of the solution.”
Wide added that many schools lack the staff needed to support students in the wake of trauma. 
She noted that school counselors and social workers are also in short supply. The student-to-counselor ratio in Indiana — last reported at about 497 to 1 — is among the worst in the nation.
The American School Counselor Association recommends a ratio of 250 students per school counselor.
“There’s just not enough staff to meet the needs of kids who are experiencing this kind of repeated trauma,” Wide said. “We need more mental health practitioners in schools, and we need them to be culturally responsive and trained in trauma-informed care.”
Beyond the school fence
Experts emphasize that while these shootings don’t occur inside school buildings, their psychological toll can be “incredibly” significant.
Magee’s research found that students who are chronically exposed to community violence — whether they witness it, hear it, or know someone affected — show heightened signs of trauma, depression and behavioral struggles.
“When we ask youth about their safety, what they talk about isn’t always school-specific — it’s walking to the bus, or playing outside, or scrolling social media and seeing another friend killed,” Magee said. “It creates a chronic stress environment.”

In a recent study co-authored by Magee, which examined firearm-related injuries among youth in Indianapolis, she found that adolescent firearm injuries most commonly occurred in public settings, such as streets, parks or near schools.
Although few incidents took place inside school buildings, many happened near schools or along routes students commonly travel.
“One of the most important findings was that firearm violence doesn’t only affect the immediate victim,” Magee said. “The psychological and academic impacts extend to their peers, families, teachers — and school climate more broadly.”
Her research also found correlations between proximity to gun violence and negative academic outcomes — including lower test scores and increased disciplinary action.
ILEARN results for schools with higher numbers of adjacent shootings, for example, were below statewide averages. 
“We’re asking kids to sit in algebra class after witnessing — or hearing — a shooting,” Magee said. “It’s untenable.”
Her research further concluded that Black youth and families are disproportionately exposed to firearm injury and its ripple effects.
That inequity is echoed in a new, separate report from the Violence Policy Center that ranked Indiana eighth in the nation for Black homicide victimization, with a rate of 39.7 per 100,000 in 2023, the most recent year with available data. 
Indiana recorded 290 Black homicide victims that year. Most, about 90%, were shot.
Forty of those killed were under 18 years old, and most were killed by someone they knew. The majority of incidents were not tied to other felonies — they were arguments, disputes or community violence turned fatal, according to the report.
Working towards solutions
Wide’s organization, CPLI, has launched programs like the Youth Justice Leadership Initiative to encourage and assist youth to become advocates in their communities by focusing on violence prevention, peer support and civic engagement.
CPLI’s recently-published best practices report recommends broader community-school partnerships — including engaging businesses to provide mentorships or third-space opportunities, like recreation centers or co-working spaces for teens.

“Often, these shootings are happening after school, during a gap in supervision and support,” Wide said. “Caregivers may be working second shifts, and young people are left with few safe places to go. We see the consequences of that.”
“There are so many vacant buildings in these neighborhoods — why not turn them into youth hubs?” she added. “We need to invest in alternatives to the street.”
Wide and other advocates additionally urged policymakers to look beyond school buildings and consider “the wider neighborhood context.”
“It’s not just about what’s happening inside school walls,” Wide said. “We need a broader lens that sees the whole ecosystem. These are intergenerational issues. And if we don’t meet them with intergenerational solutions, we’ll keep seeing the same patterns.”
She pointed to policies like better tracking of school absences as a step in the right direction.
“You can’t solve truancy if you don’t know why a student isn’t in school,” she said. “Sometimes it’s violence, sometimes it’s poverty, sometimes it’s caregiving responsibilities. But all of that needs to be visible to respond to it.”
Still, Magee cautioned that impact is limited without changes to gun policy itself.
“We can invest in trauma-informed practices, and we should,” she said. “But if we don’t also address the upstream causes — how guns are accessed, how they’re trafficked, how youth are being pulled into violence — then we’re asking schools to clean up a mess they didn’t create.”

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)It would seem as if Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and California Gov. Gavin Newsom don’t have much in common. Yet their recent pronouncements about the need to redraw congressional districts in their states indicate they both are willing to subvert democracy for political gain. 
By moving to redistrict congressional maps mid-cycle, both Abbott and Newsom not only threaten the voting rights of their state’s citizens, but they also threaten to open a Pandora’s box of copycat activity across the country. It’s a dangerous stunt that could cause permanent damage to our democracy.          
Like just about all bad election ideas these days, this one originated in the White House. Earlier this year, Trump appointees at the Department of Justice sent the Texas governor a letter making the controversial claim that four of the state’s majority-minority districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders. So, in addition to having a special session to deal with issues surrounding the devastating July 4 floods, Abbott added mid-cycle redistricting to the agenda.
Hyper-aware that Trump’s “Wreck it Ralph” approach to governing could cost them in the mid-terms next year, Republican Texas legislators have made it clear that they prioritize following Trump’s marching orders over protecting their constituents from natural disasters. They were called into special session on July 21 and so far, have spent their time on redistricting, not public safety. That speaks volumes about how important line-drawing is to election outcomes. 
Indiana redistricting earns ‘D’ grade in national report card

But it’s extremely disappointing that Democrats in Texas and beyond have decided on a “fight fire with fire” strategy to bolster their chances of winning back the House next year and are encouraging leaders in blue states to draw maps mid-cycle too. The problem with their cynical approach is that it will continue the deep erosion of fair representation caused by partisan gerrymandering and will result in rigged districts across the country.  
Although he has supported an independent redistricting process in the past, Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke said, “We have to be absolutely ruthless about getting back to power.”  
But the danger of fighting gerrymandering with more gerrymandering is a deepening of the already heightened sense of disillusionment that so many voters have today. Gerrymandering reduces voters to pawns and often their response is to refuse to play the game, i.e. not vote.  
Newsom’s plan to lead a mid-cycle redistricting charge in California not only threaten the voting rights and fair representation of voters in that state, it will also undermine the state’s Citizens Redistricting Commission (CRC), which has become the gold standard for a fair redistricting process.  The governor has suggested that the CRC only has authority to redistrict after the federal census and that the state’s General Assembly could draw maps this year. Any effort to subvert the authority of the redistricting commission will be met by litigation, so any changes to California’s congressional map will not come easy, nor should they.  
Indeed, if Texas, California or any other state chooses to redistrict outside the normal parameters, their resulting maps will be challenged by advocacy groups, causing problems and confusion for candidates and voters alike ahead of the critical 2026 elections. Instead of trying to fight fire with fire, politicians should douse the flames of these cynical power grabs by remembering that playing with fire usually ends up with everything burning down.  
Do they really want to torch democracy for short-term electoral advantage?

Thankfully, there doesn’t seem to be any enthusiasm for these games among Indiana’s Republican leadership. And, at the local level, Common Cause Indiana is working with activists and local elected officials in Valparaiso to pass an ordinance to create a bipartisan citizens redistricting commission to draw maps during the 2032 round of local redistricting. We’re expanding this effort to several other cities soon.  
As the overheated rhetoric continues at the national level, it is truly refreshing to work with Hoosiers who understand that the goal should be fair redistricting, not a ruthless power grab.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)National research laboratories in Colorado, Oregon and Washington focused on addressing climate change and its impacts and improving energy efficiency and affordability for Americans would be gutted under budgets proposed by President Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.
The Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, based in Richland, Washington and Portland, Oregon, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, based in Golden, Colorado, would see their funding in the year ahead nearly halved under the Trump administration’s proposed 2026 budget for the U.S. Department of Energy. Lawmakers in both the House and Senate are negotiating spending bills for the next fiscal year that begins in October and will decide on the energy agency’s budget after Sept. 2, when they return from their August recess. 
The national labs are meant to lead research and scientific experimentation in climate and clean energy strategies, including measuring extreme weather risks by collecting and analyzing atmospheric data from around the world and improving battery and grid technologies to get more wind and solar energy flowing to homes and businesses. They also study energy efficiency across U.S. infrastructure and commerce, all of which is meant to save Americans and businesses money and to curb climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Andrea McMakin, a former communications specialist and 34-year veteran of the Northwest Laboratory in Richland, said the U.S. risks losing its best scientists if the proposed funding cuts go through.
McMakin is part of the group Friends of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, which has been raising concerns about the cuts. McMakin said the group learned in June that the lab’s former director told staff in a meeting that up to 1,000 people could be cut if the current budget passes, a number that’s been echoed by state leaders. 
“Those people leave. They have to find jobs someplace. And we’re seeing that a lot of other countries are stepping up their recruiting to get U.S. scientists and engineers,” McMakin said. “We don’t want to see that. We want to keep our energy competitiveness and we want to keep our brain power here in the U.S.”










This administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs.


– U.S. Sen. Patty Murray of Washington


A recent report from Politico cites two sources familiar with U.S. Department of Energy facilities who said up to 1,000 people could be cut from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in Colorado.
Heather Lammers, a spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, said in an email that the lab is talking with the federal energy department to fully understand the impacts of its proposed spending cuts.
The Northwest Laboratory’s public affairs officer, Dawn Zimmerman, did not confirm figures for potential staff cuts and said the U.S. Department of Energy requires all queries involving the federal budget to be directed to its public affairs office. An unnamed energy department spokesperson said in an email that personnel decisions are dictated by the labs directly, not the federal government. 
“The Department of Energy is committed to making the American people’s government more efficient while also growing the output of top-quality science at our national labs,” the spokesperson wrote.
Proposed cuts
Trump proposed in May cutting next year’s budget for the U.S. energy department by about $3.5 billion. Of that, $2.5 billion would be cut from the agency’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy — a 74% reduction from its current budget. 
The Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy office, established following the 1973 oil crisis, in recent years has focused on researching, developing and deploying technologies meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the country’s electricity sector. That technology includes batteries that can hold large amounts of wind and solar power, and white LED light bulbs that require far less energy than incandescent and fluorescent lights.
The budget also cuts 14%, or $1.15 billion, from the department’s Biological and Environmental Research program, meant to collect and analyze climate change data.
Both the Colorado lab and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory get most of their funding from those two programs. But under Trump’s proposed 2026 budget, the Renewable Energy Lab would lose $387 million in funding – more than half of its current budget. 
Lammers, the spokesperson for the National Renewable Energy Lab, said it also receives funding from state and tribal governments and some private industry partners.
“We remain committed to our mission of delivering integrated solutions for an affordable, secure and reliable energy future through research, innovation and strategic collaboration,” she said.
The Northwest National Lab would lose about $280 million, a third of its current budget. 
The lab, which employs more than 5,000 people, is the largest employer in Washington’s Tri-Cities area, which includes Kennewick, Pasco, and Richland, according to the area’s development council.
State lawmakers weigh in
Washington’s U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat, said the Republican budget for the energy department would be a “devastating blow” to the Northwest National Lab.
“Make no mistake: if Trump’s budget request were to become law, it would result in the loss of over 1,000 jobs at PNNL. On top of that, this administration is defying the law right now by redirecting millions of dollars away from wind and solar research and development happening at our national labs — this move alone could force major layoffs at PNNL,” she said in a statement.
Murray, the lead Democrat and vice chair on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she would fight the proposed cuts. 
“President Trump’s budget is dead on arrival in the Senate as far as I’m concerned,” she said. “I’m working to write a bipartisan funding bill that will protect investments in our national labs and save the jobs President Trump is thoughtlessly seeking to eliminate.” 
Oregon’s U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, also a Democrat, said in an email the Republican budget is “anti-science” and will harm clean energy industries gaining traction and growing in parts of the state.
“I just had five town halls in eastern Oregon where wind turbines and solar panels are taking full advantage of renewable energy options that lower prices for consumers and fight the climate crisis,” Wyden said. “That’s but one clear example of how this latest Republican scheme to slash research investments in clean energy would be both nonsense and anti-science.”
Wyden said he voted against confirming oil executive Audrey Robertson as Trump’s appointee for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy at the federal energy agency, in large part because Trump said he wanted to cut renewable energy investments. 
Trump threatened nearly identical cuts for the energy department during his first presidency in 2017, but Congress ultimately ignored the president’s suggested budget for the agency. McMakin said she remembers staff of the Northwest National Lab starting to change the way they talked about their work so they wouldn’t draw Trump’s attention.
“I remember at that time it was like, we have to change. We can’t say ‘atmospheric climate science’ anymore, we have to say ‘earth sciences,’ because it was just one of those language things that if you said climate science or anything about climate you are in danger of getting your funding cut,” she said.

This voting location is one of the most popular in the county. (Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Tuesday’s primary will gauge the political climate in Washington and provide an early forecast of how the makeup of the state Legislature could change this fall.
Nine Democratic state lawmakers, all appointed to their seats, are running to retain them. It’s a larger-than-usual number of legislative contests in an odd-year election cycle and, for Democrats, a lot of seats to defend.
They don’t have to sweat over all of them. Five involve legislators who are unopposed or heavily favored to finish in the top two on Tuesday and advance to the general election.
Those four other match-ups are attracting loads of attention and bountiful spending by candidates and their allies. 
Contests for two Senate seats will be the first test of voters’ views on higher taxes, budget decisions and new laws passed last session by majority Democrats over the objections of Republicans.
Races for two other seats feature intraparty battles exposing and amplifying strains within the Democratic Party among its progressive and centrist forces.
Here are the four races to watch Tuesday.
Republicans’ best hope
Republicans sense the duel in the 26th Legislative District may be their best chance this year for chipping away at Democrats’ 30-19 seat advantage in the state Senate. 
That’s because Democratic Sen. Deb Krishnadasan, a former school board director making her case to voters for the first time as a lawmaker, faces Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier, winner of six straight House races in the district, the last with nearly 55% of the vote.
They are vying to represent the district that encompasses parts of Kitsap and Pierce counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor.
Krishnadasan, who served six years on the Peninsula School District Board of Directors, was among the vulnerable Democrats voting against her party’s major tax bills and transportation revenue package this past session. 
But that hasn’t stopped business- and Republican-backed political committees from spending a little more than a quarter million dollars as of Thursday to tie her to Democrats’ tax hikes. 
They are hammering out a message that the most significant new tax increases fall on businesses, and some Democrats wanted to go further with heftier levies on large companies and wealthy individuals. 
Caldier’s campaigning on the theme that Democrats overreached and reducing their numbers in the Senate is the best means of preventing a recurrence in 2026.
As the only two candidates, both will advance. Why spend so much money now? Each side hopes to get a sense of which issues resonate with voters. And they know winners of primaries generally go on to victory in the general election.
Republicans’ second-best hope
A similar dynamic is at play in the 5th District in east King County.
Victoria Hunt, a Democrat, who easily won a House seat last November, moved to the Senate a few weeks ago following the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos. 
She’s up against an experienced Republican candidate, Chad Magendanz. A former two-term state representative in the district, he ran for Senate last year and lost to Ramos. In 2022, Magendanz tried unsuccessfully to win a House seat.
As in the 26th District race, a major focus is on the new and higher taxes enacted in the 2025 legislative session.
Unlike Krishnadasan, Hunt did vote for the tax bills and has defended her decision to do so. A political committee devoted to electing progressive Democrats has shelled out $40,000 in an independent effort to bolster her candidacy.
On the other side, the state Republican Party and the same business-backed political enterprise at play in the 26th District are behind $210,000 in spending on mailers, texts and digital ads opposing Hunt. 
That’s a change. Those political forces stayed out of the November election as Ramos beat Magendanz by 3,400 votes. The Senate Republican Caucus didn’t lift a financial finger either, but is doing so now. These forces must be feeling something akin to confidence ahead of Tuesday.



The other 5 races 
In Tuesday’s primary, the top two finishers move on to the general election.
In five races, incumbents are either expected to safely scoot through or they are running unopposed.
Reps. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, and Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, each drew two opponents and both are expected to advance.
In the 41st District, Zahn faces Democrat Vinita Kak of Newcastle and Republican John Whitney of Bellevue. In the 48th District, Salahuddin is challenged by Ranga Bondada and Dennis Ellis. 
Three appointed legislators — state Sens. Tina Orwall of Des Moines and Emily Alvarado of Seattle, and Rep. Brianna Thomas of West Seattle — are all unopposed. Orwall serves the 33rd District with Alvarado and Thomas representing the 34th District.  


On to November for two Democrats? Or just one?
The 33rd District is a Democratic stronghold. It is one of the test sites for how progressive the party’s voters are feeling. 
Democratic state Rep. Edwin Obras, a liberal in his first run for office, is facing a spirited challenge from Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling, a moderate Democrat with a couple of local election wins under his belt. Daryl Jones, a Republican, is also on the ballot.
The big question Tuesday is whether enough Democratic voters turn out to advance both of the party’s wannabe torchbearers. A year ago, Republican candidates in this district collected 30% of the vote in the primary, then 31% in the general election. That means it is mathematically doable for both Democratic candidates to make it through to November.
Obras and Schilling, and their supporters, aren’t waiting to chance it. Obras has spent $131,000 to Schilling’s $126,000 and each has been the target of tens of thousands of dollars of hit pieces from independent political committees. 
A third-place finish for Obras on Tuesday means he won’t return to the Legislature in January. 
Big dollar Democratic showdown
Sen. Vandana Slatter, of Bellevue, and Rep. Amy Walen, of Kirkland, are squaring off in an expensive Democrat-versus-Democrat grudge match in the 48th District, where both enjoy broad support among its voters in Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
Already $700,000 has been shelled out collectively by the candidates and independently-run campaigns of their allies. With both women assured of moving on, all those dollars are about educating voters on some of their differences.
Slatter is the progressive, Walen the business-friendly moderate. The two voted similarly on many bills last session, but differed on a few of the marquee policies. 
Both opposed a bill containing an across-the-board increase in the business tax and surcharges on the state’s largest corporations and financial institutions. And both supported another key component of the $9.4 billion tax package that extends the retail sales tax to some services.
Slatter voted for a gas tax increase. Walen did not. Walen opposed the new rent increase cap. Slatter voted for it.
With no Republican in the running, differences on policies like those could motivate GOP voters to engage. But ultimately, this race will be a barometer of how Democratic and independent voters are feeling. Most have cast ballots for both candidates before and now must choose one.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_0189-Large-e1722992752713-1024x728.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 07:57:10.850049

The companies have opposed such moves. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Business groups, gig workers, and freelancers are fighting what they say is the state’s latest attempt to limit the availability of independent contractor status that they say gives workers and businesses needed flexibility.
The opposition targets proposed regulations from the New Jersey Department of Labor that would regulate an examination, called the ABC test, that the state uses to determine whether workers are employees entitled to unemployment, family leave, and disability benefits — or are independent contractors not required to pay into the funds that fuel those benefits.
The Murphy administration has previously characterized companies’ push to classify some workers as independent contractors as one that denies employees benefits required by law. Labor officials’ proposed regulations would ensnare some companies like Uber and Lyft that have fought efforts to classify their drivers as employees.
Kim Kavin is a freelance writer and co-founder of Fight for Freelancers, a group that helped defeat a 2019 bill that would have altered New Jersey’s ABC test.
“This is more of the same. It’s all part and parcel of the same campaign that has been waged for years now trying to restrict independent contracting, and it needs to stop,” Kavin said.
To be marked as an independent contractor, a worker must pass all three prongs of the ABC test, which measures whether a worker is free of their employers’ control, whether a worker’s work is performed outside a firm’s regular course or place of business, and whether a worker is engaged in business independent of a given firm.
Officials could adopt the new proposal after an extended public comment period closes on Aug. 6, with or without changes.
Fighting for workers?
The proposal’s most substantive changes are confined to the test’s second prong, which weighs whether a worker’s services are done outside the usual course or place of an employer’s business.
Examples included in the rules proposal’s text would designate ride-share drivers’ vehicles as a place of business for the companies they drive for. Because workers must meet all three prongs of the ABC test to be classed as independent contractors, that example would require ride-share drivers to be treated as employees.
New Jersey has for years insisted those drivers are employees entitled to benefits and argued they and their employers are liable for unemployment, temporary disability, and family leave payroll taxes.
Uber in 2022 paid New Jersey $100 million to resolve claims of more than $600 million in unpaid taxes and interest the state said were owed due to worker misclassification between 2014 and 2018. The amount owed was reduced after the firm gave the state access to more records, and Uber maintains its employees are independent contractors.
New Jersey last year alleged Lyft, another ride-share company, owed the state $17 million in payroll taxes unpaid due to misclassification. Lyft, like Uber, maintains that its drivers are independent contractors under the ABC test and that its role is limited to acting as a platform that connects drivers with passengers.
Ride-share companies have typically prevailed in lawsuits challenging their drivers’ independent contractor classifications, though the question has not been thoroughly tested in New Jersey courts.
Roughly 20 state legislators spanning both parties have expressed concerns about the rules proposal, including that it may go beyond the statutes and case law governing worker classification. The group, which is growing, includes chairs of the Senate labor, commerce, transportation, and legislative oversight committees.

Democratic legislators in the 18th District said in a Thursday letter to Labor Commissioner Robert Asaro-Angelo that classifying workers should be the job of lawmakers, not state regulators.
“The question of how to classify workers has been considered repeatedly by the Legislature, and similar efforts to change the standard through statute have not gained approval. The decision to implement such a major policy change through regulation, rather than legislation, risks creating confusion among both workers and employers,” the letter reads.
Sen. Pat Diegnan and Assemblymen Sterley Stanley and Robert Karabinchak, all Middlesex County Democrats, added their “concerns with the proposed rule are wide-ranging and substantive.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Labor declined to comment on criticism of the rules proposal. In a summary attached to the proposal, the department said it is merely codifying practices stemming from statute and case law that labor commissioners have employed for years.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat in the final months of his second term, established a task force in 2018 to examine misclassification.
“Hardworking New Jersey workers should not be kept from receiving the pay and benefits they deserve,”  Murphy said last month to mark the sixth anniversary of the task force’s report. “Protecting our workers has always been a top priority of our administration as we maintain a strong and fair economy. We’ll keep fighting against those who exploit and cheat them.”
A ‘huge concern’ for businesses
Other changes in the proposal would classify customers’ homes as a place of business for drywall installers, limiting their ability to employ independent contractors to install drywall; name caddies working for country clubs as employees; and say truck drivers working for a trucking company may be classed as employees.
Elissa Frank, vice president of government affairs for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, said the state’s plan would create “employment relationships that don’t currently exist.”
“Those people under the examples that are cited in the rule are currently serving under independent contractor status,” said Frank. “That’s a huge concern because it’s hitting at the flexibility of the business.”
Planned changes to the ABC test’s second prong note that workers outside of a firm’s normal course of business — say, someone hired to clean a dentist’s office — could still be classified as independent contractors.
Other portions of the state’s proposal offer fewer changes but have nonetheless alarmed freelancers and business groups.
The proposal would add a non-exhaustive list of criteria to determine whether an employer controls or directs an individual’s work. That list includes questions like whether the business requires the individual to work set hours, use specific tools, or wear a particular uniform, among several others. 
Some have worried the list’s non-exhaustive nature — meaning officials can consider factors not listed there — would create uncertainty among contractors.
“I wouldn’t say it’s a substantive change, but the fact that it’s non-exhaustive is a difference to the existing standard,” Frank said, adding it could lower the bar to classify independent contractors as employees.
Courts use those criteria when adjudicating misclassification cases.
In Carpet Remnant Warehouse v. Department of Labor, a 1991 New Jersey Supreme Court decision on worker misclassification cited in the rules proposal, justices found carpet installers that did jobs for a carpet sales business were not under the business’ control because the installers could determine the means of installation, freely choose — or not choose — from the business’s posted jobs, and work for the business’s competitors, among other factors. 
The test’s final prong measures whether a worker is engaged in “independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.” It typically measures whether an individual’s business would survive the loss of income stemming from the end of a relationship with one business.
There, too, the proposal adds a non-exhaustive list that includes factors like how many clients the individual has, how their income breaks out among clients, and the individual’s investment in their own tools and equipment, among several other factors courts use when adjudicating misclassification cases.
Frank said the proposal would make some bona fide independent contractors vulnerable to employee classification, raising the hypothetical of a heating, ventilation, and cooling technician who incorporates her own firm, secures her own tools and insurance, and gathers jobs from several clients — including one she works with frequently.
The frequent client’s workload, a lack of employees at the technician’s firm, and her lack of office space could make the hypothetical contractor vulnerable to an employee classification she would not seek, Frank said.
“This hypothetical shows how the proposed rule shifts the bar from functional independence to structural perfection — penalizing legitimate small businesses that don’t have the scale or resources to meet every new evidentiary factor,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are working to lessen the impact of medical debt on their constituents.
They are advocating for increased state regulations to protect people that have incurred medical debt and to ensure greater pricing transparency from hospitals in the state ahead of medical procedures.
Over a third of U.S. adults face debt from medical or dental bills. The debt is one of the leading causes of bankruptcy in the country, according to a report from the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation supporting independent health care research. The report found that medical debt greatly affects both insured and uninsured individuals and the fear of incurring debt often deters Americans from seeking care.

Oklahoma Senate Bill 889 requires hospitals to make the cost of their “most usable” services transparent to patients so they’re aware of the cost, said Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, the bill author. 
The measure was signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt and will be in effect Nov. 1. 
“If this is implemented across the United States, it could save billions of dollars in health care costs,” Murdock said. 
The new law has “teeth” because providers could face penalties for noncompliance, and hospitals will be more inclined to comply with transparency rules if there’s potential financial impact, Murdock said.
Oklahoma’s State Department of Health is charged with overseeing compliance. 
The agency is “actively preparing,” said agency spokesperson Erica Rankin. There are no anticipated additional costs for implementing the law, she said, and while details are not finalized, the department is confident it will be fully compliant. 
In a similar effort, House Bill 4148, authored by Rep. Suzanne Schreiber, D-Tulsa, and signed into law in 2024, requires debt collectors to submit evidence of a hospital’s compliance with price transparency rules before filing to collect on medical debts from patients of the institution. 
The Oklahoma Hospital Association is supportive of greater price transparency, said Rich Rasmussen, CEO and president of the group, but overburdensome regulations can affect hospital operations. 
“We don’t want to be noncompliant with any requirement placed on us, but oftentimes, when a state comes in after the federal government has made a policy decision and decides to do something on their own, it creates that noncompliance,” he said. “And that’s what we want to avoid.”
Rasmussen pointed to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which lists which U.S. hospitals have faced civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with federal price transparency regulations. No Oklahoma hospital has faced a penalty, according to the list.
  Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, asks questions about a bill on the Senate floor on May 5. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)
The Hospital Association has gone beyond what’s required by federal law to standardize reporting, Rasmussen said. 
“We began an effort to bring all of our hospitals together on a very broad what we call our community benefit project,” he said. “We have worked together with hospitals all across the state to arrive at, for those who are uninsured or underinsured, what hospitals can do to ensure that if they are eligible for our free or discounted care, that that would be the same measurement that is used across the state.”
Rasmussen said Congress cutting billions in Medicaid dollars will have a domino effect of impacts. 
Hospitals may cut services, forcing patients to travel or not receive care at all. Other Oklahomans will be kicked off Medicaid and have to find coverage elsewhere. 
“We can’t cut our way out of $6.3 billion of Medicaid reductions,” Rasmussen said. 
Rasmussen said he’d like to see greater pricing transparency from insurers, not just providers. Oklahomans with insurance don’t know how much their hospital bills will be and insurers aren’t transparent enough about out-of-pocket costs, he said. 
The Commonwealth Fund’s report found that while insured patients are less likely to owe medical debt than the uninsured, about a third of adults insured through employers still incur debt. 
Oklahoma lacks medical debt protections in place in other states, including no limits on interest rates, credit reporting, and wage garnishments related to medical debt, according to the report.
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, and Rep. Forrest Bennett, D-Oklahoma City, introduced similar measures during the 2025 session to help minimize the impact of medical debt by prohibiting it from impacting credit scores. Boren and Bennett authored Senate Bill 519 and House Bill 1709, respectively. 
Neither bill advanced from its chamber of origin or forgives medical debt. Both lawmakers said they were interested in pursuing the legislation again when they return next session.

“What I found through representing clients, even some young people, is that the credit rating really is a barrier to finding housing,” Boren said. “And because we have so much medical debt, it’s compromising people’s credit rating, and then it creates a housing issue. So what this bill does is prevent reporting by collection agencies to credit reporting agencies medical debt. It doesn’t prevent the collection of the debt. It just prevents the harm to someone’s credit rating.”
Bennett’s bill specifies that for medical debt to not be reported on someone’s credit, it must be incurred from lifesaving or emergency care. 
The House lawmaker said his bill was prompted by wanting to codify a Biden era rule into state law. 
He said banks were concerned that his bill would prevent them from seeing the “whole picture” behind a consumer before loaning money. Bennett said he’s willing to work with the banking industry on his bill, as long as the integrity of the measure remains intact. 
“As much as I like this idea and want to pursue it, we are tinkering around the edges of a major issue,” Bennett said. “And the reality is, we need an overhaul of the health care industry in America and we’re limited at the state level of what we can do.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Immigration arrests and detentions in Idaho sharply increased in 2025, following trends across the U.S. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrests in Idaho increased 797% in 2025 from the same time period in 2024, according to an Idaho Capital Sun review of ICE data collected by the Deportation Data Project. The project is led by attorneys and professors from multiple states who obtain public data sets through Freedom of Information Act requests. 
From Jan. 1, 2024, to June 26, 2024, there were 41 reported arrests by ICE agents in Idaho, the data shows. For that time period in 2025, there were 368 arrests. 
Idaho in 2024 and part of 2025 had certified the Elmore County and Jefferson County jails as federal immigration detention centers. From Jan. 1, 2024, to June 26, 2024, there were 65 reported ICE detentions in both of those facilities. For that period in 2025, there were 416 detentions, which is a 540% increase.  
The number of detentions in the first six months of 2025 was more than double the number of detentions recorded for all of 2024.
“We’ve seen an increased number of calls, typically from loved ones whose loved one has been detained,” said Chris Christensen, a Boise immigration attorney. “We have seen a lot more immigration holds … and we’ve also seen a lot more aggressive tactics used by local ICE.” 
Christensen, who has worked in various areas of immigration law since 2009, said he was aware of three recent incidents where ICE agents broke the window of a vehicle to remove someone inside. 
The ages of those detained in Idaho ranged from 18 to 64 years old. 


 Definitions of common immigration terms

ICE arrest: Immigration officials locate and apprehend someone they suspect is in the U.S. illegally. These do not always lead to detentions.
Detention: Some people arrested by ICE agents are detained in facilities such as a county jail or federal detention center.
Immigration hold: ICE may be notified if an inmate in a local jail or prison is likely in the country illegally and will ask the local law enforcement to hold the inmate beyond their release date and transfer custody to immigration authorities.


The youngest people arrested in Idaho were a 6-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy, both from Peru. The two children were arrested at the same time as a 33-year-old woman on Jan. 28 in the Twin Falls area. There is no record showing the woman and children were detained. 
Christensen said in a February meeting with ICE agents in Idaho, local immigration lawyers were told that the agency tries to avoid detaining minors because there is nowhere to hold them in Idaho. Many of those arrested in southern Idaho end up going to a detention facility in Las Vegas, Christensen said. 
The share of those arrested who had criminal convictions declined in 2025 from the year prior. 
Of the arrests made this year, 250, or nearly 68%, of all arrests, were of people with criminal convictions. There were 84 arrests of those with “pending charges,” and 34 people with “other immigration violations,” according to the data. 
In 2024, 34 of the 41 arrests were of those with a criminal conviction, or 82%, and five were of those with pending charges. 
 ICE arrests are up across the U.S., many without prior criminal convictions 

Nationwide, the share of immigrants with criminal convictions has declined overall since January, Stateline reported. From January to late-June, ICE has made nearly 112,000 arrests, and 40% of them were of convicted criminals, the outlet reported. For the same time period in 2024, 53% of the approximately 51,000 arrests were of those with criminal convictions.
Arrests in Washington state rose 35% in the first five months of Donald Trump’s presidency, the Washington State Standard reported, with 782 arrests in 2025 compared to 581 the same period last year. 
Trump administration officials have stated a goal of 3,000 immigration arrests per day; the current average is 711 as of June, the Stateline analysis of data found.

For those who have been in the U.S. for less than two years, officials under the current administration are using a process called expedited removal, Christensen said, which means they may be deported without the opportunity to see an immigration judge. 
As of July, ICE issued a new policy that required those arrested by the agency to remain in detention while challenging their removal, NPR reported. The policy was challenged in court Monday in a class action lawsuit. 
Christensen said this policy reverses a longtime interpretation of the law that allowed those who were considered a low or no threat to the community and a low flight risk to bond out of detention while their case went on in court. 
“Personally, I think it’s the Trump administration using detention to wear immigrants down,” Christensen said. “If you’ve never been in jail before, and you are locked up in an ICE detention facility — which don’t get me wrong, looks exactly like a jail and feels exactly like a jail — people are pretty inclined to give up hope, and maybe give up on their case and return to where they’re from.” 
 Idaho’s law requires cooperation with immigration authorities 

Through a law passed this year and an executive order by Idaho Gov. Brad Little, the state’s regulations largely require cooperation with immigration authorities. 
Idaho State Police partners with ICE to deport inmates without authorization to be in U.S.

On Feb. 18, Little issued an order requiring Idaho State Police and all state agencies to collaborate fully with federal immigration authorities. The order also directed the state’s prison and parole systems to confirm immigration status prior to releasing incarcerated individuals. 
The Idaho Legislature this year also passed House Bill 83, which created new state-level immigration crimes and required cooperation among local authorities and federal agencies for enforcement. 
The ACLU of Idaho challenged the law in court, arguing it superseded the federal government’s authority to enforce federal crimes, the Sun reported. 
A federal judge temporarily blocked the portion of the law that would’ve created state crimes for illegal entry and illegal re-entry, but District Judge Amanda Brailsford did allow the parts of the bill requiring cooperation to go into effect. 
In June, Idaho State Police announced it would enter into an agreement with ICE to assist with transporting undocumented immigrants from Idaho jails to ICE detention facilities. Under the agreement, the state police agreed to spend up to $300,000 for 100 transports, the Sun reported. 
Little supported the effort by utilizing his office’s Emergency Fund to reimburse state police for personnel. 
“Idaho is stepping up to help the Trump administration transport dangerous illegal alien criminals to ICE facilities instead of being released back into our communities,” Little said in a written statement June 5.
There have been no transports under this agreement as of June 30, an ISP spokesperson told the Sun.

The options available to someone who’s been arrested by ICE are different in every case, Christensen said. 
“I think (immigration law) is the most complex body of law out there,” he said. 
The factors at play include a prior criminal history, community ties, the person’s “flight risk,” and others, he said. For those afraid to return to their country of origin, they could apply for asylum or protection under the international human rights treaty, the Convention Against Torture. Some may qualify for protection under the Violence Against Women Act. 
Christensen said he’s also been receiving calls from people who are in the country lawfully, but who fear that may be revoked. His office has additionally seen an increased scrutiny and slower processing of green card applications. 
“I think there is an assault on immigration at all levels,” Christensen said.

“[It’s] a safe way to release some pent up aggression and frustrations. Because we live, I swear, just in a constant state of anxiety with the news and just all the chaos,” Melissa Hagen, 44, said. 
Hagen said she was not a frequent protestor but had gone to the No Kings protest in June. “In my generation, or my lifetime, I have not encountered the environment to feel the need to get out. But, I mean, it’s just too much,” she said. 
The sources of frustration were varied — immigration policy, abortion rights, Environmental Protection Agency cuts and Epstein were just a few of the topics discussed by speakers and attendees.

The goal of the protest, beyond venting frustrations, was also to inspire action. Tables from local organizations were standing by for those interested in volunteering. Organizers handed out information with resources for food pantries, housing and work support. 
“It’s just a moment where we need to come together with as many people as we can.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)Hats off to the Oklahoma Ethics Commission, which over the course of the past few months has seemingly transformed itself from a toothless shih tzu into an aggressive, but well-trained pitbull that’s going for the jugular.
For years, the agency and its governing board inspired about as much fear as a cute baby bunny would into the state employees, lobbyists and political candidates that they were supposed to hold accountable. 
The body had also demonstrated a propensity for secrecy, which kept the public in the dark about what they were doing. In 2023, Attorney General Gentner Drummond accused the public board of violating the state Open Meeting Act by discussing the candidate qualifications and details of the search process for their next executive director behind closed doors.
But in recent months something — or someone — has knocked the board’s rose-colored glasses askew, and politicians, lobbyists and statewide political campaigns have been in for a rude awakening. Democrats and Republicans are suddenly discovering they’re dealing with a board that has plenty of teeth and is willing to fight for Oklahomans, consequences be damned.
It’s been an inspiring sight to behold following years of lackluster performance.
In the past few months, Republican State Superintendent Ryan Walters agreed to pay an $18,300 settlement in connection with an improper transfer of funds for a school board election in Jenks and a $5,000 penalty for using his state social media account for personal reasons. Shelley Zumwalt, who once served as a Cabinet secretary for Gov. Kevin Stitt, agreed to pay a $20,000 fine and not to hold any position funded with state dollars for two years to resolve an ethics case involving contracts awarded to a firm her husband worked at. The Commission entered into a settlement agreement with Rep. Ajay Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, to pay the agency $35,000 for a variety of ethics issues related spending campaign funds.
Earlier this month, the Commission disclosed that they’re planning to open another formal investigation into Pittman and will pursue the case in court after she missed payments.
They’ve also disclosed that they’re pursuing a case against the Gamefowl Commission on accusations that it violated financial disclosure rules. The group had been lobbying to reduce the penalty for cockfighting from a felony to a misdemeanor.
Oklahomans appear to finally have the type of board they’ve long deserved and hoped for since 1990 when they voted to create the Ethics Commission and enshrine it into the state’s Constitution so that lawmakers couldn’t abolish it.
I suspect this unexpected about-face is in large part due to Lee Ann Bruce Boone, who in 2024 became the agency’s fourth director. Her predecessor, Ashley Kemp, resigned amid her claims that lawmakers underfunded the agency, making it difficult to enforce compliance.
Kemp probably was correct. Lawmakers for obvious reasons benefit from weak ethics enforcement, and they haven’t really done the agency any favors with funding. Legislators allocated the commission $2.3 million, which is slightly less than they received in the 2025 budget year, according to budgeting documents. It’s also about 36% less than the agency said it actually needs.
But Bruce Boone and the five-member appointed commission she works with have plowed ahead undeterred, holding people accountable for campaign and ethics violations.
But the commission isn’t only aiming to punish. It is moving with an appropriate sense of urgency to consider whether Oklahoma’s elected officials can use campaign funds to cover the cost of security. The request from the state’s top legislative leaders follows the June assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband at their home in Brooklyn Park. They’re hoping to have an opinion crafted before they next meet Aug. 14.
This is the same agency that previously took more than a year to approve a new policy that allows elected officials and candidates to use funds on child care and other caregiving expenses. That change was proposed under Bruce Boone’s predecessor, but the Commission didn’t act on it for months. It took so long, that state Sen. Jessica Garvin, the Republican lawmaker and parent who requested it, had already lost reelection and couldn’t benefit.   
The board has also been transparent about the outcome of its investigations where there aren’t findings of ethics violations, which is a refreshing change. In addition to sending a signal to the public that the board is taking ethics investigations seriously, such disclosure also benefits those officials who are cleared of wrongdoing.
Oklahoma Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett is one who benefited from this transparency. In May, the Commission cleared the Republican of a conflict of interest allegation stemming from Hiett’s decision to continue to vote on utility rate hikes despite accusations of drunken behavior at a Minnesota regulatory conference.
Perhaps the Commission’s newfound enthusiasm highlights how critical it is that our state leaders pick the correct people to serve on boards and commissions. Because a state agency can only be as good as the board that helps govern it.
The governor, attorney general, Senate president, House speaker and state Supreme Court chief justice each select one of the five board members. The board hires the agency head.
Now perhaps, Oklahomans finally have the right expertise at the helm and a board with the fire to do right by the integrity of the ethics rules they’re supposed to be protecting.
Here’s hoping this board isn’t a one-hit wonder, and they and their successors continue this watchdog mentality for years to come.

Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.
After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

In a landscape where print media has been rapidly eroding, Shawn Houck adds a product with Oil City Weekly. In the process, he’s coming full circle.
The post He helms Casper’s top digital news site. Now he’s jumping into the print game. appeared first on WyoFile .","CASPER—Oil City Weekly didn’t quite make its deadline today. 
The weekly’s sister product, Oil City News, has been a digital-only publication for more than a decade, so the staff is well-versed in churning out news. But posting an article and photos online is a whole different affair than shoehorning that same article along with several other stories, letters to the editor, obituaries, advertisements and a sprawling events calendar into 12 printed pages. And just two weeks into the endeavor, staff was still ironing out the process.
“We’re trying to work from going from online to print, as opposed to print to online,” Shawn Houck, the publisher and owner of Oil City Weekly, said from his Casper office that Wednesday afternoon in July. “So we’re trying to find our process.”
Despite the production manager shipping the file to the Douglas press 30 minutes late, Houck’s team remained on schedule to print and deliver the second edition of Casper’s brand-new newspaper the following day. 
The accomplishment marked a small landmark for Houck and the team. One edition is just a newspaper. But with the second edition, he said, “we are now officially a weekly.”
In a media landscape where local news has been rapidly eroding for more than a decade, creating a new print product may raise some eyebrows. Plenty of people warned Houck against what they see as a risky venture, he said. 
But the Casper native isn’t new to building things from scratch or experimenting with media iterations. Along with starting several companies, he owns Oil City News, a site in the vein of the hyper-local websites that began proliferating across the internet around 2010. 
Creating a print publication isn’t new for him either. Houck launched a zine as a college student in the ‘90s. It was a popular pastime then, a punk rock gesture of free expression. 
In a way, Oil City Weekly is punk rock too. It’s a clear step away from the internet that has utterly consumed daily life in 2025. To sit down with a newspaper and read about historic buildings or city council meetings without distractions popping up on screen is to defy the always-online status that has become commonplace. 
“I think there’s nothing more punk rock than embracing this format,” Houck said, “and trying to think about it in a way that will work for today’s news environment.”

Readers, he added, are jazzed to see Casper restored to a two-newspaper town. 
“They’re saying things like, ‘thanks for bringing the newspaper back,’” he said. “We’re not bringing the newspaper back. We’re just distributing it in a different way.”
Back to the roots of print 
Houck is a Casper native, the oldest of six children who grew up in the wind-swept central Wyoming city. He has the wiry build of a marathon runner and the frenetic energy of an ideas guy. His work experience is a blend of advertising, media and upstarts. 
While studying English at the University of Wyoming, Houck enrolled in journalism courses. Outside of the classroom, he published a zine, calling it the 630 Chimichanga — named after his dorm room in White Hall. The small tabloid started as a platform for inside jokes shared among his friends. 
“It was just things we thought were funny,” he said. But over time, it grew to include CD reviews, feature articles, political commentary and regular contributor content. 
He discovered he enjoyed the ad and design side of journalism. After graduating, he started an advertising agency called AdBay and spent many years helming it. 
An admitted serial entrepreneur, Houck had other enterprises percolating. He sold ads to movie theaters around the state, co-owned The Casper Cutthroats baseball team and launched Frontier Brewery, which he still co-owns. In 2020, he sold Adbay and launched Upslope Media. 
Along the way, he acquired Oil City News in 2016, and now also publishes Cap City News in Cheyenne and County 17 in Gillette. That put him in the thick of the hyper-local digital sites that sprouted up to help cover incremental and breaking news in small towns or even neighborhoods. The trend was seen as an effort to fill news holes as traditional newspapers downsized or shifted more coverage to national syndicated wire reporting. It coincided with a rise in social media and represented a way for people to get their news for free.

And it wasn’t always good for journalism, Houck realizes now. 
Longer features and deeper dives faded with the rise of bite-sized news, he said, and daily newspapers took a hit. He also came to realize that digital-first practices like publishing arrest reports only partially tell the story. Oil City News no longer does that. 
“So our understanding of what it means to do it right has changed quite a bit in the 10 years that I’ve been involved with the organization,” he said. 
Oil City News also strives now not to cherry-pick coverage based on what may be “clickbait,” he said. For example, staff makes an effort to cover every item on the city council agenda, not just the controversial ones. 
With a growing team and more sophisticated approach, he said, Oil City has been feeling ready to take another step. 
“We’ve been wanting to do a newspaper for many, many years,” he said. “We saw there was a need for it in our community, and we also saw an opportunity to advertise so that we could better support reporters.”
Offline by design
Casper has a rich history of journalism. It’s home to Wyoming’s largest print newspaper, the Casper Star-Tribune, which traces back more than a century. In its heyday, the paper had a bureau in Washington, D.C, and dozens of editorial staffers. It also had a competitor: The Casper Journal, a free weekly. 
The Star-Tribune acquired the Journal in 2004 and published it until 2022, when it was discontinued. That left a hole in the local newscape, Houck said: the free, community-focused weekly. 
Houck hopes to occupy that role. Oil City Weekly intends to be 100% local — no national or even state news. From the advertising side, he added, it’s a way to expand the offering of Upslope Media. 
Wyoming news veterans like Dan Neal are happy to see the new product.

“We need local news, and that’s where Oil City is focused,” said Neal, a Casper journalist who worked at the Star-Tribune from 1981-2004. “Staff at the Star-Tribune is working hard, but, you know, they’re limited, and so I think it’s great that Oil City is going to take reporting that has already been going online, and getting it in a physical format where people could find it around town, in coffee shops and places like that.”
Competition is healthy in journalism, Neal said. It pushes outlets to be better, faster and more accurate.
Creating a new print product in this internet age can be seen as questionable. And some people warned Houck against it. But, he said, Oil City has a deep understanding of social media and digital news, and he thinks starting from that foundation will be advantageous. Plus, he really believes Casper readers will embrace Oil City Weekly. 
“It just feels right,” Houck said. 
Full circle
Oil City News churns up a lot of content for the website; the staff couldn’t possibly fit it all into the weekly paper, Houck said. To determine what goes into the print product, he said, they will follow two guiding principles. 
First, “we know there’s a lot of important news that we’re covering, primarily things like elected boards, city councils, things like that.” But, he said, internet algorithms don’t often push those stories, favoring instead more sensational headlines. So those stories will take priority — stories about school-board decisions, city development, new businesses.
“We want to provide news to the community that we think is important for them to understand and know about,” he said.

The second principle for determining content is a direct response to readers, he said, who consistently ask for event listings. With that in mind, Oil City Weekly has an extensive calendar of events designed to be pulled out for ease of use. 
Readers also want physical copies of certain types of stories, Houck said, like obituaries, marriage announcements, business stories. Those, too, will be published in the weekly.
Houck used some of his own marketing savvy for the paper’s debut. In early July, Oil City staff and friends dressed up as newsies and marched in the Central Wyoming Fair and Rodeo Parade in Casper, handing out fresh copies of the first edition to readers. It was fun to see the crowd’s response, he said. 
Holding the physical paper in his hands, he added, “feels awesome.” 
It also reminds him of another time. 
“It’s funny, I found my old zine,” he said. “And I put them side by side. And we’re basically doing the same thing I was doing 20-plus years ago. It’s the feature, it’s the events calendar, it’s a little bit of the cheeky attitude. It’s all those things that haven’t really changed much.”

Decade of data helps illuminate deer family dynamics, offering possible solutions to history of decline.
The post Runs in the family: Study shows most mule deer learn to migrate from moms appeared first on WyoFile .","One early summer day in 2018, in the southern end of the Wyoming Range, a mule deer doe told her 1-year-old fawn to scram. 
The young one did. But she didn’t linger around the mountain meadows where she had been born, like other yearlings kicked to the metaphorical curb by their birthing mothers. Perhaps out of a wandering spirit, or teenage petulance, F210, as she is known, went out on her own. 
Far out. 
In fact, she spent a month making a 120-mile trek out and back over mountains and through foothills in country she’d never seen. Maybe she was one of those deer paving a new migratory route, researchers thought. Or she was looking for somewhere better than where her mother and grandmother and great-grandmother trekked. 
Or maybe she was just in a mood. 
Because by mid-summer, F210 returned to her natal summer range and then in the fall walked diligently back along her mother’s migratory route to their winter range. She then spent the rest of her life making the same migration as her mom, back and forth, back and forth, never to return to that early foray. 
F210’s story joins the catalogue of narratives built by a decade of mule deer collar information in the Wyoming Range. And through millions of data points covering hundreds of deer’s lives, former University of Wyoming researcher Rhiannon Jakopak was able to uncover some truths: More than 60% of mule deer really do learn their migratory paths from their mothers.

Researchers have, for many years, believed that to be true. But it took a massive dataset following the same deer and their fawns year after year to prove the point, which also includes a caveat: Some deer don’t do what their moms tell them. 
The information, which was published earlier this month in the journal Current Biology, gives both a warning and a shred of hope for struggling mule deer numbers, said Kevin Monteith, the University of Wyoming professor who helped start the Wyoming Range project. 
Deer follow their mothers’ paths because they provide the best blueprint for survival. Lose established migratory routes, and we lose the backbone of large mule deer herds, he said. But some deer will forge on their own, and while researchers have yet to determine the success of those wayfinders, the explorers offer some promise that herds can eventually rebuild. 
A decade of data
UW researchers, along with Wyoming Game and Fish biologists, and U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management experts, began in 2013 placing collars on mule deer in the Wyoming Range as part of a larger project to understand mule deer numbers and their continued decline. The Wyoming Range herd historically numbered as high as 50,000, but the herd for years had languished at around 30,000 before the bad winter of 2022-23 plummeted the population to just over 13,000. 
Biologists, managers, hunters and outfitters blamed everything from diseases and habitat issues to harsh winters and predators. Without concrete evidence gained from years of collaring fawns and their mothers, then following up on each death, no one could really know for sure. 
So the Monteith shop began collecting that data. And it was no easy feat, Jakopak said.

Dozens of collars went out in 2015, only for the bad winter of 2017 to hit, killing most of the fawns in the study. The same scenario happened again in 2019 and again in 2023 when many of the deer in the study cohort keeled over. 
“There were so many mother-daughter pairs to start out with in the summer and by the fall only a handful were left,” Jakopak said. “And they still had to make it through the winter.”
But after a decade, researchers ended up being able to follow 16 deer and their offspring over the course of their lives. From that data, Jakopak found 11 deer adopted their moms’ routes, including some fawns who gave birth to their own offspring within yards of where they were born. But five did not follow their moms, which was maybe even more of a surprise to Jakopak. 
“We speak with such certainties with deer,” she said. “But if we’re so certain about something, we don’t leave the potential to discover what is unexpected but true.”
Hope in the wanderers
This story isn’t just about interesting mule deer family dynamics, though. The data could help biologists and land managers find a piece of the solution to declining mule deer numbers, Monteith said. 
Because now researchers know the importance of inheriting a mother’s path. Unlike elk, who will often change migratory routes based on bad weather, a new housing development, a road or an impenetrable fence, mule deer stay faithful. That faithfulness is likely a product of what the migration corridor offers, including the best access to nutritious groceries, good stopover points and an avoidance of possible threats. Once deer find those paths, they stick to them, reproducing, introducing their fawns to the routes, and passing along the secret to longevity.

If we fragment established migration routes with a subdivision, energy field, highway or tall fence, they could lose that knowledge.
The potential bright spot comes in the form of deer who don’t follow mom and instead wander off on their own, said Jill Randall, Game and Fish’s big game migration coordinator. 
If those deer find suitable alternatives, it is possible for herds to rebuild using new, less broken routes. 
“Our climate is changing, and our landscapes are changing,” Randall said. “Maybe a fact that a number of individuals in the population show that diversity and variety prove some adaptability on a population level.”
But that also means managers must look more broadly at landscapes and consider how to conserve larger swaths than just the linear migration route. Because if we want to build back our herds, Monteith said, land managers must first protect the routes that exist for deer like F210, then also consider the bigger picture.

Forcing Mike Lee to drop his public land sale proposal merits celebration, but history signals the fight is far from over, writes guest columnist Chris Madson. 
The post The assault on public lands has a long, sad history with no end in sight. appeared first on WyoFile .","So, under pressure from hundreds of thousands of Americans, Utah’s land-grabbing Sen. Mike Lee withdrew his proposal to put the nation’s public domain up for sale. Much justifiable celebration has ensued. Largely lost in the outcry over his provision in the Big Beautiful Bill Act was an announcement by Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins: The Department of Agriculture is rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule that has prohibited road construction and timbering on 58.5 million acres of national forest.

Opinion

Rollins brought her vast experience with federal lands from her home in Texas to Washington, D.C., where she served as a minor functionary in the first Trump administration and later as the co-founder of a D.C. lobbying group, America First Policy Institute. What she knows about the issues surrounding federal land use could be comfortably contained in a thimble. 
Her order was a canny political move, since it’s likely to split the constituency that voiced outrage over the outright sale of federal land. A substantial part of that opposition came from users of ATVs, snowmobiles and other vehicles designed to move people into the backcountry with minimal sweat. Many will be happy to hear a huge swath of federal land is now open to motor vehicles.
Even more will be alarmed. Backpackers and other wilderness aficionados prefer their forests roadless. So do many big game hunters, since elk, mule deer and bighorn sheep shy away from roads, even the seldom-used two-tracks that wind their way through the public domain. The first step in planning a big-game hunt on federal land is to spread out a map and look for the places the roads don’t go — those are the places big game is likely to be found, especially after the opening morning of the season.
I mention this proposal for a couple of reasons. First, if it isn’t quickly rescinded, it will have dire consequences for those of us who prefer to maintain some places only a horse or boot leather can take us. Over decades of debate, we’ve struck a balance between motorized access on national forests and the unique character of true backcountry. I’m not surprised that a president whose idea of wilderness is the rough on a golf course appointed a woman who comes from one of the most fenced-in, jealously guarded, privately held states in the nation to oversee a system of federal lands that is a powerful symbol of freedom for tens of millions of Americans. Not surprised, just deeply disappointed. 
The second reason I raise this matter is to consider the way it fits in the fight over federal land, a fight that started almost as soon as Yellowstone, the nation’s first national park, was set aside in 1872. In the years that followed that unprecedented action, powerful economic interests in the West started a campaign to get control of the park, maneuvering to build a rail line in Montana from Gardiner to Cooke City, slicing off the northern and western edges of the park in the process. One of the park’s first superintendents, Robert E. Carpenter, was fired when his part in the scheme came to light.
In 1891, President Benjamin Harrison created America’s first forest reserve, a huge tract of high-country timber east of Yellowstone Park that would eventually become the Shoshone National Forest. At first, residents ignored the regulations intended to protect timber, pasture and watersheds from senseless abuse. Then, as the regulations were enforced, the locals pressed their representatives in Washington, D.C., for relief. Several congressmen from the West took up that cause, which was eventually adopted by Speaker of the House Joe Cannon of Illinois.
In 1907, the western anti-forest coalition managed to attach an amendment to a large agriculture appropriations bill. It appropriated $125,000 for the Forest Service, provided: “that hereafter no forest reserve shall be created, nor shall any additions be made to one heretofore created within the limits of the States of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colorado, or Wyoming, except by Act of Congress.” The identities of the authors of this provision are lost in the minutiae of congressional records, but the list of states it was supposed to protect from President Teddy Roosevelt’s ongoing campaign to establish national forests tells us where they lived.
While this contest was simmering in Washington, westerners fought federal authority on the ground. In 1906, rancher Fred Light turned 500 head of cattle loose on the Holy Cross Forest Reserve in Colorado without a permit from the Forest Service. The resulting legal battle went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, funded by a special appropriation from the Colorado Legislature. A similar case in California also made its way to the Supreme Court. The ranchers lost their bid to undermine Forest Service regulations — the court supported congressional authority to establish federal reserves and appoint officials to control the ways they’re used.
Supreme Court decisions notwithstanding, stockgrowers and settlers near the public domain continued to flout regulations and dodge limited enforcement, and the damage to federal land deepened and widened. In 1923, Aldo Leopold, then an assistant Forest Service supervisor in the department’s Southwest region, reported that, on the forests in his district, “overgrazing is responsible for much more abnormal erosion than all other causes combined.” 
The situation worsened as the region descended into the droughts of the 1930s, which led conservation-minded legislators to impose some sort of reasonable management on federal lands, especially the parts of the public domain that were neither part of the national systems of parks and forests nor owned by private interests. The Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 allowed the secretary of the interior to organize “grazing districts” on those orphan federal lands, issue permits to control grazing and charge a fee for those permits. Oddly enough, the sponsor of the law, Congressman Edward Taylor of Colorado, was an opponent of federal controls and hoped to give locals control over the new federal grazing bureau.
One of the most entrenched opponents of the Taylor Grazing Act was Pat McCarran, U.S. senator from Nevada. When the act took effect, McCarran set about undermining the new federal Grazing Service. He set standards for the election of local advisory boards that favored the biggest ranchers; he made sure the boards could set grazing fees well below prevailing market prices; he pushed regulatory loopholes that favored ranches controlled by banks and he pressed board members to buy their grazing districts outright. Over the next 20 years, he attacked Grazing Service employees for alleged abuses of authority and fought proposals to increase grazing fees. He was his generation’s leader in a war against federal land that was already 50 years old. 
After World War II, U.S. Sen. Ed Robertson from Wyoming took up the cause, introducing a bill that would have turned over federal grazing lands to the states in which they were found and holding extensive “investigative hearings” across the West to root out instances of Bureau of Land Management (formerly the Grazing Services) employees abusing their authority. He pressured the Department of Agriculture to maintain unsustainable stocking rates for sheep and cattle on national forests and helped strangle BLM efforts by slashing the agency’s budget. Other members of Congress championed laws that expanded assistance to permittees grazing public land and limited BLM and Forest Service professionals’ authority to regulate grazing. Frank Barrett, a Wyoming senator, introduced a bill that would have allowed permittees to sell their permits. Thankfully, it failed. At the same time, timber harvests on federal land expanded drastically, with no attention given to restrictions explicit in the federal laws that were supposed to control the Forest Service. 
Through the 1960s and 1970s, the American public at large reacted to the longstanding hegemony local interests had exercised over federal lands. The Wilderness Act, the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, and other federal laws sought to protect amenities the nation at large valued, and the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 kept BLM lands in federal hands while mandating management that considered “the long-term needs of future generations for natural scenic, scientific and historical values” as well as “recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish.” All of this was to be done “without permanent impairments of the land and the quality of the environment.”
The Federal Land Policy and Management Act was a glove in the face of the traditional masters of the public domain, and it elicited a response that came to be known as the Sagebrush Rebellion, yet another attempt to cede federal land to the states. Prominent in the movement at that moment were candidate Ronald Reagan and Orrin Hatch, U.S. senator from Utah.
This brings us into the realm of living memory. Following the Sagebrush Rebellion, Cliven Bundy and his son, Ammon, dared the federal government to enforce its regulations concerning the use of public land. Ammon was found not guilty of occupying a national wildlife refuge at gunpoint, and, after 10 years, Cliven is still grazing his stock illegally on BLM land. 
And now comes Mike Lee at the head of the most recent insurgent action in a fight that has stretched on for 140 years. Should anyone mistake his intentions after his land sale provision was taken off the table, he said that he “continues to believe the federal government owns far too much land — land it is mismanaging and in many cases ruining for the next generation. Massive swaths of the West are being locked away from the people who live there.” He promised to continue his efforts to “put underutilized federal land to work for American families.” We have a century of abuse of the public domain by a tiny minority of people to help us define what he means by “work” and “American families.” 
Forcing Lee and his cronies to back down was a signal victory, well worth celebrating. So find a friend, face your favorite corner of public land, the place that always brings a smile to your face and raise a libation to success. Then get a good night’s sleep. Tomorrow morning, they’ll be at it again.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After a labor-dominated 89-day legislative session, Nebraska lawmakers are looking ahead to a little time off to reset before coming back for a 60-day session in January.
The Nebraska Examiner invited all 49 senators to review the most recent legislative session, and 47 have responded so far. The collection of reflections, in lawmakers’ own words, is available below or see the full project in its own tab here.
Among the responses, lawmakers described the 2025 session as a “mixed bag,” “very successful,” “deeply disappointing,” “highly productive” or “decent.” Some early priorities identified for 2026 include the state budget, property taxes and economic development.
While the Legislature will conduct interim studies and hold hearings this summer and fall, official action is on pause — at least for a while — after state lawmakers adjourned June 2. No plans have been announced for a special session. Some laws took effect immediately during the session. Others will be enacted this fall, most on Sept. 3, or later on.
Lawmakers are expected to return for the 2026 session beginning Jan. 7.

(Fayette County Public Schools)At a Fayette County School Board meeting in April, Lamar Hobson decided he’d had enough.
He had unanswered questions about the school system’s proposed budget, which was being put together without the involvement of a finance director. The district has been without one for several months.
Before he could start speaking during public comment, Board Chair Warner Speakman cut him off. “I’m gonna ask you. Are you from this county? … Do you vote here?”
“You go up to the courthouse and check. I’m on the register,” Hobson, a 1981 graduate of Fayette-Ware High School, said before turning to Board Member Becky Trimm. “I sent you an email this morning. I’m in your district. You ain’t never spoke to me. Not one time.”
Speakman waved a Sheriff’s deputy toward the front of the room as Hobson turned to address a cheering audience.
“The board shows that they are not for us … They’re supposed to be representing us — the people — not a certain … hidden agenda,” Hobson shouted. 
Speakman banged the gavel.
Tension has been palpable between the crowd and the school board this year, though Speakman told Tennessee Lookout that “there has been ‘no’ friction” after he read aloud a letter from the Sheriff’s Office concerning rules for crowd decorum at a June meeting.
This atmosphere comes as the board continues to push toward dissolving the consent decree that has held the school system accountable to the federal government for integrating public schools since 1965. The order was put in place after the government found that Fayette County failed to appropriately desegregate its schools.

By 2023, the school system had worked to eliminate discrimination in staffing, facilities, transportation and extracurricular activities, according to an order from U.S. District Court Judge S. Thomas Anderson.
In recognition of the district’s progress, Anderson approved a new consent decree in October 2023 that restricts desegregation obligations to a few remaining areas. This order requires the district to improve its efforts to recruit and retain diverse faculty, revise discipline policies to prevent racial discrimination and better identify and serve students through gifted programs and dual-enrollment classes, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.
It also requires the district to hold parent information and listening sessions multiple times each year and “listen and respond to questions, comments and concerns.”
Repeated comments from Hobson and other community members who attend school board meetings indicate a lack of trust in the school board’s decision-making processes and consideration of public feedback.
The majority of attendees at many of the board’s meetings are Black, mirroring the demographics of the school system itself. Nearly 55% of the school system’s 3,283 students in the 2020-2021 school year were Black, according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of Education’s Civil Rights Data Collection Office.
Six of the eight sitting school board members are white.
Continued scrutiny over minority representation
In February, the board voted to declare unitary status, asserting that federal monitoring is no longer necessary and the school system’s difficulties with representation are in the past. For that decision to take effect, either the plaintiffs – including the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund – would have to agree that the district implemented the order in good faith, or the court would need to schedule an evidentiary hearing to determine the district’s compliance.
Fayette County School District has continued to file the required reports so its “progress toward a unitary system can be monitored,” court records show. The district has not filed a motion for declaration of full unitary status and case dismissal.
In multiple social media posts, Speakman states that ending the ongoing desegregation case is among his top priorities. He said the case and its requirements are costing the district money that could be better used elsewhere.
NAACP dismisses discrimination suit against Fayette County after commission passes new district map

Some community members responded to the school board’s vote with apprehension that removing federal accountability could lead to a backslide in progress.
Fayette County has continued to fall under scrutiny for issues of discrimination in recent years. The U.S. Department of Justice and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund separately sued the county earlier this year over its 2021 electoral map, which the lawsuits said illegally diluted the power of Black voters to elect candidates of their choice. 
Both of the lawsuits were voluntarily dismissed after the county commission approved a new electoral map with three majority-Black, single-member districts in late June. The new map will be used in the 2026 election cycle.
Sitting school board member David Reeves drafted a letter to U.S. Rep. David Kustoff in April, asking the Memphis Republican to “(engage) the Department of Justice” to help Fayette County Public Schools end the consent decree. 
Tennessee Lookout obtained the letter through a public records request that was initially denied by the board’s legal counsel. The letter was never shared with the public despite being reviewed by at least one other board member.

Letter to Congress 
Using Fayette County Public Schools letterhead, Reeves wrote that the district has made “significant progress” in the decades since the case began.
“The ongoing legal oversight poses a considerable obstacle to our mission,” Reeves wrote. “The constraints imposed by the case restrict our operational flexibility, limiting our ability to make decisions best suited to the current needs of our community.”
Reeves signed the letter using his school board title. Legal counsel stated that Reeves was not authorized to write the letter as a representative of the school board and acted without the board’s permission.
It’s not clear if Reeves sent the letter. Reeves did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Representatives for Kustoff did not respond to questions about the letter.
‘They shut (discussion) down’
Latoya Parker, who describes herself as a teachers’ advocate, started attending school board meetings in person in May. Like Hobson, she described the board’s function as a “hidden agenda.”
She said the board votes on big items — like the budget, which was ultimately approved this summer — without much discussion at the full board meeting. 
“When something is going to have to come out, they shut (discussion) down,” Parker said.
Multiple public speakers over the course of several meetings said board members failed to respond to or acknowledge emails from constituents.
Tennessee Lookout reached out to the eight sitting board members via email. Kevin Powers, a former Fayette County commissioner who was appointed by the County Commission to fill a vacancy on the board in May, declined to comment, citing his short time in the seat. Speakman also responded, referencing the Sheriff’s Office letter and declining to comment further. The remaining six members did not respond.

Fayette County Sheriff’s Office 
School board members have made some steps toward building a relationship with the community.
Parker said the board’s responses to public comment at a meeting on June 5 were markedly different from the norm. Board members said they had taken down a list of questions voiced by speakers during public comment. One board member suggested the board review rules of order to improve how meetings are run. The suggestion drew applause from the audience.
NAACP Fayette-Somerville Branch President Elton Holmes frequently attends and speaks at meetings. In early July, he entreated the board and newly selected Superintendent Don McPherson to create a policy for answering questions from community members.
“The only way we’re going to be able to work together is we’re gonna have to communicate,” Holmes said at a July 2 meeting. “By giving the answers to the questions … it probably will cut down on some of the animosity that the constituents have right now for the school board.”
At a committee meeting on July 22, Powers said he is “fully in favor” of creating a policy regarding addressing public comments.
“There’s nothing worse than putting up your thoughts about something and then having it look like, eh, we don’t care what’s going on. We do,” he said, asking community members to email all board members their ideas for such a policy.
Speakman echoed Powers as he closed the meeting.
“Anything that you have that you’d like to see, just let us know,” Speakman said. 
Hobson said he keeps speaking at meetings because he feels the board isn’t listening.
“Somebody has to step up and put a voice out there and let the people in the community know that you’ve got a voice,” he said. “All you got to do is come together … and protest this. This is not right.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Gov. Jared Polis wants Colorado to fast-track deployment of new clean energy projects before Republicans’ rollback of billions of dollars in incentives takes effect.
In an executive order signed Friday, Polis directed state agencies to take a variety of steps to “eliminate administrative barriers and bottlenecks for renewable projects,” citing a “time-limited window for procurement of tax-advantaged wind and solar” before Biden-era credits and rebates are phased out by the congressional GOP’s recent domestic policy bill.
“Today we are taking action to ensure that Coloradans can easily access clean energy savings, especially ones that expire soon,” Polis said. “We continue to do all we can to make people aware of how you can reduce costs on energy bills and keep money in your pocket.”

The state’s goal, Polis’ order says, is to “integrate maximal clean energy by securing as much cost-effective electric generation under construction or placed in service as soon as possible.” That could include expedited reviews of new projects by the Public Utilities Commission and invoking the agency’s authority to override local permit denials, as well as “priority air permitting” for electricity generation projects by the state’s Air Pollution Control Division.
Most of the clean energy incentives enacted by Democrats in 2022’s Inflation Reduction Act are set to be quickly phased out under the megabill passed by Republicans and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month. Tax credits for utility-scale wind and solar projects will expire for any project not placed into service by the end of 2027. Many consumer-facing incentives will expire much sooner than that, with electric vehicle rebates expiring next month and a credit for home energy upgrades due to end Dec. 31 of this year.
The state has launched an online “energy savings navigator” tool that allows Coloradans to learn what incentives they may be eligible for based on their ZIP code, income level and other factors.
$500 extra a year per household
Officials from the Colorado Energy Office told lawmakers last week that the Republican bill, also known as H.R. 1, will slow the state’s efforts to deploy electric vehicles, heat pumps and other clean-energy technologies. Colorado was already in jeopardy of falling short of its statutory goal of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, projections showed.
“The state can certainly work to ensure that Coloradans are aware of these credits and are able to take advantage of them as much as they can,” CEO deputy director Dominique Gómez told lawmakers. “But there are obviously some limitations given how quickly these credits are expiring.”
The state now projects fewer than 600,000 electric vehicles will be on Colorado’s roads by 2030, far short of the goal of nearly 1 million it first set in 2019, according to a slide shown to lawmakers.
Colorado’s plans to clean up the electricity sector, however, may be relatively unaffected by the Republican bill — aside from higher costs for utilities and ratepayers.
“While this does likely increase the cost for new wind and solar, it is likely that compared to other new generation sources, this is still the quickest to market, and in many cases, still the most cost-effective new generation source,” Gómez said. “It is difficult for us to say at this point whether or not it will really change the overall trajectory, but we do know that it will make it more expensive.”
Polis’ office claimed Friday that the energy policies enacted by Republicans are projected to cost the average Colorado household $500 a year by 2035.
“Colorado’s swift response to the devastating impacts of H.R. 1 shows true leadership at a critical moment for our economy and clean energy goals,” Emilie Olson, Colorado lead at clean energy trade group Advanced Energy United, said in a press release. “We don’t need to wait on the federal government to make progress on the clean energy future that our state leaders have committed to.”

Jeff Landry has declared a state emergency to address what he said is lack of capacity to house violent offenders at Louisiana State Penitentiary. His proclamation allows state officials to expedite repairs at a section of the Angola prison that was shut down eight years ago for security reasons.
The governor’s emergency declaration clears the way for his office to expedite resources and personnel for Camp J, comprising four maximum-security buildings on the sprawling 18,000-acre prison grounds. Once known as the “Dungeon,” most of its cells were designated as solitary confinement to segregate prisoners for disciplinary reasons.
Warden Darryl Vanoy closed Camp J in 2017 after its cell locks malfunctioned, allowing inmates to evade security checks. Dozens of weapons were found inside, and approximately 85 correctional officers resigned, retired or were fired as a result of its conditions.
Despite its closure, a portion of Camp J was used as a quarantine site for incarcerated people during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Landry’s emergency order suspends state procurement code and public bid law for the state to secure any goods and write or amend any contracts needed to respond to the emergency. 
The governor signed the declaration July 25, but news of his action only became known over the weekend. The state of emergency remains in effect through Aug. 23.
There were 4,240 people incarcerated at Angola as of May 31, the most recent state figures available, and 91.5% of them were violent offenders. 
There were more than 29,000 people in state custody across Louisiana, with 55% at nine state prisons. The other 45% are held in local jails where they’re either serving shorter sentences, awaiting transfer to a state facility or nearing the end of their incarceration. 
Violent offenders accounted for 56% of the state prisoner total at the end of May.

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Measles is spreading in the United States, and so is the risk of exposure and infection at child care facilities, which often serve kids too young to be vaccinated against the highly contagious disease.
Children’s health is the most immediate challenge amid an exposure, but not the only one. Parents may face three weeks of quarantine that requires them to keep their child at home, leaving them scrambling to figure out how to work without reliable child care.
A mother in Iowa is highlighting just how complicated things can get. Martha Martin has been posting on social media about the ripple effects after a person who visited her 9-month-old son’s day care in Cedar Rapids later tested positive for the illness. The individual was vaccinated and is among seven cases of measles in Iowa as of July 15. Not all of the infections appear to be connected.
It took public health officials several days to notify the day care of the exposure, but Martin’s son — who had not yet received his first dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine because of his age — was able to receive a post-exposure antibody known as immunoglobulin. The alert came too late for her son to get an emergency MMR shot, which can be available within 72 hours of exposure.
Martin said she and her husband took their son to an emergency room for the antibody treatment, and she has received some mixed messaging about whether the couple will be on the hook to pay out of pocket. Other children from the day care were given immunoglobulin shots through a clinic organized by UnityPoint Health – St. Luke’s Hospital and the local county public health department. A spokesperson for the hospital system confirmed those details but did not respond to questions about the cost of the shots.
“Day cares can be a terrible place to have a measles outbreak,” said Dr. Tina Tan, a pediatric infectious diseases physician and president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “There’s going to be babies there that are too young to receive a measles vaccine. And they are at very high risk, if they get measles, to get a severe case.”
The state of Iowa has a 21-day measles quarantine protocol for non-immune people, a typical period in part because of how long a person may be able to spread the disease. But Martin said the day care instructed the couple to keep their son at home for 28 days because the antibody extends that period.
“I’m not sure what we’re going to do about that, not sure what we’re going to do about me going to work, my husband, everything like that,” Martin said in one post on TikTok that has now been viewed 2.5 million times.
Martin initially responded to an interview request from The 19th but later stopped communication.
A senior staff member who answered a call at the Iowa day care directed inquiries to local and state public health officials. A spokesperson for the public health department in Linn County, Iowa, said it continues to monitor the day care and other places of exposure as needed after “hours and hours” of contact tracing. A spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services confirmed that the day care is open and highlighted its protocol document.
Martin said her son appears to be fine for now, but she knows symptoms can take some time to emerge. She said while her employer has been understanding, she will use vacation days and her husband will take unpaid time off to care for their son. Throughout her posts, Martin hammered one point a few times.
“Get your kids vaccinated,” she said, adding: “Your kids, you yourself not getting vaccinated — you are harming everybody else.”
In late March, a measles outbreak in West Texas reached a day care in Lubbock, where a child with measles infected several children, according to news reports. Some parents were told to keep their kids at home for 21 days of quarantine.
A representative for the Texas day care did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its co-owner told a local news outlet that the facility took a mix of precautions in order to keep its doors open. That meant sending some children home and isolating vulnerable children into a classroom while they still attended day care.
“Sending an infant home for 21 days is a huge burden on working families so there was the need to balance risk of exposure vs the need for income,” said Katherine Wells, director of the Lubbock Health Department, in an email.
America’s child care system runs under different levels of regulations, with varying rules by state when it comes to handling infectious disease outbreaks.
Ruth Friedman is a senior fellow at The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and former director of the Federal Office of Child Care (OCC). She said day cares work under tight financial margins, and infectious diseases like measles could be a major financial blow, a dynamic that has parallels to the COVID-19 pandemic when some centers had to reduce services or close.
“If you destabilize the attendance and enrollment of children in child care, it can very quickly lead to programs closing their doors and child care broadly becoming unavailable to a community,” she said.
Wells said some parents expressed anger about their child being quarantined, while others said they were simply fearful about their children being exposed to the disease, which can make people very sick: complications include pneumonia, brain swelling and death. Children under 5 and pregnant people are among those more likely to suffer complications. And according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people with measles are hospitalized.
The first MMR shot is typically administered to a child between 12 and 15 months of age, with a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6. Children between 6 months old and a year are eligible for an earlier shot if they live in or travel to an outbreak area or are traveling internationally.
Iowa health officials have begun to recommend that parents consider an accelerated shot schedule for their children, which can include receiving the second MMR shot as early as 28 days after the first dose. Two doses are 97%  effective against measles, which is at a 30-year high around the country.
The risk of measles at day cares is not new. Between December 2023 and January 2024, a day care in Philadelphia reported an outbreak that spread in part because a parent sent a quarantined child to day care despite knowing the child, who was not vaccinated, had been exposed to measles. The child, as well as the parent, later tested positive for measles.
Dr. Ericka Hayes, an attending physician and senior medical director of infection prevention at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the chances of more outbreaks in child care settings will depend on factors like vaccination rates within the facility and how it adheres to its policies around illness. She noted that children are contagious with measles for several days prior to the onset of a rash — often a primary symptom — but other early signs of infection can look a lot like a common viral infection: fever, cough, runny nose, and red and watery eyes.
“So equally important is if a child is sick they should be excluded from day care,” she said via email.
Friedman said the case out of Philadelphia previews a potential conflict that could emerge as parents reckon with health considerations amid work responsibilities that ensure they can pay their daily and monthly expenses. Federal law does not require employers to offer paid sick leave to its workers, leaving such options up to states. In some cases, states are rescinding those policies despite voters’ wishes.
“There’s this tension — what are you supposed to do with your child if you need to work?” she said. “From a family perspective and from a child care sector perspective, I think the implications could potentially be really, really troubling.”

My first car was one of those pollution machines, a used 1968 Buick Gran Sport that gulped a gallon of poisonous, leaded gasoline every 14 miles or so.
It was a different time, one that the Trump administration seemingly is trying to bring back.
In what could be one of the most far-reaching deregulatory moves in U.S. history, the Environmental Protection Agency wants to stop regulating greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks long considered by most scientists to be significant contributors to climate change.
“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end 16 years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said at a Kenworth heavy truck dealership in Indianapolis on July 29.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Zeldin said the administration plans to overturn a landmark 2009 finding by the Obama administration that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are pollutants the agency can regulate under the Clean Air Act.
That determination is known as the “endangerment finding” and was the basis for strict tailpipe emission rules enacted by the Biden administration that would have required about half of new vehicles sold in the U.S. being electric or plug-in hybrids by 2030.
Automakers also must meet certain fuel economy standards, which were stiffened by Biden. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in June the Trump administration is planning to roll back the Biden standards, calling them “illegal.”
And under the One Big Beautiful Bill, the tax and spending bill approved by Congress on July 3, automakers won’t have to pay fines for not meeting fuel economy standards for the past three years.
It’s a big gift to automakers that pay hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the federal government for not meeting the fuel economy standards. But it will likely sting electric carmaker Tesla, which has made billions of dollars over the years selling regulatory credits to other carmakers.
Environmental groups expressed outrage over the EPA’s intent to deep-six climate rules.
“As Americans reel from deadly floods and heat waves, the Trump administration is trying to argue that the emissions turbocharging these disasters are not a threat,” said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council. “It boggles the mind and endangers the nation’s safety and welfare.”
Environmental groups have vowed to sue the EPA over the proposed climate rules rollback, possibly delaying any implementation for years.
Even Detroit’s automakers were muffled in their response to the EPA’s move to ditch carbon dioxide rules.
The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an association representing dozens of automakers and suppliers including General Motors Co., Ford Motor Co. and Stellantis N.A., did not issue a statement about the EPA’s groundbreaking announcement on its website.
That might be because some top auto executives have acknowledged climate change is real and their products are contributing to it.
GM CEO Mary Barra has said electric cars are a key element in the automaker’s long-range plan to have “zero crashes, zero emissions, zero congestion. It’s the North Star that guides everything we do.”
Ford Motor Executive Chairman Bill Ford has supported the Paris Climate Accord, which seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels associated with climate change. Ford Motor also has pledged to be carbon neutral across its vehicles, facilities and suppliers by 2050.
Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are doing their best to torpedo those efforts by conducting an all-out war against electric vehicles.
They’re ending the $7,500 tax credit to purchase EVs on September 30. And they’re eliminating tax credits for home EV charging stations, a move slated to take effect next June.
Trump’s chaotic implementation of tariffs also is being used as a weapon in his war against EVs. The Commerce Department last month slapped a 93.5% tariff on Chinese graphite, a critical ingredient in manufacturing EV batteries.
China supplies nearly all the high-grade graphite Tesla and other automakers need to make batteries. But the Commerce Department says China is “dumping” graphite into the U.S. at prices lower than in its home market.
Some experts say the tariff could add $1,000 or more to the price of an EV battery, another huge disincentive for consumers to buy EVs.
Trump’s widespread tariffs on cars, trucks and parts are hammering Detroit automakers’ bottom lines, potentially hurting their ability to adequately invest in new technologies to compete with Chinese automakers that are rapidly gobbling up the global EV market.
Ford and Stellantis cited the impacts of tariffs in the companies’ net losses for the second quarter of the year. Combined, the Detroit Three have paid more than $2 billion in tariffs so far this year.
Trump longs to return to an America he remembers growing up before the federal government started regulating the auto industry.
I’m nostalgic, as well, for my ’68 Gran Sport. But that muscle car is an anachronism best suited for events like the Woodward Dream Cruise.
And besides, today’s quick-accelerating EVs could blow its doors off.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/799px-interstate_270-11644335642.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 06:56:17.137012

(Photo: Getty Images)Across the state, from Memphis to Johnson City, educators are emerging from their summer sabbatical, slogging their way through teacher in-service and counting the hours until they can do what they really want to do: teach students. 
Over the last quarter-century, however, the bureaucracy surrounding public education has substantially increased. From testing mandates to false flags surrounding equitable teaching and learning, classroom teachers have shouldered the burden of navigating the landmines of performative legislation (CRT, Success Sequence, Gun Safety), all while doing their best to ensure students are emotionally, mentally and physically safe to learn subject-specific content. 
Looking beyond the frivolous legislation previously mentioned, the glaring albatross that has been weighing teachers down for nearly two decades is standardized testing. 
Assessing students on one single day of a 180-day year and using that data to determine the success of a student, a teacher, a school, and a district is inarguably flawed. However, like anything that has been in place for 20 years, a habituation occurs — the worst ideas can eventually become acceptable over time.
Recently, the formula used to determine the “success” of a school and or district was changed to place more weight on academic achievement rather than academic growth. 
Without diving too deep into the weeds of data correlation, the success rates of achievement on standardized tests don’t necessarily reflect students’ abilities; instead, those success rates are directly linked to the socioeconomic status of schools and districts.  The wealthier the district, the higher the achievement. The inverse is also true: the poorer the district, the lower the achievement. While the sole measure of student success based on testing is bad enough, weaponizing that data is worse.
Tennessee governor bets big on school vouchers with primary endorsements. Will it work?

Six years ago, Gov. Bill Lee made his first move to introduce educational choice (emphasis on charter schools and private school vouchers) to Tennessee. Using districts with the lowest performance rates as voucher guinea pigs, some GOP state legislators (potentially aided by some suspect back-door deals by former House Speaker Glen Casada) introduced voucher programs into Memphis-Shelby County Schools and Metro Nashville Public Schools That opened the door to the eventual implementation of a state-wide voucher program known as “Tennessee Education Freedom,” which passed in a January special legislative session.
Ironically for teachers and students remaining in public education, teaching and learning are anything but liberated. Educators are inextricably handcuffed to testing and the data mined from it. Since 2019, the state of Tennessee has paid nearly $150 million to the testing vendor Pearson for test materials, scoring, and data organization. When millions of dollars are given to a testing company, the practice of teaching systematically bends to the will of a test’s format — In this case, multiple choice. 
Lost in the pressured pursuit of gaming the data, schools and teachers have fallen victim to assessing students in a way that hinders learning exploration, limits opportunities for creativity, and transforms learning as an evolving journey into a finite outcome of selecting one choice out of four. Every. Single. Time.
But who can blame schools or teachers for gaming the system? These are the rules of the game we’ve been given to play. If we fail to meet the data checkpoints set by the state and federal government, we risk losing funding. If our students don’t answer a certain number of questions correctly on one given test on a given day, a public grade of “F” could be assigned to the school. Public education has been painted into a corner by the corrosive legislation of testing and then, in the cruelest of turns, had that same data weaponized against it as an argument for school choice. 
However, there’s a faint light at the end of this testing tunnel.
During the last legislative session, a measure was introducted to help rectify the testing mess. were introduced. As enacted, House and Senate  bills allow for the creation of an advisory committee to study various aspects of public education in Tennessee, including the methods and frequency of standardized testing. The formation of this committee is the first step in abolishing the toxic culture of standardized testing within public education.
Rarely have I been on board with legislation introduced by Tennessee Republicans. This is an exception. During a time when it’s increasingly difficult to find common ground within a fractured political culture, this specific subject could be what brings bi-partisanship to the foreground. 
As last year’s legislative session came to a close, there was discussion of ending all state-standardized testing in high school and limiting the subjects tested in middle school. 
If that train of thought continues to roll through the advisory committee and into next year’s session, then Tennessee might finally be on its way to living up to the moniker of “education freedom.” 
We all deserve the freedom to teach and learn outside the shadows of high-stakes testing. It’s past time that we make our voices heard.

(Sarahbeth Maney/ProPublica) This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with the North Dakota Monitor. Sign up for Dispatches to get stories in your inbox every week.
For more than half a century, Diana Skarphol’s family received a check every month from the company that drilled the first successful oil well in North Dakota on their land in 1951.
The checks, from the company that became Hess Corp., were straightforward. Her family, which owns the oil and gas underground, received a percentage of the revenue generated from the company’s sale of the minerals, called a royalty.
But in April 2015, when she opened that month’s check and looked at the accompanying statement detailing her share, she noticed for the first time that a significant portion of the payment had been deducted. About 35% of what she thought she was owed was gone, and she didn’t know why. 
She was so taken aback that she called her husband, Bob Skarphol, a state lawmaker on the verge of retirement, as he drove from the Capitol in Bismarck to their home in Tioga, a small community in the oil-rich Bakken in the western part of the state. 
“Why are there minuses?” Diana Skarphol recalls asking. “Rather than being added in, things were being subtracted. I was puzzled and confused.”
The couple remembers that call because it was the start of a frustrating, decade-long search for answers from the company and of a string of unanswered pleas for help from the state, which has not taken action to help royalty recipients even as other states have. Over the past decade, Hess has withheld about 31%, or $137,635, of the Skarphols’ royalty income to cover the company’s costs to move oil and gas from the well site to market, records show. 
Oil and gas companies owed the state’s private mineral owners, like the Skarphols, an estimated $4.6 billion in 2023 before deductions, according to North Dakota State University research. But those deductions — which can vary greatly — are deeply contentious in the state: The companies claim certain costs should be shared with royalty owners, while owners say that in most circumstances, the deductions shouldn’t be permitted at all. The state itself doesn’t regulate what can be deducted and there is no official accounting of how much of that money is withheld.
The North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica spoke with 18 mineral owners, interviewed experts and lawmakers, and reviewed court records and royalty statements to understand the extent of deductions. A dozen owners provided records of companies withholding 20% or more of their oil and gas royalties. Some monthly statements showed deductions as high as 50%. Similarly, at least one energy company and one independent researcher have found the deductions to be around 20% in recent years. 
The industry’s chief lobbyist said percentages that high are atypical. Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, said it would be “impossible” to calculate an average deduction but suggested it couldn’t be more than 7% to 10% based on the cost of transporting oil out of state. If deductions were in that range, North Dakota royalty owners collectively would have lost between $322 million and $460 million in 2023.
The Skarphols’ leases with Hess were signed during a time when oil and gas was often sold at or near well sites. The leases didn’t say anything about deductions. 
“It’s a matter of fairness,” Diana Skarphol said. “We didn’t get any say in it. They just up and changed it. You feel like you’re being cheated. It’s not right.”

While the language in the leases has not changed, the industry has. Most companies now choose to move the commodities away from the well site before selling them, incurring additional transportation and processing costs. They pass on a share of those costs to the royalty owners, which the North Dakota Supreme Court has ruled is legal.
By contrast, North Dakota officials have taken steps to safeguard state-owned royalties. Since 1979, all state leases with oil and gas companies prohibit deductions. When state trustees noticed deductions were being taken anyway, they fought back and have spent years negotiating settlements to recoup those missing royalties. 
But the majority of the oil and gas in North Dakota is privately owned by about 300,000 individuals, according to the industry. And North Dakota policymakers have not taken action that would protect private minerals, an investigation by the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica has found. 
“There’s a double standard,” said Rep. Keith Kempenich, a Republican from Bowman, a community in the oil field. He has co-sponsored several pieces of unsuccessful legislation aimed at helping private owners.
Lawmakers have rejected efforts to rein in deductions and to make it easier for royalty owners to understand what costs are being deducted and why. And oil and gas regulators have claimed they have no jurisdiction to help. 
“It’s ridiculous,” said Bob Skarphol, who has led the advocacy efforts by private mineral owners. “The industry has an incredible amount of influence in North Dakota.”
The state, which owns about 6% of the minerals in North Dakota, has advantages that private mineral owners don’t have. It has the resources to audit companies that pay royalties and to litigate disputes. State law also requires that companies provide electronic copies of royalty and production data to regulators, but private royalty owners are guaranteed access only if they travel to the company’s office, which could be out of state. 
And unlike the state, private mineral owners rarely have the leverage to negotiate a lease that prohibits deductions, and leases don’t expire unless oil production lapses. 
In responses to questions from the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica, officials from three companies that operate in North Dakota — Hess Corp., Slawson Exploration Co. and Zavanna Energy — said they follow the language in the leases. In fact, most leases, like the Skarphols’, don’t explicitly mention deductions. The companies also said that while there are additional expenses to selling the oil and gas farther away from the well site, doing so also leads to a better price for both the companies and the owners. 
The companies, as well as the organization that advocates for the industry, blamed some of the fees charged to private owners on costly state regulations enacted a decade ago. 
“Basically it got really, really expensive and really, really challenging. And I think it put the economics of gas in a whole different position,” said Ness of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, which represents more than 550 oil and gas companies in the state. “Pure and simple, the world changed.”
‘Saddled with expenses’
Diana Skarphol was less than a year old when her mother’s family, the Iversons, first leased the rights to any oil found under their land to Amerada Petroleum, which later merged with Hess, in 1949. The Iverson family had immigrated from Norway at the turn of the century. They’d farmed the land for decades, survived the dust bowl of the hard ’30s and were still feeling the effects of the Great Depression. 
The discovery of oil in 1951, setting off the state’s first oil boom, changed everything. Oil executives and workers flooded the small community. Diana Skarphol said her relatives welcomed them and invited them over for coffee.

It was a change in fortune for the Iversons and many other families. “They weren’t very rich farmers. They were just getting by. And this supplemented their income,” she said. The leases promised a 12.5% royalty on the oil’s market value the day it left the well site, “free of cost.” That means that the mineral owner is not responsible for costs to drill or operate a well or other production expenses. 
That’s why families like the Skarphols say they were perplexed when the deductions began.
The Skarphols keep decades of monthly royalty checks, so they can track when Hess began deducting money. A column titled “other deductions” first appeared in 1998 but remained blank until April 2007, when the company began to deduct less than 2% of their royalty, an amount they said was too small to notice at the time. 
North Dakota’s oil and gas industry was on the verge of momentous change. The shale oil boom, triggered by new technologies, had arrived. Crude oil was fetching $100 a barrel by 2008, and the “drill, baby, drill” spirit took hold before the phrase was ever uttered in the White House. 
But the oil was leaving the surface intermingled with vast quantities of wet natural gas, which the companies often disposed of by burning it. The sight of small flames, called flares, became ubiquitous in the Bakken. 
Flaring looked unsightly, polluted the air and wasted a natural resource that could be sold. State officials enacted regulations in 2014 that required companies to curtail the flaring. The industry, in turn, said it has spent an estimated $25 billion so far to build the necessary infrastructure to collect the gas, process it and export it through pipelines.

Companies pass on to owners a share of those infrastructure costs, as well as the expenses associated with processing and transporting oil and gas, sometimes to far-flung markets. Whether owners ought to share in these costs is the heart of the debate.
The industry justifies the shared costs by citing a North Dakota Supreme Court ruling that empowered companies to deduct expenses. That 2009 ruling, which addressed a narrow issue related to natural gas, concluded that the value of the gas for royalty purposes should be calculated “at the well,” where it leaves the ground. 
That laid the groundwork for postproduction deductions. The ruling meant that when calculating royalties, companies could start with the sale price and then deduct the costs incurred after the minerals were extracted — what has been called the postproduction phase — to determine how the resources would have been valued at the well. But to royalty owners whose leases promise a royalty “free of cost,” the fact that companies incur expenses before selling the oil and gas is not their problem. 
“Mineral owners are being saddled with expenses,” said Neil Christensen, the agent for his three sisters who inherited mineral rights in McKenzie County that they lease to Hess. Those expenses, he suggested, should “reduce stockholder dividends, not reduce mineral owner income.”

Private royalties in North Dakota, estimated in the billions

There’s a lot of money at stake. North Dakota Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, a Republican who routinely sponsors bills advocating for the interests of both the industry and royalty owners, estimates that companies deduct “at least hundreds of millions of dollars” every year. He says companies should use their revenues to cover the postproduction costs — as they did before the most recent oil boom. 
An executive with XTO Energy told lawmakers in 2021 that the oil and gas company deducts on average $30 million annually, or about 21% of the royalties owed to private leaseholders in North Dakota. Mary Ellen Denomy, a forensic accountant who has audited royalty statements across the country and for at least 30 North Dakotans in the last decade, said that about 22% of royalties are deducted on average — which would have amounted to $1 billion in 2023. These figures are in line with royalty statements that mineral owners shared with the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica.
It’s difficult to verify what specific costs each company deducts because companies don’t detail those, either for royalty owners or for the state, instead providing only broad categories on the statements that accompany their checks.
Hess said it is a “common industry practice” to pass on some infrastructure costs, such as the $1.5 billion the company spent on pipelines, the expansion of a gas processing plant and construction of other facilities in the early 2010s. Hillary Durgin Harmon, a Hess spokesperson, said those investments support economic growth by increasing oil and gas production and transporting it to more markets, benefiting royalty owners and the state overall.
Zavanna Energy also attributed the increased deductions to infrastructure expenses, including the cost of getting landowners’ permission to install pipelines in the state, according to the company’s general counsel. 
“I’ve seen the costs associated with obtaining pipeline easements in some parts of North Dakota increase as much as 3000% over the last 10 years,” Zavanna’s Gillian Wilkin said. “Those increased costs can substantially influence the price that must be paid to get oil and gas to downstream markets.”
Todd Slawson, chairman of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, defended owners sharing the costs to move and enhance oil and gas after leaving the well site. Such “post-marketability” costs, he said, benefit the owners, too.
“The objective of the operator is also to obtain the best prices for all parties,” said Slawson, who owns Slawson Exploration Co., another energy company. “We are all in this together, so everyone wants the best price.”
He called royalty owners like the Skarphols, who inherited leases, “very lucky and fortunate.” “What a great country we live in where minerals can be privately owned — I do not know of another country where that occurs, but there probably are some,” he said. In most countries, oil and gas are largely owned by the government.
Bob and Diana Skarphol didn’t feel fortunate when Hess began taking unexpected deductions in 2015. Nor did Brian Anderson, who also inherited a lease with Hess that his father signed in 1949. Donald Anderson was then a 21-year-old farmer who worked in a coal mine on his property to support his younger siblings. 
The family started getting royalties soon after. But since the company began taking deductions a decade ago, Brian Anderson said his family has lost more than $600,000.
“The fact that they just arbitrarily started taking it just sticks in my craw so bad,” said Anderson, who at one time worked for Hess. “You don’t take anything for 60 years, and then all of a sudden you, abracadabra, can do it?”

By the fall of 2018, Skarphol had talked to enough other mineral owners to realize that deductions had begun appearing on many of their royalty statements — and they weren’t stopping.
Skarphol called a meeting at City Hall in Williston on a brisk October evening to discuss what they could do about it. Dozens of mineral owners filled every seat and stood shoulder to shoulder in the back of the room. 
Janice Arnson, who along with her seven siblings inherited mineral rights from their mother, stood up and declared that deductions were “out of control.” One particular lease, signed by her mother in 2009, began paying royalties a few years later when Hess drilled a well. The deductions were minuscule at first and then skyrocketed to 23% of Arnson’s royalty check in February 2015. “We just want to be paid our fair share,” she said at the meeting.
“I want the Legislature to take this seriously,” said Linda Meyer, a mineral owner in Williams County.
Skarphol, who called the meeting, responded. “Do we want to get angry enough to do something about it?” Skarphol asked the crowd. “I do.”
That night, the mineral owners formed the Williston Basin Royalty Owners Association.

‘Such a hopeless feeling’
The group started with a request at the beginning of the 2019 legislative session for the state to study the issue and consider potential solutions. Lawmakers approved the request, but the committee that selects which studies should be completed discarded the proposal.
In 2021, royalty owners worked with legislators to draft a bill to directly address their concerns. Among other changes, the legislation would have prohibited deductions unless they were explicitly allowed for in a lease and would have permitted royalty owners to audit a company’s records, at the royalty owners’ expense, to ensure they are being paid correctly. 
Curtis Trulson, a retired farmer, shared concerns about the deductions with lawmakers during that session. He receives royalty payments through leases with multiple companies, and he first started noticing his royalty payments were diminishing during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“Nobody ever called and said, ‘Well, we’re going to start taking these costs and here’s why.’ It just started disappearing,” Trulson said. “Almost every operator is doing the same thing now. They didn’t all do it to start with.”

Trulson emailed details of his situation, and a royalty statement, to seven senators on the committee considering the bill drafted by the royalty owners. Some deductions “go totally unexplained!” he told them. The only legislator who responded was the one Democrat, Merrill Piepkorn. 
“I hate to say this because I lean a little more on the Republican side and I’m more conservative,” Trulson said. “Other ones didn’t even bother to respond or say thanks for the information or anything.” He added: “The state of North Dakota doesn’t want to help us out.”
The legislation was turned into a study, which ultimately recommended no changes to state law.
“I had a hard time keeping from screaming,” Anderson said of his frustration during the hearings, which he attended in person. 
The mineral owners tried for more modest changes in 2023. That year, they pushed for a bill that would have required companies to provide royalty statements in spreadsheets. While state law requires that companies provide them that way for publicly owned minerals, there is no such requirement for private owners. 
That legislation failed, too.
“Every time we make any kind of an attempt it seems like the industry has a whole lot more influence over the Legislature in North Dakota than the people do,” Christensen said.
Arnson, who worked with Skarphol to bring concerns about this issue to legislators’ attention, said she feels betrayed by her representatives. 
“It was such a hopeless feeling,” Arnson said. “Have I lost a lot of faith? Yes I have.”

Legislators from both parties who were involved in the efforts to amend state law told the North Dakota Monitor and ProPublica that repeated legislative measures have failed because of the industry’s impact on the state economy and subsequent influence in state politics. State and local governments took in about $32 billion in oil and gas taxes between 2008 and 2024, according to a study by the Western Dakota Energy Association. That same study found that more than 50% of all local tax collections are tied to oil and gas.
The industry’s influence “has curtailed any investigation or legislation regarding looking into the validity of the deductions,” Piepkorn said. “Ron Ness is a pretty smooth talker,” he said of the industry’s chief lobbyist. “We just take what he says for gospel.” Ness said his reputation with policymakers as “a trusted and respected voice for the industry” has been “hard earned” over 27 years. 
Bekkedahl, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee that crafts the state budget, said more than half the state’s revenues are tied to oil and gas activity. He called the energy industry’s lobbying efforts on this issue “very aggressive” but said lawmakers need to address concerns about royalty deductions.
“I’ve always maintained that we should, as the Legislature, provide some clarity to this issue so that the courts can make the interpretations with clear statutes in place, which they don’t have now,” Bekkedahl said.

North Dakota Petroleum Council staff have testified to lawmakers that the state should not get involved in what it describes as private contract disputes. 
But the Legislature has gotten involved in other contract issues championed by the energy industry, including this year when it approved legislation related to coal leases. The new state law allows the companies to extract critical minerals from coal without having to negotiate amendments to existing leases. 
Joseph Schremmer, a University of Oklahoma law professor who specializes in the energy industry, said the Legislature can take action on other issues affecting private contracts as long as there is a “legitimate state interest.” 
“The Legislature has the power to do many things that would potentially modify the operation of existing contracts,” he said. 
Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a Republican who is both a royalty owner and a former executive in his family’s oil company, declined to comment for this story. He said in an interview last year that royalty owners should rely on the courts, though litigation is expensive and not feasible for most.
“If you think you have a litigation issue, litigate it,” Armstrong said. “You’re trying to use the state of North Dakota as your private lawyer. If you are in a contract dispute, there is a better place to settle that.”

Diana Skarphol is doing just that. She is one of 34 plaintiffs from the extended Iverson family who sued Hess in 2021 for $10 billion in damages, arguing that the company breached their contracts by taking deductions. 
Northwest Judicial District Judge Robin Schmidt ruled in favor of Hess and dismissed the case last week. North Dakota law, which the Skarphols and other families have been asking the Legislature to change for years, “is not on your side,” she told the plaintiffs in a June hearing.
But where this will end is unclear: The North Dakota Supreme Court has overturned this judge’s rulings on a different case related to deductions. And the Skarphols’ attorney said they will likely appeal. Schmidt also told the plaintiffs they could bring a new lawsuit over a different set of oil wells.
Meanwhile, Bob and Diana Skarphol continue to open the checks each month and calculate their losses. So far this year, Hess has deducted 36%.

Dozens of miners received free screenings at the unit while they were there for the National Mine Rescue Association’s Post 5 Mine Rescue Contest. (Payton Mandell for West Virginia Watch)MORGANTOWN, W.Va. — On a turf field in Morgantown, West Virginia, last week, mine rescue teams from across the state put their training to use as they worked together to respond to simulated hazards that can occur in coal mines as part of the National Mine Rescue Association’s Post 5 Mine Rescue Contest.
The hazards, according to Josh Brady, include what to do if there is an unstable structure, water flooding a mine, a methane bubble or areas with low oxygen — all things that threaten miners’ safety while underground and can, potentially, cost them their lives. 
Mine rescue teams are the ones called in when things go wrong in a mine, said Brady, who is the director of the department of Mining and Industrial Extension at West Virginia University. 
Usually, these situations are clear and the danger they pose apparent. Having individuals trained to correct them, Brady said, means lives are saved and disasters avoided.
Nearby, in the parking lot of the Hazel & J.W. Ruby Community Center at Mylan Park, a different kind of team was working to help miners stay safe from a less obvious but just as dangerous threat: black lung. 
Employees with the National Institute for Occupational Safety were there staffing the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program’s mobile black lung screening unit. It’s the first time the mobile unit has been back in the field since federal government cuts shut it down earlier this year.
Now, following a court mandate ordering the full restoration of services at the CWHSP, Laura Reynolds, the supervisory programs management officer with the NIOSH Respiratory Health Division, said everything is back to normal.
“It did take some time — first to stop everything [in April] and then, you know, getting everything back going again,” Reynolds said. “But we’re fully operational again now. Everything is staffed, we’ve got the mobile unit going, and we’re just happy to be back in the community meeting miners where they are.” 
The mobile black lung screening unit provides miners with free screenings to test their lung function and see if there is evidence of black lung. Screenings take roughly 30 minutes per person and include a health and work history questionnaire, a chest X-ray, a blood pressure screening and a spirometry test.
It takes about five people to staff the unit — one to drive and four others who run the tests and see miners.
Joene Patterson, a health technician at NIOSH who works on the unit, said being able to take services to miners directly is critical.
“For a lot of folks, too many, this might be the only time they really come and get their health checked,” Patterson said. “You know, people — men especially — can be stubborn about their health. They don’t think that something bad will happen to them, but we know it does.” 
The screenings are fully confidential and available to both current and retired miners. Reynolds said the check-ins allow miners to make up their own minds about what they want to do depending on the results. There aren’t any mandates that stop someone from working if they do have black lung, but knowing the diagnosis allows them to have options.
“It’s about giving them choices, making sure they’re aware of their health and any risks they might be taking,” Reynolds said. “We aren’t here to force anyone to do anything, but we want to make sure that they’re being educated about what could happen and their own risk level.”
If a current miner shows a positive black lung X-ray, then they can apply for a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a less dusty part of the mine without facing retribution — like a cut in pay or hours — from employers.
For retired miners, the X-rays can be used to apply for black lung benefit payments.
Over the course of three days last week, Reynolds said the mobile unit saw dozens of miners.
“A few people told us they were happy to see us back out here and that was great to hear,” Reynolds said. “We’re happy anytime anyone comes in and decides to get checked out.”

The screenings are critical for early detection of black lung disease. The earlier a case is caught, the more steps people can take to prevent the disease from evolving into a more complicated and debilitating form.
There is no cure for black lung. The best intervention, according to experts, is to limit exposure to dangerous silica dust. 
But limiting that exposure is becoming difficult as dust is more common in mines now due to miners needing to dig through silica-rich sandstone to reach the little coal that remains in existing seams.
In central Appalachia, black lung rates are on the rise; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners here are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. 
One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
The resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to the increased exposure to silica dust.
Jennifer Orrahood, who also works on the mobile unit, said they’re seeing these statistics in real life all the time. It’s difficult, however, since younger coal miners tend to be more resistant to getting screened, Reynolds said.
“They tend not to worry about it, and I guess that’s part of being young,” Reynolds said.
Orrahood said she wants young miners to understand that they aren’t invincible. Risks exist and, if nothing else, it’s important to be knowledgeable about your own health.
“If you’re young, even if you believe you’re totally healthy you should still be getting screened to set a baseline,” Orrahood said. “We hope they’re right, that there’s nothing wrong, but that baseline is critical for knowing that’s the case.”

Construction is also underway across the street, where a new legislative office is being built to house lawmaker offices and committee rooms. Both projects are a part of a $392 million renovation plan the Georgia General Assembly approved last year.
The Gold Dome has been a symbol of the state since its construction in 1889. Renovation plans are designed to preserve this history while simultaneously celebrating a new chapter.
“It’s a place of history as well as a place of government, and so the building itself should reflect that,” said Timothy Crimmins, co-author of “Democracy Restored: A History of the Georgia State Capitol.”
When the state Capitol was initially constructed, there was a strict $1 million dollar budget and a requirement that Georgia materials should be utilized when possible. Financial restraints made it difficult to locally source some construction materials. This led to Indiana limestone being used for the exterior of the Capitol and European carpets being imported for interior chambers.
The current renovation of the Capitol is being done in the same spirit. Backed by a $83 million restoration budget for the historic Capitol building alone, the project has already incorporated local materials from floor to ceiling.
Shaw Floors, a Dalton-based company, made the new carpet being installed in both the House and Senate chambers. Long dubbed the “Carpet Capital of the World,” Dalton is known for producing between 85 to 90% of U.S. carpet, according to state Rep. Kasey Carpenter, a Republican who represents Dalton.
“It’s a sense of pride obviously for northwest Georgia to make sure that we have a place in the Capitol,” Carpenter said.

Dalton isn’t the only city that has found a place to shine at the Capitol. Dahlonega gold was used last year when Georgia’s iconic dome was regilded during initial renovation stages.
While a lot of change has happened at the Capitol since 1889, Gerald Pilgrim, the Georgia Building Authority chief of staff who is overseeing renovations, said he hopes that by the end of the project, the Capitol will look and feel a lot like its early days.
To bring this vision back to life, Pilgrim and his team have emphasized historical accuracy by hiring historical preservation architects and a preservationist subtractor. Together, even small details like lighting and color schemes have been fact checked. Numerous light studies were conducted after restoring chandeliers from the 1900s to ensure that each bulb emits an appropriate glow.
Lawmakers’ desks are currently being refinished and will all receive a new USB port before returning to the Capitol. Chairs have been replaced with replicas, but old chairs will be kept in storage and be made available by seat-holder’s request.
Skybridge debate lingers
Construction at the new legislative office building has progressed and is on track to be finished by the end of next year.
“At the (Coverdell building) the offices were very small and cramped,” Pilgrim said. “Everybody’s (new) office is going to be the same size. They’re all going to be 226 square feet, which is about double what they currently have, and all (offices) have a window view of either the Capitol or downtown Atlanta, there’s not an obstructed view in the building.”

The eight-story building will also feature a skybridge meant to create an accessible way to move between the new offices on Martin Luther King Jr. Dr. SW and the Capitol building.
Constructing a bridge or tunnel has been a decades-long conversation at the statehouse. Crimmins said an earlier proposal to add a bridge from the Capitol to the current legislative office across Mitchell Street was ultimately rejected. Officials instead reduced traffic with street closures.
When conversations about a skybridge reemerged, the idea was met with concerns from preservationists. Pilgrim said the Georgia Building Authority considered alternatives before deciding that the skybridge was the best option.
“We looked at doing a tunnel with the cost being about four times more expensive,” Pilgrim said. “But more importantly, the tunnel was not going to improve accessibility.”
To address preservationists’ concerns, Pilgrim said the skybridge will bear its own weight and won’t require any demolition. This allows the bridge to be easily removed in future years if the project does not prove to be as successful as anticipated. Construction will use similar materials that match the Capitol’s existing aesthetic and include arches that mimic the building’s renaissance style architecture.
David Mitchell, executive director of the Atlanta Preservation Center, has been a vocal opponent of the skybridge. Comparing it to a “bizarre umbilical cord,” he argues that claims of improved accessibility are ironic considering the limited public awareness and outreach about renovations.
“You’re telling me you’re spending $10 million for something to be used for four months, if even,” Mitchell said, referring to the skybridge. “It’s not like it’s being used 12 months out of the year, and is helping multiple handicapped accessible people. We’re not talking about something like an ADA compliance, we’re talking about during the session when the greatest usage of this will take place.”
Despite continued debate over the skybridge, construction was approved in June when the Atlanta City Council signed over the air rights that will allow the bridge to be built next year.
Original library will be restored

If entering the Capitol from the skybridge, pedestrians will be welcomed through a soon-to-be-restored state library that was part of the original Capitol. The two-story library will bring a variety of books back to the statehouse and offer additional meeting spaces for public affairs.
The library was converted into office space around 1910 and was completely eliminated by 1950, according to Pilgrim. After the restoration, the current offices and copy room occupying the space will relocate to the first floor. An observation space is planned to give visitors a chance to watch the restoration process.
“We’ll have Plexiglas partitions in there so when school groups come in and tour, they’re going to see the artisans in there doing the work,” Pilgrim said.
Renovations and new construction are all on track to be completed by the end of 2027. The three-year project is not expected to interfere with next year’s legislative session.

Kathleen Kauth of Omaha and Tanya Storer of Whitman, who will shepherd the bills through the Legislature. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers’ efforts to crack down on delta-8, marijuana and other THC products crossed state lines Friday with a new lawsuit against a nationwide manufacturer and distributor.
Hilgers and his office filed a lawsuit in Lancaster County District Court against Savage Enterprises, a Wyoming corporation based in California. The lawsuit accuses Savage of falling “woefully short” on Nebraska labeling and safety laws and argues that it aims to “entice and ultimately ensnare” children and teenagers.
A Nebraska consumer alerted the Attorney General’s Office to Savage Enterprises, leading to the investigation, according to the lawsuit. 
The investigation included the testing of at least seven vape, gummy or edible products that purported to include certain types or levels of THC that were ultimately inaccurate. The lawsuit alleges the corporation also “recklessly ignored” health warning signs against delta-8 and other tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products and did not appropriately warn consumers.
“Nebraska consumers cannot predict with any degree of certainty which ingredients Savage Enterprises puts into its products, nor understand the potential intoxicating or other adverse effects that may result from their consumption,” the lawsuit states.
Savage Enterprises did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

The lawsuit included a section that specified how many products Savage Enterprises has provided to how many retail smoke and vape shops throughout Nebraska, including in Lancaster County, but the specific numbers were redacted from the filing, including in the official court documents. An attorney general’s spokesperson did not answer a reporter’s question on why the numbers were redacted.
Among the allegations in the lawsuit is that Savage Enterprises offers online purchases without age verification and has used advertising that Hilgers’ office says is geared toward minors.
Hilgers’ office says the advertising included a Black Friday promotion in November 2023 promoting a free Nintendo Switch or Sony Playstation 5, social media content creators promoting Savage Enterprises products on various platforms, a Discord server where employees promote products and offer prizes, funny memes posted to appear “trendy and cool” and packaging with fruity flavors, cartoons, bright colors and childish fonts.
The lawsuit also accuses Savage Enterprises of using sex appeal through “young, attractive models” who it argues posted “sexually provocative” or “scantily clad” images or videos while using THC-containing products from Savage Enterprises.
“Savage Enterprises recklessly disregarded the fact that its strategies would appeal to adolescents and teens and would induce them to try Savage Enterprises’ THC products,” the lawsuit states.
This is the 16th Hilgers-led lawsuit alleging violations of Nebraska’s Consumer Protection Act and Nebraska Pure Food Act since he took office in 2023. His office has sent 225 cease and desist letters, too, including 21 in the last month.
Those letters have been sent to shops from Ralston to Scottsbluff, including 104 smoke and vape shops in Omaha, 82 in Lincoln, four in Kearney and three in Nebraska City.
Hilgers has tried to partner with state lawmakers in legislative attempts to take such products off Nebraska shelves that he maintains are already illegal under state and federal law. Past legislative attempts have stalled but will likely be revived in 2026.
The latest, in a partnership with State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, would classify most “hemp” products as marijuana and severely limit, if not ban, most hemp and THC-containing products in Nebraska.
Hilgers is asking Lancaster County District Court to stop Savage Enterprises and anyone “in active concert or participation” with the corporation from continuing the allegedly illegal behavior. The lawsuit seeks $2,000 for each violation of state law.
“The Attorney General will not sit idly by while Savage Enterprises enriches itself and its owners by endangering the health and well-being of Nebraska’s most valuable asset: its children and teenagers,” the lawsuit states.

U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Helping them in their efforts is Todd Graves, a prominent Kansas City attorney and chairman of the Herzog Foundation, which participates in the voucher program through an affiliated nonprofit connecting Missouri students and private schools with scholarship funding.
Graves is also a member of the University of Missouri Board of Curators. He filed the motion to intervene in the case in Cole County circuit court last week. 
The lawsuit targets a state tax credit program called MOScholars that relies on nonprofits like the Herzog Foundation — called “educational assistance organizations” — to gather donations and distribute scholarships to students in private, parochial or home schools. Donors can receive a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution but can use it to cover no more than half of their state tax liability. 
However, the budget signed by Gov. Mike Kehoe includes an injection of general revenue to the MOScholars program, budgeting $50 million in taxpayer funds for scholarships and $1 million to assist marketing the program.
The three parents seeking to intervene in the lawsuit — one from Kearney, one from Kirkwood and one from Springfield — say they’ve used MoScholars and expect their families to benefit from the influx of state money. 
They are represented by EdChoice Legal Advocates, an Indiana-based nonprofit that advocates for school-choice measures. Graves filed the motion to intervene because he’s a licensed attorney in Missouri. 
“Missouri families depend on MOScholars to afford educational options that best fit their children’s needs,” said Thomas Fisher, director of litigation at EdChoice Legal Advocates. “We are proud to support these brave parents who are stepping forward to defend and protect the expansion of the MOScholars program.”
Missouri educators sue state over $51 million appropriation to private school vouchers

The lawsuit, filed by the Missouri National Education Association and two public school teachers, argues a direct appropriation of taxpayer funds to MOScholars is unconstitutional. 
The 2021 law that created MOScholars only prescribes the use of tax-deductible donations to educational assistance organizations as its funding source — not general revenue. The lawsuit contends that a direct appropriation to the program effectively changes the MOScholars law,  and changing state statute in a budget bill is not allowed.
Plaintiffs had hoped a Cole County judge would expedite the case so that a temporary restraining order could be in place before state money is dispersed through the voucher program. 
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey argued his office needed more time to prepare for the case, citing recent departures of two top aides who would have been involved in the litigation. 
“A rushed response could lead to inadvertent admissions or incomplete answers, which would unfairly prejudice the defendants’ ability to present a full and fair defense,” the attorney general’s office said in its filing. 
The judge agreed with Bailey, and arguments over the teacher’s union request for a temporary restraining order are set for late August.
Critics of Missouri’s voucher program argue that shifting state resources into private schools could hurt public education around the state. That’s especially true, they contend, in rural Missouri, where there are few options for private or religious schools. 
“Politicians in Jefferson City and their privatization lobbyists are stealing from our kids,” Missouri NEA President Phil Murray told The Independent last month. “In rural Missouri, that $51 million means losing our music teacher, canceling basketball and watching our schools crumble. They’re killing our small towns.”
Proponents argue the program is a vital resource for families who do not feel public schools are the best option for their children.  
Libby Eversgerd, a single mother of four from Kirkwood and one of the parents seeking to intervene in the lawsuit, said her daughter struggled in public schools before eventually dropping out. When her son started having similar issues years later, she was able to use MOScholars to help enroll in a private school where she says his grades and attendance improved dramatically.
“The recent expansion of the program is constitutional,” EdChoice’s Fischer said, “and will expand education freedom for low-income families and students with learning differences.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/herzogfoundation2-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and Pennsylvania and 15 other states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Immigration drives nation’s population growth

Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Patience was thin and the Rhode Island Senate calendar heavy on the afternoon of June 12 as lawmakers sprinted toward the end of the 2025 legislative session.
Time was running out to change the fate of a proposed assault weapons ban, the biggest policy question hanging over the Rhode Island State House.
So Sen. Pam Lauria made it quick. Reading prepared remarks from her phone, she asked to move the bill to a different committee, prompting an outcry from Senate Republicans. Senate President Valarie Lawson quickly interjected, commanding the lawmakers to let Lauria continue. 
Undeterred, Lauria finished and looked up and let her request sink in. The chamber fell into a secondslong, stunned silence. Then, protests and procedural questions poured in.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary assigned to vet the controversial gun safety policy appeared unlikely to advance the legislation. Rerouting the bill to the Senate Committee on Finance would have guaranteed a floor vote, where it was likely to pass.
Lawson ruled Lauria’s procedural request “out of order.” The Senate narrowly upheld Lawson’s conclusion by a 20-17 vote.
For Lauria, it was about gun safety. But it was also a bold move that forced her colleagues to confront the implicit expectations of loyalty above lawmaking. In just 30 seconds, she had recast the conversation and her own reputation — from quiet workhorse to change agent.
“It’s never been about relationships for me, as much as about the policy,” the Barrington Democrat said in a recent interview. “At the end of the day, I am the one that has to live with myself.”

Changing which committee first vets and advances legislation to the full chamber is nothing new on Smith Hill. In 2019, the Senate rerouted the Reproductive Privacy Act, which codified federal abortion protections in state law, from its Judiciary Committee to the Committee on Health and Human Services, which subsequently forwarded it to the full chamber for passage. In 2022, after a proposed ban on high-capacity firearm magazines stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee under a tied vote, Senate leaders advanced the House version of the legislation directly to the floor, where it was approved. 
“Procedures are important, the process is important, but also, the reality is, we make that up,” said Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, who voted against Lawson’s out of order ruling. “If 19 people in that room agree on something, that makes it real.”
Lawson said she ruled Lauria out of order because the Judiciary Committee had already heard hours of impassioned testimony on the bill. 
“Senator Lauria’s motion violated Senate Rules and the legislative process which is at the heart of our work in the Senate,” Lawson said in an email.
The Senate’s adopted rules, however, suggest Lauria’s request was allowed. The chamber’s procedural guidebook lets senators object to the committee assignment of any House bill received during the previous legislative day. 
“Upon objection being made, the presiding officer shall assign the transmittal to the committee requested by the senator making the objection,” the rules state.
Five days later, the Judiciary Committee ultimately advanced an amended bill banning the sale — but not the possession — of assault-style weapons. Proponents defended the watered-down version, noting the legislation still prohibited the transfer of firearms, thus reducing the number of assault weapons in circulation in Rhode Island.
Lauria reluctantly voted for the scaled-back version of the legislation on the final night of the legislative session, signed into law by Gov. Dan McKee on June 26.
Lawson and Lauria became friends after Lauria won state office in 2022. The two East Bay lawmakers texted often, Lauria said. They shared meals in their free time and hotel rooms at legislative conferences. Lauria canvassed for Lawson ahead of the 2024 Democratic primary. Lawson ascended to the president position after the death of  former Senate President Dominick Ruggerio in April. She donated $300 to Lauria’s campaign on June 8, according to the most recent campaign finance statements filed with the Rhode Island Board of Elections. 
Four days later, Lauria asked to move the assault weapons ban to a different committee. The two have not spoken since.

A lawmaker who wears a white coat by day
Lauria’s commitment to safer gun laws is rooted in her experience as a trauma nurse at Rhode Island Hospital. Now a nurse practitioner for Brown University Health’s primary care office in East Greenwich, she loved the frenzy, the technicalities of wound care, the chance to help. But the memories of treating patients with gunshot wounds linger decades later.
As a freshman senator, Lauria sponsored legislation mandating safe storage of firearms, shepherding the contested proposal through two years of late-night committee hearings and behind-the-scenes negotiations until it became law in 2024. 
“Statistically-speaking, the safe storage bill will save more lives than the assault weapons bill will,” Lauria said. “But that’s what terrifies people, assault weapons. It’s truly terrorism, and also enormously lethal. We don’t allow cars on the road that can go 150 miles an hour.”
Lauria, who grew up in East Providence, earned both her bachelor’s degree and a master’s of science to be a nurse practitioner at the University of Rhode Island. 
Her political career almost ended after a single campaign season. She lost a bid for a seat on the Barrington School Committee in 2016 after vigorously campaigning against a proposal to start the school day earlier. Her position was informed by her professional and personal experience as a mom trying to get her then-teenagers to get out of bed earlier in the morning.
She lost by 50 votes, finishing fourth in a four-way race for the three open seats on the nonpartisan school board. 
Lauria turned down an offer to chair the town Democratic Committee three times before she said yes.
“Why would it be me?” she said of her reluctance. “I hadn’t been on the committee before. I had no idea what the job would entail. And, I think like a lot of women, you need a few times before you say ‘yes.’”
After five years of helping recruit and train candidates for local office and galvanizing voters as head of the Barrington Democratic Town Committee, Lauria still never saw herself on Smith Hill. When Rhode Island Sen. Cindy Coyne opted not to seek a third term in 2022 and asked Lauria to run in her place for the seat representing parts of Barrington and East Providence, she declined.
Lauria’s husband, David, a music teacher at Mount Hope High School, urged her to reconsider.
“You have to do this,” David recalled telling his wife. “This is the opportunity you’ve been waiting for.”
Lauria agreed to try. She succeeded, trouncing a primary opponent and a general election competitor.










Procedures are important, the process is important, but also, the reality is, we make that up. If 19 people in that room agree on something, that makes it real.

Months into her first term, in April 2023, longtime senator and former majority whip Maryellen Goodwin died of cancer. Goodwin’s death began a period of grief and instability that would plague the upper chamber for the next three years as Ruggerio’s health also worsened. Ruggerio died on April 21.
The part-time position as state lawmaker consumed Lauria’s evenings and weekends throughout the six-month session. Lauria used three hours of vacation each week, working without a lunch break, to accommodate the Senate’s biweekly afternoon sessions with her day job.
Many of the bills Laura has sponsored or advocated for directly reflect her experiences in the exam room, like a 2023 bill signed into law requiring insurance providers to cover the cost of EpiPen refills.
“I don’t know how she did it, to be honest,” said Dr. Kristen Hubbard, lead physician and Lauria’s longtime colleague at Brown University Health. “You would see her run from here to there each week, and she was always 100% focused when she was at our office, and 100% focused when she was there. She’s tough.”

A growing distance
Lauria voted “present” at the November 2024 caucus to elect new Senate leaders. Lawson, recently tapped by Ruggerio to be his second in command, voted for Ruggerio to serve another term as president.
That was when Lauria felt something shift in their friendship.
Six months later, after Ruggerio’s death, Lauria voted for Sen. Ryan Pearson, not Lawson, for president. When senators were asked to vote on the chamber floor later that day, Lauria voted for Lawson because she knew Pearson could not win. 
They continued to meet to talk through legislative solutions to critical health care issues like primary care reimbursements and the abrupt closure of Anchor Medical Associates. 
“I don’t think punishment is Val’s MO,” Lauria said.”I’ve always been given the opportunity to be heard, and I hope that continues.”
She maintains faith in Lawson as a leader.
“I think that she could, she will, be a good president,” Lauria said. “It’s really always just been about what I thought was best for the chamber.” 
Lawson declined to comment on her personal relationship with Lauria, but stressed her respect for Lauria’s advice and expertise, especially on health care.
DiMario, a friend and confidante to Lauria throughout the chaotic 2025 session, said Rhode Island politics could use more perspectives like Lauria’s. DiMario was unsurprised by Lauria’s stand on the assault weapons ban.
“I think we share an ability to deal with uncomfortable things head-on,” DiMario said. “Honestly, I think our chamber and the General Assembly overall would benefit from more people approaching the work like she does.”
You wouldn’t know it from watching the Capitol TV recording of Lauria calmly delivering her June 12 speech, but she admits her heart was racing and her mouth was dry.
Looking back more than one month later, Lauria said she doesn’t regret her procedural request and would have made it regardless of who was Senate president. But, she acknowledged she might have opted to give Lawson a heads up beforehand.
“I wasn’t trying to make it difficult for her,” Lauria said. “I was actually trying to make it easy for her. In hindsight, would I go back and tell her about it? Maybe. I don’t know what would have happened. I can’t say what would have happened.”

(Photo provided)When children are unnecessarily removed from their homes, experts say the separation puts them at risk of chronic mental and physical ailments. 
With that in mind, four Kentucky libraries are launching programs to keep families together, well resourced and educated, aided with $200,000 in grant money from the national nonprofit Youth Villages. 
Libraries in Jackson, Johnson, Marshall and Spencer counties received around $45,000 each for a variety of programs to help parents meet their children’s needs. 
Britany Binkowski, the executive director of the Youth Village initiative New Allies, said libraries are a “low stigma, high access point of contact for all communities” and make sense for grassroots outreach. 
“They pretty consistently exist in most counties where they can be reached by lots of families, especially those in rural areas, and they’re (places) people trust to get information, to get access to resources,” she said. “They don’t carry the stigma, for example, of going to a child welfare department and asking for resources in a way that might feel very vulnerable.”  
Among other things, the libraries are using the grant month to host trainings on growing food in an apartment setting, teaching parents how to deal with challenging behaviors and how to cook basic recipes, and connecting families to other community resources where they can get car seats and other necessities. 
Libraries are also a more “natural” place to host visitations for parents who are working toward reunification, Binkowski said. 
It’s “often not the case” that a child is removed from a home because the parents are outright bad, she said. Most of the time, parents lack the resources to properly feed, clothe or otherwise care for their children, she said. In fact, about 70% of all Child Protective Services allegations are related to neglect and poverty, the Lantern previously reported. 
“We see substance use disorder and parents who are struggling with that as a significant driver of entries into foster care — not only in Kentucky, but across the country,” Binkowski said. 
Other preventable issues contribute to removal, she said, like a parent not being able to buy a car seat or access safe child care. 
“Things like that can cause safety issues that have to be resolved for a child to remain safe and stable,” Binkowski said. 
‘Before there’s a problem, let’s fix it.’ 
Tammy Blackwell, an author and the director of the Marshall County Public Library, said libraries working in this space is just “logical.”
“Libraries are already reaching families and just doing a lot of good work giving families a place to be and form bonds,” she said.

Marshall County’s grant supported a renovation of the Hardin branch to create a more child-friendly space and funded an eight-week program for mothers of young children called Mom’s Night Out. 
During the Mom’s Night Out program, which will start the first week in September, mothers who are referred by Court Appointed Special Advocates will gather weekly and have a meal together. During the meal, representatives from the Marshall County Extension Office and the health department will lead discussions about stress management, home upkeep and how to cook recipes with staples handed out at food distribution centers like rice and beans. 
Because this is grant-funded, it’s not affected by recent changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, Blackwell said. Congress recently passed the Big Beautiful Bill Act, which cut funding for the SNAP Education program, among other things. 
The Mom’s Night Out discussions will be in a “very non-judgmental way, and not in a lecturing kind of way, but as a conversation and getting those families very comfortable in that space, very comfortable with library staff, comfortable with community partners who they may need to call on at some point,” Blackwell explained. 
“We’re hoping that they build a bond with each other; other people with similar lived experiences, and to really give them a sense of community and resources in order to help the mothers thrive, so that the children may thrive,” she added. “I love that it’s ‘before there’s a problem, let’s fix it.’” 
The first round of the program will only include mothers — Blackwell hopes between 12 to 15 — who have children of preschool to early elementary school age. Should it be successful and receive funding for a repeat, she’d like to expand it to fathers as well. 
“There’s been some coverage of how many kids in Kentucky are in either foster or kinship care situations,” Blackwell said. “It’s a lot of kids, and that really impacts their ability to be successful in life. And anything that we can do to strengthen those families and give those kids, then we need to at least try. And I think libraries are in a perfect position to really make a difference.” 
The 2024 Kids Count report, from Kentucky Youth Advocates and the Annie E. Casey Foundation, showed there were nearly 46,000 youth in foster care in the state from 2021-2023. In that same time period, the number of children leaving foster care and reunited with their families dropped to 32%. Pre-pandemic, from 2016-2018, it was 36%. 
Additionally, in 2024 there were around 55,000 Kentucky children being raised with a relative in a kinship care arrangement. 
The Department for Community Based Services came up with the idea to partner with libraries, Binkowski said. Lesa Dennis, the DCBS commissioner, wasn’t available for an interview but said in a statement that “by meeting families where they are, we’re building pathways to stability, resilience and well-being so no family has to face challenges alone.” 
Removal is ‘traumatizing’

Binkowski, who previously worked as Assistant General Counsel for the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services, said that “a foster care intervention, even if necessary, is traumatizing to everyone involved.” It can damage bonds between parents and their children and upend daily routine and connections, she said. 
“We have a substantial body of evidence that tells us that children do best when they are with their families of origin — when it can be safe,” she said. “We know that connections to biological family, knowing where you came from, feeling like you belong — those are really critical emotional stabilization and safety factors that support children’s growth and development.” 
Experiencing brokenness in the home, abuse or neglect are Adverse Childhood Experiences, which refers to traumas or stressors in a person’s life before their 18th birthday. They include, but are not limited to, parental divorce, abuse, parental incarceration, substance use issues in the home and more. The more such experiences a person has, the more likely they are to have poor health, lower education and economic hardships. Childhood trauma also cost Kentucky around $300 million a year. 
“Enough stressors on a child at early ages without protective capacities to keep them from having negative outcomes can literally take years off of their lives,” Binkowski said. “So, while we don’t want children to experience abuse and neglect … we also don’t want them unnecessarily being removed from their home if the issues are not creating those kinds of negative impacts and we can stabilize a family without requiring removal.”

The bill was signed into law as Act 52 of 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas lawmakers overwhelmingly approved three laws during the 2025 legislative session meant to increase patients’ access to prescription medication.
One of those laws has since been blocked in federal court, but the other two will go into effect Tuesday.
Act 52 removes the state’s ban on nonprofit hospitals holding pharmacy permits. Supporters of the law, including some of the state’s largest hospital systems, said patients should benefit from hospital pharmacies’ capacity to afford more expensive drugs and remain open at all hours compared to local independent pharmacies.
Additionally, Act 630 prohibits drug manufacturers from restricting the availability of medication to a “limited distribution network of out-of-state pharmacies.”
  Rep. Brandon Achor, R-Maumelle (Arkansas Secretary of State)
Republican Rep. Brandon Achor of Maumelle, a practicing pharmacist and the lead sponsor of Act 630, said in an interview that manufacturers have the power to limit which pharmacies can purchase their drugs. He called this “a huge public safety issue,” especially when the availability of some drugs is limited to mail-order pharmacies.
“These patients should not be contingent on an airplane or a FedEx truck,” Achor told a House committee in March. “They should be contingent on being able to access [pharmacies] in real time.”
Achor was a co-sponsor and vocal supporter of Act 624 of 2025, which would have banned pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) from holding a permit to operate a drug store in Arkansas after Jan. 1, 2026. PBMs negotiate prescription benefits among drug manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies and health insurance providers, and the biggest ones also own pharmacies and insurers.
A federal judge temporarily blocked Act 624 in July after four PBMs and the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association filed lawsuits against it. Supporters of the law said it would prevent PBMs from financially straining local pharmacies to the point of forcing them to close, but U.S. District Judge Brian Miller ruled that the law “likely violates” the U.S. Constitution’s commerce clause. The state filed a notice of appeal with the court on Thursday, and both plaintiffs and defendants asked Miller to stay further proceedings until the appeal is decided.
The Arkansas Pharmacists Association supported Act 624. CEO John Vinson told a Senate committee in April that Act 52 will create new pharmacy jobs that could make up for any job loss brought about by Act 624.
Committee rejects bill to allow nonprofit Arkansas hospitals to hold retail pharmacy permits

The initial version of Act 52 would have simply removed the portion of state code banning hospitals from having retail pharmacies. It failed in committee in January after Vinson and others expressed concerns that competition from hospitals’ in-house pharmacies could snuff out independent pharmacies. A 2023 bill similar to Act 52 did not advance in the Legislature.
Lawmakers amended the eventual Act 52 to replace the deleted code with specific provisions, such as allowing the State Board of Pharmacy to issue permits for retail pharmacies within 250 yards of a nonprofit hospital’s physical location in Arkansas, plus one additional pharmacy permit per 100 beds in the hospital.
Additionally, Act 52 does not place a limit on the number of retail pharmacies that nonprofit hospitals could operate in conjunction with infusion centers, and it allows these hospitals to direct their pharmacies’ services to underserved areas.
 Projected impacts on patients

The Arkansas Pharmacists Association was neutral on the final version of Act 52. Vinson said in an interview last week that the combined impact of Acts 52, 624 and 630 “will benefit a whole lot more people than just this one law alone.”
“It’s not just [about] how many pharmacies there are, but [whether] the patients have a fair market where they can access drugs at the lowest cost where they want to, rather than where a fox guarding the henhouse forces the patients to a pharmacy they don’t want to use through the mail at a higher price,” Vinson said.
Vinson and independent pharmacists have repeatedly denounced PBMs’ ability to set their competitors’ prices and steer clients to their own affiliate pharmacies. They have also claimed PBMs routinely break or skirt around Arkansas’ existing laws meant to regulate them.
Act 900 of 2015 required PBMs to pay pharmacies at least the national average of what drugstores pay wholesalers for drugs, and two 2018 laws prohibited PBMs from reimbursing their affiliated pharmacies in Arkansas at a higher rate than their locally owned competitors.










These patients should not be contingent on an airplane or a FedEx truck. They should be contingent on being able to access (pharmacies) in real time.


– Rep. Brandon Achor, R-Maumelle, lead sponsor of Act 630


Three pharmacy benefit managers — OptumRx, Express Scripts and CVS Caremark, all of whom sued Arkansas over Act 624 — manage 79% of prescription drug insurance claims for approximately 270 million people, according to a July 2024 Federal Trade Commission report.
Vinson noted that even if Act 624’s lack of enforcement means nonprofit hospital pharmacies can’t provide patients with specific drugs, the existence of those pharmacies due to Act 52 still broadens patient access to other drugs.
Administrators from Baptist Health and Mercy Arkansas Hospitals both expressed support for Act 52 before lawmakers in January.
Baptist does not plan to submit an application for a retail pharmacy permit immediately but still “broadly supports the concept that hospitals should have that opportunity to fulfill the need” for more accessible medications, particularly for infusion drugs, said Jordan Burgess, Baptist’s vice president of government relations and public affairs.
Meanwhile, the Southwest Arkansas Regional Medical Center is in the process of becoming a nonprofit hospital, said Clay Hobbs, chief operating officer of Pafford Health Systems, the locally-owned medical service company that runs the hospital in Hope.
The hospital plans to take advantage of Act 52 upon becoming a nonprofit, and providing reliable access to prescription drugs in an area with few existing pharmacies will be a “great opportunity for our rural communities” in Southwest Arkansas, Hobbs said.

Ambulance provider will take over Southwest Arkansas hospital; purchase finalized last week


The State Board of Pharmacy is required to process pharmacy permit applications within a month of receiving them, and processing includes an on-site inspection of the facility, board executive director John Kirtley said in an email.
CARTI Cancer Center has 18 locations statewide, including 11 licensed pharmacies. Some of those locations are limited in what cancer drugs they can provide thanks to limited distribution networks, and Act 630 will alleviate that, CARTI CEO Adam Head told a House committee in March, speaking in favor of the legislation.
The only opponent of Act 630 before the Legislature was Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade organization representing drug manufacturers. PHRMA supported the intent of the legislation but wanted more time “to make sure there’s no harm with this new [drug] delivery system,” Sharon Lamberton, the organization’s deputy vice president of state policy and external outreach, told the same House committee.
However, Act 630 will make it easier for the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences to provide patients with specialized cancer drugs, including those from clinical trials in which UAMS participates, spokesperson Leslie Taylor said Friday.
“We’re able to get them during the clinical trials, but then once we’ve done our part to help with this, that’s over with, and we have trouble accessing the drugs directly,” Taylor said.

This is especially true of his crusade to make the workforce and higher education less diverse.
He’s had success using losing lawsuits, investigations that do nothing but burn Missouri taxpayer dollars and threatening letters that misstate the law. 
On the day that the U.S. Supreme Court ruled traditional affirmative action programs in higher education unconstitutional, Bailey sent threatening letters to Missouri universities and municipalities in which he overstated what the ruling did and implied that all efforts at fostering diversity and inclusion in Missouri must be halted.  
In April, Bailey excoriated the Business Roundtable for having “racist DEI initiatives.” He wrote he would fight “woke political trends and blatant racial discrimination.” In an impressive act of government “jawboning” that Bailey has claimed to oppose in other contexts, he threatened that such policies “risk exposing your organizations to substantial liability.”
Bailey is suing IBM, alleging the company did too much to recruit non-white and female hires. 
Diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts (the “DEI” much maligned by the far-right) help companies hire and retain qualified people who they wouldn’t easily find through traditional white male networks. Many studies and companies have explained that diversity is good for profits and innovation, and that you don’t get a diverse workforce without making an effort to recruit one.
Bailey’s court filings come shockingly close to outright stating his contrary premise: women and non-white people are inherently inferior so any increase in their representation is bad. 
IBM argued that Bailey hasn’t pleaded that any Missouri employee or job applicant was discriminated against. Indeed, this looks like Bailey preening for the national anti-diversity warriors rather than addressing a Missouri problem. 
Though you wouldn’t know it from listening to Bailey, diversity is still a permissible goal under Supreme Court precedent. And it is typical for companies to reward executives for advancing corporate goals. 
But the IBM lawsuit looks like another one where Bailey could win with a loser of a case. IBM has long been known for being a model for inclusive policies and a great place to work. IBM’s diversity council began in the ‘90s. It has touted hiring a disabled employee in 1914. But this year it ended most of its diversity efforts. We’ll see whether IBM continues to fight back against Bailey.
Whatever happens, say goodbye to IBM and similarly situated companies employing more people here. Bailey has made it clear that employers should expect legal harassment for exercising their rights to association and free speech in Missouri.
Bailey has also sued Starbucks. His brief argues that the Starbucks workforce has become “more female and less white” — and that this is unacceptable. 
Starbucks appears to be defending the values that the company professes. The company is also likely aware that if it were to abandon its reasonable efforts to have a workforce more representative of its customer base, it could lead to a boycott and a massive stock hit like Target experienced.
Shareholders have realized that reversing inclusive policies is bad for business. Shareholders voted down anti-diversity proposals overwhelmingly this proxy season.
The market has spoken. So Bailey’s latest ploy is to punish free speech in the market. 
Bailey filed lawsuits against two firms that give shareholders advice on how to vote. He claims that they have engaged in “deceptive practices” by recommending inclusive policies. This is one of his many attempts to weaponize the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, which was meant to protect Missourians from actual fraud.
But frivolous lawsuits against out-of-state corporations are not the only way to light taxpayer dollars on fire.
Bailey can burn up twice the Missouri tax dollars by having Missouri wage legal warfare against itself. See for example, Bailey’s investigation of the Hazelwood School District over an off-campus fight between students of different races, the three year lawsuit against the Springfield School District over demands to search thousands of documents for a list of possibly DEI-related terms that the District estimated would cost $170,000, or his new investigation of the City of Columbia over whether it might be trying to advance diversity and equity.
How does a successful, powerful white man come to have such resentment towards women and people of color for the modest gains we have made that he treats it as Missouri’s biggest problem? How does someone once known as a “reasonable and smart attorney” become a “warrior in the culture wars”? What could compel him to regularly use dehumanizing language about diversity proponents who merely want more people to have opportunities?
Did he get radicalized online? Bailey has filed a surprising number of lawsuits based on tweeted statements or videos. 
His IBM lawsuit cites a video circulated online. He sued Media Matters in response to an Elon Musk tweet (that lawsuit was thrown out as I predicted, but Media Matters had to cut staff due to the costs of Bailey and Musk lawsuits, so that’s another extra-legal win for Bailey). Bailey sued Planned Parenthood over a Project Veritas video, without bothering to get the unedited tape.
Another possibility is that this is how Republicans feel they need to make a name and impress Trump and MAGA. Still, I just can’t muster the cynicism to make it make sense.
Sometimes I wonder what Bailey’s mom thinks. 
I learned that Dr. Jessica Bailey was the first female dean of the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s School of Health Related Professions and a revered and beloved leader there — and a champion of diversity efforts. 
A 2022 article about her retirement describes Dr. Bailey’s mentorship and recruitment of the school’s then chief diversity and inclusion officer. In an earlier article, Dr. Bailey extolls that colleague for being “committed to providing opportunities for students who might otherwise not imagine themselves in a health care profession,” and having “the vision to recognize opportunities to make our health care work force be more representative of our Mississippi population.” 
These are goals that her son claims are unconstitutional and racist.
During Dr. Bailey’s tenure as dean, she oversaw the development of a Diversity and Inclusion Champion Professional Development and Certificate Program. She supervised PhD theses concerning the need to diversify the health work force and bone marrow donors. She was lauded for her personal involvement in a program that recruited young Black men into medical professions.
I asked Bailey’s office whether the attorney general thinks his mother was engaged in illegal “woke political trends and blatant racial discrimination” in general, or specifically with the mentorship program for Black men.
His office responded:
“Attorney General Bailey has no knowledge of these programs administered in another state, years ago, when he was not in office. What he does know is this: DEI programs that condition opportunity on skin color violate the Missouri Constitution and the foundational American promise of equality under the law. Whether it’s in corporate boardrooms, public universities, or government contracting, he will continue to fight race-based discrimination in any form. He has led on this issue since taking office.”  
That’s a clearer “yes, my mother did illegal, racist things” than I was expecting. 
Bailey is not just disavowing the work of his highly accomplished mother, who has referenced the barriers she overcame as a woman in a male dominated field and who worked to help others up the ladder. He is twisting the law to claim all such efforts are illegal.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/011325_Bailey1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.

After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo courtesy of Butte County Office of Education)Victoria Gomez de la Torre doesn’t know when — or if — the migrant children she serves are going to get the education help they’ve come to rely on.
Gomez de la Torre oversees the migrant education program for 12 central Florida counties. The federally funded service helps the children of migrant agricultural workers, who move within and between states based on planting and harvesting seasons.
Her staff identifies agricultural workers who’ve migrated to the area and helps them enroll their children in school. It also helps connect them with tutoring and medical care.
Earlier this summer, the Trump administration froze more than $6 billion in education funding, including money for migrant education, after-school programs, English-language programs for non-native speakers and other grants. Congress had already approved the money, but the administration said it wanted to conduct a review of the programs.
The administration announced July 25 it would release the remaining $5.5 billion of the money, after unfreezing $1.3 billion earlier last month.
But for Gomez de la Torre’s program, the damage had already been done: Without the money, it had to shut down this summer.

“We didn’t have enough money left over to carry the program,” said Joram Rejouis, the director of program development for the public schools in Alachua County, which includes Gainesville and is the largest of the 12 counties. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage.”
The program came to a complete halt when Gomez de la Torre’s 11 staff members were offered other positions in the school district. Throughout July, about five dozen migrant children across the 12 counties were without summer services. The funds were supposed to go out before the start of the month.
“It’s going horrendously,” said Gomez de la Torre. “Migrant families depend on us, rely on our system and our help.”
The Alachua County program serves about 1,000 to 1,200 children of migrant workers throughout the year, many in rural farming communities. Each year, roughly 17,000 migrant children are served by programs across Florida.
“It is a very valuable program for a very vulnerable population,” Rejouis said. “Definitely, stopping the program caused damage, period — for the families, for the program and for the district.”
Migrant children are less likely to have regular primary care and are more likely to face health conditions such as anemia and high blood pressure. Many migrant families who harvest food in the fields don’t have enough food themselves.
The program also helps with communication and translation among parents, teachers and guidance counselors. “We were their go-to for whenever they needed something,” Gomez de la Torre said. “Now, they don’t have us.”

The freeze in funds added to the uncertainty and fear created by the Trump administration’s broader moves to target benefits for immigrants. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recently announced it had added Head Start to the list of public programs that would be closed to immigrants who are here illegally. After the funding announcement earlier this month, a senior official said the administration had established “guardrails” to ensure the funds are not used “in violation of Executive Orders.”
“It’s anybody’s guess when we’ll come back,” Gomez de la Torre said. “If we’ll come back. If people who chose to retire will return, if their retirement can be rescinded. … Nobody knows exactly how it’s going to play out.”
A similar story is unfolding in California.
The statewide Mini Corps program, run by the Butte County Office of Education, north of Sacramento, connects migrant children at schools and labor camps with bilingual tutors who help them during the school day. Many of the tutors are former migrant children themselves, said Yvette Medina, who oversees the program.
The funding freeze forced the office to lay off around 400 workers statewide, according to spokesperson Travis Souders. Despite Friday’s announcement, the organization is waiting for official word — in writing — before reversing layoffs.
“There’s going to be many students out there who are just going to have another disadvantage to the disadvantages that we already have,” Medina said.
In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, the program was forced to shut down altogether, according to Medina.
Medina grew up in migrant labor camps, following her parents to the fields at 4 a.m. as they picked cherries and grapes before she went to school. Her parents worked throughout the Central Valley, back in Mexico and up and down the West Coast, all the way to Oregon.
“It is devastating,” she said. “If it wasn’t for the migrant program, I know for a fact there’s no way I would have graduated high school.”

 
Migrant families already are gripped with fear as the Trump administration ramps up immigration raids and arrests, which President Donald Trump insists are focused on those with criminal histories.
“They are terrified,” Gomez de la Torre said. “We had families stop sending kids to school and others who fled the country.”
Ruby Luis, a consultant who helps school districts across Florida identify and enroll migrant students in school, also was a migrant child. Her parents worked in orange groves, at strawberry and Christmas tree farms and produce-packing houses.
Program tutors read books with her and gave her school supplies. The program took her on college tours and she enrolled via a scholarship for migrant children — a first-generation college student. She eventually graduated with a degree in biology.
“Just having even somebody to talk to you about going to college — because you don’t have anybody to talk to about [that],” she said. “Having that support was really impactful.
“To take that away, and then now they just have to navigate it themselves, it creates these barriers,” Luis said. “And it can ultimately leave these children not having access to education.”

Sears.As immigrant rights are threatened daily by federal policies under the Trump administration, one of the country’s most influential immigration advocacy groups is losing its leader of more than three decades.
Gustavo Torres, who has served as executive director for 31 of his 34 years with the organization, plans to retire in November.
Before the 64-year-old civil rights advocate steps away, he’s going to strategize with his team on how to provide affordable housing, workplace rights and other services for the immigrant community.
But “My next chapter is…going to dedicate my time to my family,” Torres, who is now the youngest living sibling among eight brothers and sisters, said during a Zoom interview Tuesday while with family in Colombia, South America. “I know CASA will be in good hands.”
While a national search is underway to replace Torres, he will be honored during the organization’s 40th anniversary celebration Sept. 18.
Torres started working with the organization with three people in a church basement in Montgomery County in 1991.
Today, he said CASA has 250 staff members with its headquarters in Prince George’s County’s Langley Park neighborhood, home to one of the D.C. area’s largest concentration of Latinos. The organization also has offices in Virginia, Pennsylvania and a welcome center in Georgia that opened in 2022.
The staff, Torres said, balloons with up to 500 temporary employees hired during election seasons “because we need to keep building power in particular elections where we are located.”
Torres and his team have also increased CASA’s membership base to almost 200,000 people in 46 states and Puerto Rico.
He made CASA the most influential immigrant rights and immigrant services organization in the Mid-Atlantic region, and he’s advocated on those topics with national television appearances on C-Span, and a national rally, which he helped organize, in 2013 in Washington, D.C.
“He’s absolutely synonymous with CASA,” said Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s), who chairs the Legislative Latino Caucus.
Before Martinez’s election to the House of Delegates, he worked as a research and policy analyst for CASA from 2020 to 2022.
During Martinez’s time, he spent a month in Georgia when CASA’s sister organization, CASA In Action, helping to mobilize Latino voters during the 2020 election to get Democrats Ralphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff elected to the U.S. Senate.
“I think the biggest lesson that Gustavo taught me was about courage. He always took on fights that were worth it. He was always focused on the most marginalized among us, because he understood, if we improve their conditions, all of our lives become better,” Martinez, 29, said in an interview Thursday. “I’ve always taken that courage is the center of leadership.”
That courage from Torres continues to ensure immigration topics remain in the public discourse in Maryland. The organization has built coalitions with other advocacy groups to expand other services and programs for immigrants such as health care, voting rights and legal services.
Del. Deni Taveras (D-Prince George’s), whose legislative district includes the organization’s headquarters, said under Torres’s “fearless leadership,” several pieces of legislation became state law. Some of those include allowing residents to obtain a driver’s license regardless of their immigration status; expanding Medicaid to cover prenatal and postpartum care to those who are pregnant regardless of immigration status; and protecting residents on how to deal with immigration enforcement agents at “sensitive locations” such as a public library, public school and hospitals.
In terms of the immediate future, Taveras said, “This is an opportunity to be introspective and strategic in their [CASA leadership] thinking on how they would like to move forward. We’re going to be right there alongside them as we celebrate Gustavo, and as we work with them to see what their next chapter will look like.”
Fighting Trump, winning elections
Before President Donald Trump (R) was sworn into office in January for a second time, CASA held a “Know Your Rights” events to prepare for enforcement actions from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The organization gained experience from the first Trump administration. However, for his second term the president signed executive orders on the first day, including an order to deny citizenship to certain U.S. born children whose parents are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents.
“I never imagined that we are going to have that kind of leadership in this country,” Torres said. “We say, ‘Oh my God, we made a mistake [the first time].’ But now twice. That is no longer a mistake. Something is very rooted in our country that we need to think about what happened and why this kind of situation is happening.”
One strategy Torres proposes is simple: have politicians speak directly “to Black and brown communities where they are.” One person who he said did that was New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old state assembly member who won the city’s Democratic primary last month.
“What this gentleman did in New York was something very, very powerful,” Torres said. “He went to listen to them. As a good organizer, that is exactly what we need to do.”
He continued: “The leadership in the Democratic Party and other different institutions just go and do those polls and [look at] numbers and hire these big corporate, big companies to do the assessment and [spend] millions of dollars in the campaigns. They don’t speak about affordability. You need to listen to our community. That is how you build power and the capacity to win elections.”
‘Tough moment’
Not all 34 years with the organization have been easy.
It endured controversy in November 2023, after some members issued statements and social media posts expressing solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza that began Oct. 7 of that year.
It led some lawmakers, including Montgomery County’s Senate delegation to publicly scrutinize CASA and threatened to pull public funding. Private donors also announced they would withdraw funding. CASA released a public apology from Torres in response.
Torres acknowledged that it was “a very tough moment” for the organization.
“What I’ve learned from that is was a very difficult moment, but we are going to keep demanding for peace and dignity for everybody, for Palestinian and for Israel,” he said. “We are going to keep doing that, and that is going to be our position about that forever.”
During this year’s 90-day legislative session, CASA leaders lobbied in Annapolis for legislation to prohibit local police from entering into 287(g) agreements with ICE. On the last day of the legislative session in April, lawmakers passed a watered-down version of a bill that does not include the 287(g) ban, the biggest loss for immigration advocates this year.
Although that part of the legislation wasn’t included the sensitive locations provision was.
“This is an extraordinary victory that we got to celebrate. We are very grateful for what [the legislature] did in protection of our community,” Torres said.
And, he said advocates will be back next year to push for restriction of 287(g) agreements. One main reason, he said, stems from the Trump administration using that as “a loophole…to arrest and kidnap people who live in Maryland” such as Kilmar Abrego Garica. Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, is both a union worker and member of CASA.
“We are going back in 2026 to convince our policy makers, our friends, the governor, that it’s the right thing to do,” Torres said.
Family time
Well, Torres himself may not come back right away after his retirement becomes official. He plans to spend time with family for at least six months. He may do some work as a consultant.
“But right now, I’m focused on my family,” he said.
Torres and his wife, Sonia Mora, an assistant chief administrative officer for the Montgomery County government, don’t have children of their own, but he plans to enjoy some time with his nieces and nephews.
But before he does that, he has a message to share with Maryland’s immigrant community, including its 250,000 green card holders: “I beg you. This is so very, very important that you become U.S. citizens to protect your rights and your family’s rights,” he said. “When you are U.S. citizen, you have more rights for you and your family, and then you can register to vote and make a decision to vote for whatever you want to vote.”
Some residents, who speak limited English, fear the Trump administration’s tactics to arrest people for simply “being from a Black or brown community.”
“That is the reason why CASA exists to help you in that. We navigate all of those systems. Just call us and we take care of that,” he said. “We’re here to help.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230322TorresGustavo03-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)As the battle for Virginia’s House of Delegates heats up, both major parties are zeroing in on a small number of suburban swing districts that could ultimately decide which side holds the majority come January.
Among the most closely watched races this year are contests in Chesterfield, Williamsburg, Chesapeake, Prince William, and Hampton — five competitive districts that reflect broader political shifts in Virginia and where both parties are making heavy investments in money, message, and manpower, according to data from the Virginia Public Access Project.
While Democrats currently hold the majority, their grip on the 100-seat chamber is slim. 
With every seat on the ballot this November — along with races for governor, lieutenant governor, and attorney general — the stakes are unusually high. And both sides say they’re ready.
House Democrats are touting historic momentum this cycle, running candidates in all 100 districts for the first time in recent history — including in reliably Republican areas where they haven’t competed in years. 
Their campaign arm recently announced a $9 million TV ad reservation, covering the state’s four biggest media markets — Washington, Richmond, Norfolk, and Roanoke — with more than $8.5 million slated for the final three weeks of the campaign.
“This is how we not only protect our majority, but expand it,” said House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, in a statement. “House Democrats aren’t just reacting — we’re setting the pace. This ad buy is about making sure voters hear directly from us, early and often, about what we’re doing to protect their freedoms, lower costs, and move Virginia forward.”
Republicans, meanwhile, are focused on the districts most likely to determine the balance of power. 
While they’re fielding candidates in 83 districts — short of a full slate — party leaders say that’s by design. They argue Democrats are spreading themselves thin in unwinnable territory, while Republicans are concentrating on a narrower, more winnable map.
“They’ve got candidates in 20 of the reddest districts who are going to raise $1,000 — do you think that concerns us even a little bit?” Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake told The Mercury. “I don’t think (Democrats) have as much enthusiasm as we do.”
Peake said GOP House Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, is working hard to raise funds and support candidates across the state, particularly in the 10 to 15 districts seen as most contested. 
“We are fully competitive in all of those, with fundraising and quality candidates who are well known in their communities and working extremely hard,” he said.
Political analysts say the terrain slightly favors Democrats this year, especially in fast-changing outer suburban areas. 
“It’s no surprise that the most competitive districts right now are in Republican hands,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington. “This is an environment where Republicans are facing significant headwinds for a bunch of reasons, and that’s creating a tailwind that would help Democrats who, in other years, might be more vulnerable.”
Farnsworth pointed to the suburbs of Chesterfield County and Prince William as key bellwethers. 
“The action in this election cycle in Virginia is largely in these outer-ring suburban counties,” he said. “The rural areas tend to be very red, and the urban areas more Democratic. But those transitional places are where Republican fortunes are particularly at risk this year.”
Democrats and Republicans alike agree that a few closely contested races will likely determine the House majority — and perhaps the direction of state government under a new governor.
Here’s a closer look at five of the most competitive House districts in Virginia this year.
 House District 75

In a high-stakes rematch, Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, faces Democrat Lindsey Dougherty once again in a district that’s seen its political balance shift in recent years and that is shaping up to be this cycle’s most competitive contest. 
Covering parts of Chesterfield and Prince George counties and the city of Hopewell, this district leans slightly Republican, but not decisively. 
Vice President Kamala Harris carried it in 2024 with 52.3%, while GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump pulled 46.2%. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., performed even better, winning 54.6% to Hung Cao’s 45.2%. Yet just three years earlier, in Virginia’s previous gubernatorial election, Republican Glenn Youngkin bested Democrat Terry McAuliffe here by a solid 8-point margin.
Coyner, a moderate Republican and attorney who previously served on the Chesterfield County School Board, was first elected in 2019 after defeating Dougherty with 55.1%. She’s known for occasionally bucking her party, notably voting to abolish the death penalty and protect same-sex marriage in Virginia. 
Dougherty, originally from Knoxville, Tennessee, has made her mark in Virginia as a dedicated volunteer advocating for children’s health care and support for single mothers. 
Coyner enters the fall with a financial advantage, raising $546,436 to Dougherty’s $227,774 — despite Democrats’ broader statewide edge in campaign cash.
 House District 71

Del. Amanda Batten, R-James City County, is seeking reelection in a district where the GOP holds a narrow edge — but recent Democratic victories suggest the race could go either way. 
The 71st spans parts of James City and New Kent counties, as well as Williamsburg. Harris narrowly won the district in 2024 with 51.5%, and Kaine topped Cao here 52.3% to 47.5%. However, Youngkin beat McAuliffe in 2021 by nearly 8 points, and the area has reliably leaned red in most past cycles.
Batten, first elected in 2019, chairs the House Republican Caucus and leads the “Purple Caucus,” an informal coalition of Republicans in politically vulnerable districts. She previously worked for GOP leaders in the General Assembly. 
Her Democratic challenger, Jessica Anderson, is a lifelong Virginian from Newport News with a background in the insurance industry.
This cycle, Democrats are signaling they see an opportunity: Anderson has narrowly outraised Batten, pulling in $356,915 compared to the incumbent’s $305,863.
 House District 89

With Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake, stepping down after one term, the open-seat contest in District 89 is drawing serious attention from both parties. The district, covering parts of Chesapeake and Suffolk, leans Republican by just over two points — and recent election results paint a mixed picture. 
Harris edged Trump here in 2024, 50.1% to 47.2%, and Kaine performed even better, winning by over five points. Youngkin, however, beat McAuliffe by more than 7 points in 2021.
Republican Mike Lamonea, a retired Homeland Security special agent, is facing Democrat Karen Carnegie, an attorney and community activist with deep ties to local civic groups, including the Girl Scouts and the Ruritan Club. Carnegie’s strong community presence and local activism make her a formidable opponent in a competitive landscape.
She’s also ahead in fundraising, with $205,436 to Lamonea’s $194,811 — a tight margin that mirrors the race itself.
 House District 22

Del. Ian Lovejoy, R-Prince William, is looking to hold onto his seat in one of the most closely watched matchups in Northern Virginia. He faces a challenge from Elizabeth Guzman, who represented a neighboring district from 2018 to 2024 and is aiming for a return to the House. 
District 22 includes parts of Prince William County and leans slightly Republican.
The margins here have been razor-thin. In 2024, Harris edged Trump 49% to 47.9%, and Kaine carried the district by just over 2 points. Guzman, who unseated a longtime Republican in 2017, ran unsuccessfully for state Senate in 2022 but remains a well-known figure in the region.
She’s also leading financially, with $402,989 raised compared to Lovejoy’s $250,858. Lovejoy, a former Manassas City Ccouncil member and small business owner, won his first term in 2023 and is now defending it in what could become a costly, hard-fought race.
 House District 86

Del. A.C. Cordoza, R-Hampton, the only Black Republican in the House of Delegates, is in a tough reelection battle against Democrat Virgil Thornton in a district that has become a top target for Democrats. Covering Poquoson, parts of Hampton and York County, the 86th leans Republican — but just barely. In 2024, Harris eked out a win over Trump by 1.1 points, and Kaine took it by a margin of less than 3 points over Cao.
Cordoza won the seat in 2021 and has since attracted statewide GOP support. Concerned about holding the district, Gov. Glenn Youngkin and the full Republican statewide ticket — including Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, AG Jason Miyares, and GOP gubernatorial nominee John Reid — recently headlined a joint fundraiser for him in Hampton, despite internal fractions between the candidates. 
Thornton, a community leader running on a platform of economic justice and public safety reform, has outraised Cordoza with $149,805 to the incumbent’s $106,283 — another sign Democrats believe this district could be a sleeper flip.

Mark Warner (D-VA)at a committee hearing in the U.S. Capitol in December 2021. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virignia, recalls how over the years, he and colleagues in Congress used to say “we’re gonna get to housing next, we’re gonna get to housing next.” But it never really came, he said, and now “housing shortages are a real crisis.”
Last week, he called himself and his colleagues out for “kicking the can on housing” since before the COVID-19 pandemic. Though he and others had introduced proposals, the proposals haven’t always succeeded. But he’s encouraged this year, as a package of housing bills he helped craft advanced unanimously through the Senate’s Banking Committee. 
He said that the overall goal is helping states cut through red tape and build more housing to fit their residents’ needs. 
“‘Okay, locality, you don’t want the feds snooping into your zoning — but here, if we give you extra money or extra flexibility, will you be willing to lean in on speeding up the zoning and permitting process?’” Warner said the package proposes hypothetically.
For example, the package includes an “Innovation Fund” that would authorize $800 million to support locally-driven initiatives to expand housing supply and reduce costs. The Housing Supply Frameworks Act would direct the U.S. Housing and Urban Development department to create best-practice zoning and land-use frameworks as guidance for localities. The HOME Investment Partnerships Reauthorization and Improvement Act reauthorizes and updates HUD’s HOME Investments Partnerships Program to help localities facilitate construction of more affordable housing. 
The first bit of the housing bills Warner spoke of on a call with the Mercury was the RESIDE Act, which he co-authored with Indiana Republican Jim Banks. That bill would create a new pilot program to help communities convert vacant commercial buildings — derelict hotels, warehouses, or strip malls — into residential ones. 
“You’ve got deserted strip centers —  they’ve got water, they’ve got power, they’ve got broadband, they’ve got parking,” Warner said. 
Federal assistance can help communities get conversion projects over the finish line, he suggested. To achieve this, the program would operate under HUD to give grants to local governments seeking to acquire, site prep and rehabilitate blighted properties. 
It’s “low hanging fruit,” state senator Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said. Like the U.S. senator, he is also focused on housing legislation and no stranger to introducing it in Virginia.

Some advancing legislation in Warner’s package is similar to measures introduced by VanValkenburg and others at the state level. Not all of the ideas came to fruition, though, as they met concern or pushback from local governments.
Such was the case for a bill by VanValkenburg that would have required localities to adopt by-right zoning for multifamily housing near commercial and business districts, which are often also corridors with public transit. The bill failed, as did his proposal to give state government authority to step in when local governments failed to take steps to create affordable housing. 
Meanwhile, Warner’s Build More Housing Near Transit Act would amend a federal grant program to allow the Federal Transit Administration to give transit projects a higher rating if they are located in areas that adopt policies to encourage more housing near public transportation hubs. 
VanValkenburg noted that federal lawmakers can help accentuate state and local lawmakers’ efforts. 
“Subsidies are things that the federal government can really do to help jump start housing that state or local governments can’t always do in the same way,” he said. “Solutions are going to be solved, fastest, if all three levels of government are working together, and each level of government can bring something different.”
Other measures included in Warner’s housing package streamline efforts between different federal agencies to reduce funding or approval delays for things like new rural housing or preservation of existing rural homes, enhance transparency on loans for veteran homebuyers, and fund a pilot program for grants and loans to help low-and-moderate-income homeowners or certain landlords address critical home repairs and health hazards to preserve affordable housing stock. 
With an estimated shortage of 4.5 million homes nationally, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, lawmakers at all levels are exploring how the public sector can help the private sector. 
Dubbed the Bipartisan ROAD to Housing Act, Warner is hopeful that the housing package stands a good chance to become law. 
The fact that the committee voted unanimously, he said, is something he feels “pretty darn good about.”

Glenn Youngkin wants to bring a small modular nuclear reactor (SMR) to Southwest Virginia in the course of the next decade. The administration has put together a small amount of funding to search for a larger amount of funding to pay for a study. One of the study questions is what they would use the reactor for – research, possibly, and to provide electricity for the University of Virginia at Wise, or perhaps a data center that the region has yet to attract.
Virginia takes steps to bring advanced nuclear reactor to Wise County

If this all sounds a little sketchy, that’s because SMRs remain a little sketchy. Nuclear companies haven’t yet demonstrated they can attain the holy grail of safe, 24/7 carbon-free power at a competitive cost.  
It’s not for lack of trying. At last count, the Nuclear Energy Agency was tracking some 98 different design technologies around the world for SMRs ranging in size from 1 MW microreactors to utility-scale reactors of more than 300 MW. Only a handful of these have reached the construction phase, and none are operational in the U.S. 
This meager track record hardly reflects the enthusiasm surrounding the industry. It’s not just politicians and profit-seekers; many climate advocates believe the industry must succeed if the world is to have any hope of transitioning our energy supply away from fossil fuels. And polling shows that 56% of the public supports building more nuclear plants. That’s way less than the levels of support for wind and solar but more than support for fracking and coal mining. Still, concerns remain about safety and the proliferation of nuclear waste, a problem neither the industry nor the government yet has a strategy to deal with.
And then there’s the cost. SMRs haven’t shown an ability to compete in the energy marketplace, even against other carbon-free alternatives. As renewable energy and storage technologies continue to drop in price, the economic case for new nuclear remains an open question. 
Nonetheless, both of Virginia’s publicly-owned utilities are exploring SMRs, having secured legislation last year that will allow them to charge customers for millions of dollars in early development costs. Appalachian Power is targeting a site near Lynchburg (not Southwest Virginia), while Dominion Energy says it is evaluating the feasibility of an SMR next to its existing conventional reactors at North Anna. 
Dominion’s 2024 integrated resource plan shows an SMR could be part of its power mix as early as 2035; APCo has no timeline. For either utility, actually building an SMR will require making the economic case to the State Corporation Commission.  
The slow timeline and cloudy cost picture have not dampened enthusiasm for nuclear among Virginia’s elected leaders. The data center boom is exacerbating a shortage of energy and causing utility bills to skyrocket. Keeping the party going means making messy tradeoffs between polluting fuels with volatile prices and low-cost but land-hungry solar. No wonder Youngkin and other leaders hope nuclear will magically allow them to sidestep the hard decisions and party on.
Energy demands, regulations and federal funding challenge Virginia Clean Economy Act

But wishful thinking doesn’t put megawatts on the grid. A recent article surveying the state of the nuclear industry makes it clear that these are early times in the nuclear renaissance, if such it is. The industry won’t be able to scale unless and until production-line manufacturing becomes a reality, and that will be years from now. 
Fortunately for the nuclear industry, it has always been a darling of U.S. policymakers, and that remains true. Nuclear subsidies survived the axe in this year’s Republican budget law, while tax credits for wind and solar were revoked. 
Indeed, President Donald J. Trump is doing his best to further the industry’s prospects, albeit in a ham-handed fashion that almost seems calculated to erode public trust. 
Last month a representative of his Department of Government Efficiency reportedly told the head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, charged with ensuring the safety of the industry, that it was expected to provide “rubber stamp” approval to nuclear plant applications after they were tested by the Department of Energy or Defense. A few days later, Trump dismissed all but one of the members of the U.S. Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which provides oversight of spent fuel storage.  
These alarming moves may not do much to dampen the enthusiasm of the Youngkin administration and other boosters. The administration even hopes to lure nuclear manufacturing to Virginia – but it would be in Lynchburg, not Southwest Virginia. 
That calls into question Youngkin’s claims of economic benefits for an SMR in Wise County. If the SMR would be just a one-off for “research” purposes and needs a rich company or state-supported customer to buy the electricity, is it really an investment in the region, or a solution in search of a problem?
Many local residents are skeptical of the administration’s plans, trusting neither the governor nor the nuclear industry. Sharon Fisher, one of the leaders of the Southwest Virginia Nuclear Watch grassroots movement, told me in an email that her group “has extensively researched the nuclear industry with its enormous costs and contaminations.” 
 She pointed me to a 2023 study of health trends in a Tennessee county where a company called Nuclear Fuel Services generates highly enriched uranium fuels for naval reactors. Over the years, unintended releases of enriched uranium, plutonium and other substances have caused an accumulation of radioactivity in the local air, water, and food. The study documented rising cancer and mortality rates in the county, including a rate of premature deaths that is 61% above the U.S. average.   
Rees Shearer, an activist with the Appalachian Peace Education Center, told me in a phone call that SMRs are “the next wave of exploitation” of Southwest Virginia’s resources.
“First they came for the timber, then they came for the coal, now they are coming with radioactivity,” Shearer said.
He explained, “Coal left a terrible legacy of abandoned mines, polluted creeks, and leaking methane. But this pales compared to the potential legacy of high-level nuclear waste stored on site. With SMRs, the amount of this waste can be 100 times more per megawatt than conventional nuclear. This is waste that will last millions of years. This isn’t a fair trade.”
An SMR would also come with the risk of terrorism, either from hacking or a drone attack. “It makes a place that was never a target into a target,” he noted.
Both Fisher and Shearer challenged the notion that SMRs would provide jobs for Wise County residents, even in the construction phase. Modular facilities would be manufactured offsite and assembled by an expert crew from out of the area. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has even approved remote operation of nuclear reactors from an offsite facility, they pointed out.
Well-paying jobs are certainly a priority for the area. Unemployment rates for Southwest Virginia counties have risen only slightly from their Biden-era lows, but poverty rates in some counties remain stubbornly high.
But Fisher says the key to a healthy economy lies in diversification. 
“Wise County was once a major producer of apples. We have vineyards and breweries, and fields for growing grains. Tourism is growing. (We should be) investing in local entrepreneurs and farmers. (And) getting equitable tax revenues from the thousands of large absentee landholdings, which should be used for housing and development.” 
Energy jobs needn’t be off the table, but, said Shearer, “We think the better approach is to put solar on the abandoned mines. We have a ready workforce already trained to do this.” He pointed to an effort already underway that’s being spearheaded by the environmental group Appalachian Voices. 
What the region shouldn’t do, concluded Fisher, is “rely on one industry again that puts our lives and land at tremendous risk.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)On Aug. 1, New York became the sixth state to offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Federal employees may start seeing and hearing more about religion in the workplace, following new guidance from the Trump administration.
All federal employees must be allowed to express their religion at work, the Office of Personnel Management told agencies in a memo last week — as long as it doesn’t interfere with business operations.
Park rangers, for instance, can join a group in prayer when leading a national park tour. And doctors working at a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital can pray over patients for their recovery, OPM explained. Security guards are also allowed to display religious items at the front desk of a federal office building.
And as long as it doesn’t rise to the level of harassment, OPM said federal employees are also allowed to try to persuade their coworkers of the “correctness of their own religious views.”
“During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,” OPM said. “However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request.”
OPM Director Scott Kupor said in the memo that agencies should “robustly protect and enforce” federal employees’ religious expressions in the workplace “to the greatest extent possible.”
“Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,” Kupor said. “This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths. Under President Trump’s leadership, we are restoring constitutional freedoms and making government a place where people of faith are respected, not sidelined.”

OPM clarified that agencies cannot punish federal employees for expressing their religious beliefs at the office — for instance, by having religious items displayed on their desks, wearing clothing or jewelry with religious symbols, or discussing religion with coworkers. Federal employees can also display upcoming religious events on communal bulletin boards in the workplace.
Federal supervisors and non-supervisors should also be treated the same when it comes to the ability to freely express their religion, according to OPM’s new guidance. If an employee is unwilling to engage in religious conversations with a supervisor, however, OPM said that the employee cannot be disciplined for it.
Jim Eisenmann, a federal employment attorney and partner at Alden Law Group, said affording more flexibility to federal supervisors in their religious expressions may still lead to some blurred lines in the workplace.
“Supervisors are in a special position in the federal workforce. They hold power and control over employees, employee assignments and employee performance appraisals,” Eisenmann said. “In the past, supervisors had to be very discerning and careful about having any discussions about religion or having religious displays in their offices. They were discouraged from doing that because people could perceive it a certain way, and it could lead to complaints of religious discrimination.”
Under the new guidance, agencies also have to let federal employees privately engage in religious expressions in the workplace. But agencies can still limit the amount of time and determine the places that federal employees are allowed to do so, OPM said.
Federal employees are allowed to engage in religious expressions in groups as well — as long as those expressions don’t happen during “on-duty time,” OPM said. For instance, OPM explained that if an employee asks a supervisor to shut down a coworkers’ gathering for prayer in an empty conference room, the supervisor should “politely” say that the coworkers’ gathering is allowed, and that it can continue.
The guidance for “on-duty time,” however, may also lead to some confusion about when employees are or aren’t technically working, and when they are allowed to express their religion, Eisenmann said.
“The vast majority of federal employees are not punching a clock, so it’s not going to be clear,” Eisenmann said. “If I knock on my boss’ office door and ask to chat, and they’re just reading the Bible, do I know they’re on a break? To me, the distinction can be lost.”

OPM’s guidance comes after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in February, calling for the eradication of “anti-Christian bias.” Trump’s order established a new task force responsible, in part, for reviewing agencies’ activities to identify and eliminate any “anti-Christian policies, practices or conduct,” the White House said in a Feb. 6 fact sheet.
The VA, for one, launched a task force in April to investigate instances of “anti-Christian bias” — in particular, seeking cases where employees believed they were denied promotions for religious reasons, or faced retaliation for seeking a religious exemption to vaccine mandates.
The new guidance aligns with the unanimous June 2023 Supreme Court decision in Groff v. DeJoy, which determined that all employers, including federal agencies, must grant religious accommodations to employees, unless doing so would create an “undue hardship” to business operations. The court’s decision made it harder for employers in and out of government to deny religious accommodations in the workplace.
OPM additionally referenced protections of religious freedom for individuals, including federal employees, afforded under Title VII and the Constitution.
The new guidance is OPM’s second action this month, calling for more flexibility for federal employees “of faith.” On July 16, OPM also encouraged agencies to grant telework exemptions to federal employees for religious purposes — carving out some limited exceptions to Trump’s broad return-to-office orders across the executive branch. The Trump administration said federal employees can request exemptions to telework, for instance, when observing religious holidays, attending services or fasting.
“The federal workforce should be a welcoming place for federal employees who practice a religious faith,” Kupor said. “Allowing religious discrimination in the federal workplace violates the law. It also threatens to adversely impact recruitment and retention of highly-qualified employees of faith.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-475978260-1024x697.jpg,,,2025-08-04 07:57:10.850049

Offshore wind leasing is effectively dead in the U.S. following a Trump administration order issued last week.


Large swaths of U.S. waters that had been identified by federal agencies as ideal for offshore wind are no longer eligible for such developments under an Interior Department statement released Wednesday.


In the four-sentence statement, the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) said the U.S. government is ​“de-designating over 3.5 million acres of unleased federal waters previously targeted for offshore wind development across the Gulf of America, Gulf of Maine, the New York Bight, California, Oregon, and the Central Atlantic.”


The move comes just a day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered his staff to stop ​“preferential treatment for wind projects” and falsely called wind energy ​“unreliable.” Analysts say that offshore wind power can be a reliable form of carbon-free energy, especially in New England, where the region’s grid operator has called it critical to grid stability. It also follows the Trump administration’s monthslong assault on the industry, which has included multiple attacks on in-progress projects.
Amid federal setbacks, Maine ‘closely tracking’ development of Canadian offshore wind



The outlook was already grim for new offshore wind leasing activity following President Donald Trump’s executive order in January that introduced a temporary ban on the practice. Wednesday’s announcement makes that policy more definitive. Wind power advocates say it will erase several years of work from federal agencies and local communities to determine the best possible areas for wind development.


“My read on this is that there is not going to be any leasing for offshore wind in the near future,” said a career employee at the Interior Department, who Canary Media granted anonymity to speak freely for fear of retribution.


Figuring out the best spot to place offshore wind is an involved undertaking. The proposed areas start off enormous and, according to the Interior staffer, undergo a careful, multiyear winnowing process to settle on the official ​“wind energy area.” Smaller lease areas are later carved out of these broader expanses.

Take the process for designating the wind energy area known as ​“Central Atlantic 2,” which started back in 2023 and is now dead in the water.


The draft area — or ​“call area” — started out as a thick belt roughly 40 miles wide and reached from the southernmost tip of New Jersey to the northern border of South Carolina, according to maps on BOEM’s website. Multiple agencies, including the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, and NASA, then provided input on where that initial area might have been problematic. NASA, for example, maintains a launch site on Virginia’s Wallops Island and in 2024 found that nearby wind turbines could interfere with the agency’s instrumentation and radio frequencies.


The winnowing didn’t stop there. By 2024, according to BOEM’s website, its staff was hosting in-person public meetings from Atlantic City, New Jersey, to Morehead City, North Carolina, to gather input from fishermen, tourism outfitters, and other stakeholders. Under a wind-friendly administration, a final designation and lease sale notice would have likely been released this year or by 2026, based on a timeline posted to BOEM’s website.


But the Trump administration is no friend to offshore wind.


Trump officials have repeatedly targeted wind projects by pulling permits and even halting one wind farm during construction. Last month, Trump’s ​“big, beautiful bill” sent federal tax credits to an early grave, requiring wind developers who want to use the incentives to either start construction by July 2026 or place turbines in service by the end of 2027. The move is particularly devastating for offshore projects not already underway. Currently, five major offshore wind farms are under construction in the U.S., and when they come online, they will help states from Virginia to Massachusetts meet their rising energy demand with carbon-free power.


Wednesday’s order halts all work on Central Atlantic 2 and similar areas, like one near Guam, and also revokes completely finalized wind energy areas with strong state support. One example is in the Gulf of Maine, where Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, has been a fierce advocate for the emerging renewable sector.


These wind energy areas could hypothetically be re-designated by a future administration or the policy reversed, according to the Interior Department employee. Still, in the best case, that means developers will have to wait several more years for new lease areas to become available, further slowing down an industry whose projects already take many years to go through permitting and construction.

Ever since North Carolina legislators established the so-called “Opportunity Scholarships” school voucher program, sponsors and proponents have pitched it as a means of helping low-income students escape struggling public schools.
Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, a new report from the Department of Public Instruction shows that this was all baloney. The DPI researchers found that just sixty-seven hundred of the state’s eighty-thousand-plus vouchers in the current school year went to students who had attended a North Carolina public school in the prior year.
And while the data for kindergartners
were not yet available, it’s clear that as much as ninety percent or more of new vouchers in 24-25 were for students who have never attended a public school.
In other words, the vast majority of voucher money is going to parents – most of them well-off – who never had any intention of sending their kids to public schools.
The bottom line: School vouchers in our state have nothing to do with quote “opportunity” and everything to do with undermining and privatizing public education. Other explanations are simply false.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Millions of dollars in federal budget cuts to public media have been finalized by President Donald Trump, but state lawmakers in Ohio also made budget cuts in funds mean for public broadcasting, including services for the blind.
Trump signed away $9 billion in previously approved spending on July 24, which included more than $1 billion to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for the next two fiscal years. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting distributes federal funds to public media stations including NPR and PBS affiliates in Ohio.
The U.S. House cleared the legislation on a mostly party-line vote, with only one Ohio Republican, Rep. Mike Turner, voting against the measure. All House Democrats voted against it.
But lesser known cuts were made in the state budget, via earmarks in the Broadcast Educational Media Commission.
The commission is a independent state agency that has been around for 60 years. The mission statement for the commission says it seeks to support and fund public television and radio services, including delivering “educational programming and broadcasting solutions statewide.”

The commission “seeks to expand the knowledge of Ohio’s citizens through promotion of educational broadcasting products, funding of the state’s broadcast affiliates and organizations, and collaboration with stakeholders and advocates of technology-driven education,” according to the state’s official website on the commission.
The site states the commission provides “financial assistance and technical services” to eight public TV stations, 15 public radio stations, and six “radio reading services” for the blind.
Those receiving operating subsidies distributed through the commission include The Ohio Channel, which provides recorded and livestream access to government press conferences and meetings, including Ohio General Assembly hearings and sessions.
In total, the state budgeted $10.6 million each to the commission in fiscal years 2024 and 2025.
The newest state budget, signed by Gov. Mike DeWine at the end of June, reduces the commission’s budget by 3% in 2026 and 5% in 2027. While it still includes support for The Ohio Channel and Ohio’s Statehouse News Bureau, among others, earmarks for specific resources have been cut.
DeWine’s budget proposed up to $965,000 in each fiscal year to be distributed equally among “Ohio’s educational television stations for the production of interactive instructional programming, with priority given to resources aligned with state academic content standards,” according to budget documents.
But the final budget included Ohio Senate-introduced changes, providing more than $120,000 less than the governor’s proposal in fiscal year 2026, and more than $240,000 less in 2027.
More funding intended to support public educational television and radio operations was cut from DeWine’s proposed $2.65 million in each fiscal year, to $2.3 million in 2026 and $1.9 million in 2027.
A third line item under the Broadcast Educational Media Commission’s budget is specifically intended for radio reading services for the blind. While DeWine’s budget set the earmark at up to $294,000 each for the next two years, the legislature ended up cutting that appropriation by more than $37,000 in 2026 and more than $75,000 in 2027.
Outlets in the state are now preparing to lose their shares of the federal funding, with many worried about smaller local stations who serve as the only news outlets for certain areas, and as emergency alert stations as well.
Luke Dennis, general manager of WYSO in Yellow Springs, told the Capital Journal earlier this month that public media is, “in many places, the only media,” and for those without internet access or the ability to afford it, public media can mean the only source of needed information.
“There’s a very well-established infrastructure for emergency alerts that are made possible through public media,” Dennis said as the federal funding cuts were still being discussed.
WYSO could be looking at about $300,000 in cuts on the federal side, and that may mean a new budget plan. Dennis said that back up plan for funding comes at a time when the station is newly independent, and working on a “lean and mean” budget.
Ideastream, which partners with the state to provide The Ohio Channel’s services, said in June they may have to look at “consolidation” because of the cuts.

Houston Gaines, an Athens Republican, became the first major contender to announce a bid for Georgia's 10th Congressional District. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder (file photo)It had only been roughly 72 hours since U.S. Rep. Mike Collins launched his run for U.S. Senate before we landed our first big candidate for his congressional seat.
State Rep. Houston Gaines, a Republican from Athens, announced Thursday that he’s running in what is likely to become a crowded primary for Collins’ District 10 congressional seat, which reaches across 18 counties from the eastern edges of metro Atlanta to the South Carolina state line.
“Being your State Representative for the last seven years has been the honor of a lifetime,” Gaines said in a note on social media announcing his congressional run. “Together, we’ve accomplished so much. But it’s time to take the fight to Washington, D.C. If we’re ever going to turn this country around, we need good, common sense people to run for Congress to help President Trump continue to deliver for the American people.”
Gaines’ candidacy is far from a surprise. A former student body president at the University of Georgia, the young legislator was always thought to have congressional aspirations but had declined to run in previous open races for this seat. 
The then-23-year-old Gaines first arrived at the state Capitol in 2018 after defeating Democratic State Rep. Deborah Gonzalez in a competitive district that combined liberal Athens-Clarke County with a trio of Republican-friendly counties nearby. He has routinely won re-election by wide margins in the years since.
In the statehouse, Gaines wasted no time climbing the Republican ranks: He now serves as the vice chair of the House Appropriations Committee and also holds a caucus leadership role. As a Republican lawmaker from a left-leaning college town, Gaines has repeatedly butted heads with his hometown’s liberal city officials over immigration and law enforcement. He is also an important political ally and personal friend of Gov. Brian Kemp, whose Athens home lies in Gaines’ legislative district.
Gaines is hoping to cement his status as an early frontrunner, raising more than half a million dollars in his first 24 hours in the race. But other Republicans are likely to join the race soon.
Topping the list of potential candidates is Collins’ predecessor, former U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, who left Congress in 2022 to wage a Trump-backed bid for Secretary of State. And Paul Broun, another ex-congressman who ironically gave up his seat for an ill-fated Senate run, is said to be eyeing a return to Washington.
Two names you can’t expect to hear? State Sens. Brian Strickland of McDonough and Bill Cowsert of Athens, who are both running in the Republican primary for state attorney general and just so happen to be residents of GA-10.
On the Democratic side, 2024 nominee Lexy Doherty is running for the second time. But any Democrat will face long odds in a district where roughly three of every five voters backed President Donald Trump last year over Vice President Kamala Harris.
“We need our government to work with us, not against us, to make a better life for us and our families,” Doherty told the AJC. “And all we’ve gotten this year from extremists like Collins is chaos and corruption while the ultrarich take tighter control of Washington.”

The alarm rings early for work, but sleep is short, and exhaustion looms large over ever-accumulating bills and a monthly paycheck that won’t stretch far enough. With fingers crossed, the car — on its last legs but too expensive to repair — starts up. Otherwise, it could have been a late arrival to the office or a full day of missed wages. These experiences aren’t an anomaly for ALICE. They’re an everyday reality.
Despite facing persistent challenges, our ALICE neighbors continually step up and serve our communities, including on the front lines of local nonprofits.
According to Zip Recruiter, the average nonprofit salary in Arkansas is $36,000. Meanwhile, for a Pulaski County household with just one adult and a child under the age of two, the survival budget — the minimum cost to live and work in today’s economy — is $49,380.
Today, our ALICE neighbors are working harder than ever, particularly those in the nonprofit sector. When economic uncertainty rises, so does our collective need for services. Combine that with dwindling federal funding, and charitable organizations already under tight budgets are now doing more with fewer resources. At the same time, employees of these organizations, who often wear multiple hats, are taking on additional responsibilities for the same pay.
So, how can we better support ALICE employees while advancing their efforts on behalf of our community? A great place to start is empowering nonprofits — and organizations of all sectors — to implement policies and procedures that create environments where all employees can thrive. With a more equitable workplace, data shows that individuals feel more engaged, which in turn improves productivity, reduces turnover and creates stronger organizations.
That’s just what ALICE@Work aims to do. With the support of the Heart of Arkansas United Way, Blue & You Foundation, Entergy Arkansas, Delta Dental of Arkansas Foundation and Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, business and nonprofit leaders are uncovering the unique challenges that their ALICE employees face.
First up were financial institutions. Now, Central Arkansas nonprofits are participating in the second ALICE@Work cohort. During the process, they’ll complete a workforce assessment and receive regular education in five key areas: benefits and compensation, scheduling and flexibility, professional development, work support and resources, and financial wellness. This hands-on training will enable organizations to develop individualized action plans in alignment with their culture and values.
ALICE@Work is a pragmatic solution to tackling systemic challenges for our state, where nearly half of Arkansas households struggle to make ends meet. As our neighbors’ needs grow and the federal funding landscape continues to evolve, this initiative benefits not only ALICE workers but participating organizations and the broader community. By recognizing the vital role ALICE workers play in our organizations, we can help strengthen our state together.",,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

Despite the strength of the U.S. economy, the gap between rich and poor Americans is increasing.

The wealthiest 1% of Americans have more than five times as much wealth as the bottom 50%, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. That’s up from four times as much in the year 2000. In 2024 alone, the wealthiest 19 families got a total of US$1 trillion richer – the largest one-year increase on record.
And yet 59% of Americans don’t have enough money saved up to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense.
We are political scientists who study human rights and political economy.
In a 2023 study, our team looked at 145 countries, including the U.S., to understand the link between labor rights and inequality. We found evidence that strengthening collective labor rights may reduce economic inequality.
 Empowering workers

Collective labor rights include the rights to form and join a union, bargain collectively for higher pay and better working conditions, go on strike, and get justice if employers punish workers who exercise these rights.
In the U.S., where less than 10% of workers belong to unions, union members typically earn higher wages than their nonunion counterparts.
Through negotiations on behalf of their members, unions can pressure employers to provide fair wages and benefits. If negotiations break down, the union can call for a strike – sometimes winning better benefits and higher wages as a result.
Some U.S. unions don’t have the right to strike, including air traffic controllers, teachers and those working on national security issues. But most unions have some ability to implement work stoppages and impose costs on employers to negotiate for raises and better benefits and conditions.
 Reducing inequality

For our study, we analyzed the human rights in the CIRIGHTS dataset, which uses human rights reports from the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International and other sources to measure government respect for 24 human rights, including the rights to unionize and bargain collectively. The dataset is produced by the University of Rhode Island, Binghamton University and the University of Connecticut. One of us, Skip Mark, serves as a co-director of the project.
Using a scoring guide, a team of researchers reads human rights reports and gives each country a score of zero if they have widespread violations, one point if they have some violations, or two if they have no evidence of violations. The team has assigned scores for all 24 rights from 1994 through 2022.
Using this data, we created a measure of collective labor rights by adding scores for the right to workplace association and the right to collective bargaining. The resulting collective labor rights score ranges from zero to four.
Countries where workers’ rights are routinely violated, such as Afghanistan, China and Saudi Arabia, scored a zero. The United States, Macedonia and Zambia, three countries with little in common, were among those that tended to get two points, placing them in the middle. Countries with no reported violations of the rights to workplace association and collective bargaining, including Canada, Sweden and France, got four points.
According to the CIRIGHTS dataset, the strength of respect for collective labor rights around the world declined by 50%, from 2.06 in 1994 to 1.03 in 2022.


At the same time, according to the World Inequality Dataset, the share of income earned by the 1% with the biggest paychecks increased by 11%.
We used advanced statistical methods to figure out whether better worker protections actually reduce inequality or are just associated with it.


 Gaps between individuals and ethnic groups

We also measured what’s been happening to economic inequality, using two common ways to track it.
One of them is vertical inequality, the gap between what people earn within a country – the rich versus the poor. The more unequal a society becomes, the higher its vertical inequality score gets. We measured it using the disposable income measure from the Gini index, a commonly used indicator of economic inequality that captures how much money individuals have to spend after taxes and government transfers.
We found that a one-point increase in collective labor rights on our four-point scale reduces vertical inequality by 10 times the average change in inequality. For the U.S., a one-point increase in collective labor rights would be about enough to undo the increase in inequality that occurred between 2008 and 2010 due to the Great Recession and its aftermath. It would also likely help stem the growing wealth gap between Black and white Americans. That’s because income disparities compound over time to create wealth gaps.
We also assessed the connection between horizontal inequality, which measures income inequality between ethnic or other groups, and collective labor rights.
Negative horizontal inequality measures the amount of a country’s income held by the poorest ethnic group. Higher scores for this metric indicate that the lowest-earning ethnic group has less income relative to the rest of society. Black Americans have the lowest median income of any racial or ethnic group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Positive horizontal inequality measures the income earned by the richest ethnic group. When positive horizontal inequality rises, that means the richest ethnic group has more income relative to the rest of society. According to the same Census Bureau report, Asian Americans had the highest median earnings.
We found that stronger collective labor rights, both in law and in practice around the world, also reduce both types of horizontal inequality. This means they raise the floor by helping to improve the income of the poorest ethnic groups in society. They also close the gap by limiting the incomes of the richest ethnic group, which can reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
That is, our findings suggest that when workers are free to advocate for higher wages and better benefits for themselves, it also benefits society as a whole.

Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

When election officials flagged the naturalized U.S. citizen’s voter registration for possible removal last August, the Dutch native fought back.
Hazelhoff, then a 67-year-old college instructor, sued to stop Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican, from seeking to kick him and more than 3,200 other registered voters off the rolls. The lawsuit was part of a multifront legal challenge led by him and three other voters, along with voting rights groups and the Biden-era U.S. Department of Justice.
A federal judge halted Alabama’s effort within weeks — and Hazelhoff voted in his first presidential election last November without incident.
Ten months later, Hazelhoff is watching with deep concern as the Department of Justice, in President Donald Trump’s second term, is demanding that states turn over their voter registration lists and other election information, citing unspecified concerns with voter list maintenance.
“My initial reaction was of sadness that this could happen but that still a mistake could be made,” Hazelhoff, who lives in the Birmingham area, told Stateline. “Now, I’m more in a stance of saying this is the most fundamental right afforded to citizens of the United States, and I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.”
The Trump administration’s effort to scoop up voter registration lists and other information from a growing number of states underscores how state-controlled voter lists are a major battleground in fights over access to the polls. The Justice Department told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it will eventually contact all states, an association spokesperson wrote in an email.

Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have so far declined to provide full voter registration lists to the department amid questions over the legality of the requests and uncertainty over how the information will be used. Maine Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that federal officials can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The Justice Department declined a Stateline request for comment.
Even before states began tangling with the department, how election officials oversee these lists — including when and why voters can be removed — was under increasing scrutiny. The stakes for voters are foundational: How states maintain the lists determines who is on them — and therefore who is able to vote. Power over voter registration lists is the power to shape the electorate.
“Voting should be easy, not akin to trying to get a U.S. passport when it’s been lost or stolen and you’re in Nicaragua, you know what I’m saying?” Hazelhoff said. “It should be something that we encourage and this is not encouraged. This is the exact opposite.”
Some states in recent years have signed up for competing systems to help identify duplicate or noncitizen voter registrations, after the largest operation came under fire from Trump. Election officials in some states have also entered into ad hoc agreements with some of their counterparts to share data.
Other states continue to tighten voter list maintenance requirements as well. New Hampshire legislators in June approved a bill requiring local officials to verify voter lists annually instead of once a decade; the governor signed the bill on Friday. Idaho lawmakers passed a bill, signed by the governor in April, that requires state agencies to share data with the state secretary of state to help check the accuracy of voter registrations.
Chief election officials in some states tout their annual or regular elimination of registrations.
Georgia Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger announced in mid-July that his office was sending cancellation mailers to 477,883 inactive registrants. Last week, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, directed local election officials to begin a new round of removals. The registrations will be eligible for cancellation in 2029 following a federally mandated notification process, he said in a news release.
The Trump administration is also pushing states to use a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services tool, typically used to determine the immigration status of people seeking government benefits, to identify noncitizen registered voters. The agency now allows state and local officials to conduct bulk searches using the tool, the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, program, instead of one at a time.










I am a legal citizen of this country and I will fight for that right.


– Roald Hazelhoff, a naturalized U.S. citizen who sued after his Alabama voter registration was made inactive


Voter fraud and noncitizen voting rarely occur. But Trump’s false claims of a stolen election in 2020, along with an uptick in anti-immigrant sentiment among conservatives before last year’s election, has driven attention to the voter registration lists.
Election officials and voting rights activists across the political spectrum agree accurate, up-to-date voter rolls ensure that elections remain secure. They split over how to balance cleaning the lists with protecting voters from accidental deletion — and where to draw the line between legitimate maintenance and politically driven purges.
“It has to be done fairly. It has to be done transparently. And it has to be done legally,” said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that often challenges voter restrictions in court, including the Alabama effort.
“I think that any time you are doing voter list maintenance in a way that disenfranchises more people or is careless, then there has to be a hard ‘no’ on things like that,” Stewart said in an interview.
New Hampshire Secretary of State David Scanlan, a Republican, said he wants to find a middle ground where “everything is balanced.”
Scanlan declined to provide the Justice Department with his state’s voter rolls. He wrote in a July 25 letter that state law doesn’t authorize him to release the list to the department. Still, he noted that under the law the department could obtain voter lists by contacting local election officials.
In an interview, Scanlan also predicted the New Hampshire legislation requiring annual verification wouldn’t be an onerous change and would improve the accuracy of the rolls. He said he wants a system that makes voting easy, but one that’s also transparent and ensures everyone casting a ballot is a legitimate voter.
“I think that’s where we’re headed,” Scanlan said. “It’s not a straight line to get there.”
Undermining ERIC
Trump helped usher in the current era of division over cleaning voter rolls in March 2023 by attacking the Electronic Registration Information Center, or ERIC, and calling on states to pull out of the group. He posted on social media at the time that it “‘pumps the rolls’ for Democrats and does nothing to clean them up.”
Within months, eight Republican-led states had withdrawn.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit allows member states to submit voter registration and motor vehicle department data. It also has access to Social Security death data and address change information from the U.S. Postal Service.
ERIC then identifies potential duplicate and out-of-date registrations, dead voters and possible illegal voting. Member states also reach out to individuals who are likely eligible to vote but haven’t registered, a requirement that angers some Republicans.
Some Democrats are now quick to point out what they see as the irony of Trump’s Justice Department voicing concerns with voter list maintenance practices after the president undermined ERIC — a system they say is effective in helping states clean their voter rolls.
“It is an extra layer of … hypocrisy and ridiculousness that they would turn around and be critical of the one organization” ensuring voter rolls are clean and up to date in its member states, said New York state Sen. James Skoufis, a Democrat who sponsored a bill passed by the state legislature to require New York to join ERIC. The measure hasn’t been delivered to the governor.
Twenty-five states — a mix of red and blue states, as well as presidential swing states such as Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania — and the District of Columbia currently use ERIC. In an email, ERIC Executive Director Shane Hamlin wrote that the organization remains committed to attracting new members. Hamlin cited the New York legislation and noted that Hawaii recently joined.
Republican states haven’t coalesced around a single alternative to ERIC, but an Alabama-led system comes closest. The Alabama Voter Integrity Database, or AVID, includes Alabama and 10 other mostly Southern states; the latest state, Virginia, joined in late May.
The Alabama secretary of state’s office, which maintains the database, didn’t respond to multiple interview requests or written questions from Stateline.
Why Republican-led states keep leaving a group that verifies voter rolls

“Voter file maintenance is the foundation of election integrity,” Allen, the Alabama secretary of state, said in a June news release. “Ensuring that Alabama’s voter file is the cleanest and most accurate voter file in the country has been a top priority of mine since day one.”
As states weigh the value of ERIC and AVID, some election officials aren’t racing to pick a side.
Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane, a Republican, said ERIC likely isn’t the right solution, though he said he had no reason to criticize it. To have an effective system, every state needs information from their neighboring states, as well as the states where their “snow birds” go, he said.
He identified those states as Florida in the East, Texas in the Midwest and California and Arizona in the West. Florida and Texas belong to AVID, while Arizona belongs to ERIC. California belongs to neither.
“We need a broader solution. … It’s tough in this environment, where everyone’s guards are up on the political spectrum,” McGrane said in an interview.
‘A total shock’
In Alabama, Hazelhoff said his experience demonstrates the nightmare that can unfold when voter roll cleaning crosses the line into an illegal purge.
“That was a total shock when that happened,” said Hazelhoff, who was born in the Netherlands, moved to the United States in 1977 and became a citizen in 2022.
In August 2024, he received a letter from the Board of Registrars in Jefferson County, where he lives, informing him his voter registration had been made inactive and that “you have been placed on a path for removal from the statewide voter list.”
Republicans scrutinize voting rolls and ramp up for mass challenges ahead of election

The reason, the letter said, was that Allen had provided information showing Hazelhoff was issued a noncitizen identification number by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security while also being a registered voter.
After Hazelhoff and others sued, U.S. District Court Judge Anna M. Manasco, a Trump appointee, ruled that Allen had blown past a deadline in federal law that prohibits systematic purges of ineligible voters less than 90 days before a federal election.
Allen had announced his purge 84 days before the election, she wrote, and had later admitted his purge list included thousands of U.S. citizens. He had also referred everyone on the list to the Alabama attorney general’s office for criminal investigation, despite the inclusion of citizens.
When Hazelhoff went to his polling place last year, he said he still felt some trepidation, even after the court ruling. He questioned whether he would be escorted out for casting an illegal vote.
“It worried me,” Hazelhoff said. “But then the actual voting experience was great and the people were polite. The system seemed to be working.”

(Photo illustration by tolgart/Getty Images)As educators prepare for the next school year, one consideration is becoming increasingly pressing: whether and how to embrace AI in schools.
The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter last month reminding educators — including those in New Hampshire — of the opportunity to use federal funds toward artificial intelligence learning tools. 
And this summer, a coalition of New Hampshire groups has produced 77 pages of guidelines for teachers and school administrators to responsibly use those AI tools.
“We have to buckle down and understand it, so that we can help kids be prepared for it,” said Ellen Hume-Howard, the executive director of the New Hampshire Learning Institute, which helped create the guidelines. “And people don’t like change — they don’t like to do things they haven’t done, but that’s what it means to be an educator.”
The letter and guidance have come as New Hampshire schools have increased their use of AI. The state Department of Education has partnered with Khan Academy to provide “Khanmigo,” an AI–powered tutoring program for children, in New Hampshire schools. That program is provided for free by Khan Academy, with no state or local funding required. 
But a number of other programs for schools have emerged that are powered by generative AI, such as Curipod, Book Creator AI, WriteReader, MagicSchool.ai, Eduaide.ai, and Class Companion.
State officials have argued there is a place for AI in schools, with limits. Caitlin Davis, the new Department of Education commissioner, was asked at a hearing what she thought of AI. 
“I see it akin to a pocket calculator 50 years ago. Now, we would never say that there shouldn’t be calculators in classrooms. AI is a tool. It doesn’t replace educators. It doesn’t replace learning. And so we need to ensure that AI is instructor-led and most importantly that student privacy is at the center of all of those learning opportunities.” 
In its July 22 “Dear Colleague” letter, the federal department has listed a number of ways in which it says schools can use the federal funds, from tutoring programs to career and college guidance to learning materials.
Meanwhile, the guidelines, published in June, are designed to give schools a vision of how to proactively introduce children to AI, Hume-Howard said. She argued the technology will soon be ubiquitous, and that children should understand its benefits and risks. 
And Hume-Howard said that while cheating with AI is a problem, if schools are focused only on cracking down on student AI use, they will miss the opportunity to get ahead of the trend. 
“Running away from this would be a mistake, because we would be short-changing our learners,” she said. 
The guidelines, which were created by a team that included the New Hampshire School Administrators Association, the New Hampshire Association of School Principals, the New Hampshire School Boards Association, New Hampshire Association of Special Education Administrators, and the New Hampshire Supporting Tech-using Educators, feature a roadmap for schools to implement AI policies. That includes forming an AI task force in each school, coming up with policies and rules to govern the use of AI, and developing training plans to bring educators on board. 
The guidelines also have suggestions for appropriate uses of AI. In English classes, students could use AI to have simulated conversations with characters, or to generate writing prompts, the guidelines say. In math classes, AI can help break down complicated problems, and in science class, students could use AI to analyze lab data and compare an AI interpretation of scientific findings with peer reviewed journals. 
They also name a number of concerns with AI that teachers should take into account during assignments. For instance, AI can hallucinate and give wrong information, or be biased, depending on the source material it was trained on. It can aid academic dishonesty, and it can undermine a student’s critical thinking skills if it is overused. 
The guidelines have a number of suggestions for teachers to combat these risks. “Be purposeful. Align AI use with instructional goals and outcomes — not novelty or convenience,” the guidelines state. “Be critical. Always preview and verify AI outputs for accuracy, bias, and developmental appropriateness” and “Be ethical. Model equitable, respectful, and secure uses of AI tools,” they continue. 
It is not yet clear how many New Hampshire school districts will adopt more AI-based instruction. But some teachers and administrators are showing independent interest.
In March, dozens of teachers assembled at the New Hampshire Technical Institute in Concord to attend a daylong workshop on the topic. Day of AI, an MIT-founded initiative, provides presentations to public school staff demonstrating what AI is, how to harness it in the classroom, and how to avoid its pitfalls.
“You think of a shop where there’s hammers and saws and other tools, and there’s certain jobs you should use the hammer for, and certain jobs to use the saw for, and certain jobs you should use the ruler for,” said Ethan Berman, the founder of Day of AI, in an interview. 
Administrators and teachers attending the conference said they recognized the importance of AI, even if they were wary of it. And they agreed that more schools should adopt policies regulating how to use it.
“The AI is here, and it’s not going away,” said Eric Larcomb, the principal of Memorial School in the Sanborn Regional School District.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/aimarketing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-04 05:56:20.348653

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.
Americans haven’t saved for retirement. States are creating automatic savings plans.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

(Photo by Mimi Ditchie Photography/Getty Images)“Why Trust Science” is the title of a book written a few years ago by Naomi Oreskes. It asks the question and provides an answer that everyone should understand. Oreskes makes the case that the scientific method and its reliance on research, publication, confirmation through repetition, and ever more research — which is all exposed to the examination and critique of a community of scientists — is the essential way to understand our world and all its parts.  
Science derives its trustworthiness from its “collective character,” in which every idea, hypothesis, or theory is exposed to rigorous review, criticism, and the requirement that the data and conclusions be replicable by other independent research. When it sometimes goes “off track,” it eventually comes to correct conclusions through this process.
In today’s world of misinformation and disinformation, which can come from many sources that purport to be based in science, citizens do not know what to trust and easily become confused by opinion and partisan claims. This is why it’s so important to get information from reliable, science-based institutions that subject their work to critical review and that are funded not by industries or political interests, but by governments, nonpolitical foundations, and sources that do not have a particular ax to grind.
One can assert, with ample evidence, that academic and other independent science is what has made America the world leader in medical science, information technology, environmental protection, space exploration, advanced energy technology, and many other fields. We have, for generations, supported with our tax dollars independent research in government agencies and at many of the world’s leading American universities, including the University of New Hampshire. Our science has fueled our technological and medical advancements and inspired generations of young people to become world leaders in their fields.
Today, that foundation of “greatness” is under extreme threat. An administration of scientifically illiterate politicians has decided that if they don’t like what science is telling them, they should simply ignore it and stop funding it. In effect, they have decided, “Don’t confuse me with the facts; I’ve already made up my mind.” Even worse, they don’t want anyone to work on science that might produce facts they disagree with.
The examples over the past few months are numerous, but here is a sampling:

Major cuts to the nation’s medical research (National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and others) have undermined the basic research that is critical to ensuring the health of our nation. These include cuts of 39% to the institute that researches heart disease, 37% to the institute that researches cancer, 40% to the program that researches Alzheimer’s, and 38% to research on drug overdoses and suicide. On top of this, the replacement of independent experts on a number of medical advisory boards with people who closely adhere to the dogma of the new administration has undermined the trust of many in the medical field. Doctors have said that they can no longer fully trust federal health guidance and their patients will suffer.
Notable to us here in New England, where the incidence of Lyme disease is the highest in the nation, the program at Cornell funded by the Defense Department to develop a single accurate test for numerous tick borne diseases was eliminated. 
Staffing and budgets for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have been dramatically slashed, and the Trump administration budget for next year would close 10 laboratories that research life-threatening weather disasters. The lab that flies the “hurricane hunters” into storms to collect critical data used to predict the path and intensity of hurricanes is among those to close.
The Trump administration budget eliminates funding for the Ecosystems Mission Area, a program in the US Geological Survey that studies nearly every aspect of the ecology of our landscapes and waters in the country. Decades of regular data gathering that has documented how our environment is changing both for good and bad, will be ended. Scientists say this will be a loss that cannot be easily recovered.
The current EPA says it will completely eliminate its scientific research arm. The research program is the basis for nearly all of the air, water, toxic materials, and other regulations required by federal law. The union that represents 8,000 EPA workers has said, “Without it, we don’t have the means to assess impacts on human health and the environment. Its destruction will devastate public health in our country.” 
Similarly, the administration has cut or proposes to cut science in the national parks, from scientists who provide educational programs to projects that study changes in the landscape over time and the impacts of rapidly melting glaciers. Managing our national parks requires science for good decision-making, and apparently that no longer matters.
As if all of this wasn’t enough to convince one that politicians and their big donors have abandoned science in favor of advancing their own power, the EPA just announced it will propose eliminating a bedrock scientific finding on climate change. Disregarding a worldwide scientific consensus that climate change endangers public health and the environment, the EPA wants to eliminate the “Endangerment Finding” that was established in 2009 and later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. In essence, Donald Trump’s EPA wants to both eliminate any information about climate change and prevent the government from taking any actions that would attempt to slow or stop it.

All this anti-science behavior is truly astonishing. If one doesn’t base decisions on facts, supported by rigorous independent science, what will decisions be based on? Political expediency? Whomever donates the most money to political campaigns?
Adding insult to injury, the White House had the audacity to issue a statement on Earth Day with this headline: “On Earth Day, We Finally Have a President Who Follows Science.”
What?  
The statement went on to list the president’s proposals to cut “wasteful” environmental regulations, champion sound forest management, “end the forced use of paper straws,” and protect public lands. Meanwhile his agencies are gutting whole areas of regulations, demanding environmental rules be suspended to increase drilling and forest cutting on public lands, undoing protections for endangered species, decimating the incentives for clean energy, and reducing fuel economy of autos, which will simply increase air pollution.  
In the face of climate disruption that is creating extreme weather events that are killing people, is our president really spending his time targeting paper straws?
No, there’s no science being followed in this White House. And it will have lasting negative impacts not only on our health and our environment, but remove us from our position as the world leader in science and technology. We will watch China and the European Union leave us behind. So much for making America great.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/yellowstone-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-04 04:56:15.395237

On Jan. 1, the Ohio Elections Commission’s responsibilities shift to a new office under the Secretary of State’s umbrella. Beyond that date-certain transfer, much of what happens next is still up in the air. In the meantime, their work continues.
The commission meets
The Ohio Elections Commission meets in a basement hearing room at the Vern Riffe Center, just across the street from the Ohio statehouse. Commissioners sit at a long table on a dais in front of several rows of sparsely filled chairs. The mood among commissioners is light-hearted and collegial. They trade jokes and tease one another about who seconded a motion first.
By and large, the cases coming before them are honest mistakes — part-time treasurers who forgot to file reports or filed them incorrectly. In one case the candidate passed away and the treasurer didn’t realize there was more he needed to do. Many of those incidents receive no penalty or a modest fine of $50-$100.

But commissioners also try to put a foot down after repeated delays. One organization has been struggling to reconstruct its books after a previous treasurer took off with their records. The commission agreed to give them another 30 days. But Commissioner Stephen Caraway warned, “I would be in favor of moving to a substantially higher fine violation, from $50 into the $1000s,” if it’s still not resolved.
In another case commissioners had to throw up their hands. Township trustee candidate Justin Peroli criticized a political mailer sent out by “a multitude of concerned citizens of Lafayette township.” It’s a bogus disclaimer, he argued, because there’s no committee with that name and no campaign finance filings for the mailer.
Commissioners were frustrated but had to dismiss the complaint because they couldn’t serve notice to the non-existent group. A representative from the Secretary of State’s office urged Peroli to file another complaint with them so they could follow up.

Where we’re headed
For the OEC’s critics in the state legislature, that feeble response to obvious violations and repeated extensions for straggling treasurers only underscore the commission’s obsolescence.
“I’ve had a four-year front row seat to how inept this process is,” state Rep. Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said back in April.
The commission’s perceived shortcomings, though, are a function of the laws governing it. They can impose fines and refer cases for prosecution, but after the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Ohio’s false statement statutes, a substantial chunk of the commission’s job went away.
Referring to that case, Stewart said lawmakers never “right sized the operation in response.” As the House’s chief budget negotiator, he pushed to abolish the OEC and transfer its duties to the new Election Integrity Unit with the Secretary of State.
Ohio House budget would eliminate independent campaign finance oversight

Instead of the Ohio Elections Commission, the budget directs the secretary to set up a new Ohio Election Integrity Commission. That unit will investigate campaign finance complaints as well as election law violations like improper registration. It will have five members instead of the current seven, and at least three of the five must be attorneys. Commissioners will be chosen by the secretary and legislative leaders of both parties.
That’s a departure from the current structure where the governor names three Republican and three Democratic members who in turn select a seventh independent member. In all likelihood, the new arrangement will set up the secretary’s designee as the tie-breaking vote. In cases of a potential conflict of interest, the attorney general is meant designate someone else to investigate a complaint.
Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Sec. LaRose for this story, but his office did not respond.
How do we get there?
At the close of the most recent OEC hearing, commissioners took a moment to discuss what it will look like to wind down their operation. Commissioner Ernie Knight cut to chase.
“So, for me, the most important part, first and foremost, for the next meeting is to understand at a very granular level, if we have enough capital to get through the end of the year,” he said.
In an interview, Executive Director Phil Richter wasn’t particularly optimistic about funding lasting until the handoff.
“Depending on how you mean, ‘get through the rest of the year,’ not necessarily, no,” he said.
The problem is the funding typically appropriated to the commission lands in April or May in an ordinary budget cycle. That’s obviously too late if they’re handing things off at the beginning of January. Richter said they’re still working through the figures, and if it looks like they’ll fall short, “that would be worked out between me, my budget analyst, (the Office of Budget and Management) and the Controlling Board.”

In the next couple of weeks Richter is going to tell county boards to pause new referrals. He wants the commission to clear as much of its docket as possible before handing things over. Right now, they’ve got roughly 150 cases.
“Of the about 150, I feel like we’ll get through most of those,” Richter explained.
But beyond abstract questions about funding or the transferring of cases, there’s the very tangible question of what to do with the office. What happens with the cabinets full of paper files? Or the desks? Or the staff?
“Great question,” Richter said with a grin. “There isn’t an answer right now — let’s put it that way.”
The budget carries a provision transferring existing staff to the secretary, and Richter is hopeful they’ll be kept on. He’d already been contemplating retirement and said he expects to finish the year and move on, although he left the door open to “other opportunities.”
As for the files and furniture, Richter has had preliminary conversations with the secretary’s staff but that’s about it.
“I don’t know that they want all this stuff,” he said. “but all this stuff at one level becomes their stuff.”
“It could be it all just gets taken and put out to storage, out on Surface Road, and put into the next auction,” he added.

Mike DeWine wants to get rid of proposition bets after two Cleveland Guardians players were placed on leave for gambling allegations. 
DeWine is calling on the Ohio Casino Control Commission to remove prop bets from the type of bets that can be placed in Ohio. 
A prop bet is a wager on an individual player or a specific event in a game, rather than the final outcome of the game. The number of strikeouts a pitcher throws or if a player hits a home run are examples of prop bets.

“The evidence that prop betting is harming athletics in Ohio is reaching critical mass,” DeWine said in a news release. “The harm to athletes and the integrity of the game is clear, and the benefits are not worth the harm. The prop betting experiment in this country has failed badly.” 
DeWine is calling on the commissioners and players unions of Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the Women’s National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League, and Major League Soccer to support the ban on prop betting. 
Ohio does not allow bettors to place prop bets on college athletes. Instead, Ohio bettors are able to make bets on the overall outcome and final score of college sporting events. This happened after NCAA President Charlie Baker wrote a letter to the OCCC asking for the change in 2024. 
Prior to Baker’s letter, DeWine had spoken out against threats made against University of Dayton basketball players shortly after Ohio launched legalized sports gambling in 2023. 
“The Ohio Casino Control Commission took quick action to protect student athletes from unnecessary and potentially harmful threats,” DeWine said back in 2024. “Amending rules to focus bets on the team and away from individual athletes will improve the marketplace in Ohio and properly focus betting attention on the teams and away from individual student athletes.”
MLB placed Cleveland Guardians pitcher Luis Ortiz on non-disciplinary paid leave on July 3 to look into gambling charges against him during Guardians games in June. About two weeks later, MLB extended Ortiz’s leave of absence through Aug. 31. 
On July 28, MLB also placed Guardians closer Emmanuel Clase on non-disciplinary paid leave through Aug. 31 as part of a related sports betting investigation.

Laura Kelly speaks at a rally on May 29, 2025, in Topeka. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)Amid all the ominous signs for the unraveling of our constitutional republic — and the 50 state governments contained therein — one last month struck me as particularly bleak.
The Atlantic first reported that Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would be leaving the National Governors Association. The bipartisan group claims that it serves as “the voice of the nation’s Governors and a leading forum for bipartisan policy solutions.” Democrats Kelly and Walz apparently didn’t see it that way.
Meanwhile, Kelly has raised her national profile as chairwoman of the Democratic Governors Association and has called for a robust response to potential gerrymandering in Texas.
The cliche response to this storm of news would be: “I don’t think we’re in Kansas anymore.” But we are in Kansas, and in every other state besides. The notion that officials might benefit from listening to one another and working together has been thrown on the partisan bonfire. As Republicans attempt to extract maximum advantage from government, Democrats find themselves forced to react in kind.
None of this reflects reality. According to Pew, the United States splits right down the middle between Republican and Democrat party registration. There’s a similar division between governors, with 27 Republicans and 23 Democrats. But what does the real word have to do with politics?
Apparently Democratic governors have grouched about the national group for some time.
Michael Scherer and Ashley Parker of the Atlantic wrote July 24 that “some Democratic members of the group have privately been fuming in recent months over the organization’s tepid reaction to President Donald Trump’s federal incursions into state matters. They complain that the group did not respond forcefully enough when Trump’s Office of Management and Budget briefly ordered a disruptive pause on the disbursement of all federal funds in January; when Maine Governor Janet Mills and her staff clashed with the White House the following month, over transgender sports; and in June, when Trump deployed the California National Guard to the streets of Los Angeles over the objections of local authorities.”
That makes sense. But what an unfortunate situation for governance in this country. What an unfortunate lack of spine as the federal government spirals.
Kelly decided not to privately fume any longer, making her unhappiness public. Remember, we’re not talking about a stereotypical wild-eyed leftist here. We’re talking about Laura Kelly, a politician whose primary skill has always been demonstrating her sanity in an otherwise insane world of political maneuvering.
“I just felt like Kansas was not getting a return on investment, and we will keep our eyes on it,” Kelly said, according to KSNT. Dues for the organization run about $100,000 a year. “The NGA does some very good things particularly in the area of training for governor’s staff, but there also needs to be a state rights advocate, and I think they’ve sort of fallen down on that role.”
In the meantime, political tensions have flared over mid-decade redistricting for congressional seats. Lawmakers usually draw maps every decade, following U.S. Census results. However, Texas legislators have been pressed by Trump to create new maps earlier, making it more difficult for Democrats to win U.S. House seats. Given that the governing party usually loses seats in midterm elections, this redistricting could cushion the expected blow for Republicans.
This has enraged Democrats, and leaders of blue states like California have threatened their own gerrymanders in retaliation. Guess who’s OK with that? Laura Kelly.
“I have never believed in unilateral disarmament, and so while I may not want to participate in certain activities, if I have to, in order to level the playing field, I would support my Democratic colleagues who decide to answer in kind,” she told ABC News at a policy retreat last week.
She added: “If the other side is going to pursue this, regardless of the obvious unconstitutionality of it, then I don’t think we have any other choice but to go there. You just don’t go to the front lines without your bullets.”
By running and governing as authoritarian wanna-bes, Republicans have pushed moderate Democrats like Kelly toward bare-knuckle political combat. They have alienated would-be allies, all in the service of the dime-store strongman living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We live in a narrowly divided country, but the GOP has chosen to eschew rules, norms or the barest sense of shame.
Kelly will do fine. I wish I could say the same for our state and nation.

Despite the strength of the U.S. economy, the gap between rich and poor Americans is increasing.
The wealthiest 1% of Americans have more than five times as much wealth as the bottom 50%, according to the U.S. Federal Reserve. That’s up from four times as much in the year 2000. In 2024 alone, the wealthiest 19 families got a total of $1 trillion richer – the largest one-year increase on record.
And yet 59% of Americans don’t have enough money saved up to cover an unexpected $1,000 expense.
We are political scientists who study human rights and political economy.
In a 2023 study, our team looked at 145 countries, including the U.S., to understand the link between labor rights and inequality. We found evidence that strengthening collective labor rights may reduce economic inequality.
 Empowering workers

Collective labor rights include the rights to form and join a union, bargain collectively for higher pay and better working conditions, go on strike, and get justice if employers punish workers who exercise these rights.
In the U.S., where less than 10% of workers belong to unions, union members typically earn higher wages than their nonunion counterparts.
Through negotiations on behalf of their members, unions can pressure employers to provide fair wages and benefits. If negotiations break down, the union can call for a strike – sometimes winning better benefits and higher wages as a result.
Some U.S. unions don’t have the right to strike, including air traffic controllers, teachers and those working on national security issues. But most unions have some ability to implement work stoppages and impose costs on employers to negotiate for raises and better benefits and conditions.
 Reducing inequality

For our study, we analyzed the human rights in the CIRIGHTS dataset, which uses human rights reports from the U.S. State Department, Amnesty International and other sources to measure government respect for 24 human rights, including the rights to unionize and bargain collectively. The dataset is produced by the University of Rhode Island, Binghamton University and the University of Connecticut. One of us, Skip Mark, serves as a co-director of the project.
Using a scoring guide, a team of researchers reads human rights reports and gives each country a score of zero if they have widespread violations, one point if they have some violations, or two if they have no evidence of violations. The team has assigned scores for all 24 rights from 1994 through 2022.
Using this data, we created a measure of collective labor rights by adding scores for the right to workplace association and the right to collective bargaining. The resulting collective labor rights score ranges from zero to four.
Countries where workers’ rights are routinely violated, such as Afghanistan, China and Saudi Arabia, scored a zero. The United States, Macedonia and Zambia, three countries with little in common, were among those that tended to get two points, placing them in the middle. Countries with no reported violations of the rights to workplace association and collective bargaining, including Canada, Sweden and France, got four points.
According to the CIRIGHTS dataset, the strength of respect for collective labor rights around the world declined by 50%, from 2.06 in 1994 to 1.03 in 2022.
At the same time, according to the World Inequality Dataset, the share of income earned by the 1% with the biggest paychecks increased by 11%.
We used advanced statistical methods to figure out whether better worker protections actually reduce inequality or are just associated with it.
 Gaps between individuals and ethnic groups

We also measured what’s been happening to economic inequality, using two common ways to track it.
One of them is vertical inequality, the gap between what people earn within a country – the rich versus the poor. The more unequal a society becomes, the higher its vertical inequality score gets. We measured it using the disposable income measure from the Gini index, a commonly used indicator of economic inequality that captures how much money individuals have to spend after taxes and government transfers.
We found that a one-point increase in collective labor rights on our four-point scale reduces vertical inequality by 10 times the average change in inequality. For the U.S., a one-point increase in collective labor rights would be about enough to undo the increase in inequality that occurred between 2008 and 2010 due to the Great Recession and its aftermath. It would also likely help stem the growing wealth gap between Black and white Americans. That’s because income disparities compound over time to create wealth gaps.
We also assessed the connection between horizontal inequality, which measures income inequality between ethnic or other groups, and collective labor rights.
Negative horizontal inequality measures the amount of a country’s income held by the poorest ethnic group. Higher scores for this metric indicate that the lowest-earning ethnic group has less income relative to the rest of society. Black Americans have the lowest median income of any racial or ethnic group, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Positive horizontal inequality measures the income earned by the richest ethnic group. When positive horizontal inequality rises, that means the richest ethnic group has more income relative to the rest of society. According to the same Census Bureau report, Asian Americans had the highest median earnings.
We found that stronger collective labor rights, both in law and in practice around the world, also reduce both types of horizontal inequality. This means they raise the floor by helping to improve the income of the poorest ethnic groups in society. They also close the gap by limiting the incomes of the richest ethnic group, which can reduce the likelihood of conflicts.
That is, our findings suggest that when workers are free to advocate for higher wages and better benefits for themselves, it also benefits society as a whole.

Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.
‘Pure emotion’ frequently drives debates on sports stadium deals

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, professor of sports marketing at Clemson University


After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)While more than a dozen states have shrunk their pension debt obligations in recent years, a majority continue to see growth in the gap between the amount of money retirees have been promised and the amount of cash states have set aside.
In a new analysis released this week, The Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that states’ unfunded pension liabilities grew to nearly $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2022, largely because of lower-than-expected investment returns.
Total liabilities for future pension costs as a share of state revenues increased more than 22 percentage points between fiscal years 2008 and 2022 — reaching nearly 66% in fiscal 2022, Pew found. It’s an important issue for current public employees and retirees as well as state policymakers, who must balance the growing tab with other spending priorities.

“Long-term liabilities are not always top of mind for state policymakers because they are paid for over decades,” Pew’s report reads. “Yet, when they grow faster than a state’s revenue, those liabilities can squeeze state budgets and constrain future public investments.”
Between 2008 and 2022, unfunded pension obligations grew relative to state revenue in 34 states. In 16 states, unfunded pension liabilities decreased. Pew researchers found Illinois had the largest unfunded pension liability of any state, followed by New Jersey, Mississippi, Connecticut and Kentucky.
In four states — New York, South Dakota, Tennessee and Washington — pension plan assets exceeded what was owed.
Pew found states have made progress specifically on closing gaps on unfunded retiree health care costs — which decreased by nearly 8 percentage points as a share of state revenues between 2008 and 2019, falling to 45% in 2019.
And all 50 states collectively shrunk their outstanding debt loads relative to revenue by more than 6 percentage points from fiscal years 2018 to 2022, which fell to 18% of revenues by 2022.

(Mac Johnson/Nebraska News Service)Nebraska legislators spent much of their recent session debating and parsing the political landscape in two primary areas: the will of the people via the ballot box and the ongoing culture wars, those nitpicky, divisive punch ups, which often cleave communities. 
That focus last session was the subject of an excellent article by Nebraska Examiner reporter Juan Salinas II.
While he meticulously detailed the body’s battles over issues ranging from taxes to school books to whether your cheeseburger came from a petri dish or a pasture, most troubling was the inordinate amount of time senators spent on what can only be described as undoing the will of the people. 
By the end, the majority had watered down, thinned or undermined initiatives already approved by voters regarding paid sick leave, medical cannabis and minimum wage requirements, the latter, while not passing muster this past session, is sure to be debated again next year. 
Governing by ballot initiative is a tedious, meandering process, often exacerbated by lengthy campaigns to gather petition signatures and court filings disputing everything from language to intent. Nevertheless, that’s our way of doing things. 
Yes, democracy isn’t easy. Nor is it quick.
Ergo, I understand and respect — sometimes grudgingly — that once the votes have been counted, game over. For example, after railing in a number of commentaries about how a lie led to a petition that resulted in Nebraska now requiring photo IDs to vote, I dutifully had my driver’s license at the ready to mark my X when the time came. 
True, the Legislature is charged with putting flesh on the bones of passed initiatives. But weakening them in any way truly is at odds with the people’s will. In our system, “Put it to a vote” both poses the question and has the expectation that we follow the answer … even when we vehemently disagree with the result because we have other remedies. (See your local civics class for details. Wait, do we still teach that?)
Politics is the mechanism by which we practice these principles of democracy. At its core is the art of creating and selling an idea, one that the majority of those affected believe will better their or their neighbors’ lives. We call voting our civic duty, though usually a third to half who have the right don’t use it. Even so, having the decision subverted or enfeebled by another elected body should be a non-starter in a democratic republic.
That said, if an initiative that passes turns out to be a real stinker or constitutionally challenged, the separation of powers can reign in or block such nonsense going forward. Legislators know that and should act accordingly. 
Ballot initiatives as a political solution have become popular. Paid petition circulators and expensive PR campaigns routinely accompany such efforts. Legislators should expect to continue to deal with them while never minimizing the power and voice of a vote of the people nor alter the initiative’s focus.
I hesitate to talk about the culture wars for a number of reasons, not least of which is that I too often seem to write about the horrors and hijinks of too many who don’t like how others chose to live, love, pray, eat, read … the list could go on. 
The Legislature last session joined the fray debating transgender issues and sports, lab grown meat, what books kids can read in school, and, most curious, that Nebraska public schools should only be deemed full and functioning if they posted the Ten Commandments in every classroom. The proposal never made it out of committee. Thank God.
I’m often hard-pressed to see what problems are solved by shaking down colleges and universities for being “woke.” Or banning books not simply because you don’t want your child to read them, but because you don’t want anyone’s child to read them. Or continually obsessing about transgender youth, which, in practice and new laws, effectively questions their actual being — who they are. 
While issues such as trans athletes’ participation in scholastic sports are up for debate, it seems that much of what has transpired in legislative chambers, political debates and coffee shops about trans kids specifically and the LGBTQ+ community generally could have been avoided by simply minding our own business.
But what do I know? White hot culture war arguments still erupt on social media and nearly 600 pieces of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation were proposed in state legislatures in 2025. Go figure. 
Here’s the most critical point of the culture wars: What are the spoils for winning?

Al Capone liked to relax in Miami Beach.
Ex-dictators, junta leaders, and death squad commanders from Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, Honduras, Venezuela, and Panama have moved here when things got too hot at home.
Then there are the dodgy New York billionaires, including the felonious current occupant of the White House and his erstwhile pal, the late Jeffrey Epstein, who installed themselves in ocean-front mansions and became Florida Men.
Epstein’s girlfriend/posh pimp Ghislaine Maxwell made herself a Florida Woman, too, shopping for young girls in Palm Beach County.
Then she moved north, although not by choice: She was sentenced to 20 years for sex trafficking and imprisoned at FCI Tallahassee.
Now the feds have whisked her off to some tennis prison in Texas.
If you’re a halfway rational human being, you probably haven’t given much thought to her over the past six months, what with the attacks on science, the attempts to wreck higher education, the dismantling of environmental protections, and destruction of the rule of law.
 Obsession
Our brothers and sisters in MAGA, however, just can’t get her out of their heads.
They’re fixated on her, Jeffrey Epstein, and these alleged files which may or may not still be sitting on the attorney general’s desk.
They’re convinced the files contain mighty secrets about nefarious cabals, Pizzagate, Lizard People, and sex island dirt on the Clintons.
Pam Bondi claimed on Fox “News” she would “review” the files then put Epstein’s stuff out there for everyone’s delectation.
Yet no files have been forthcoming, and boy, is MAGA mad.
Recently some “personal finance” website voted Tallahassee the ninth most boring city in America.
Unfair!
Until last Friday when Maxwell left us, everybody wanted to visit Tallahassee.
Florida’s capital was the focus of the political world, an object of slathering fascination especially among podcast hosts, news junkies, cable TV reporters, Never Trumpers, Ride-or-Die Trumpers, and people on psychotropic medication.
Call that boring? We hadn’t gotten this much attention since the Great Presidential Vote Count Screw-Up of 2000.
Trump acolyte Todd Blanche (his side-hustle is being Bondi’s deputy AG) recently descended upon the United States Courthouse in downtown Tallahassee to interview Maxwell in the presence of her Miami attorney David Markus.
 Look over there!
Blanche and Markus admit they are good friends but swear there’s no conflict of interest, no sir, nothing to see here.
We don’t know what they said, but Ghislaine-o-mania isn’t going away.
Hoping to distract us, the regime keeps hollering “Squirrel!”
The FBI just released 230,000 files on the assassination of Martin Luther King.
National Security Tsarina Tulsi Gabbard has accused Barack Obama of treason, claiming he cooked up a coup against Trump in the 2016 election.
Speaker Mike Johnson was all for releasing the Epstein files until he wasn’t (maybe there was a phone call from the Oval Office?), so he adjourned the House early to avoid a vote on it.
Trump himself has been slinging delusions around like a chimp with a barrel of feces, claiming the Epstein files were created by James Comey or Joe Biden or maybe sinister Greenlandic elves.
When that didn’t seem to work, he started barking about changing the names of NFL teams in Cincinnati and Washington back to “Indians” and “Redskins.”
Then he tried to change the subject by flouncing off to Scotland (where three-quarters of the population heartily despise him) to (in order of importance) 1. Play golf; 2. Make a “trade deal” with the EU that will cleverly raise costs for Americans.
The Scots and the international press made sure nobody forgot how the president and Florida’s favorite pedophile used to be bosom buddies, dogging him with questions and snark.
There’s a grand sign at the entrance to his Aberdeenshire golf course proclaiming “Trump International Golf Links.” Underneath, somebody placed a smaller, quite official-looking sign which said, “Twinned with Epstein Island.”
 Overboard
Neither heat domes nor killer floods nor ICE agents nor gloom of night will stay Americans from their fixation with Epstein and Maxwell.
And so — inevitably — back to Florida, always the humid center of bad behavior, back to Jeffrey Epstein’s Palm Beach palace of horrors, and back to Ghislaine Maxwell, surely the most uptown inmate in FCI history.
She was once an heiress, the youngest child of megabucks London newspaper baron Robert Maxwell. As a student at Oxford, she was described as a “shiny glamazon.”
But her father was not only physically and emotionally abusive, he was embezzling from his own company and defrauding its employees.
In 1991, they found Robert Maxwell face down in the sea.
He’d been sailing near the Canary Islands on his yacht “The Lady Ghislaine.” Nobody ever figured out whether he jumped or was pushed.
Next thing you know, Ghislaine is Jeffrey Epstein’s arm candy, hard at work procuring young girls for him.
Like Trump, Epstein was a New Yorker trying to be a big deal in Palm Beach. In 1990 he bought a 14,000 square foot mansion and partied at Mar-a-Lago.
Like Trump, noisome stories about sexual abuse swirled around him like a nasty cocktail of skunk spray and dog poop.
 Enabling Epstein
You will not be surprised to learn that the state of Florida played a major role in enabling Epstein.
Having amassed vast evidence he’d raped and sexually assaulted at least a dozen under-age girls, Palm Beach County cops searched his Palm Beach mansion in 2005, only to find his six computer hard drives had disappeared.
Epstein finally got arrested, and though a federal grand jury returned a 60-count indictment, he was allowed to plead guilty only to “soliciting a prostitute.”
In 2008, he was put into the private wing of the Palm Beach County jail. He had his own television room. His personal driver arrived every morning to take him to his office.
Turns out the Palm Beach County state attorney, the FBI, prosecutors and the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida — a man named Alex Acosta, later appointed Secretary of Labor by Donald Trump — colluded to give Epstein the sweetest of sweet deals: a 20-month sentence.
He served about a year.
This is corrupt even by Florida standards.
When he got out in 2009, Epstein went back to living the lifestyle of the rich and infamous while the young women he assaulted and exploited were forgotten.
We might never have known all this were it not for the relentless and brilliant work of journalist Julie Brown, whose 2018 series in the Miami Herald gave voice to his victims: She tracked down more than five dozen of them.
 ‘Pyramid scheme’
Brown’s reporting detailed how he’d prey on homeless girls or especially vulnerable kids, paying them to bring in other girls.
This sex-trafficking “pyramid scheme,” as Brown calls it, was run by Ghislaine Maxwell.
Maxwell would visit South Florida gyms and spas, telling petite blonde high schoolers — apparently Epstein’s “type” — they could make big money giving massages to “this old guy.”
She encountered 17-year old Virginia Giuffre working at Mar-a-Lago’s spa and convinced her to “work” for Epstein.
Virginia Giuffre said Epstein passed her around to various men, including Prince Andrew and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz, instructing her to have sex with them. Prince Andrew denied the allegations but he wound up reaching a settlement with Giuffre. Dershowitz has also repeatedly denied allegations. Giuffre dropped her allegations against Dershowitz in 2022 and said she “may have made a mistake.”
Trump claims he had no idea what his good friend Jeffrey was up to back then, variously insisting he ditched Epstein for being “sleazy” (insert your own pot-and-kettle joke here) or they quarreled over Epstein’s “stealing” his pretty young Mar-a-Lago employees.
Brown’s attention to the shady nonprosecution deal in Palm Beach eventually led to his 2019 New York arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.
Epstein, of course, is now dead, most likely by suicide — though lots of MAGAs don’t believe that.
Virginia Giuffre is also dead, definitely by suicide.
Ghislaine Maxwell, however, is still here.
She wasn’t exactly living her best life in Tallahassee, spending her days giving yoga classes, teaching etiquette (even criminals want to be ladylike!) and, no doubt, explaining over and over that her name is not pronounced “Gizz-Lane.”
MAGA (and quite a few Democrats) want her to talk; she wants out of prison.
She may be about to get lucky.
 Pardon
Thanks to Trumpists’ rich fantasy life, in which everything is a conspiracy of the Deep Swamp, she suddenly has some power.
She says she’ll testify in public as long as Congress agrees to a few little provisions as spelled out by her lawyer, chiefly immunity and a chance to see the committee’s questions in advance.
She also doesn’t want to appear before them until after the Supreme Court hears her appeal, in which she makes the thoroughly bizarre argument that the nonprosecution deal the Southern District of Florida cut with Epstein should apply to her, too.
Classic Florida move: The rules are different here.
Anyway, if they don’t comply, she’ll take the Fifth.
Trump keeps saying he’s “allowed” to pardon her, though he evades the question of whether he actually would.
That, no doubt, depends on what kind of dirt he thinks she has on him and whether that outweighs dirt she might have on his perceived enemies.
Here in Tallahassee, we’re feeling a little sore, a little mad at Texas for stealing our celebrity sex offender.
But once a Florida Woman, always a Florida Woman.
Texas will never take that away from us.

This bill prevents that.,"Spare me the fake outrage about Senate Bill 1370. Claims like those made in “No kings? CT Democrats might want to look in the mirror” wrongly cast doubt on legislation that creates quality jobs for Connecticut’s working families.
Let’s be clear: SB 1370 didn’t create a loophole, it closed one. For years companies have dodged fair wage standards by shifting construction work to nearby “off-site” locations. Working families were getting hung to dry because of a stupid technicality. 
With SB 1370, common-sense finally prevails. Skilled workers will get paid fairly, and public dollars will support quality local jobs. This bill went through a transparent, public process, with a hearing, a committee vote and broad support that earned its place in the budget. Our lawmakers and the governor were absolutely right to get it done.

Vital health coverage and food assistance programs are being slashed to fund massive tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy. A mass deportation agenda is infused with hundreds of billions of dollars. The LGBTQ+ community is under heightened threat.  A provision to immediately “defund” Planned Parenthood from the federal Medicaid program makes access to reproductive healthcare more precarious than ever.
The rollback of rights and resources is not hypothetical. These are deliberate choices, with devastating consequences for people in every corner of our state.
That’s why, months ago, Protect CT, a coalition of 11 statewide advocacy and service organizations, came together to sound the alarm and share a roadmap for resilience and safety. Now, with the recently signed-into-law One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the harm is no longer looming; it’s landing.
Connecticut took some important steps this past legislative session that go beyond incremental, and that will help advance progress. We celebrate efforts to invest in early childhood and K-12 education, and acknowledge the thoughtful planning to set aside funds for an economic recession. These are good examples of why we love Connecticut and what will continue to make our state a great one. This is also a testament to decades-long community advocacy and political will—doing what’s right even when it’s hard. 
However, Connecticut’s response has been uneven at best. 
While modest funding increases were made to Medicaid and the EITC for families, and marginal improvements were made to the state’s Trust Act, these investments and policy changes fell short of what’s needed. In fact, in a troubling unwillingness to address certain issues, the Gov. Ned Lamont threatened to veto important bills and concepts had they gone to a vote in the regular session. What’s more, the Governor vetoed the primary housing bill of the session. 
There has been talk of a potential special session to respond to the federal reconciliation bill. While this is an important next step, if our elected leaders are serious about protecting Connecticut, we cannot afford to remain reactive. A special session should address federal funding gaps as well as the various crises (like housing) that have been and continue to be felt by residents across our state. The only way forward in Connecticut is to proactively pass and enact ambitious policies that will allow Connecticut to rise and meet this moment.
We have a plan to make that happen.  
The federal landscape has changed. We are living through unprecedented times unlike anything we’ve seen in a generation. And, in spite of this, the partners of Protect CT still believe in what’s possible. We believe in the values the people of this state hold: fairness, justice, and opportunity for all. But belief is not enough. We need bold action. 
So, to every state leader who failed to vote for immigrant protections: these people are important members of our community and our economy – we must stand by them. 
To those who support reproductive freedom and transgender rights, now is the time to take bold action that protects access to vital health care for those who need it today and for years to come.
When you call for affordability for families but haven’t yet passed a state-level child tax credit: now is the time to provide meaningful support to families to help manage the high cost of living.
And to those who say now is not the time for bold action: If not now, when?
The next legislative session cannot be business as usual because these are not normal times. The stakes are too high. We will continue to fight for a future where our residents are safe, supported, and free, no matter what zip code they live in, how much money they make, or where they were born. But we can’t do it alone. 
We call on state leaders to act boldly and urgently: to protect immigrants, safeguard access to the full spectrum of healthcare, and pass a child tax credit. If you’re ready to fight with us for a better Connecticut, join us:  Call your legislators and Governor Lamont today and ask them to move forward with these measures to protect Connecticut and move us forward.

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York began offering free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons on Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so.
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)
A group of state attorneys general, led by New York, has filed a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of mounting an unconstitutional pressure campaign against gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The lawsuit, filed Friday in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, challenges actions taken by the Justice Department to investigate and halt gender-affirming care across the country.
The lawsuit argues that the Trump administration is pursuing a backdoor strategy to restrict gender-affirming care at the federal level through threats of criminal and civil penalties, while skirting state laws that protect transgender patients’ health care.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

As federal investigations and funding threats roll out, hospitals across the country are shutting down their gender-affirming care programs for minors — including in areas where access to this care is protected by state law. Clinics and medical programs have shuttered in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois and Washington, D.C., among others — despite state laws that protect the care’s legality. Multiple hospitals have attributed shuttering or pausing their gender-affirming care programs to President Donald Trump’s executive orders and federal administrative actions, including the Yale health system and Denver Health in Colorado.

The White House recently celebrated these closures as a direct result of Trump’s executive orders.
“The administration’s actions put providers in an impossible position: either comply with unlawful federal threats or violate state laws that require nondiscriminatory access to medical care,” New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office said in a statement.
James and other attorneys general suing the Trump administration argue that these actions are not based in law, since no federal statute prohibits gender-affirming care in the United States. Instead, these actions are an intimidation tactic to suppress the health care, the lawsuit alleges. Through the courts, they are attempting to halt the Justice Department’s actions.
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit include the attorneys general of states where gender clinics have recently shuttered, as well as Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. They assert that gender-affirming care is legally protected in all of their states and that federal efforts to block that care violate states’ rights provided by the 10th Amendment.
Over the past few months, federal agencies have begun to follow through on Trump’s executive orders regarding gender-affirming care.
In early July, Chad Mizelle, chief of staff at the Justice Department, announced that the agency had launched at least 20 subpoenas into clinics involved in gender transition care, alongside subpoenas to drug manufacturers and investigations into hospitals providing the care. Doctors are being subpoenaed for patients’ private information, the New York Times reports. The agency is following the White House directive it received in January, via executive order, to broadly investigate gender-affirming care. In these directives, the Trump administration has incorrectly conflated the care with female genital mutilation.
The New York lawsuit challenges these actions, as well as FBI criminal investigations into three children’s hospitals that currently provide gender-affirming care or have done so in the past. Although the lawsuit is being brought against Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and the Justice Department, it also references other actions taken by federal agencies targeting gender-affirming care — including an all-day event hosted by the Federal Trade Commission. That event, titled “the dangers of ‘gender-affirming care’ for minors,” is where the Justice Department first announced its subpoenas for confidential patient information.
Major medical groups including the American Medical Association, American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have endorsed gender-affirming care for transgender youth. The new president of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which sets global standards for doctors and nurses providing health care to trans patients, has expressed concerns that banning gender-affirming care will simply drive the care underground and endanger patients.
Transgender people, as well as the families and parents of transgender youth, are feeling increasingly worried and scared as the Trump administration targets their identities and their health care. For years, states have banned gender-affirming care for minors in red states and through Republican-controlled legislatures; but now, with the crackdown taking place on a national level, trans people living in blue states and liberal cities face the same threat.

It has controlled the governor’s mansion for nearly three decades – and also currently holds all three Cabinet offices, maintains a supermajority in both chambers of the Legislature and maintains a more than 1.3 million voter registration lead over Democrats.
Yet several top-leading GOP leaders at the Florida Freedom Forum in Orlando on Saturday warned that complacency and infighting could give an opening to their political rivals.
“Don’t get high on your own supply,” said Gov. Ron DeSantis. “There is nothing permanent in politics.”
For proof, both the governor and his close ideological ally, newly appointed Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, referenced two proposed constitutional amendments on last year’s statewide ballot that nearly passed.
Amendment 3 would have legalized adult recreational cannabis, while Amendment 4 would have enshrined abortion rights into the state’s Constitution. Both received more than 55% support, a clear majority but not enough to break the 60% threshold required for passage.
“If the left can spend $250 million running these ballot initiatives, they can turn this into California through the backdoor,” DeSantis said. “Without ever having to control the Legislature. Without even ever being able to elect a governor, again, and we could wake up in 10 years and all of a sudden, we’ve got a left-wing state. And so Amendments 3 and 4 were really a big test for this state.”

“Never, ever underestimate leftists and their ability to lie, cheat and steal,” added Ingoglia. “Leftist and progressives know they can’t win in Florida as candidates anymore. So now they’re trying to buy our Constitution in an effort to turn this state into California. Massive voter fraud. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent. Vague language. Enticing titles. Foreign money. Last year’s amendments should be a wake-up call for every God-fearing Republican in this room … they’re not going to let up, and neither should we. Guard our Constitution!”
Left unsaid was the fact that in reaction to those proposals, the Legislature passed and DeSantis signed into law a measure that Democrats say has made it significantly more difficult to pass (or even get on the ballot) citizen-led constitutional amendments in the future. The criticisms over Amendment 3 are also notable because the measure was backed by President Donald Trump and state Sen. Joe Gruters, who Trump is now backing to become chair of the Republican National Committee.
So it could be seen as notable that Byron Donalds, the Naples-based Republican U.S. Rep. who President Trump endorsed in the 2026 gubernatorial race, said the only thing that could shut down the GOP’s momentum in Florida is intraparty fighting.
“Listen man, we cannot fight among ourselves in this moment,” he told conservative influencer Benny Johnson in a conversation. “The wind is at our back. 1.3, 1.4 million voter advantage in the state of Florida. We are winning. And the only way you stop winning is when we start fighting each other, because this person wants to be in charge. That person wants to be in charge. Or I want my committee. ..we need to stay united and we need to keep winning.”
Donalds has already won the backing of Trump for governor, but DeSantis has declined to endorse him so far.
Other officials who spoke at the event —which also included an award handed to Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff who has been at odds in the past with DeSantis — included Attorney General James Uthemier, who like Ingoglia, was appointed to his position by DeSantis earlier this year (in his case to replace Ashley Moody).
While relatively unknown except in Florida political circles before his appointment, Uthmeier has been in the news frequently this summer, warning local officials they could be removed from office if they don’t get with the DeSantis agenda on illegal immigration.
Uthmeier took a victory lap of sorts telling the audience how he had come up with the notion of the detention facility in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.”
And he accused state Democrats who recently paid a visit to the site as “political grandstanding” and said they cared more about the undocumented than American families who have suffered from the open border policies under former President Joe Biden. “Which is why their party is getting their butt kicked every single day,” he said.
Uthemier also reminded the crowd of Republicans that he will be on the ballot next year.
“If you want somebody who’s soft on crime, that’s lenient, that wants illegal immigrants to get an easy way out, I am absolutely not your guy,” he said.
 A day of protests

Uthmeier also had to deal with a protester who began shouting at him early in his presentation, one of more than half-a-dozen such outbursts that took place throughout the day at the Rosen Shingle Creek hotel.

“Get this guy outta here,” he shouted. “You know what? I think we’ve got a spot in Alligator Alcatraz for that guy.”
Nobody was interrupted more than DeSantis.
“You’ve got to do a better job than that if you’re going to interrupt,” he proclaimed after a fourth protestor began shouting out during his speech. The protestor was escorted out of the ballroom and DeSantis offered: “That was a weak performance.”
Two other protesters also were escorted out earlier in the morning after shouting at U.S. Rep. Randy Fine, who was in conversation with fellow Republican congressional members congress Daniel Webster and Aaron Bean.
The group of activists issued a press release later in the day explaining their actions.
“Republican lawmakers have made it difficult to register complaints,” read a portion of the statement.  “They’ve dodged town halls, ignored petitions, ducked our phone calls, and generally done everything they can to avoid hearing from any constituents who don’t already agree with them.”
Joy Metzler, who wore a “Veterans against Fascism” T-shirt and described herself in the press release as a “recently separated Air Force Veteran,” blasted Florida Republicans for helping to construct the immigration detention center, saying they had “built a concentration camp in our own backyard, a stunningly disrespectful insult to my grandfather, who fought against the Nazis in WWII.”
The intermittent outbursts were mostly treated as annoying distractions in a day otherwise set aside for a celebration of GOP dominance in the state.

(South Dakota Searchlight images)There is early, bipartisan interest in serving as the next governor of South Dakota.
Republicans already have three announced candidates for the primary in 2026, with one more likely contestant waiting in the wings. Democrats have signed up a 19-year-old college student with hints that an adult or two may also seek that party’s nomination.
So much early interest in the job is baffling because being governor of South Dakota is a task that is getting tougher by the day. So far, the U.S. House and Senate have acquiesced to the Trump administration’s attempts to cancel federal funding that has already been approved by Congress. Those actions will mean profound changes for state budgets.
19-year-old at the top of the ticket is no way to build a party

The irony is that the Republican candidates applying for such a tough job have all, to some degree, offered their loyalty to Donald Trump. According to a South Dakota Searchlight story, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden has already spent $187,000 to build his name recognition in the state. In his commercials and mailings, the name that often appears next to Doeden’s is Trump’s.
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson doesn’t have to run ads claiming loyalty to Trump as he has been in Washington, D.C., doing the president’s bidding. Johnson voted for a “big, beautiful bill” that is estimated to add $3.4 trillion to the deficit over the next 10 years. He also gave his approval to the president’s plan to claw back money that had been allocated for South Dakota Public Broadcasting, financially hamstringing a state institution.
Not much is heard yet from state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen who doesn’t have Doeden’s money or Johnson’s name recognition. Since Hansen is from the same MAGA/“patriot” wing of the state Republican Party as Doeden, it’s unlikely he would break with Trump on any issue. Undeclared as a candidate so far is Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has had nothing but praise for the president.
Yet, as Trump and his minions continue to take a machete to the federal budget, he only serves to make life tougher for the next governor of South Dakota.
An easy reference for this can be found on South Dakota Searchlight’s “Federal Fallout” page, containing stories detailing the impact of federal budget cuts in this state. A scroll through the stories shows some of the challenges that the next governor will face as federal funding starts to disappear:

$5 million of extra costs for the state to manage the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
$2.2 million cut from South Dakota Public Broadcasting.
$5.6 million cut from efforts to expand digital access.
$2.8 million for teacher training.

Remember, in South Dakota, a million dollars still goes a long way. Consequently, replacing a million dollars in the state budget will be hard work. The state budget is $7.3 billion. Of that, $3.1 billion comes from the federal government.

Read the latest > 


Ultimately, there’s no telling how much the federal government’s share of the state budget will shrink. Cutting foreign aid and funding for public broadcasting were just the first of Trump’s rescission efforts to erase federal spending that has already been approved by Congress.
All of this is happening at a time when South Dakotans are upset about the continual rise in property taxes. The next governor will be faced with the task of figuring out how to moderate or cut those taxes while also finding a way to replace federal funds that have gone missing.
Some of these federal cuts will be felt in the next session of the Legislature. A South Dakota Searchlight story about a meeting of state fiscal experts included a projection that lagging revenue could result in as much as $24.5 million less for the next state budget.
These candidates who want to be governor should pay close attention to the funding problems faced by Gov. Rhoden and legislators in the next session. There is still plenty of time between now and January for Trump and the Republican majorities in Congress to make more cuts. The struggles in Pierre will serve as a harbinger of the challenges the next governor will face.
Fear of Trump’s wrath sparks an almost blind loyalty within the Republican Party. These GOP candidates for governor must ask themselves if they really want the job of running South Dakota government while the party leader they praise is working overtime to make the job more difficult.

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)PITTSBURG, Kan. — Amid a summer swelter last week, more than 80 people crowded into a trendy gastropub in downtown Pittsburg, Kansas, for cold drinks and hot talk.
The subject? Democrats.
After disappointing results in November, Kansas state House Democrats are touring the Republican-leaning state, trying to improve relationships and set the stage for a comeback. Pittsburg, a college town of 20,500 in the southeastern corner of the state, elected a Democratic state representative as recently as 2018 before choosing a Republican in the past three elections.
“Your guys’s messaging sucks,” local resident Justin Mcelwain told a panel of state Democratic lawmakers during the Q&A portion of the town hall-style event last Thursday, adding that when it comes to getting their points across, Democrats “are not even in the same sphere as the right wing.”
Earlier, Mcelwain had raised his hand along with a handful of others to indicate he had never before attended a political event.
During a brief interview, he described his political views as “so far to the left that guns are cool again.” What Democrats need to do, he said, is repeatedly emphasize the effects of President Donald Trump’s and Republicans’ policies.
“They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that your life, over the next five, 10 years or whatever, all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party,” Mcelwain said.
Some state-level Democrats believe Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act provides a perfect opening.
Trump signed the massive tax cuts and spending legislation into law on Independence Day. The sweeping measure cuts more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, the safety net insurance program funded jointly by the federal government and states. It slashes spending on food assistance and green energy programs and cuts taxes in a way that overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest earners.
In Kansas and a majority of states, Republicans dominate the legislature, with many increasingly tying themselves to the Make America Great Again movement. As Democrats search for a path back to power, both at the federal and state levels, they are seizing on Trump’s signature legislation six months into his second term as a major rallying cry.
“Let’s not even get started about the one big beautiful awful bill,” Kansas state House Minority Leader Brandon Woodard told the Pittsburg crowd.
A few audience members groaned in agreement.
Trump’s sweeping law is an opportunity, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview with Stateline. Portions of it “are so obviously cruel and detrimental to so many people,” she said. Reductions to Medicaid and food assistance, for example, will cut across party lines.










They need to drive it home and hold on to that forever — that … all the decline in your quality of life is a direct result of the Republican Party.


– Justin Mcelwain, Pittsburg, Kan., resident


Kelly said Republicans already appear worried about the political consequences: She pointed to efforts by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, to repeal some of the federal cuts to the safety net health program.
“I do think that they’re very concerned, as they should be,” Kelly said. “And I hope that the public stays engaged, stays informed, continues to protest as they have been, and that those of us in positions to educate and inform take that role very seriously.”
‘Not a bumper sticker bill’
The law’s enactment comes as Democrats have been searching for a compelling message. They’re trying to connect with disaffected voters after Trump and Republicans attacked the party last year as elitist and out of touch, and they’re highlighting Trump’s actions since his inauguration.
But amid a daily barrage of Trump developments, the party has been pulled in a multitude of directions — spotlighting everything from violent immigration raids to Trump’s connections to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
Earlier this month, the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats at the state level, launched ads in several states with upcoming competitive legislative races slamming Republicans “for selling us out” with Trump’s tax and spending law.
The group is focusing heavily on New Jersey and Virginia, the two states with legislative and gubernatorial races in the fall. In 2026, it will target swing states including Michigan and Wisconsin, but also divided states, such as Kansas, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, that have Democratic governors but Republican control of one or both legislative chambers.
Nevada Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, a board member of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said Republicans have failed to live up to the rhetoric of the 2024 race that focused largely on lowering costs, presenting a “big opportunity” for his party.
In his state, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is expected to face one of the nation’s most competitive gubernatorial races next year.
Yeager said Nevada Democrats will tell voters about the “complicity” of Republicans at the state level — and share a positive vision of Democratic priorities.
“I think Democrats in Nevada and nationwide are a little more clear-eyed in terms of what our objective is and should be, and that’s just to help people with the day-to-day issues that they face,” he said.
State Democrats may also look to a GOP strategy from 15 years ago.
Chris Cooper, a professor of political science and public affairs at Western Carolina University, wondered whether Democrats would employ Trump’s “big, beautiful” law against Republicans the way the GOP used President Barack Obama’s signature health care law against his allies.
“Is this going to become the Republican version of Obamacare?” Cooper asked. Despite proving popular over time, the passage of the Affordable Care Act was initially a political albatross for Democrats, who lost hundreds of seats in statehouses in 2010, Cooper said.
But at hundreds of pages long, Trump’s federal legislation will require lots of education for voters to fully appreciate the implications to taxes, social services and immigration. And many of the deepest cuts won’t be felt for months or years, with Republicans setting up the cuts to go into effect after the midterm elections.
“It’s not a bumper sticker bill,” Cooper said.
“The Democratic strategy can’t just be, ‘Remember what happened,’” he said. “First they have to teach people what happened, and then they have to work to assign blame, and then they have to work to mobilize that blame to their benefit.”

In Pennsylvania, officials expect more than 300,000 residents to lose health coverage through Medicaid cuts and over 140,000 to lose food assistance. Pennsylvania Democratic state Sen. Vincent Hughes said Republicans will be held accountable for that devastation in next year’s state races.
“The very loud silence coming from Republican elected officials, MAGA elected officials, Trump-loving elected officials all across the country, that will be spoken about, that will be talked about, because their silence screamed volumes,” Hughes said. “They chose to look the other way, knowing the kind of damage this would do.”
For their part, national Republicans have sought to frame the law as a major win because of its deep tax cuts and huge influx of spending on immigration enforcement. At the state level, the messaging has so far been more mixed. In May, 20 of the nation’s 27 GOP governors signed a letter in support of the bill.
The Republican Legislative Campaign Committee, the party’s state committee, did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Michigan state Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former chair of the committee, said that Democrats “will feel the consequences next year” of opposing Trump’s bill. The minority leader of Michigan’s state Senate, Nesbitt is running to be the GOP’s nominee for governor.
“Democrats walked the political plank by voting for a $2,000 tax increase on working families, for allowing illegal immigrants to continue collecting Medicaid, against eliminating taxes on tips, overtime & Social security benefits, for [former President Joe] Biden’s war on American energy & against enforcing our immigration laws,” he wrote in a statement to Stateline.
Democrats ‘fight back’
This summer, Kansas House Democrats have embarked on a “Fight Back” tour across the state, visiting communities where the party has struggled in recent years.
“We’re going to places that unless there’s someone representing them as a Democrat, we’re being defined by cable news as to what a Democrat is,” Woodard, the Kansas House minority leader, told Stateline.

In Pittsburg, some Democrats said they are unsure whether the federal tax and spending law will help shake loose Republicans’ grip locally.
Janice Arthur, a lifelong Democrat who retired after working in the customer service industry, refused to say Trump’s name as she spoke about the legislation, declaring there’s “nothing about the current occupant of the White House that I agree with or I appreciate.”
When asked whether the law would cause her Republican friends and neighbors to vote for Democrats, she voiced uncertainty. “I don’t know,” she said.
Pittsburg was historically a Democratic stronghold in Republican-leaning Kansas. The party lost substantial ground locally over the past two decades, until the last Democratic state representative failed to win reelection in 2020. Last year, the city’s Democratic candidate for the state House received just 40% of the vote.
But these are the kinds of races Kansas Democrats will have to win if they want to break the Republican supermajority in the state legislature and, one day, take control of a chamber — something that hasn’t happened since the 1990s. Democrats need to flip five seats in 2026 to end the Republicans’ veto-proof majority in the House.
Emily Walters, who chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party, which includes Pittsburg, said many voters locally cast ballots for the first time last year, enthusiastic about what she called “the image” they have of Trump. They voted Republican down the ballot, she said.
“My suspicion is … they are being quickly disillusioned by the reality of Donald Trump,” Walters said. “And without that artificial buoyancy, I think that Crawford County has a very good shot of reverting to its blue self.”

In both of his terms in office, Donald Trump has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens
The post A nation of immigrants imperiled  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AT THE RECENT graduation ceremony for Northern Essex Community College’s Center for Adult Education, we celebrated the accomplishments of 24 students who had completed their high school equivalency exams, dozens more who finished English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) programs, 15 inductees into the National Adult Education Honor Society, and six newly naturalized citizens of the United States, who, waving American flags, treated the crowd to a surprise performance of “God Bless America.” 
Adult education programs like these are offered by community colleges, school districts, and non-profit organizations across the country, and are in high demand by people seeking a second chance at improving their lives through education; by employers looking for talented, credentialed workers in a tight labor market; and by immigrants drawn to the promise of America. 
Recently, these programs seemed to be at risk, as the Trump administration announced that $716 million in adult education program funding that was supposed to be distributed to states by July 1 was being withheld. The administration said the freeze on these funds was due to a wider review of resources allocated to education, under suspicion that, according to a spokesperson at the Office of Management and Budget, “Many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.”  
Last week, facing mounting criticism, the Trump administration said that it will release the adult education funds – along with more than $4 billion in other funding for K-12 schools and higher education that had also been held back.  
That news was a huge relief. Still in place, however, is a directive in letters sent by the US Department of Education to colleges rescinding guidance that had been in place since 1997 that allowed federal funds to be used for undocumented residents in some adult education programs. The letters notified them the “Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders” executive order signed by President Trump in February is intended to “prevent spending of American taxpayer dollars on Federal assistance for illegal aliens,” and therefore, colleges should no longer admit undocumented students into these programs. 
While the focus in these recent announcements is on ending federal support for undocumented residents, it is clear from other White House communications and actions that the broader agenda is to practically eliminate immigration into the United States entirely. 
In both of his terms in office, the Trump administration has taken aim at each of the principal ways that people from other countries can become naturalized United States citizens, including: 

Family-based sponsorship: A way for a US citizen or lawful permanent resident to sponsor close relatives for a green card that President Trump has derided as “chain migration,” and vowed to curtail by reducing the categories of eligible family members, increasing income requirements, and imposing stricter, more time-consuming vetting processes. 


Employment-based sponsorship: A way for an employer to sponsor a foreign national for a green card with a qualifying job offer that Trump is aggressively trying to limit through stricter interpretation of H1-B visa requirements, setting higher wage requirements for work visas, and enhanced vetting of visa applications, which slows processing time and presents barriers for employers seeking to fill vacant positions. 


Refugee or asylee status: A process used to recognize individuals fleeing their home country because of a fear of persecution that the Trump administration has nearly eliminated by suspending the US Refugee Admissions Program, suspending asylum applications for anyone attempting to cross America’s southern border, and ending Temporary Protected Status designations for asylees from Afghanistan, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and other strife-torn nations. 

These steps are in addition to the Trump administration’s attempts to end birthright citizenship, which has been guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution since 1868; and severely limit the number of international students studying at American universities through travel bans, suspension of visa interviews, social media vetting, and other steps designed to dissuade aspiring scholars from other countries from considering American higher education. 
Despite this array of restrictions on everyday people attempting to emigrate to the United States, Trump has proposed, and even set up a web site for wealthy foreigners interested in applying for, the “Trump Card,” which offers US citizenship to anyone willing to pay $5 million for the privilege. 
The president is not alone in pursuing these immigration restrictions.  Although it passed by the narrowest possible margin in Congress, the recently enacted “One Big, Beautiful Bill Act” contains a number of provisions, like a 300 percent increase in funding for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), $45 billion for construction of ICE detention facilities, and $46 billion for border wall construction, designed to deter would-be immigrants to America. 
Taken together, Trump’s executive orders since January and his signing of the “One Big, Beautiful Bill” Act represent a radical shift in federal policy toward immigrants, based largely on myths and misinformation, like claims that immigrants are overrunning the US population, are more prone to committing violent crime, and are taking American jobs or relying on welfare assistance. In fact: 

The proportion of foreign-born residents of the US is the same today as it was in the early 1900s. While the share of the population made up immigrants has increased in recent decades, it is now same as it was at the turn of the 20th century. According to the Migration Policy Institute, in 1910, 14.7 percent of US residents were born in other countries. Today, that figure is slightly lower, at 14.3 percent. 


Immigration is stabilizing our population. Massachusetts has experienced a net migration of native-born citizens out of the state each year since 2011, and we have slipped from 9th to 16th place in population size. Immigration has been the only way we did not actually lose population overall. And the same is true across New England, which has the oldest average population of any region in the country and, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has noted, is being reenergized through immigration.  The consequences of losing population are significant, and include a smaller workforce, fewer consumers, and fewer representatives in Washington. 


Immigrants are educated: According to the Migration Policy Institute, 48 percent of recently arrived immigrants have a college degree, compared to only 38 percent of native-born Americans. 


Immigrants are law-abiding: One of the big fears often stoked about immigrants is crime, and accusations that those seeking asylum or citizenship are violent criminals. But numerous studies over the years have demonstrated conclusively that immigrants commit fewer crimes and have lower rates of incarceration than native-born US citizens. 


Immigration improves our economy: According to a study from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, “Most economists agree that the effects of immigration on the US economy are broadly positive,” and include: 


Increased wages: Immigrants often do not compete for the same jobs as native US citizens, putting minimal downward pressure on wages. Rather, immigrants’ consumer needs increase the demands for goods and services, and studies find that immigration has actually raised average wages of native-born workers over the past few decades. 


Improved innovation: Immigrants account for a disproportionately high share of patent filings, science and technology graduates, and senior positions at top venture capital-funded firms. In addition, the presence of immigrants often creates opportunities for less-skilled native workers to become more specialized in their work, thereby increasing their productivity. 


Higher tax revenue: Contrary to one often expressed belief, most immigrants, including those in the country without authorization, pay significantly more in taxes over a lifetime than they consume in government services. According to a report by Pew Research, immigrants in the US illegally contribute more than $12 billion annually in state and local taxes. The average estimated tax rate of unauthorized immigrants is 8 percent, while the wealthiest one percent of Americans pay just over 5 percent. Approximately 75 percent of unauthorized immigrants contribute to Social Security—a benefit they are not even eligible to receive. 


Saving retirement: The US population is getting older. In 1990, there were five workers in America for every retiree. Now, there are only three. Without immigration, by 2030 that ratio will fall to only two—not enough to sustain our population of retirees. 

Over the past few national election cycles, our nation has seemingly swung from one extreme to another as each party has sought to impose its vision for immigration on a population that appears equally divided over which way to turn. 
A few years ago, New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, ever the pragmatist, suggested that what we really need is “A high wall with a big gate,” an approach that would balance our very real need for national security and social cohesion with our equally compelling need for shoring up our aging, birth-rate-declining population with the energy and vibrancy of immigrants seeking a better way of life. 
The last time Congress passed meaningful comprehensive immigration reform that moved us in that direction was nearly 40 years ago, when President Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which imposed penalties on employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants and increased funding for border security, but also provided amnesty and a path to citizenship for nearly three million undocumented immigrants. 
President Reagan, and indeed leaders of both political parties until recently, recognized the importance of immigration to the very essence of what it means to be an American. 
In his final speech as president, which is worth taking a few minutes to watch as a reminder of why he was called “the great communicator,” Reagan noted, “We lead the world because, unique among nations, we draw our people—our strength—from every country and every corner of the world. And by doing so we continuously renew and enrich our nation.”  
Then he cautioned, “If we ever close the door to new Americans, our leadership in the world would soon be lost.” 
Four decades later, under the policies being implemented by the Trump administration, we are rapidly spiraling in the direction Reagan feared for the nation. 
Reagan added one more particularly poignant point, which was inescapably obvious to the crowd watching those half-dozen newly naturalized American citizens wave their flags and sing “God Bless America” at the recent graduation ceremony for Northern Essex’s Center for Adult Education: “Those who become American citizens love this country even more.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)As residents rally to alert neighbors to immigration agents around the city, Durham City Council member Javiera Caballero warned Saturday that anyone could be arrested off the street and detained.
Speaking to an audience of around 70 at a “State of Durham” town hall held in the Durham County Main Library, Caballero said the massive boost in funding given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the recent congressional megabill would only embolden the agency to abduct noncitizens and citizens alike.
“Once that money really hits, what’s going to happen to our community is actually quite terrifying. And so when I say we’re going to have to put our bodies on the line, it’s not hyperbole,” Caballero said. “They will disappear folks, they will kidnap folks, and it’s not just going to be folks who, quote, shouldn’t be here.”
Though the discussion, moderated by organizers with Kids Voting Durham and a journalist from INDY Week, ranged from housing and transit to education and crime, the presence of ICE and other ways the city might be targeted by immigration enforcement proved a recurring source of anxiety among audience members.
Caballero said she was proud of the city for mustering an “amazing community response” to ICE agents spotted at the Durham County Courthouse, apparently seeking to detain a man ahead of his initial court appearance. Their presence became widely known through immigrant advocacy group Siembra NC’s “ICE Watch” program, which trains spotters who monitor their communities for ICE amid the Trump administration’s mass deportation efforts.
“Those are the kinds of things we’re going to have to be doing, bringing attention to it and then really fighting for our community,” she said. “When we say that Durham is a welcoming place, it’s not just a tagline — we believe it.”

‘It’s about mass deportation’
Nida Allam, who chairs the Durham Board of County Commissioners, said standing up to ICE will take a collective effort from residents.
“Showing up when there’s ICE sightings, making sure community is out there to witness, record, document what is happening to make sure that our community stays as safe as possible, and that there’s a record of these incidents so that way we can protect our community,” said Allam, among the local officials who spoke out at the courthouse last month.
She pointed to the case of Greensboro man Mohamed Naser, a Libyan father of five detained in July who has spent weeks in a Georgia detention facility. Though he was granted bond, ICE denied his release. “He has been here on a valid visa, is a pending asylum case, and unfortunately, they have taken him away from his family, he’s the main breadwinner,” she said.

“We know that U.S. citizens have been taken all over this country already, and kept in detention for weeks while they’re trying to get legal services to get themselves out,” Caballero said.
Durham School Board Chair Bettina Umstead stressed that “every student is welcome in our public school system,” and noted that they do not ask for the immigration status of enrollees. Asked how Durham Public Schools would address ICE agents attempting to come onto the property, she was circumspect.
“Our principals all have a guidance document around what to do in the public school system, and I think there was a message sent to families that we are aware of what’s going on,” Umstead said. “We want to be really mindful of what we’re sharing publicly to everyone to make sure that our policies and procedures around safety at school stay something that remain private.”
Rep. Marcia Morey (D-Durham), who billed herself as the bearer of bad news throughout the forum, said the passage of House Bill 318 over Governor Josh Stein’s veto would only expand ICE’s ability to seize North Carolinians. The bill requires sheriffs to vet the immigration status of detainees and hold them beyond their time of release pending ICE action.
“It’s no longer about public safety, it’s about mass deportation, and it’s right out of the Project 2025 playbook,” Morey said. “We’re still going to fight it, we’re going to do all we can to take that back.”
After she alluded to the fact that the bill became law only after a single Democrat joined with Republicans to override the veto, an audience member interrupted: “Let’s name her name, Carla Cunningham.”
‘What’s affordable?’
In stark contrast to clashes over immigration, Durham officials described continued support from the federal government in expanding the city’s and region’s transportation infrastructure.
“The federal government hasn’t really cut transit dollars — that’s not what we’re seeing so far,” Caballero said. “That’s one space that we’re kind of very much holding our breath around, but the federal dollars are still moving forward.”
She described the city’s plan to move forward on a bus rapid transit project through a federal grant, upgrading a line from Duke Hospital through downtown to Wellons Village, one of the highest ridership communities in the city. “Bus rapid transit is basically your regular bus line but way nicer and faster,” she said.

At the interstate level, Caballero noted that federal funding also continues to support the S-Line “Raleigh to Richmond” Amtrak expansion, which is set to create a faster passenger train line connecting Washington to Atlanta through North Carolina and neighboring states. She urged residents to make their voices heard in the upcoming midterm elections to ensure that elected members of Congress continue to support the state’s transit initiatives.
She expressed frustration, however, that so much of the state-level transit dollars are tied to the widening of old roads and the construction of new ones — to the point that the Triangle West Transportation Planning Organization, which she and Allam serve on, expects to forgo much of the North Carolina Department of Transportation funding.
“Having an effective General Assembly that doesn’t hate its cities would be great,” Caballero said. “[We decided] we didn’t want to take NCDOT dollars that were just going to expand roads and make them wider, that we really wanted to move away from that, that it did not align with our goals around transit and climate.”
Allam said transit and housing affordability are the two biggest issues where she sees the potential for bipartisan collaboration. She noted that Johnston County, long a Republican stronghold, is on track to be the fastest growing county in the state from now to 2055 — creating the same pressures around growth that have long affected more urban and left-leaning areas in the state.
“Affordable housing 10 years ago was a Raleigh issue, a Charlotte issue. It wasn’t a Johnston County issue, it wasn’t a Person County issue,” Allam said. “And now, it is.”
Morey said affordability would be out of reach so long as workers in the state are underpaid.
“What’s affordable? When you’re paying people $7.25 an hour minimum wage that hasn’t gone up in 20 years, how are you ever going to have affordable housing?” she asked. “Putting a down payment, the rent, the dream of buying a house is going out of reach for people and we need to do better.”
‘Bored kids cause trouble’
Another area of concern around federal funding is education, city officials said, pointing to after-school and summer programs that rely on money from the Department of Education that has been in doubt. Those funds were frozen by the Trump administration and only released after lawsuits from dozens of states, including North Carolina.
“When that federal freeze happened in the summer, there was a lot of concern from community partners that work directly with our Durham Public Schools students over, can we fund our program? This is where students go after school,” said Umstead, the school board chair.
  Durham School Board Chair Bettina Umstead speaks to residents at a town hall on Saturday, Aug. 2, 2025. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)
Officials connected the existence of these programs and other educational opportunities with crime prevention. Discussing gun violence, Umstead touted a “text-to-tip” program allowing students to report potential threats as well as mental health investments like therapy provided on school property.
“The role the school system needs to play is to make sure students have connections to all the opportunities that are listed there,” Umstead said. “How do we make school an exciting place for students to be, that’s a connector to the other places?”
Caballero, a mother of three teenagers, pointed to crime reports showing teenage boys getting access to guns, often stolen out of unattended vehicles, and warned that “bored kids cause trouble.”
“There’s not enough for them to do, you can’t even go to an arcade in most places in Durham because it’s a 21-plus establishment, and so we have to do better by our youth,” she said. “How do we, as a community, make sure that we’re offering what we can to our kids and keeping them busy?”
Speakers also criticized attacks on reading materials and diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools. Morey called a set of bills seeking to ban DEI in North Carolina “horrific,” and said it was vital that lawmakers uphold Stein’s vetoes on them.
“It is criminalizing a concept, diversity, equity, inclusion, our country is built on,” Morey said. “In my eight years, they’re the most despicable bills I have ever seen.”
After the forum, resident David McCole said the bills seeking to ban DEI were his top concern. He added that he was impressed with Morey’s earlier comments on income inequality, adding that he was glad she called out tax breaks given to corporations under changes to North Carolina’s fiscal policy.
“Our General Assembly is not doing enough or anything to look at where we stand and helping our workforce, the people at the lower level of the economic scale,” he said. “How do we improve their ability to be able to afford things such as rent or housing, things along those lines? I loved her comments on that.”
Attendee Najerie McMillian said she was disturbed by the ongoing ICE arrests in the community.
“It’s disheartening to hear what ICE is doing. They’re actually going to schools and churches trying to pull people out,” McMillian said. “It’s actually U.S. citizens, people born and raised here, whose parents and grandparents were born and raised here, getting snatched up too.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Durham-Town-Hall-Featured-1024x641.jpg,,,2025-08-03 08:56:19.365128

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
In Utah, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson’s Office shared its letter  to the Department of Justice in response to its request, which says the state has provided its publicly available voter registration list. Henderson’s office also pushed back on the department’s claim that Utah has “the lowest rate in the nation for voter registration records removed from the voter registration rolls.”
“Utah remains one of the most proactive states for maintaining current and accurate voter registration rolls,” explaining that the department was relying on the limited reporting available from Utah’s 25-year-old system, which is being replaced.
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Anne Watson: How to flex your flood preparedness muscle.","This commentary is by Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington. She is chair of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy. She has served in the Vermont Senate since 2023 and was previously Montpelier’s mayor from 2018 to 2022.


It has been heartbreaking to see flash flooding occur in Vermont for the past three summers, and increasingly around the country as well. 
I, for one, do not want to let this kind of news begin to feel normal. This is not the Vermont I grew up in. It is already hotter and wetter from climate change, and there are a number of things we can do as individuals, homeowners and renters to be prepared for the next natural disaster. 
What the last three years have taught me is that flooding and erosion can impact anyone anywhere in Vermont, depending on what areas receive intense rainfall. So it’s important that we are all prepared for that possibility.

Every choice we make matters — and the choices we make right now will affect how prepared we are for our next natural disaster. Here are some practical steps you and your family can take to be better prepared for potential flooding events. Some of them may apply to you, some may not, but these are taken directly from Vermont Emergency Management’s website:

Install “check valves” in sewer traps to prevent flood water from backing up into the drains in your home.
Ensure your home is ready. Where possible, minimize damage from basement flooding by elevating utilities and materials that could be damaged by limited basement flooding.
Anchor fuel tanks to ensure that they do not wash away, which can create a safety and environmental issue inside or outside of the home.
Develop a family emergency kit, which could include food and water, medications, a first aid kit, and a flashlight with extra batteries, amongst other things.
Make a family communication plan. Designate an out-of-state relative as a central point of contact.
Be prepared to turn off electrical power when there is standing water, fallen power lines or before you evacuate. Know how to safely turn off gas and water supplies before you evacuate.
Contact your insurance agent or local government to discuss flood insurance coverage.

Other recommendations from ready.gov include: knowing evacuation routes, safeguarding documents and planning with your neighbors.
Also, if you have not signed up for VT-Alerts — which, according to the state’s website, is “used to notify the public of emergency situations,” such as evacuation information, severe weather advisories and roadway interruptions — now would be a great time to do that. 
You can sign up by following the instructions on the VT-Alert website. WCAX reports that only 90,000 Vermonters have signed up to receive these alerts — 14% of the state’s total population. I would highly recommend doing so to anyone living or working in Vermont.
Finally, I’ll add one recommendation of my own. Since we know these events are driven and exacerbated by climate change, we all also have an obligation to do what we can to reduce our fossil fuel consumption. 
Thankfully, most renewable alternatives are much cheaper to operate than their fossil fuel counterparts. Maybe this means taking the bus or carpooling; leasing or buying an EV or plug-in hybrid; or adding a heat pump, pellet stove or another renewable heating system. 
For each of us the solutions may look different, but it’s important that we are all looking to take that next step toward the ways in which we can reduce carbon pollution.
Meanwhile, the Legislature will continue to have more work to do this next session to protect and prepare Vermont for potential natural disasters. This includes ensuring that Vermont’s dams are safe and that we are protecting our wetlands to help prevent and reduce the risks from these kinds of events in the future.
We all have a part to play. We can all make a difference to ensure that our families and neighbors are safe and able to weather the storms that we know are likely to continue on into the future.
You can access multi-language translations, a free workbook and other resources on the Vermont Emergency Management website.

Duff of Hattiesburg, who along with his brother James are listed as the state’s only billionaires, according to Forbes Magazine, has made no secret of the fact he is considering a run for governor.
If he does, it will mark the first time for Duff’s name to be placed on ballot for public office. The 68-year-old would be starting his political career vying for the highest office in Mississippi.
Combustible Vicksburg contractor Kirk Fordice, a unique politician in Mississippi on many levels, is the only person in the modern era to win the Mississippi governorship in his first venture as a candidate.
All other successful candidates for governor in the modern era have held other elected offices before capturing the seat.
Going all the way back to the 1950s, Ross Barnett was a successful trial attorney before running for governor — his first elected office. He lost the governor’s race twice before finally winning the post in 1959 and then becoming a national figure as he fought to maintain Mississippi’s segregated society.
A few other people have tried to win the governor’s mansion in their first campaigns. They have not been successful.
People always say a candidate needs strong name identification to run for governor. Even though he has not run for statewide office, Duff has the wherewithal and presumably the willingness to write seven — and maybe eight — figure checks to develop that recognition. And with his money, he has the ability to craft the narrative he wants Mississippians to hear.
But what we don’t know yet is whether Duff has the “it” factor. Will Duff look comfortable in his own skin traveling around the state asking people for their support?
Often, though not always, it comes down to the old adage that people vote for the candidate with whom they would have a beer or glass of tea.
It can take a special personality to navigate campaigning. Experience on the campaign trail helps develop the skills to do and say the right things in often stressful circumstances. It helps to be quick on your feet.
Andy Mullins, a longtime administrator at the University of Mississippi and before then an aide to Gov. William Winter, tells the story of Winter campaigning.
Winter entered a drug store in south Mississippi and went to the pharmacist to ask for his support. The pharmacist told him in no uncertain terms, Mullins said, that he would not vote for Winter because he would not help get his son into medical school.
After enduring a verbal beating from the pharmacist, Mullins recalled what Winter said as he left the store: “Put the pharmacist down as undecided.”
Who knows how Duff will perform if he does engage in his first campaign. He may be a natural.
Many thought Tupelo businessman Jack Reed was a natural in 1987 when he entered the governor’s race as a political novice. Indeed, he did appear to be one, but he ran into and lost a close election to a politician with more experience in Ray Mabus.
Reed will go down with others, such as Mike Sturdivant and John Arthur Eaves Jr., who waged and lost their maiden political campaign for the hard-to-obtain office of governor.
Sturdivant, a Glendora farmer and businessman, spent a large sum of his own money running in the Democratic primaries in 1983 and 1987. Eaves also wrote large personal checks to his campaign against incumbent Haley Barbour in 2007.
Duff recently appeared at an economic forum hosted by Mississippi Today and JPMorgan Chase. During his on-stage interview before the hundreds of attendees, he deflected most questions and laid out few policy specifics.
But Duff has plenty of time to develop a campaign platform before the 2027 election. The question is whether he has the skills to connect with Mississippians as he delivers it.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29120449/MSRS153.jpg,,,2025-08-03 07:56:58.465586

But there are ways to improve those roads that reduce pollution and strengthen against floods.

BURLINGTON — Vermont’s dirt roads span 8,534 miles — more than the straight-line distance between Burlington and San Francisco three times over. They contribute to the state’s rustic charm, bring tourists looking for gravel biking and are beloved by rural residents.
They are also particularly vulnerable to floods. 
Runoff from any type of road can harm water quality, but Vermont has some 1,300 more miles of dirt than pavement — and that dirt is subject to easy erosion. 
With the state experiencing an increase in flooding, those old roads are hitting waterways and their ecosystems hard. 
And the state is pretty much stuck with them. “Putting in paved roads is very expensive, and we just don’t have that kind of funding in Vermont to want to do that,” said Jim Ryan, former manager of the Vermont Municipal Roads Program with the Department of Environmental Conservation.
But there are ways to improve those roads that reduce pollution and strengthen against floods. 
Like paved roads, dirt roads are essentially impervious, meaning they do not absorb water, said Beverly Wemple, a University of Vermont professor who helps lead the college’s Water Resources Institute. When it rains, water washes across those surfaces, eroding sediment and running into ditches or bodies of water.
Phosphorus likes to bind to sediment, meaning it gets swept away too. In excess, it fuels harmful algae blooms — as is the case in Lake Champlain, where runoff has deposited high levels of the nutrient. Large sections of the lake are on the federal impaired waterways list.
Phosphorus aside, those sediments can hurt aquatic ecosystems where plants and animals struggle to survive in water choked with dirt and debris. 
Wemple’s research helped bring attention to dirt road runoff at a time when Vermont was focusing more and more on water quality. 
A 2008 lawsuit alleging poor pollution control forced federal and state officials to revise plans for Lake Champlain. State lawmakers passed the Vermont Clean Water Act in 2015, anticipating stricter standards. Those came a year later when federal officials tightened limits on phosphorus in the lake. 
People wanted a better understanding of where the phosphorus was coming from.
Funded by the Lake Champlain Basin Program, Wemple studied the impact of Vermont’s transportation network on water quality.
Tropical Storm Irene hit while research was underway, allowing Wemple’s team to also see what happens to Vermont’s roads when they flood, she said. 
The study, released in 2013, proved erosion from dirt roads was a significant source of sediment in waterways — and confirmed phosphorus attached to the sediment was polluting Lake Champlain. It also included research on ways to keep water off roads and reduce runoff.
“That research essentially gave us the first piece … of scientific evidence of the importance of our road network as a source of pollutant transfer but also of the potential for some fairly straightforward practices to minimize that pollutant runoff,” Wemple said. 
After the new phosphorus regulations, the state created a permit program that set road standards for towns. It aimed to reduce erosion contributing to phosphorus pollution. The Department of Environmental Conservation and Agency of Transportation run the program. 
Towns must record the condition of their roads and key characteristics — such as whether they connect to water and whether they use storm drains, or ditches and culverts, for drainage. Over half the roads in Vermont connect to waterways, the state says.
The Agency of Natural Resources says open-drainage roads — those with culverts and ditches — are often gravel and produce the most phosphorus. Those roads are where the bulk of the standards are applied.
Towns must upgrade roads not up to code. For a dirt road, this usually means improving drainage: lining ditches with stones and vegetation to filter out sediment.
There are also improvements to the road itself. Crowning a road, or lowering the sides so the high point is in the middle, helps it shed water, as does removing berms and ruts that trap water. Another element: properly sizing culverts, the tunnels that allow water to pass underneath roads. 
“We were able to document that many of these practices are quite effective in both reducing erosion and making the transportation network more flood resilient,” said Wemple. 
Through the Agency of Transportation’s Better Roads Program, towns can apply for grants to cover projects.
Making improvements also helps protect from floods, said Ryan. Working as a deputy stream engineer in the aftermath of Irene, and doing “flood forensics” after the 2023 floods, he found that up-to-standard roads came away in better shape.
Where there was damage, the culprit was most frequently culvert size, he said. Often the issue stemmed from small culverts under driveways or over intermittent streams. In heavy rain, culverts have to handle more water than usual. If they’re too small, they flood or get blocked by debris, leading to a domino effect where one failed culvert takes out several others down the road, Ryan said.
Municipalities are slowly updating their roads. Ryan said Vermont towns have an average of 25 miles of roads running directly into waterways and are upgrading about a mile a year.  
Flood resilience can get a boost right away, but maintenance is ongoing. 
“There’s no finish line there. The road grader always has to go out and put a proper crown on the road, remove the grader berm, lower the road’s shoulders and clean out the ditches,” Ryan said.
His observations are set to be tested: Wemple just began a two-year study on the impact of the road permit program on flood resilience in 2023 and 2024.
“We hear anecdotally … that it looks like places where we’ve upgraded the storm water infrastructure on roads, there were fewer damages,” she said. “But we don’t have the scientific evidence to back that up yet.” 
Wemple said people often ask, Should we just pave the roads?
One factor is uncertainty about which is worse for water quality. Wemple said there’s not much difference between paved and unpaved.
But there’s also what she called “the societal question.”
“Many of us in Vermont are quite attached to our rural landscapes and those unpaved roads,” she said. “And if we paved them, people would drive a lot faster. And we’d lose some of that rural ideal that we are really attached to.” 
Eric Barker lives on a dirt road in Underhill close to where he grew up. When he chose where to raise his family, a dirt road was a priority. 
“I don’t even think we looked at a single lot on pavement,” he said.
His driveway requires a lot of care, and his car has gotten stuck in the mud at inopportune times, but he said it’s worth it.
“I think you have to have the right vehicles, and I think you have to have the right mentality,” he said. He values the privacy his home allows for his family — and the sparse traffic. 
Dirt roads also draw tourism. Waterford resident Fritz Fay is president of Northeast Kingdom Gravel. The organization’s mission is to bring dollars to the Kingdom by mapping gravel biking routes and attracting tourists. 
The sport has exploded in recent years — and Fay said Vermont, with its sprawl of dirt roads, is ready made for it.
Big events and concentrated trails can overwhelm small towns, and locals often resent that, Fay said, but gravel biking is gentler. 
The NEK has witnessed that scenario in East Burke with the popular Kingdom Trails. Gravel biking brings in a few people at a time across multiple towns, Fay said. 
“It’s scattered, and that’s an advantage,” he said. 
The benefits go beyond drawing cyclists, though.
“If all these roads were paved, it’d be one less kind of unique thing to come to Vermont (for),” he said.

WESTON — When the Weston Theater Company announced its musical now playing would be a stage adaptation of the 1954 film “White Christmas,” some locals wondered about the seeming incongruity of orchestrating summer with sleigh bells in the snow.
More residents, however, are worried about an even bigger toppling of tradition.
Upon its start in 1937, Vermont’s oldest professional acting troupe performed in a white-pillared playhouse on the postcard green of its namesake Windsor County town of 623 residents.
In 1962, a fire ravaged everything but the building’s Doric columns. In 1973 and 2011, storm overflow from the neighboring West River flooded the cellar of the restored structure. But come hell or high water, the company always reopened in keeping with the theatrical credo “the show must go on.”
Then on July 10, 2023, a record downpour swallowed up the playhouse’s basement and first floor. The troupe relocated to a smaller second stage at the nearby Walker Farm with hopes of bailing out the main theater in time for that summer’s musical — fatefully, the splashy “Singin’ in the Rain.”
But two years later, the playhouse sits empty as its nonprofit operators wrestle with questions about finances and the future.
“Our estimate right now is we’re three years out from getting back into the building, and when I tell people that, they’re shocked,” said Susanna Gellert, the theater company’s executive artistic director. “They think, ‘Why can’t we be back in tomorrow?’”

The answer, according to all involved, is almost as complicated as the bureaucratic paperwork they’re swimming in.
The theater company doesn’t own the playhouse, which was built as a church in 1839. Instead, the troupe leases it from the Weston Community Association, a volunteer-run nonprofit that also oversees the nearby 1795 Farrar-Mansur House museum and Cold Spring Brook Park.
In 2011, Tropical Storm Irene washed away a $700,000 renovation of the playhouse’s dressing rooms, prop shop and orchestra pit. Twelve years later, the 2023 floodwater rose about 30 inches higher, swelling cleanup costs to nearly $500,000 and the proposed reconstruction to as much as $5 million.
Both the community association and theater company are seeking damage reimbursements from insurance carriers and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. They’re also planning separate fundraising campaigns to pay for their parts of a shared restoration project.
But the state fire marshal has closed the playhouse to the public until the community association replaces the alarm and sprinkler system — a nearly $200,000 expense that volunteers have yet to figure out how to fund.
“A lot of the people we know who are capable of writing a big check are reluctant to do so until all of the building mitigation has been done,” community association President David Raymond said. “It’s a Catch-22 situation.”

The community association and theater company are not giving up. They recently welcomed U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vermont, to tell him about the cleanup challenges shared by dozens of communities statewide.
“When you look at this town at the helicopter level, we’ve got probably $12 million to $15 million worth of capital needs in the playhouse, fire station, post office, school,” Weston Town Moderator Wayne Granquist said. “That’s incredibly far beyond our capacity to raise money. We need to have external help.”
Welch didn’t promise federal funds, just words of understanding.
“The Weston Playhouse is such a community resource,” the senator said.
Planners are aiming to move all of the playhouse’s electrical and mechanical systems and backstage and storage space above the most recent flood line.
“It’s going to be a push to get the building sustainable, and then a push to get it functional again,” said Rebecca Marzalek-Kelly, the theater company’s general manager.
In the meantime, the theater company is presenting its 89th summer season at its nearby Walker Farm performance space.
“We’re doing what work we can right now so that we’re ready to get back into the playhouse once it’s ready,” Gellert said. “But all of that starts with funding.”
Raymond, for his part, knows the playhouse may be within walking distance of everything in town, but he and his community association colleagues have a long road ahead.
“Hope,” Raymond said when asked what kept him going. “And patience.”

U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The race to replace Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is crowded on both sides.
Whitmer, a Democrat and potential 2028 presidential contender, is term-limited. The current Democratic primary contenders are Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist; Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson; Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson; and Marni Sawicki, the former mayor of Cape Coral, Florida. If elected, Gilchrist would be the state’s first Black governor.
The crowded Republican field includes Rep. John James, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Sen. Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox and Anthony Hudson, a truck driver who ran for Congress in Michigan’s 8th District in 2024.
Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat, is also running for governor but as an independent candidate, potentially throwing a wrench into the dynamics of what is expected to be one of the closest and most competitive 2026 governor’s races.
Michigan has long been a key swing state — and a pipeline for women leaders — where control of the governor’s office has switched between Democratic and Republican over the last 40 years. Former President Joe Biden won the state by 2.8 points in 2020. In 2024, Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin won her election to the U.S. Senate by just 0.3 points while President Donald Trump carried the state by 1.4 points.
In all, 36 governorships are up in 2026. Five Democratic-led states won by Trump in 2024 (Arizona, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) are holding elections for governor in 2026, while two Republican governors in states won by former Vice President Kamala Harris (New Hampshire and Vermont) are up for reelection.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3115471-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Christiana Botic/Verite News and CatchLight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Daniel Cressy yawned, tired after three days of watching a machine pull blood out of his body, extract his stem cells and pump the blood back in. Tubes protruded from the side of his neck, preventing him from turning his head. He gestured toward them while sitting in his hospital bed at the Manning Family Children’s Hospital.
“It’s uncomfortable at first, but then you kind of get used to it,” he said Wednesday.
The tubes were annoying, but, to Cressy, the reward is more than worth the discomfort: freedom from sickle cell disease. This procedure marked the first major step toward what he hopes is a long-lasting cure for the rare genetic blood disorder.
Over the next year and a half, Cressy’s genes will be altered to remove the trait that causes his red blood cells to sickle, or harden and bend in a way that blocks blood flow and causes immense pain. He will be the first patient in Louisiana to complete the gene therapy treatment.
The 22-year-old’s stem cells will be sent to a lab in Scotland where they will be treated with an enzyme to reach a specific part of the cells and edit the gene to stop his blood cells from changing shape. Then, Cressy’s edited stem cells will be returned to Louisiana and infused back into his body. More than 90% of the patients in a clinical trial who received this treatment known as Casgevy, went at least a year without sickled cells blocking blood flow.

(Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
The process is long and expensive. Between insurance approvals, paperwork and preliminary doctor appointments, it took Cressy nearly a year to get to this room. But, for Cressy, it’s the only way to achieve his dream of becoming a commercial pilot.
Three years ago, Cressy discovered his love of flying, but after hours of lessons, working toward his certification, he was told his dream might be impossible. People with sickle cell disease seeking a pilot’s license face scrutiny over their health backgrounds from the Federal Aviation Administration.
High altitudes can make cells more likely to sickle, creating the risk of intense pain while in the air if there isn’t enough oxygen.
“The Office of Aerospace Medicine routinely reviews evolving medical therapies and updates policies when there is proof that new treatments are safe in the aviation environment,” said an FAA spokesperson in a statement.
Cressy applied for his medical certification in 2022 but was rejected despite several appeals. To Cressy, his condition was manageable. Unlike many people with severe cases of sickle cell disease, he hasn’t needed frequent hospital visits and blood transfusions to avoid pain.
“One thing that people don’t understand is that sickle cell affects everybody differently,” he said. “I believed that I could fly without getting cured.” But the FAA disagreed.
When Cressy first asked for the treatment, his hematologist, Dr. Zach LeBlanc, said no. To LeBlanc, a career in aviation didn’t seem like a top medical priority. But Cressy’s passion – and an official rejection from the FAA – changed LeBlanc’s mind.
“The more I got to know him, I understood that it wasn’t as superficial as it appeared the first time,” said LeBlanc, a pediatric hematologist with the hospital who was part of clinical trials to develop another long-term sickle cell cure. “He was really serious about this, and he understood the risk.”

Traditionally, bone marrow transplants have been the primary way to provide long-lasting relief, but patients have to fit specific criteria and find an unrelated donor with a close genetic match. The right bone marrow donor is hard to find, and Cressy didn’t have many options for a cure until two gene therapies were approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2023. Children’s Hospital is the first in the state to be approved to administer the treatments.
Cressy and LeBlanc hope other sickle cell patients will soon receive better care.  The Louisiana Department of Health recently estimated that at least 3,000 people in the state have been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.
The disorder occurs mostly in Black people like Cressy. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that evolved and spread across much of Africa as a response to malaria. People who only have one sickle cell gene are at least 90% more resistant to malaria, but if a person inherits two sickle cell genes, they will develop the painful disorder.
Many health care providers and researchers, including LeBlanc, now acknowledge how the medical community has historically neglected and stigmatized patients with the disorder. But LeBlanc believes, especially with the addition of new treatments at Children’s Hospital, that such care is starting to improve.
“Sickle cell disease in the state of Louisiana is hopefully in a time where it can really change,” he said.
There are still vast areas in rural parts of the state where basic care for sickle cell isn’t available, especially for adults, but there’s been an uptick in attention, he said.
Advocates for people living with the disorder say that attention is much needed. Courtney Davis is the deputy executive director of the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana. He said the state legislature has begun to pay more attention to the disorder, forming a commission and starting a registry to monitor the prevalence of the condition in 2021.
“There’s a lack of knowledge about sickle cell,” said Davis, who is also living with sickle cell disease. “We’re always trying to garner more support for sickle cell all over the state.”
Compared to other rare disorders like cystic fibrosis, there’s a large disparity in both public and private funding for sickle cell treatments and cures, researchers have found. Disparities in health care for Black Americans also affect how patients are treated.

Rhonda Chube, a community health worker with the Sickle Cell Association of South Louisiana, said her clients often face stigma when trying to receive care. They struggle to get hospitals and employers to understand the severity of their pain, she said.
“They may look okay physically, but what’s going on inside their body is where the problem is,” she said.
The condition also comes with financial burden due to hospitalizations, transfusions and regular doctor appointments. Chube and Davis said it’s nearly impossible to survive the disorder  without insurance.

Cressy chose to undergo a gene therapy treatment that cures sickle cell disease in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot. (Christiana Botic/Verite New and CatchLight Local/Report for America)
Many patients also need insurance in order to afford a curative treatment like Cressy’s. The medication alone costs $2 to $3 million. The stem cell collection and infusion, among other doctor visits, add another few hundred thousand dollars.
Lynn Winfield, Manning Family Children’s Hospital’s senior director of patient care services, said it can take more than a year for private insurance providers to approve reimbursement for the procedures. Without that guarantee, neither the patient nor medical providers can afford the treatment. Medicaid recipients are easier to get approved, but Winfield said she worried that could change with recent federal cuts to funding.
Winfield said the hospital is already lining up more patients, including a boy from Shreveport.
Cressy hopes he is only the beginning. He plans to advocate for more people with sickle cell as he goes through treatment and is excited to eventually become one of the first commercial pilots with the disorder. Cressy will be following in the footsteps of a friend with sickle cell who participated in a gene therapy clinical trial in Atlanta two years ago. They met through a Reddit post, bonding over experiencing the same roadblock to aviation. That friend, Cressy said, has since received a pilot’s license.

“Becoming aviators with sickle cell was once something that people thought was impossible,” he said from his hospital bed, wearing a Mr. Impossible t-shirt that he created. “My buddy has already proved to the world that it’s not. Nothing is impossible.”

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Less than a month after I moved to Durham for graduate school, Hurricane Helene devastated western North Carolina. Helene, the deadliest storm to ever hit the state, took 108 lives and caused an estimated $48.8 billion in damage. Less than a year later, Tropical Storm Chantal killed six North Carolinians and did more than $56 million in damage to Orange County. This is just one of the 13 counties for which Governor Stein declared a state of emergency. The physical and emotional trauma being felt during this time reminds me of watching my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana struggle to overcome tragic extreme weather events.
As a Gulf Coast native, I’ve felt the presence of natural disasters my entire life. When I was three, I evacuated New Orleans with my mother and younger sister ahead of Hurricane Katrina. When the levees broke, my dad watched the water rise up, filling our street and submerging our front lawn, creeping up the steps to the top lip of our front porch. We were lucky the water began to drain before it could make it into the house.
As I grew older, I felt Katrina’s legacy in New Orleans. Many people were not as fortunate as my family – some lost their homes and others their lives. Some who made it out during evacuations or in the storm’s aftermath never returned to New Orleans. I worry for my family that still lives there.
Throughout my childhood and adolescence, we experienced other large storms. None were as seriously damaging as Katrina, but it was common to wake up to felled tree branches and flooded streets. In 2021, Category 4 Hurricane Ida whipped through New Orleans, leaving the city without power for over three weeks at the hottest time of the year. Unfortunately, such extreme weather experiences were not limited to my time in New Orleans.
The morning after Chantal hit Durham, my coworkers and I watched live news reports of the 130 casualties caused by flash flooding in Texas. Twenty-seven young girls were killed by the floods while attending a sleepaway camp similar to the one I attended for seven summers.
While watching these reports in shock and horror, I listened to people calling the disaster an unavoidable “act of God.” Of course, we should dedicate thoughts and prayers to the families suffering during this tragedy, but the increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather is not random. It is directly attributable to human-induced climate change. To prevent future tragedies, we need accurate forecasts and warnings, timely federal relief programs, more resilient infrastructure, and climate action plans.
It is mystifying to me that the president claimed that he is investing in technology to protect people from extreme weather events on the same weekend he slashed support for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and renewable energy. We need to be proactive, not reactive, and that means investing in climate adaptation.
Devastating extreme weather events are our new reality, no matter what state you live in. If it’s not a hurricane, it’ll be a tornado like the one that hit St. Louis in May of this year. Or wildfires like those that burned through Los Angeles in January. Or an extreme heat wave like the heat dome that is triggering heat alerts from Nebraska to Florida this past week.
As someone just starting to establish a career and life as a young professional, I fear the upcoming years during which extreme weather will become an even more powerful and disastrous force. Flooding from Chantal in Durham wiped out an entire suspension bridge in the Eno River State Park, where I frequently hike and recreate with friends. This is reality for my lifetime, and I want to do something about it.
We need to get serious about climate action. Without concerted environmental efforts, communities will continue to suffer, and people will needlessly die. We need to make our voices heard.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7182574-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-03 06:56:17.412214

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Nevada has had either the highest or one of the highest unemployment rates in the U.S. over most of the 21st century. In the latest report Nevada has the nation’s second highest jobless rate, behind only the Musk-ravaged District of Columbia.
Occasionally Nevada’s notoriously persistent high unemployment rate is attributed to almost optimistic factors, like an economy in transition that is diversifying away from service sector jobs.
But for all the state tax breaks ladled to pretty much any expanding or relocating company that asks for one, before Trump killed it earlier this year Canadian tourism still supported more jobs in Southern Nevada than manufacturing does. Statewide, manufacturing only accounts for less than 4% of the state’s total employment. Nevada remains primarily a service sector economy with a service sector workforce.
From 9-11 to the Great Recession to the pandemic and now the tariff chaos, every time Nevada’s service economy starts to emerge from a crisis, it gets hammered by another one. (And through it all, the state’s primary industry has taken advantage of the carnage to trim its workforce. In the summer of 2000, 210,000 people were employed in Nevada’s casino hotels; in June of this year, 157,000 were.)
Trump threw one of his trademark Queen of Hearts “off with her head” tantrums Friday and fired U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer, because Friday’s BLS jobs report indicated the Trump economy hasn’t been creating anywhere near as many jobs as were being created nearly every month during the Biden years.
Trump insists on government employees who are more dedicated to toadying up to him than faithfully executing the legitimate duties required in their jobs.
So now presumably monthly jobs reports won’t be determined by the Current Employment Statistics survey of more than 100,000 private and public employers, along with analysis and modeling of additional tools used by the BLS. Instead, official employment statistics will be corruptly determined by whatever numbers Trump jots on a poster board with his beloved Sharpie.
Which brings us back to Nevada’s unemployment rate.
Monthly state unemployment rates basically mirror those reported by the BLS. So with Trump now insisting that federal employment data must reflect positively on him, it’s possible Nevada’s official unemployment rate could drop substantially. Not because of an improving Nevada economy, or because fewer people are unemployed, but because of the aforementioned Sharpie.
There are at least two scenarios by which Nevada’s unemployment rate could officially (but not really) drop.
First, Trump could take a break from his busy schedule of tariff madness, Texas gerrymandering, and Epstein nostalgia and notice that Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo is on the ballot next year. Trump could order his loyalists installed in the BLS to start lowering Nevada’s unemployment rate month by month. Then, when Democrats point out Lombardo has no economic policy to speak of, Campaign Joe could cite official data indicating the unemployment rate is dropping thanks to his economic mad skills.
Or, echoing his tariff-setting methodology, Trump could just pronounce arbitrary unemployment rates depending on how he feels about some state or other that day.
California? Ewww, a 9% unemployment rate because Gavin Newscum and woke, so Californians need to elect Republicans, Sharpie says.
Nevada? Oh, perhaps a little below the national average, just like Lombardo’s net approval rating. At least until the election. After that, it depends. If Lombardo remains governor and very nicely and publicly proclaims that his reelection was only possible thanks to Trump’s benevolent magnificence, Sharpie will say Nevada’s unemployment is super low. If Lombardo loses, only California’s is higher, or something along those lines.
“When leaders of other nations have politicized economic data, it has destroyed public trust in all official statistics and in government science,” reads a statement on Trump firing the BLS commissioner issued by a group led by the person Trump named to head the BLS during his first term.
Destroying public trust? Nothing is more dear to Trump’s heart. (See: Democracy and elections, Trump’s undermining of and assaults on.)
“Policymakers themselves are induced to undertake mistaken interventions in the economy if the data upon which decisions are taken is incorrect,” write the authors of a 2024 academic article on governments manipulating economic statistics.
Hmm, guess that’s one way to get the Fed to lower interest rates — trick it with bogus data. What could possibly go wrong?
Closer to home, imagine Nevada’s budget forecasters trying to determine how much money the state can budget for education, public safety, Medicaid and all the other state programs and services if official economic data isn’t worth the poster board it was scribbled on.
Business and industry and banks and investors of course rely on government economic data when making all manner of decisions, so it would be in their interest to see credible research instead of Sharpie jottings. But U.S. corporate and financial powers have been brought to heel, and dare not say a discouraging word, lest Trump unconstitutionally crush them while the U.S. Supreme Court aggressively looks the other way.
“When I become president, it will mark the end of credible, reliable government data, which will be terrible for many, many households, and the history of economic disturbances in this century suggest the effects will be even more damaging in long-struggling Nevada” is not a promise Trump made while campaigning last year.
But if he had, he’d be on his way to keeping it.

(Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)Police officers may face hundreds of traumatic incidents over the course of their careers, but many still hesitate to seek mental health support when they need it.
Despite growing investments in wellness programs by law enforcement agencies across the country, a recent study of just over 100 surveyed officers from the Fargo Police Department in North Dakota found that stigma remains a major barrier to mental health care for officers.
The study found that 60% of surveyed officers said most of their peers wouldn’t disclose a mental health condition to a colleague, and nearly three-quarters believed officers wouldn’t tell a supervisor. Slightly more than half agreed that most officers would expect to face discrimination at work if they disclosed they were experiencing mental illness.
Carol Archbold, the study’s author and a criminal justice professor at North Dakota State University, said officers may avoid disclosing mental health struggles because doing so also conflicts with societal expectations that they remain strong and unemotional.
“The nature of [police officers’] work really, really makes it difficult and important for them to have services available and for them to actually utilize them,” Archbold told  Stateline, adding that departments also need to foster a culture where officers feel comfortable using the support available to them.
Departments across the country have expanded access to services like counseling, peer support, therapy, substance use programs, and on-site gyms in response to growing concerns about post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD, depression, and suicide among officers.  The Fargo Police Department, for example, hired its first-ever health and wellness coordinator last year.
While the department offers a wide range of mental health-related services and programs, the study found that relatively few officers are using them.
Eighty-four percent of surveyed officers were aware of the department’s new health and wellness coordinator, but only 22 had interacted with them, and 19 found the interaction helpful. About 68% knew about the Employee Assistance Program; 20 had used it, with 17 reporting it was helpful. Awareness of the peer support program was higher at 93%, yet only 42 officers had used it, and 36 said it was helpful.
Still, stigma and fears about career repercussions may discourage some officers from using such services.
State suicide prevention efforts are lacking amid federal cuts

About half of all U.S. adults will experience at least one traumatic event in their lifetimes, though most will not develop PTSD, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. For police officers, the rate of exposure is significantly higher. Research suggests police officers may experience about three traumatic events every six months, or roughly 180 over a 30-year career.
Repeated exposure to traumatic events has been linked to a wide range of health issues in first responders, including poor sleep quality, depression, alcohol misuse and a heightened risk of PTSD.
In the Fargo survey, 53% of officers agreed that most police officers view being treated for a mental illness as a sign of personal weakness and would not seek professional help if they were experiencing mental health issues.
Forty percent believed that having a history of mental illness would negatively affect an officer’s chances for promotion. Many officers also disagreed with the idea that mental illness would lead to mistrust or social exclusion among peers. Sixty-four percent of officers disagreed with statements suggesting that most officers would avoid partnering with or think less of a colleague who had experienced a mental illness.
While agencies have expanded mental health resources in recent years, the study’s findings suggest that organizational culture remains a key factor in whether officers feel comfortable using those services.
The U.S. law enforcement system includes more than 17,000 federal, state, county and local agencies. While smaller and rural departments may be less likely to offer robust mental health services, Archbold said that does not reflect a lack of interest from leadership. Many departments — regardless of size — struggle to meet officer wellness needs within existing budgets and often must seek additional funding to support mental health programs.
“It’s likely that police chiefs would like to have these services available, but they just don’t have the money to be able to do that –– to provide those services,” Archbold said.

Advocates say they save lives. Others say they encourage drug use.,"In late May, a group of people who had lost friends and family to drug overdoses gathered behind the velvet ropes just outside the House chamber at the state Capitol. 
Many of them had come to this building time and again to tell their stories to lawmakers, reliving painful memories of some of the worst moments of their lives. 
But on this day, they’d come full of hope: it was the final stretch of the 2025 legislative session, and they wanted to make one last push for passage of a landmark bill establishing Connecticut’s first overdose prevention centers. 
As the day unfolded, though, it became apparent that the bill faced a major roadblock: Gov. Ned Lamont. 
“‘We’re hearing that the governor’s threatening a veto,’” Diane Santos recalled another advocate telling her when she arrived at the Capitol. “I still didn’t fully grasp that it was going to play out the way that it was.”

Santos, who lost her 26-year-old son, Mark Collins, to an overdose in 2023, had spent the weekend emailing state representatives and had received encouraging responses. The measure was tucked into a bigger public health bill, and the odds of passage looked good, she thought. Another advocate had even spoken to Lamont by phone and came away feeling confident in his support. 
But now the word was out that Lamont would veto the broader bill if it included the overdose prevention center.
The provision would have made Connecticut one of the only states in the country to have an overdose prevention center, or OPC, a space equipped with supplies to mitigate the dangers of drug use that would allow people to bring illegal drugs and use them under the supervision of trained staff, equipped with supplies, like Narcan, that can prevent and reverse overdoses.
The concept, though relatively new in the United States, had won approval in the Connecticut Senate, and advocates expected the House to follow suit. They anticipated that Lamont would then sign the bill into law, and that, in time, the new center would join OPCs in states like New York and Rhode Island as a lifesaving instrument in the fight against drug overdoses. 
Last year in Connecticut, just shy of 1,000 people died of an overdose, down 35% from a peak of 1,530 in 2021, according to data from the Department of Public Health. Despite the unprecedented drop in deaths in both the state and country over the past couple of years, overdose remains the leading cause of death for American adults under 45. 
Supporters of overdose prevention centers — also known as supervised consumption or safe injection sites — say they are a crucial part of the fight to save lives, one that has for too long been avoided in the U.S. out of stigma and fear. With the availability of naloxone, the overdose reversal drug, saving lives is relatively straightforward as long as people don’t use drugs alone. Therefore, advocates say, the argument in favor of OPCs comes down to a simple truth: no one can recover from substance abuse disorder if they are dead. 
Skeptics question the legality of the centers and whether they encourage people to continue using instead of seeking treatment. Some also worry about their impact on the neighborhoods where they are placed. 
Evidence from around the world indicates that no one has ever died of a drug overdose at an OPC and that the facilities reduce public drug use and decrease demand on local emergency services without increasing crime. But accounts from advocates and community leaders in Rhode Island, New York City and Canada show that, even with evidence, it can take time to build approval among a public that isn’t familiar with the concept.

Lamont: “Wait and see” 
That afternoon at the Capitol, despite reports of the governor’s disapproval, Santos and other advocates kept on talking to legislators, hoping through some political maneuvering that their key issue would prevail.
But behind closed doors, the measure appeared doomed. The governor’s staff told House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, that Lamont would veto the bill if it included OPCs. In an effort to save the rest of the sprawling legislation, which tackled issues from fluoride in drinking water to pancreatic cancer screening, lawmakers sacrificed the OPC measure.
“Just complete disappointment,” Santos said of the result. “Just heartache and heartbreak and feeling like I was letting my son down all over again.”
In an interview with The Connecticut Mirror in July, Lamont said he had wanted more time to consider results from other states and see whether the facilities draw the ire of the Trump administration. 
“I think I said I’d have to take a look at it, but I’d be pretty reluctant to do it. I think it’s pretty early,” Lamont said. “I think Rhode Island really hadn’t gotten going yet. New York was going. Donald Trump was in office. He was coming down pretty hard.”
Plus, he said, Connecticut already uses nearly every tool at its disposal to combat the overdose crisis, including four harm reduction sites, with a fifth slated to open in Bridgeport, where people can get wound care, clean syringes, connection to counseling or just a cup of coffee.
“We have harm reduction sites already,” Lamont said. “We do everything in terms of Narcan and prevention and counseling and clean needles and such. We do everything except for the drug injection. And I just figured it was worth a little more wait-and-see.”
Lamont referenced a few conversations with individuals skeptical of the sites or their impact but said he hadn’t been on the receiving end of any significant opposition to the idea, either.
The legality of overdose prevention centers is itself controversial. Some question whether the centers violate the federal Controlled Substances Act, which prohibits maintaining a site “for the purpose of … using illegal drugs.” Others argue the law doesn’t apply to public health programs meant to prevent death. The sites in New York City and Providence have been able to operate mostly unbothered, but a 2019 Department of Justice lawsuit prevented the opening of an OPC in Philadelphia. 
An executive order issued by the Trump administration last month directed agencies to withhold discretionary grants from organizations like “safe consumption sites” that allow for illicit drug use.
Lamont did, however, suggest a willingness to consider the policy.
“It’s not something we’re saying ‘hell no’ to,” Lamont said. “Let’s just get a little more experience based on Rhode Island and perhaps a couple other states.” 
But the wait-and-see approach has enraged some advocates who say that people are dying now — advocates like Dita Bhargava of Greenwich, whose son died of an overdose in 2018. 
“I know the governor. I know he has a compassionate heart. But at the end of the day, I think, unfortunately, he doesn’t understand the disease. He doesn’t understand the gravity of this epidemic. Lives that can be saved are being lost.”

Other states are also taking it slow 
Lamont isn’t the only state leader taking a cautious approach, however. In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a measure in California that would have allowed an “unlimited number” of sites, though he said he remained open to discussing a “truly limited pilot program.” Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont vetoed an OPC bill in 2022 and again in 2024, but, the second time around, lawmakers overrode his veto. 
In 2023, Connecticut’s Public Health Committee introduced a bill to establish three “harm reduction centers” that would include, among other services, a space where people could bring drugs to use under supervision. But legislators removed on-site drug use from the version that went to the broader legislature out of concerns from the administration about the use of state funding and conflicts with federal law, according to Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, the co-chair of the Public Health Committee.
This year’s effort would have established a pilot program of four OPCs without tapping state funding. The centers would include access to substance use disorder and mental health counseling, laundry, bathrooms and showers. The Public Health Committee passed the measure as a stand-alone bill, and the Senate cleared it as part of a sprawling public health bill.
Republican lawmakers on the committee, who nearly unanimously voted against the measure, voiced concern about the centers’ effects on surrounding communities and questioned whether they encourage drug use instead of treatment. 
During an eight-hour public hearing, advocates presented personal stories and real-world evidence, including studies suggesting the facilities prevent overdose deaths for clients, increase uptake of treatment services, reduce emergency-related health care costs and reduce public drug use and publicly discarded drug paraphernalia, without increasing crime rates in the surrounding areas.

Cameron Breen helps to coordinate the Statewide Harm Reduction Project, or SHaRP, a group of more than 100 overdose prevention advocates from around the state. He said the focus on abstinence-only solutions can be frustrating. 
“People think that the only truly successful intervention is the person stopping to use drugs altogether,” he said. “The reality is that substance use exists and too many of our community members are dying.”
But Breen agreed there’s room to increase community outreach in the future.
“Without it, we’re left in this limbo of people not having a good understanding of how much these centers save lives,” Breen said.
Rep. Tracy Marra, a Darien Republican and the only member of her party in favor of the measure during the Public Health Committee vote, said she understands her colleagues’ hesitation around community buy-in and potential effects on crime. 
Marra agrees the sites reduce overdose deaths but said she’s also interested in exploring other interventions that could be effective, like cleaning up the drug supply and stopping drugs from coming in across the border. 
With just three OPCs in the U.S., Marra added that studies about the effects of overdose prevention centers in this country are necessarily limited. There are over a hundred sites around the world, but what might work in Vancouver, for example, may not play out the same way in Waterbury, she said. Plus, she had concerns that the Connecticut bill proposed establishing four sites across the state, when New York City, with well over double the population, has only two.

Part of her questioning nature, Marra said, comes from witnessing the beginnings of the opioid crisis firsthand as a pharmacist. 
“We were taught as pharmacists that if someone was in pain, they would not get addicted to opioids,” Marra said. “Shame on me if I believe anything that quickly again.”
Marra has focused her legislative work in part on addressing the crisis, including a 2023 proposal to put Narcan in vending machines. During a visit to one of the OnPoint sites in New York City a few years ago, Marra became convinced OPCs were a powerful solution. But still, she said, the decision to establish them in Connecticut is “much more nuanced than that.” Other factors, like location and timing, have to make sense, too.
She encouraged elected officials, including Democrats voting ‘yes’ along party lines, to visit.
“Seeing the site, seeing this done, was definitely eye-opening,” Marra said. “If you don’t know what this is about, then go see.”

Success in Rhode Island
In an understated brick building in the heart of Providence’s medical district sits one of three OPCs in the entire country, Project Weber/RENEW. 
From the outside, Project Weber/RENEW looks much like the OB/GYN and spinal health offices that surround it. The first floor is a common space that feels like a cross between a church basement and a community center, outfitted with showers and laundry machines. There’s also a medical suite, staffed with a full-time nurse, behavioral health physician and part-time doctor, available for walk-in patients, with or without insurance. 
On the second floor, clients find the OPC. It’s a meticulously clean environment, with the hospitality of a better-quality medical office. There are individual stations for people to use illegal drugs with sterile supplies, a smoking room with a robust ventilation system, and of course, overdose-reversing naloxone kits. There are also oxygen tanks, which can prevent an overdose without painful withdrawal side effects.

The atmosphere is calm; a mellow Macy Gray song plays from a speaker, and staff members discretely check in on clients every 10 to 15 minutes. There’s even a room equipped with soft surfaces for when clients inadvertently take a drug that agitates them.
The center opened in Providence in January and has received high marks from advocates, elected officials and community members. The staff exude pride in the OPC and their lifesaving work. But the road to realizing that goal was a long and at times heartbreaking slog, one that could offer lessons on Connecticut’s stalled effort to open a center of its own. 
It took multiple attempts before Rhode Island’s governor, Dan McKee, signed an OPC bill in 2021, creating a two-year pilot. But the center still had to be funded, ultimately achieved with $2.6 million in settlement funds from opioid lawsuits. Then, organizations had to bid for the contract. 
Project Weber/RENEW won the bid. The group was already doing harm reduction work, like providing clean syringes, wound care supplies and access to medical treatment. But to open the OPC, they had to find a location and win approval from the Providence City Council.

City Councilwoman Mary Kay Harris represents Ward 11, home to the hospital district. She grew up and raised four kids here. When it comes to Ward 11, “I just love it.” 
Harris had some concerns about the OPC (like this common question: wouldn’t the OPC encourage drug use?). She wasn’t necessarily against the idea, but she didn’t want it in her ward, which includes Upper South Providence, a majority Black and Hispanic neighborhood where about a third of residents live below the poverty line. Neighbors there “had more than their fair share” of the city’s social services. 
“No, absolutely not,” Harris remembers thinking at the time.“It’s just too much pressure on the ward.”
Harris prides herself on being a good listener and making decisions based on consensus; in rejecting the OPC, she believed that she was representing her constituents. 
But in the months that followed, Harris began to hear from others, including advocates from Project Weber/RENEW, like Deputy Director Ashley Perry. Perry has lived experience with drug use and got involved with the organization as a volunteer running support groups for sex workers. Perry had been reluctant to engage with recovery groups in the past, which are often structured around repentant confessions.
“It didn’t feel good to always be reminded of the worst things that I’ve done,” Perry said. “I really wanted to move past that, and I really wanted to find safer ways for people who I knew were still suffering in a lot of different ways.” Project Weber/RENEW felt different, a nonjudgmental group giving people the tools to reduce harm and stop using drugs when they were ready.

But after Perry started volunteering, fentanyl sent the overdose death rate soaring. Then COVID worsened the isolation of the community, contributing to a leading cause of overdose: using alone. 
The group staged a mock funeral procession in January 2021, with doctors carrying caskets on their shoulders, representing 384 people who had died in the nation’s smallest state of an overdose the previous year. 
As time went on, Perry and her team became a constant presence in community and state-level meetings on the opioid epidemic, explaining why an OPC was needed. Their team also responded to calls from the community, like requests to pick up needles in neighborhoods. They were, Harris said, relentless. And Harris began attending meetings, too. 
“The more I attended, the more I understood, the more I heard people struggling, the more I heard people losing their family members, the more I heard drug addicts who said, ‘I’m not ready to stop using drugs.’”
Harris’s own granddaughter died of a fentanyl overdose during that time period, at age 26, a young woman she describes as joyful and creative. Harris believes an OPC might have saved her life. 
But it was before her death that Harris came around to the idea of putting the OPC in Ward 11, a change of heart she attributes partly to the location of the building. The proposed location wasn’t in a residential neighborhood or on a Main Street like she feared. Rather, it was a building in the medical district, accessibly located on a bus line.
Between opening day on Jan. 13, 2025, and July 8, Project Weber/RENEW saw 460 unique clients and performed 99 interventions to prevent overdose. They haven’t lost anyone to overdose so far. 
Perry and Harris are quick to talk about the importance of community buy-in as Connecticut considers its own OPC.
In New York City, where the two other OPCs in the U.S. are located, that kind of participation did not happen. City Councilwoman Carmen De La Rosa explained to The Connecticut Mirror that she learned, along with her constituents, during a press conference on the last day of former Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration that New York would get two OPCs and that one of them would be located in her district of Washington Heights, a low-to-middle income neighborhood where about half of residents are immigrants. 
“I have to say that that has caused a lot of trouble in terms of the community feeling involved,” De La Rosa said. That includes the choice of location — near one of the largest and most popular parks in the neighborhood.
Though the OPC has since made progress in gaining some community support, De La Rosa said that complaints persist, and she’s often blamed for the OPC, even though she had no say in where it was located. 
“The minute someone runs into a needle somewhere, they bring up the OPC,” she said. “The needle could just have come from someone who is in the throes of addiction and was using on that street. But they’re like, ‘Well, you know, if that OPC wasn’t here, they wouldn’t be able to get needles.’” 
 She wonders what it might have been like if the community had been involved from the get-go, as they were in Providence.

What’s next for Connecticut?
In late May and early June 2025, a spike in overdoses took dozens of lives in New Haven County, sparking a desperate attempt to stem a fatal mix of drugs. As this was taking place, Lamont sent out a press release announcing a significant drop in overdose deaths for 2024. 
Though the release nodded to the seriousness of the issue, it did not mention the crisis that was unfolding. Advocates like Diane Santos, already raw from Lamont’s singlehanded move to prevent OPCs, said the announcement was jarring. 
“To me it says he is either out of touch himself, or he’s getting bad information from somewhere.”
When a bill fails, advocates and lawmakers usually put their heads together and consider what strategy they might try next time to turn public opinion and rally support from other lawmakers. But some advocates in Connecticut say they already had the votes, and there was no public testimony opposing the concept, so they now face a different scenario: they must convince an audience of one, Gov. Lamont, to support the measure. 
Sen. Anwar was among the most committed advocates of the OPC measure. Since the measure failed, he has been publicly criticizing Lamont and says he’s calling Lamont out every time there is an overdose death. 
“It still makes me sad, and it makes me angry,” Anwar said of Lamont’s decision. “Because I value our citizens, and for somebody to make a decision knowingly and then shrug it away like it’s not a big deal is unacceptable to me.” 
Bhargava also lobbied for Lamont’s support. Her son, Alec Pelletier, had been in and out of treatment for substance abuse disorder when he died of an overdose on his birthday in 2018 while living in a sober home. Like Harris’s granddaughter and Diane Santos’s son, he was 26. 
Over the past year, as a student at the Yale School of Public Health and as an advocate, Bhargava educated herself about OPCs, visiting one in Vancouver and speaking with the program managers of the centers in Rhode Island and New York. She came away convinced that such a center could have saved her son’s life. 
The issue, she says, is simply too urgent to wait.  
“We don’t have the time. We just don’t. The time is now. And Gov. Lamont should hold a special session and get this done to save the people’s lives he’s serving to protect.” 
When asked if he would visit an OPC, Lamont said he’s open to it. 
“Visit or call, we’ll see what happens. I don’t want to overpromise. I have an open mind, if that’s what you’re suggesting,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAFE-CONSUMPTION-SITES-0716-SR-22-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-03 05:56:41.418493

So, is Connecticut a great place to be a child? For many, the answer is no —especially when poverty limits opportunities and dreams feel distant.

That’s why more than 100 organizations – hospitals, higher ed institutions, nonprofits, philanthropy and experts throughout the state — have come together and pledged to End Child Poverty Now! Almost every community foundation serving our 169 towns is involved and leading local efforts to raise awareness, convene partners and advocate on behalf of our state’s children who do not have enough to thrive.   
Morally, we know that this should not be.  Sixty-one years ago, in his 1964 State of the Union Address, President Lyndon B. Johnson announced an unconditional war on poverty and called it a national disgrace that merited a national response. Unfortunately, those calls went unheard until the COVID-19 pandemic brought the issue to the forefront. The pandemic served as an unprecedented global crisis, but it also revealed the profound impact of targeted government assistance in alleviating poverty.  

Through programs like emergency food aid and the refundable child tax credit, we saw a dramatic decrease in child poverty across the United States. In Connecticut, the federal government provided $2,000 to $3,000 in child tax credits per child, and child poverty was reduced by nearly 70%. However, as we now know, this progress was short-lived. The expiration of key pandemic relief programs in 2023 led to a sharp increase in child poverty, serving as a stark reminder that without sustained investment in social safety nets, progress remains fragile at best.

Children in Connecticut were not spared! Even here, with our great wealth, Connecticut experienced skyrocketing child poverty since 2022. According to the report, “Poverty in the U.S. and Connecticut 2019-2023,” by the Connecticut Voices for Children, the supplemental poverty rate was 10.5 percent in 2020, or 74,520 children living in poverty.  By 2021, the child poverty rate had dropped to 6.8 percent or 27,080 children.  Yet, by 2023, our numbers have skyrocketed and exceeded pre-pandemic level. 
This spike tells us that when families have access to financial resources, they can meet their children’s basic needs, invest in education, and create a stable environment in which their children can thrive. To let these gains slip away is not just an economic failure, it is a moral failure. 

The data is clear. Still far too many children in our state are growing up without the things that they need. Child poverty is not inevitable. It is not a natural condition. It is a policy choice and we can advocate for different choices.Kathy Taylor, President and CEO, Connecticut Community Foundation

In June, Connecticut Community Foundation hosted a public forum and panel discussion featuring a Community Data presentation with Mark Abraham, Executive Director DataHaven, and a panel discussion moderated by Ginny Monk, housing reporter for The Connecticut Mirror, with Panelists Emily Byrne, MPA, Executive Director of CT Voices for Children; Chelsea Harris, Director of Early Care & Education, Waterbury Bridge to Success, and Rashida Rattray, Education and Outreach Coordinator, Connecticut Fair Housing Center. Their wide-ranging conversation was both enlightening and sobering; serving as a wake-up call to remember the children and families left behind in our highly resourced state.
This moment calls for a renewed commitment to ending childhood poverty – a commitment that must be underpinned by policy change. The End Child Poverty Now Campaign is a unified platform for advocacy behind a common vision: a thriving and economically robust Connecticut where no child experiences the debilitating effects of poverty. 
This nonprofit advocacy collaborative engages lawmakers and policy influencers to promote and enact policies that address the root causes of child poverty, including income inequality, access to healthcare, safe and affordable homes, and quality education. 
Our collective goal for the 2025 legislative session was to advance the following:  

Support a permanent, refundable CT Child Tax Credit at $600 per child. 
Support universal no-cost healthy school meals (breakfast, lunch, and afternoon snack).  
Support universal childcare subsidies for families earning up to 85% of the State Median Income.
Expand good cause eviction protections to support family housing stability. 

We made progress: Connecticut chose to invest in our children’s education, approving a suite of bills designed to enable thousands of additional children to enroll in early childhood education programs. But our work is not finished, and the 2026 legislative session is soon approaching. 
The End Child Poverty Now will continue to advocate for the passage of child-friendly policies that will lead to meaningful change for many more of our children.  We cannot sit and watch while our neighboring states make steady progress to end child poverty.  Now is the time for our vision of being a child-friendly state to be reflected more fully in the everyday experiences of all of our children and families within our state of Connecticut.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)It was such a peaceful morning that Yoshito Matsushige could scarcely believe it was wartime.
Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer who had been up most of the night before covering air raid warnings, woke from a brief nap at army headquarters in time to see the sun rise over Hiroshima.
It was Monday, Aug. 6, 1945.
Now we know Matsushige was witnessing the last sunrise of the age before humankind had developed a weapon powerful enough to annihilate itself — and had demonstrated a willingness to use it.
There had been just one other explosion of a nuclear bomb, a test shot July 16 of a plutonium implosion weapon at the Trinity Site in southern New Mexico. The resulting fireball had fused the sand of the desert floor into a kind of glass later named Trinitite. On the morning of Monday, Aug. 6, another atomic bomb — a uranium gun-type device — was bound for Hiroshima.
Wednesday marks the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, a grim milestone that has me pondering the nature of time, memory and hope. It’s been slightly more than an average human lifetime since the bomb devastated Hiroshima, and those who are still around to recount the unthinkable are increasingly few. Once Hiroshima and Nagasaki fade from living memory, how will its warning be passed to future generations?
At 8:15 a.m. on Aug. 6, an American B-29 named the Enola Gay, after the pilot’s mother, released a 12-kiloton atomic bomb over the city. The aircraft was flying six miles up. The aim point was a T-shaped bridge in the center of the city. The bomb fell for 43 seconds and then detonated at 1,968 feet.
What happened next took only milliseconds.
The temperature on the ground reached 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit, vaporizing humans near the epicenter and leaving only their shadows behind. A 1,000-mph blast wave spread from the epicenter, destroying two-thirds of the city’s homes and buildings and contributing to a massive firestorm. A dark mushroom cloud rose over Hiroshima, carrying deadly radioactive fallout.
Matsushige had left army headquarters and returned to his home, about a mile and a half from the target bridge, where he was sitting shirtless in the August heat eating a meager breakfast of rice.
“There is an explosive called magnesium that is used for photographic (lighting) and everything went white as if that magnesium had been fired,” Matsushige told me through an interpreter in 1986, when I was a young reporter in Japan on a grant project to interview those who had experienced the bomb. “It seemed the light was an electrical short, or spark. So I was about to stand up and try to switch off the light, … and then came the blast.”
The force lifted Matsushige from his feet and slammed him into a far wall. He was covered in debris and broken glass, and his bare chest was bleeding, although he wasn’t badly hurt. He and his wife ran outside and hid in a sweet potato field for 40 minutes in the dirty brown gloom of ash and dust. Then Matsushige put on his uniform, retrieved his Mamiya camera from the rubble of his home and two rolls of film, and set out for newspaper office in the heart of the city.
Matsushige was a photojournalist but like most everyone else in Japan had also been pressed into military service. He worked for both the city newspaper and military headquarters, wearing a uniform with no rank insignia. Civilian photography was prohibited.
When he was about a kilometer, or six-tenths of a mile, from the center of the city, he had to turn back because the fire was too intense. He made his way to the Miyuki Bridge. The bridge was a landmark in a city known for its bridges and river, but this morning it was swarmed by thousands of wounded and dying civilians.
In 1986, I stood with Matsushige on the Miyuki Bridge and he told me what he had seen 41 years earlier. It was one of the last times the photographer, then in his early 70s, would visit the bridge, which was closed and about to be demolished to make way for a new structure. My interview with Matsushige originally appeared in my newspaper, the Pittsburg (Kansas) Morning Sun, which had sponsored my application for the Akiba Project travel grant to interview the aging hibakusha, a Japanese term translated as those who had received or been exposed to the bomb. In 2021 I wrote about my memories of that assignment for the Reflector.
Matsushige told me in 1986 that he had yet to take a single photograph on his grim trek into the city but here, at the bridge, he readied his Mamiya. Many of those on the bridge were junior high school students. Unlike elementary school children, most of whom had been evacuated to relatives and others in the hills around the city, the junior high students had been kept in the city to clear fire lines or to work in the ammunition factories. The victims on the bridge looked as if their clothes were hanging from their bodies, but they weren’t trailing fabric, it was tattered pieces of their own skin.
“I thought that I would take a photo of (the scene on the bridge), so I checked the camera in my hands,” Matsushige said. “When I saw this tragic scene, I was unable to push the shutter button. Among these people, there was a person holding a child. She was crying the name of the baby, and the baby probably was dead. The mother was saying, ‘Please open your eyes, please open your eyes.'”
It took Matsushige more than a quarter of an hour to make a photo.
“I felt as if the eyes of these people were piercing me,” he said. “These people had black faces because of the burns. It was such cruelty. I couldn’t stop my tears as I tried to take that second picture, and I remember that the viewfinder of my camera was blurred because of the tears.”
He returned home but set out again that afternoon.
He attempted to go to the newspaper office again but found it ablaze. He passed Hiroshima University, where he saw corpses at the bottom of a swimming pool that had been nearly emptied by the heat. The deeper he went into the city, the greater the destruction.
“People were under collapsed buildings and utility poles and were buried alive,” he said. “Among (the corpses) there were some mothers with children. I was totally numb. I didn’t feel anything, didn’t feel any heat or pain.”
He found a streetcar filled with corpses.
“All their clothes were burnt off,” he said. “I thought about taking a picture, I put my hands on my camera at one time, but since all these dead people were naked, I felt (ashamed) to take such a photo.”
Hours later he found himself back at the Miyuki Bridge, where he took a photograph of an injured policeman writing out relief certificates for food rations. The photo of the policeman was the last Matsushige would take that day. He had carried enough film for 24 exposures but ended up making only five. Two of the photos were at his home, two on the bridge, and one at an intersection near the bridge.
  Only five photos were made the day the bomb fell on Hiroshima, all by the same man — Yoshito Matsushige, a 32-year-old newspaper photographer. He was at home at the time the bomb was dropped on the morning of. Aug. 6, 1945, He made his way into the city. The first photo he took, around 11 a.m., was of badly burned junior high school students on the Miyuki Bridge. What appears to be rags is, in many cases, skin hanging from arms and legs. (Yoshito Matsushige)
Matsushige took some of the hardtack biscuits next to the policeman’s station for his and his wife’s dinner. After it was dark, he developed the film in trays in the kitchen sink and washed the negatives in a nearby creek. He hung the strip of film in a tree to dry. The photos weren’t published in the Hiroshima newspaper until the next year. They didn’t appear in the United States until Life magazine published them in 1952.
The death toll at Hiroshima was horrific. Estimates vary widely, but at least 70,000 died from the bombing. Three days later, on Aug. 9, a plutonium bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing another 40,000. These are conservative estimates, however, and the actual number might be double for each city.
When I went to Japan to interview Matsushige and the other hibakusha in 1986, it was the height of the Cold War. There were 70,374 nuclear warheads deployed or in stockpiles around the world, according the Federation of American Scientists, an all-time high. Of those, all but a few thousand belonged to the United States and the Soviet Union. The Doomsday Clock, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientist’s graphic representation of how close we were to nuclear annihilation, was at six minutes to midnight.
Now the Doomsday Clock is at 89 seconds.
There are fewer nuclear weapons — about 12,000, according to the FAS — but there are hot wars around the world, tensions are high, and the Doomsday Clock now takes into account other existential risks.
“We now move the Doomsday Clock from 90 seconds to 89 seconds to midnight — the closest it has ever been to catastrophe,” the Bulletin said in a January 2025 statement. “Our fervent hope is that leaders will recognize the threats posed by nuclear weapons, climate change, and the potential misuse of biological science and a variety of emerging technologies.”
The Bulletin cited emerging and re-emerging disease and the military use of artificial intelligence as concerning. It also said threat of nuclear war had been exacerbated by various conflicts.
“The war in Ukraine, now in its third year, looms over the world,” it said. “The conflict could become nuclear at any moment because of a rash decision or through accident or miscalculation. Conflict in the Middle East threatens to spiral out of control in a wider war without warning.”
The 10 or so countries that possess nuclear weapons are increasing the size and the role of their arsenals, the Bulletin said, and the nuclear arms control treaty process is collapsing.
We seem hellbent on our own destruction.
In my hand is a relic of the birth of the nuclear age, a bit of Trinitite that my wife, Kim, bought at a rock shop in New Mexico near Alamogordo. Yes, it’s legal to possess because it was gathered from the site decades ago, and no, it’s no longer dangerously radioactive. Why did she want it? Because she gathers information of all kinds — books, objects, experiences — that will help her understand the beauty and darkness of the world. The Trinitite sample cost a few bucks and is only mildly radioactive. It’s about the size of a peanut, is greenish black, and weighs about the same as the albatross in the Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner.
Trinitite is among the artifacts that were to be included in the Library of the Great Silence, a catalog of objects representing transitions and periods of existential threat. The project was part of the SETI Institute, a nonprofit dedicated to the search for intelligent life beyond earth. The library is a response, in part, to the Fermi Paradox. Posed by physicist Enrico Fermi, the paradox asks why, given how vast and old the universe is, we haven’t found evidence of other communicative technological civilizations?
I won’t bore you with the math behind the Drake Equation, which seeks to estimate how many intelligent worlds there might be out there, except to cite the most important variable, L. That stands for the average lifespan of technological civilizations. One explanation for the great silence is that civilizations have a tendency to destroy themselves. Nobody knows what L might be, because we have a lack of observable data, but our current estimate is at least 80 years.
If we are not to fall into the great silence, we must learn to do a better job of passing on the lessons of the past. Part of that is honoring the testimony of those who have gone before, such as Yoshito Matsushige.
Matsushige died in 2005, at the age of 92, but his words and his pictures live on. They were given to me in 1986, and now I share them with you.
The time the bomb detonated will be observed with a moment of silence at 8:15 a.m. Wednesday in Hiroshima. That’s 6:15 p.m. Tuesday for most of Kansas, because of the 14-hour time difference.
Honoring the dead is proper.
But too many of us who yearn for peace content ourselves with prayer and visualization. This may be mentally healthy and personally satisfying, but it’s not enough to turn policy or change minds. The pursuit of peace is an active one, requiring a knowledge of the past combined with a willingness to engage the future.
It’s 89 seconds to midnight.
Let’s raise some L.

The final approval came days ago from the MTA, parent of Metro-North, which rubber-stamped the Connecticut Department of Transportation’s fare hike decision.  At least one MTA Board member called the hikes “scary” and another exclaimed that he was “actually kind of offended”.  But, hey… there is nobody on the MTA Board representing Connecticut riders so they both voted to approve the hike as did the entire MTA Board.  After all, it’s not their money.


Mind you, the MTA is also shortly expected to approve a 4.4% fare hike for New York’s Metro-North riders as well as a 25-cent increase for New York City subways and buses, so put that in your pipe of moral indignation and smoke it.
As I explained a few weeks ago, the Connecticut fare increase can be blamed on Gov. Ned Lamont and the legislature, which knowingly under-cut the CDOT budget, pretty much telling the agency to raise fares to make up the difference.  After all, they seem to assume that everyone who rides Metro-North along Connecticut’s “gold coast” is a millionaire. 
But a 10% increase in one year?  On top of a 4.5% hike just two years ago?  That adds up to a compounded 15.2% increase since 2023… way more than inflation.  Remember, Metro-North has a captive audience and can do anything it wants.

And adding insult to injury, there are new ticket rules coming!
With more and more commuters buying one-way e-tickets (57%) instead of monthly passes (36%), those tickets will automatically be activated on purchase, not when you get on the train and activate them yourself.  Why?  Because, the railroad says, 55% of ticket holders don’t activate their tickets until they see the conductor coming around. 
But isn’t it the conductor’s job to collect those fares and put seat checks on each row?
According to MTA Deputy Chief Jessica Lazarus “Conductors are spending more than 20,000 hours each year reminding customers to activate one-way mobile tickets.” Really?  How did they come up with that metric?
Requiring activation of the ticket at time of purchase, she says, will “recapture those hours that can be better put to use for fare collection and train safety operations.”  Like enforcing the “no radios rule” and “no feet on seats?”
If you’re doing a same-day roundtrip you won’t buy two one-way tickets but, instead, a new Day Pass.  It’s good for unlimited travel until 4 a.m. the next day. Day-trippers using the pass will get a 10% fare discount compared to buying two one-way peak tickets.
For hybrid commuters, after buying ten one-way tickets within two weeks the 11th will be free.  For seniors, the disabled and those on Medicare, the new reduced fare ticket will be valid at all times, even in the morning peak.
Make no mistake:  fare evasion is a serious problem for MTA, which estimates they lose $700 million each year, most of it on buses ($315 M) and subways ($285 M).  Metro-North losses are estimated at $44 M.  Given that train fares are much more expensive than bus and subway, that’s not a lot of commuter scofflaws; just 6% of riders compared to 15% of subways riders and 37% of bus passengers.

Of course, bus riders can easily board by the rear door and subway riders can jump over turnstiles.  On Metro-North we have conductors.  It’s an hour-long ride from Stamford to Grand Central Terminal, plenty of time to look at everyone’s ticket… which they will still have to do even under the new rules.
But what about the Dashing Dan running to make his train, grabbing a seat and then trying to buy an e-ticket in a cellphone dead spot, nervously watching the conductor moving down the aisle?  No ticket to show?  You’ll get whacked with a $2 surcharge.
Here are the optics:  Connecticut lawmakers short-change the CDOT budget, basically saying “let the commuters pick up the tab.”  Now MTA makes commuting less convenient with new ticket rules.
We all end up paying more and getting no improvement.  The trains are no faster or reliable… and maybe less attractive as a transportation choice.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Metro-North-shot-ephillips.jpg,,,2025-08-03 04:56:44.457753

Mike Dunleavy’s veto of more than $50 million in funding for Alaska’s K-12 schools.
As legislators were set to gavel in at 10 a.m., about a dozen protesters lined the hallways to advocate for legislators overriding the veto, with signs reading “vote like your kids live here,” “vote to override” and “fund public education!” 
One protester was Peter Sidmore, a middle school teacher in the Juneau School District, where he graduated in 2019.  
“It’s impressive how much the system in town has degraded in the six years since I graduated, just due to lack of funding. And I’ve been pretty present to see all of that, because we did have a fairly robust school system, and it’s really changed,” he said. 
Sidmore said that last year, the consolidation of Juneau’s two high schools was especially hard on students. This year, it’s the continued climate of uncertainty, he said. 
“That’s the hardest part. When we have a direction and we know what we’re getting, and we know what we can do, we can prepare students to an extent, but it’s the indecisiveness, it’s the back and forth that really, really is hard on students. Yeah, you hear that in education all the time. It’s just, you want to have a plan, even if it’s not the best,” Sidmore said.
McLain Sidmore, standing with him holding a sign, works for an education nonprofit in Juneau. “I see classes seem to be getting bigger every year,” McLain Sidmore said. “Teachers are being moved around until weeks into the school year; there are students not getting the services they need. And just parents are stressed. Kids are stressed. Teachers are stressed.”
Eric Antrim, an engineer with the U.S. Forest Service, as well as a member of the National Federation of Federal Employees, NFFE Local 251, held a sign reading “education is our future.” 
“I benefited from a public education growing up, and that was good enough to get me into engineering school and to perform well,” he said. “And I want our Legislature to act responsibly and pay it forward. They all benefited from safe schools and good schooling, and they shouldn’t be taking that away from the next generation.”
Debra Craig, a 43-year-resident of Juneau, said she worked in state government in social services. “So I have a fairly deep understanding of the challenges that people face when they don’t have adequate resources,” she said. “And education is like a fundamental resource that people need to be able to get ahead in the world, to be able to survive, to be able to just exist adequately.”
Craig said she’s concerned about the quality of education in Alaska, especially the lack of civics education and understanding of government. “Alaska is one of eight states that doesn’t require students graduating from high school to pass a civics test. And I think all of that is showing up throughout the United States in our national politics and our state politics,” she said. “So we need to support education. We need to support civics education so people understand what their government does, and doesn’t do for them.”
Outside the Capitol, a rally kicked off at 11 a.m with a crowd gathered to join a national day of action, and to support public education in Alaska. More than 300 demonstrations were set to take place on Saturday, part of a “Rage Against the Regime” protest against the Trump administration and threats to democracy, due process, and civil rights and freedoms. 
Speakers condemned the Trump administration’s actions on immigrant communities, public services and higher education, and they called for solidarity to continue protesting the president. 
“Public schools are democracy’s tools!” the crowd chanted. 
Just after 1:30 p.m., legislators voted to override two of the governor’s veto. A handful of demonstrators in the hall cheered senators after they left the house chambers.  
“It was great. We were very happy,” said Pat Race, a demonstrator who was standing outside the House doors. He’s a Juneau-based filmmaker and illustrator, and a product of Alaska schools. “There was a lot of clapping and then shushing of the clapping, because they were still working on things. But both veto overrides were a really big deal. And it was really nice to see them come through,” he said, referring to legislators also voting to override a veto of Senate Bill 183, a bill to require reports on oil tax settlements.
“And afterwards,” he added. “It was a sunny day in Juneau, and I fled the building for a celebratory taco.”

Kim Reynolds earlier this week.
Bird spoke on the issue at the annual “Bird Barn Bash,” a fundraiser for the attorney general as she looks ahead to running for another term in 2026. Bird, who was first elected in 2022, spoke about her time challenging federal policies during former President Joe Biden’s tenure, but also spoke on a more recent issue – investigating UI for potential noncompliance with state and federal policies banning diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts.
Fox News published an “undercover” video Tuesday of a person identified as Andrea Tinoco, the assistant director of UI Leadership and Student Organization Development, who said her department was still committed to working on DEI despite directives from university leadership.

After the video was posted, Reynolds issued a statement saying she was “appalled” by the comments made in the video and would be filing a complaint to the Attorney General’s office for further action. On Friday, a second video was posted by Townhall, a conservative outlet, of another UI employee identified as Cory Lockwood, senior associate director of the Iowa Union Memorial, making similar comments about continued work on DEI initiatives.
Both employees featured in the videos have been placed on administrative leave.
At the fundraiser Saturday, Bird said her office has launched an investigation into the situation and “is going to get to the bottom of it” – but asked the crowd for patience.
“Please know – the investigation’s going to take a little bit,” Bird said. “I know all of us want it to be fast — and we will not make it be slow — but I’ll tell you, to do something right, it takes time. And we’re going to do it right, we’re going to do it by the book and by the law.”
She also reiterated her commitment to upholding the ban on DEI at Iowa’s regents universities, saying ”here in Iowa, our taxpayer-funded universities are supposed to be about education, not indoctrination.”
Talk radio host Simon Conway, who spoke in support of Bird at the event, said the UI investigation shows the importance of having Bird in office – and reelecting her for another term. He said former Attorney General Tom Miller, the longtime Democratic incumbent who Bird defeated in 2022, would not have followed up on Reynolds’ request to investigate the university if he was in office.
“If we had Tom Miller, or a Tom Miller, in the attorney general’s chair right now, with what is going on in our state in regards to DEI — I think first of all, there’d be a really good chance that regents universities would be losing federal funding,” Conway said. “They still might, by the way. But I think it’s an absolute given if he was there. And you don’t want to see that, do you?”
Cruz, Schmitt stay in D.C.
U.S. Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Eric Schmitt of Missouri were also scheduled to speak at the event, but both were unable to attend. The U.S. Senate was in session Saturday, with Senate Republicans aiming to confirm more than 100 of President Donald Trump’s nominees despite a breakdown in negotiations with Senate Democrats.
Bird said she was disappointed the two Republican senators could not be at the event, but that she told them on behalf of attendees, “we want you to do your job like you’re doing, confirming President Trump’s nominees.”
Schmitt will be back in the state later in the month, Aug. 23, for U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson’s fundraiser in Cedar Rapids.
Bird was considered a top choice to become the next Republican nominee for governor in the 2026 election cycle, following Gov. Kim Reynolds’ announcement that she would not seek reelection after finishing her current term. But in July, Bird announced she would not run for governor, instead running for reelection for her current position.
At the event, Bird said she had spoken with many people in the crowd about her plans in 2026 – and that her decision to run for reelection was because she believed there was still more she had to accomplish in the role.
“We’ve done some good things in the attorney general’s office to help Iowa but we are not done,” Bird said. “The work is not done. And I’m not going to leave that unfinished to run for something else.”

BURLINGTON — Vermont Green Football Club are national champions. 
The Green toppled Seattle-based Ballard FC, 2-1, in Saturday night’s United Soccer League 2 championship game at the University of Vermont in Burlington. Thousands of fans turned out to the Green’s home stadium at the school, Virtue Field, to watch the team cap off its undefeated 2025 season with its first-ever national-level prize. 
United Soccer League 2 is a semi-professional, summertime competition made up largely of collegiate players. It has about 150 total teams across the country.
Saturday’s win was the culmination of a dream run for Vermont Green, which is in its fourth season and has garnered international attention for its outspoken support of climate justice and other progressive social causes. The team regularly draws sellout crowds for its home games, boasting some of the highest average attendance of any similar team in the country. 
After tying just three regular-season games and winning every other, the Green won its local United Soccer League 2 division, the Northeast Division, in early July. Later that month, the team topped the league’s regional Eastern Conference bracket to advance to the final stages of the national playoffs.
Saturday’s win marks the second national championship for a Vermont-based soccer team in the past year. Last December, the University of Vermont men’s soccer team won the NCAA Division I championship, the first national collegiate title in a major sport in school history. Four UVM players were part of the Vermont Green team that won Saturday’s game.

Andy Barr and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — have been taking snipes at each other on the campaign trail this summer as they barrel toward the May 2026 primary, but […]","U.S. Senate candidates (from left) Nate Morris, Andy Barr and Daniel Cameron before speaking at annual Fancy Farm Picnic, on Saturday, Aug 2, 2025. (Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)FANCY FARM, Ky. — The top three Republican candidates hoping to represent Kentucky in the U.S. Senate — former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and Lexington businessman Nate Morris — have been taking snipes at each other on the campaign trail this summer as they barrel toward the May 2026 primary, but they pulled out the stops for the annual Fancy Farm Picnic. They laid into the event’s tradition of trading zingers with opponents Saturday afternoon in the small West Kentucky town.  
The picnic, a fundraiser for the St. Jerome Catholic Church, has historically brought together Democrats and Republicans for roasts from the stage as supporters and detractors yell and heckle. With Kentucky’s top Democrats, including Gov. Andy Beshear and Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman skipping the event Saturday afternoon, Republicans either joked at the lack of their presence or toward each other, in the case of the GOP Senate candidates. 
Beshear said he had a scheduling conflict and Coleman said the stage should be reserved for candidates on the ballot. 
Each Senate candidate tried to tie themselves closer to President Donald Trump, who has not made an endorsement in the race so far. Morris took it a step further by tying his opponents to U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is not running for re-election and who also spoke at the picnic. 
Cameron won a coin toss to speak first. He joked about the lack of Democrats, saying “there aren’t even enough of them to run Joe Biden’s autopen.” Kentucky U.S. Rep. James Comer, also a speaker at the picnic, is leading a probe into the former’s president’s alleged use of an autopen to sign documents. 
“But look, I understand why they aren’t here,” Cameron said of the Democrats. “They’re out searching for a national identity, which is going to be hard to find when they’re afraid of being misgendered.”

Cameron took some swipes at his opponents, saying Barr has voted with former Democratic U.S. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and that Morris donated to former United Nation Ambassador Nikki Haley’s 2024 presidential campaign. Cameron also said Morris had supported diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as a company executive in the past. 
“Some would say his campaign reminds him of a fart: it stinks, it’s unproductive and it’s a sign that the emitter is full of crap,” Cameron said of Morris. 
Cameron ended his speech by saying that he and his wife, Makenze, want their sons to grow up in a “a colorblind society — one based on merit and opportunity, not division and handouts.” He vowed to be focused on “the future, not the past,” as senator. 
For the most part, Barr focused on his record in Congress and touting his support for Trump’s policies in office. He did tease Beshear for his absence and his rumored aspirations to run for president in 2028, saying that “Americans will soon learn what we Kentuckians already know — he’s as liberal as he is boring.”

“I’d say anyone could beat this guy, but I wouldn’t want to offend Daniel Cameron,” Barr said, referring to Cameron’s loss to Beshear in the 2023 governor’s race. 
Barr added that he hopes Kentucky keeps “the tradition alive of Andys beating Daniels.” 
But Morris was also the punchline of some of Barr’s remarks, calling him a “dumpster fire” and attacking his business record and his Haley donations as well. 
Barr ended by promising to be a “friend” to West Kentucky, with several regional nods, like supporting the military at Fort Knox and cheering on Murray State University in sporting events. 
Morris was critical of McConnell ahead of the picnic and opened by saying, “I didn’t realize this was bring your boys to work day,” referring to Barr’s and Cameron’s ties to the senior Kentucky senator. 
Speaking last out of the three, Morris told the crowd that he wanted them to remember three things about him — that he supports Trump, he started a garbage company in Kentucky and that he’s “going to trash Mitch McConnell’s legacy.” 
“The third one is pissing off a lot of people, but I have a serious question — who here can honestly tell me that it’s a good thing to have a senior citizen who freezes on national television during his press conferences as our U.S. senator?” Morris said, referring to 2023 episodes McConnell had in front of reporters.

Morris said that Barr and Cameron would continue the senator’s legacy in office, calling them the “McConnell boys.” 
“To break some real news here, perhaps you could both show us the seat of your britches so we can finally understand where Mitch McConnell’s hand goes.” 
McConnell spoke before the Senate candidates, but didn’t directly address them in his remarks. A longtime attendee, Fancy Farm organizers presented McConnell with a plaque before the speeches began to recognize his frequent participation. 
However, McConnell did share some thoughts on the race during the Graves County GOP Breakfast earlier Saturday morning. The event’s attendees included Republicans from the region and around the state, as well as the GOP Senate candidates. 
“Surely this isn’t true, but I’ve heard that one of the candidates running for my office wants to be different,” McConnell said. “Now I’m wondering how you want to be different from the longest serving Senate leader in American history. I’m wondering how you’d want to be different in supporting President Trump.” 
McConnell then posed a “little quiz” to the crowd: “Which of Kentucky’s two Republican senators supports President Trump the most?” Multiple people in the crowd replied, “You.” 
McConnell argued that he’s repeatedly supported Trump more often than U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, who did not go to the picnic this year, pointing out that Paul voted against the GOP spending megabill, while McConnell supported it. McConnell also had his staff tally up the money he’s brought to Kentucky while being in office for 41 years, saying the total was $60 billion. 
“I leave by thanking you all for giving me this remarkable opportunity,” McConnell said.”Not just to help myself, not just to brag on how long I may have been there, but look at the difference that I’ve made to try to help us move into a different place — a place when they talk about Kentucky, they talk about how well we’re doing, not how many people we have, how well we’re doing.” 
When McConnell stood before the crowd of Republicans, he received a standing ovation. Cameron and Barr also stood and clapped for McConnell while Morris stayed seated. 
The lone Democrat
Only one Democratic candidate addressed the crowd at the Fancy Farm Picnic — John “Drew” Williams, who is challenging Comer in the 1st Congressional District. The district includes Fancy Farm and West Kentucky. He kept his remarks mostly focused on Comer’s record and told the crowd that he would offer them more public service if elected to Congress.

Comer spoke after Williams, but largely talked about national issues and made fun of Beshear. However, he did add that he didn’t know Williams’ name but still brought him a gift from Washington, D.C. A Comer supporter then came to the stage and held up a prop poster with an endorsement of “Comer’s opponent,” signed by Biden’s autopen. 
Williams had a chance to campaign in a room of Democratic voters the Friday night before the picnic at the Marshall County Democrats’ Mike Miller Memorial Bean Dinner. In an interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he said he has wanted to speak at the Fancy Farm Picnic since he was in middle school, so he was excited for the opportunity.
However, he said he didn’t blame other Democrats like Beshear for not going to a “hateful space” but added that it “doesn’t mean that it has to stay that way.” He’d like to see the space become a way for candidates to have a conversation. 
“I’d much rather me pick an issue, they pick an issue, and we come together. They don’t do that.”
During the dinner, Coleman reiterated that her decision to not go to the picnic this year was because she was not on the ballot. She said there were “so many obvious jokes” to make “but not much worth laughing about in this moment.” 
She hinted that Kentucky’s statewide races in 2027, which would include the governor’s race to succeed Beshear, may bring her back to the picnic stage. 
“We have to leave here tonight with a renewed sense of purpose,” she said. “We have to leave here and talk to our neighbors, listen to their concerns, and remind them that we are fighting for their kids’ and grandkids’ schools, for their families’ security and for a Kentucky where every person has a chance to thrive.”

Speaking to reporters after her speech, Coleman said that the Fancy Farm Picnic has become a “tradition for many, many years” for people in West Kentucky. She added that it’s an exciting year to have the first female emcee, Ashli Watts, the president and CEO of the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce. But Coleman argued she showed up for rural people in other ways, like supporting the rebuilding efforts after devastating tornadoes in West Kentucky. 
When asked if she thought Democrats should find an alternative event to the picnic, which has become dominated by Republican speakers in recent years, or if changes should be made to its format, she recalled the attempted assassination of Trump on the campaign trail and the attacks earlier this summer on Minnesota Democratic lawmakers, that left a state representative and her husband dead and seriously wounded a state senator and his wife. 
“We got to think about the rhetoric. We’ve got to think about the way that we present things. And jokes are one thing, but it can get out of hand, and especially in an environment like that, I could see how it could,” she said. “So, I would leave it to the people who run the organization. I saw that they said they have to evolve with the times, and then got some primary candidates this year. I would encourage them to evolve with the times when it comes to rhetoric as well.”
Matthew Powell, a member of the Graves County Democratic Party, attended the dinner in a Beshear 2028 shirt. He said he likes Beshear because of what he’s done for the area during his response to tornadoes and floods, calling him a “champion for the working class and myself.” 
Powell didn’t mind the governor skipping the Fancy Farm Picnic. 
“His record speaks volume. He’s been in Fancy Farm and in Mayfield before, and when it counted. He was there with us in Mayfield, Kentucky, through the tornadoes and the flooding. So yes, he’s always there with us.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/fancyfarm_018-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 20:56:11.046726

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature, meeting in special session, has overridden Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of more than $50 million in public school funding.
The vote was 45-14. Forty-five votes are needed to override an Alaska governor’s budget veto.
The override eliminates a 5.6% year-over-year cut to public school funding, leaving districts with a small funding increase. 
School district superintendents said before the vote that if lawmakers were able to override the governor, they would be able to reduce class sizes and restore programs that had been cut.
Lawmakers were also expected to vote on whether or not to override Dunleavy’s veto of Senate Bill 183, a measure that would require the Alaska Department of Revenue to provide lawmakers with a report on oil tax settlements. Sen Bill Wielechowski, D-Anchorage, has said that could reveal the state has been settling tax disputes for much less than their stated value. 
As the session opened, Dunleavy issued another version of an executive order creating a cabinet-level Alaska Department of Agriculture.
Lawmakers rejected the governor’s first executive order on a 32-28 vote in March and introduced broader legislation instead.
The presiding officers of the House and Senate responded to the second order with a letter of their own, saying that the governor’s order is unconstitutional and that they will not accept it.
The governor’s office did not respond to a question asking what it thinks of the legislative response.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Saturday as part of a nationwide anti-Trump movement dubbed “Rage Against the Regime.”
The Denver protest was led by Colorado 50501, which also organized “Good Trouble” demonstrations honoring civil rights leader John Lewis on July 17, and “No Kings” anti-Trump protests in mid-June. The “Rage Against the Regime” protests, which were planned in more than 300 cities across the United States, focused on bringing communities “together to transform anger into action, harnessing the energy of collective resistance,” according to the 50501 website. 
Several local left-leaning groups, including the Denver chapter of the Party for Socialism and Liberation and the immigrant rights group Aurora Unidos CSO, set up booths in front of the Capitol on Saturday. 
The demonstrators protested President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportations, the elimination of federal funding for public media by Congress, and mass layoffs at several federal agencies, among other Trump administration priorities.

At around 12:15 p.m., organizers led chants of “When we fight, we win” and “No hate, no fear, immigrants are welcome here,” which were met with clapping from the crowd and honks from passing cars. 
Brandon Quintanilla, a co-founder of Aurora Unidos CSO, called for protestors to “stand up for our immigrant communities and educate our neighbors.” Quintanilla, 23, said members of his family were deported several years ago, adding that “these attacks on our people have been happening for years, and they have only escalated to unprecedented levels under the Trump administration.”
“We are all well aware of the attacks on our people: masked (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents picking up our parents as they pick up the trash, our siblings being picked up on the way to work or to immigration court,” Quintanilla said.
Protestors yelled “shame” when Quintanilla mentioned the recent federal Republican tax cut and spending law’s allocation of $170 billion in funding for the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown.

Denver residents Phaedra Andersen, 54, and Nancy Andersen, 71, have attended several anti-Trump protests in the past eight months. The mother-daughter duo first got involved in community organizing decades ago. Phaedra’s first protest was at age 13, against apartheid in South Africa, while Nancy started out with Vietnam War protests.
“I am hoping that we can break this cycle of human rights violations,” Nancy said. “If anyone’s rights are violated, all of our rights can be attacked. We are on the very edge of losing our democracy.”
Robynn Bartholomew, 52, attended the Denver protest carrying dozens of handmade bracelets beaded with the word “resist.” She stood near the Capitol and handed them out for free to fellow demonstrators.
“I just wanted to do what I could, what’s in my lane, to lift people up, because this is a marathon, not a sprint,” Bartholomew said. “Every day there’s a new thing that can bring you down, but I’m trying to make people smile. We need to come together.”

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, Brookings Institution senior fellow in governance studies


The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(Photo by Eric Lee/Getty Images)U.S. Department of Justice officials say the department will seek voting and election information from all 50 states, according to a national group that includes many top state election officials.
The department has sent letters to at least nine states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.
Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

The party approved a new rule that allows it to remove Republican candidates from a re-election ballot if they appoint a Democrat in their term. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Republican Party Saturday approved a new rule that would allow the party to disqualify an elected GOP official if they appoint a Democrat to a position during their term.
About 83% of the attendants at the GOP Summer Meeting in Montgomery voted for the rule that prohibits elected partisan officials from appointing people other than Republicans. Suzelle Josey, a former candidate for Senate District 30 in 2014, wrote the rule change. 
Josey said in an interview after the meeting that the rule is meant to send a message to Republicans to keep Republicans in office.
“If you are Republican, if you have taken Republican support, if you have depended upon people to get out there and knock on doors for you, taking money, their time, their treasure, once you have the opportunity and the privilege of being elected as a Republican, then we certainly would expect you to be appointing Republicans when you have the opportunity,” Josey said. “We hope this bylaw change will send a message to elected Republican officials that we have new expectations.”
In the chairman’s report, John Wahl claimed that Democrats do not listen to opposing views or debate, but said that the new rule would allow Republicans to be in the room in areas that are typically Democratic. 
“You would never see a Democrat appoint a Republican,” Wahl said in an interview. “I want to see Republicans taking seriously the fact that we want the opportunity to debate. The open debate here is actually giving Republican appointees the chance to go out and talk to their community, explain their values that they may never have the chance to do if they weren’t appointed to these positions.”
The Alabama Democratic Party’s bylaws do not have a similar rule.
Wahl also gave the 287 attendants an update on the congressional redistricting litigation. The court ordered the state to draw a new congressional map in 2023 after nearly two years of litigation with two appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court. The panel determined that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with white voters tending to support Republicans and Black voters tending to support Democrats. With that determination, the judges ruled that the Legislature-approved map did not give Black voters the ability to choose their preferred leaders, and ordered a majority-minority congressional district and a district with a near-majority of Black voters to be drawn. 
After a trial earlier this year, the court ruled in May that Alabama had intentionally discriminated against Black voters by approving a map in 2023 that initially only had one majority-Black district. The judges are considering sanctions, which could include requiring court approval of any future congressional maps, a process known as preclearance.
Wahl said that the litigation is not fair because California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to redraw the state’s congressional districts to include more Democratic seats. Texas Republicans on Wednesday drafted a map that would flip five Democratic-held districts.
“California and New York redistricted based on a political basis, without any repercussions from federal courts,” Wahl said. “Now I’m not arguing that anyone should be unrepresented, but I’m going to tell you double standards are not okay.”
Wahl said that majority-minority districts were inherently racist because not all members of minority groups vote for Democratic candidates.
“It shouldn’t matter what the color of your skin is. And if that’s the case, then if any district is drawn based on the color of someone’s skin, it is racist by the nature of that decision,” Wahl said. “I do not think this should be a political or or racial decision. This should be based on communities of interest and traditional lines.”
The party also established qualifying dates for the 2026 midterms. State and county GOP candidates must file their candidacy between Jan. 5 at 8:30 a.m. and Jan. 23 at 5 p.m. with the party’s chairman, according to the resolution that passed at the meeting. The resolution was amended from the qualifying period for statewide candidates only starting on Jan. 12 with 69% of the party’s support. 
“I think it’s confusing to have two different dates there as a former county party chair,” said Michael Hoyt, former Baldwin County GOP chair. “I think it’s helpful to have uniform dates across the board. I think a lot of the 11 day period is far too short.”
Wahl said the original 11 day period was due to the primary election being moved from May 26 to May 19, and the qualifying period could not start sooner because of winter holidays.
“Originally it was at three weeks for county parties and two weeks for the state party. Members felt that they would like to have the dates consistent,” Wahl said in an interview after the meeting.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0174-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 15:56:49.562015

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.
State regulations
As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.













If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.

The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
What do these programs look like across the country?
FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Rapid City has conducted what sources in law enforcement and government say could be one of the first compliance checks for hemp-based intoxicants since a South Dakota law banning their sale took effect a little over a year ago. 
The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office, Rapid City Police Department and Pennington County State’s Attorney’s Office partnered on the operation.
Officers and deputies visited eight area smoke shops and convenience stores on Thursday, purchasing products like gummies, suckers, vape cartridges and beverages containing hemp-derived ingredients. 
The products will be tested to see if they contain any of the prohibited high-inducing chemicals lawmakers voted to restrict in 2024. 
Law banning sale of some near-pot products takes effect, but won’t prevent every legal high

The compounds occur in tiny amounts in hemp plants, but are synthesized to infuse into consumable goods at levels significant enough to induce marijuana-like euphoric feelings in those who use them. The law is targeted at the synthetic versions of the compounds, sold under names like Delta-8 and THC-O, sometimes called “diet weed.”
The bill restricting the sale of those products did not bar the possession of them. Their sale is a low-level misdemeanor, punishable by up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.
A press release on the operation said businesses were sent letters on June 10 warning them to pull offending products from their shelves.
“We want to better understand what’s being sold in our community and ensure that both consumers and retailers are informed,” Pennington County State’s Attorney Lara Roetzel said in the press release.
Katy Urban, spokeswoman for Roetzel’s office, told South Dakota Searchlight that the products collected in the end-of-July sweep will be tested at local law enforcement laboratories, and by the State Health Lab in Pierre.
There is no specific timeline for results. 
Since the law banning the products took effect on July 1, 2024, 100 charges have been filed, according to the State Unified Judicial System. Spokeswoman Alisa Bousa said the figure includes pending and completed cases, and that each case could involve multiple charges. 
Rep. Brian Mulder, R-Sioux Falls, prime sponsor of the bill creating the law in 2024, said via text message he hasn’t heard of any other counties or agencies doing similar compliance checks. 
Representatives from local law enforcement agencies in Mulder’s city did not immediately respond to a question on whether they intend to conduct similar compliance checks.

Gretchen Whitmer call a special election in Michigan's vacant 35th Senate district. | Kyle DavidsonThis article was originally published by Votebeat, a nonprofit news organization covering local election administration and voting access.
 
LANSING — It’s been more than 200 days since residents of Michigan’s 35th District have had a state Senator, prompting growing and bipartisan complaints over Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s refusal to call a special election to fill a vacant seat.
“We’re being taxed, but we have no representative in the state Senate. I think that’s egregious,” Saginaw County Democratic Party Chair Brandell Adams said this week.
Brandell is among three candidates who have so far filed to run for the seat in a district that includes parts of Bay, Midland and Saginaw counties. It’s been vacant since Jan. 3, when Democrat Kristen McDonald Rivet began her new job in Congress, leaving about 270,000 residents without a state senator.
Under Michigan law, only the governor has the power to call a special election to fill the seat for the remainder of the term, which runs through next year. Whitmer has not said when she’ll do so — or why it’s taken so long.
“We expect an announcement will be made in the near future,” Whitmer spokesperson Stacey LaRouche said Wednesday in a text message. “We will keep you posted.”
The governor’s office has offered variations on that statement for months but missed opportunities to utilize existing election dates to fill the seat, including Tuesday’s municipal primary.
In the meantime, the absence of a state Senator “has real consequences” for people in the district, said state Rep. Bill G. Schuette, a Midland Republican who is considering a run should Whitmer call a special election.
“We’re debating serious issues in the state Legislature, whether it’s our state’s budget, how we finally work to fix our roads … ,” he said. “People in the Great Lakes Bay region only have half of their voice.”
Schuette and other Republicans have continued to question the delay, accusing Whitmer of petty politics driven by a fear that the district will flip to Republicans.
Should it, Democrats and Republicans would each hold 19 seats in the state Senate.
Democratic Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist would have the power to break a tie, but Republicans could effectively block bills by asking a lawmaker to miss session. In the event of a 19-18 vote, a bill would fail, with no opportunity for Gilchrist to provide the 20th vote necessary for passage.
“It seems like Gov. Whitmer is very intent on doing the most political thing, because it seems like they’re afraid they’re going to lose the seat to Republicans,” said Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, R-Porter Township. “It’s blatantly political, partisan politics that they’re playing.”
 People in the district ‘deprived of representation’

It’s not uncommon for a lawmaker to leave office before their term concludes. But Michigan’s solution — giving the governor almost absolute control to call an election with little restriction on timing — is a poor solution, experts say.
“This is an endemic problem,” said Quinn Yeargain, a professor of law at Michigan State University. “Any time there’s a vacancy and you have to have a special election, there’s going to be a period of time in which nobody is in the seat and the people are functionally deprived of representation.”
Half of U.S. states instead use some version of an appointment system — typically, where the party that previously held the seat gives names to the governor for a replacement candidate — to expedite the process.
Political appointments can appear undemocratic, Yeargain said, but they help ensure voters do not lack representation for prolonged periods.
Michigan lawmakers in recent years have tried but failed to force a timeline for filing vacant seats in the state Legislature.
Former state Rep. Andrea Schroeder introduced a bill in June 2021 that would require a governor to announce within 30 days of a vacancy whether there will be a special election to finish the term.
The bill was personal for Schroeder, a Republican from Independence Township: She had been diagnosed with stomach cancer, and she died in October of that year.
Lawmakers in the House and Senate approved the legislation, but Whitmer vetoed it, saying she would “not tie the hands of future Michigan governors.”
Schuette, the Midland Republican, introduced a similar bill this year that would require a special election within 180 days of a legislative vacancy.
The proposal was co-sponsored by 16 Republican colleagues and referred to the House Election Integrity Committee in June. The GOP-led House has yet to hold a hearing on the bill, however.
State Board of Education Chair Pamela Pugh, a Saginaw Democrat who has already filed to run for the vacant seat, said Whitmer may have a good reason for not yet calling a special election, including ongoing negotiations over the state budget and road funding talks in Lansing.
But it’s getting to the point where she needs “to bump us up on that priority list,” Pugh said, adding later: “We are asking her to prioritize us. This district. A district that has great needs.”
 The cost of a special election

A lack of clarity around when — or even if — Whitmer will call a special election also leaves local election officials in a lurch.
Whitmer could call a special election to be run outside of the standard schedule, which can prove expensive and labor-intensive for clerks who will only have a single question on the ballot.
It’s not uncommon, as both May and August local elections frequently have little on the ballot. But any election requires a lot of clerks, from the ballot design to machine testing to counting ballots, and balancing that with the many other tasks they manage can be tricky.
The governor could also call a special election to coincide with other upcoming election dates. That might be easier on clerks, but it would likely also mean the state Senate seat stays vacant into next year.
State law requires that there is first a primary, Department of State spokesperson Cheri Hardmon confirmed. It’s far too late to get the race on next week’s ballot, and the language for much of the November ballot is finalized by the middle of the month to meet state and federal requirements.
Officials in the affected counties said they haven’t heard anything about possible special election dates from the Whitmer administration or the Michigan Bureau of Elections.
It’s been “radio silence,” said Bay County Clerk Katie Zanotti, who is concerned about the potential timing.
If the election is scheduled for later this year, officials could be looking at canvassing during the holidays. If it waits until 2026, Zanotti and other local clerks could have to run four elections next year, including major statewide primary and general elections for governor, U.S. Senate, the Legislature and more.
That was “really challenging” for fellow clerks when it happened last year in Metro Detroit, said Zanotti, a Democrat.
“I wish it would have been called much, much sooner,” she said. “Otherwise, it’s going to be a mad dash if it gets called at all, and I don’t know if it’s going to be.”

Fresh off an embarrassing defeat to Winneshiek County Sheriff Dan Marx, the state’s chief enforcers of Iowa RightThink have decided to take on someone they undoubtedly believe is more vulnerable.
The governor has filed a complaint concerning a University of Iowa employee who had the misfortune of being captured on hidden camera disparaging the anti-Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Gospel of the Republican Party.
In a secretly recorded video that aired on Fox News this week, an employee who has been identified in news reports as Andrea Tinoco, assistant director of Leadership and Student Organization Development, said that despite being ordered to remove “DEI” from their websites, “we are essentially finding ways to operate around it. … “We were like, ‘oh, OK, we can’t use that word. OK, ‘civic engagement.’ I think that’s a lot of what we’re doing.”
Civic engagement? The horrors!
In another part of the heavily edited video, Tinoco says: “We are still doing DEI work. We’re still working with our students. I have yet to be told, like, ‘Drea, you can’t say DEI,’ and I’m still gonna say it.”
Reynolds — who once said a jury’s verdict convicting Donald Trump of 34 felonies didn’t matter  — was instantly triggered by the video. She’s already pronounced Tinoco guilty of defying the state law banning diversity, equity and inclusion offices and activities. This, before the investigation was even completed; perhaps before it had even begun.
But it’s not at all clear that Tinoco has violated anything. The vaguely written law, passed in 2024, prohibits establishing offices or engaging in activities that give “special benefits” or encourage “preferential treatment” based on characteristics like race, religion, ethnicity, gender identity or sexual orientation.
Just because the adherents of Iowa RightThink get wiggy at the mere mention of “DEI,” and some university employees continue to believe in the idea behind it — equal opportunity — this doesn’t mean they are breaking the law.
Disparaging a concept, or attempts to banish it, are not illegal, either.
Nor are attempts to maneuver within the law’s meaning. Politicians do this all the time.
We’ve seen this movie before.
In February, Dan Marx violated Iowa RightThink by having the nerve to say he would uphold the Constitution, even if it meant refusing to pledge unquestioning loyalty to the federal government’s immigration practices.
These words also triggered the governor, who complained to Bird. The attorney general then tried to bring Marx to heel for what he wrote, going to court claiming he had broken state law. But Marx, a popular Republican sheriff in a Republican leaning county, chose to fight. He won.
This no doubt embarrassed Reynolds and Bird. So now they’ve chosen someone who might not have the resources or the level of public support of the elected sheriff who humiliated them. A person who they now seek to intimidate, either themselves or by leveraging the Board of Regents or the university to do it for them.
I don’t know Andrea Tinoco, but I hope she’s got access to good legal help. Because the weight of Iowa’s government is being brought to bear against her.
If she doesn’t, I hope Iowans who believe in free speech will step up.
I also hope the University of Iowa doesn’t knuckle under. We’ve already seen larger universities, with hefty financial resources, cave under the pressure of Trumpian intimidation, surrendering their free-speech values in the process. It would be a shame to see the University of Iowa join this crowd.
Here’s the bottom line: Iowans, including public employees, ought to be able to express an opinion, even if it runs against the prevailing winds of Iowa’s ruling party; even if it is expressing how you have tried to find ways, in the face of a pernicious law, to do “what we know we have to do for students.”
If this breaks the law, then Bird should have to prove it. If not, then she and the governor ought to leave people alone to say what they want in our free society.
Iowa Republicans have been on a jihad for years to try to establish RightThink in this state — by muzzling public school teachers, banning library books, seeking to impose loyalty oaths on law enforcement, etc.
If they can’t do it by law, then they’ll try to do it by intimidation. They failed with Dan Marx, so now they’ve chosen a new target. But the truth is they’re not just trying to persecute a state employee. We are all the targets of Iowa RightThink.

Though the Mendenhall River flowing by their backyard had been swollen with floodwaters in past years – and though the Lindoffs had taken precautions last summer like sealing doorways and stacking sandbags – the Aug. 5-6, 2024, event was the biggest Mendenhall Glacier outburst flood ever measured. The water that rushed out of a breached glacial ice dam brought the river to a record crest of 15.99 feet, inundating about 290 homes and stunning much of the community.

	“No one expected it to be this big,” Lindoff said months later in an interview at her freshly repaired and refurbished house.
The community is no longer likely to be caught by surprise.
“It’s probably likely that the floods could get larger in the future,” said Eran Hood, an environmental science professor and glacier specialist at the University of Alaska Southeast.
Hood is part of a broad effort mounted by scientists, government agencies, the local Tribal government, nonprofit community groups and individuals to limit the damage that may result from future floods.

The event, one of several held by municipal and Tribe officials, was in anticipation of another glacial outburst flood. (Photo by Corrine Smith/Alaska Beacon)
 

	A first step is ensuring that the public knows the risks. To that end, Hood and others at UAS and partner organizations have created an online resource, the Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard, launched in May.
Though the floods glaciers produce can happen quickly, there can be early warnings of water releases. The Juneau Glacial Flood Dashboard gives real-time information on water levels pooled above the ice dam that forms each year at one of the glacier’s basins. It has weather data, aerial images and other up-to-the-minute information. One of the most important features is a detailed flood-inundation map; users can type in their addresses and get predictions for flood impacts, depending on river-level scenarios and other conditions.
The dashboard idea came up as an answer to a basic question, Hood said: “What are the best ways to communicate hazards?”
Work by Hood and his colleagues is supported by a National Science Foundation grant. The foundation funded a project to do detailed studies of Mendenhall Glacier and the flood risks it poses, hone systems for predictions and warnings and apply those tools to other flood-prone glaciers in Alaska and possibly beyond.
Outburst flooding is a natural phenomenon in glaciated areas, sometimes referred to by an Icelandic name: jökulhlaup. They occur from the Andes to the Arctic. Their suddenness can make them dangerous to people in certain parts of the world, like the Himalayas; overall, about 15 million people in the world are at risk of such floods, according to a 2023 study published in the journal Nature.
The risks are increasing with climate change and glacial melt, studies have shown. Globally, glacial lake volume increased by 48% between 1990 and 2018, according to a 2020 study by Canadian, U.S. and British scientists who used satellite imagery to make the calculations.
Alaska outburst floods
Glacial outburst floods are also natural in Alaska, though the trends are a bit different.
There were 1,150 of these outbursts released from 106 ice-dammed lakes between 1985 and 2020, according to a study published in 2023 by scientists from Colorado State University, the University of Alaska Fairbanks and other institutions. The frequency of such events was unchanged over that period, they found. But there was a big change in timing, with most of the sites flooding earlier in the year, likely the result of warming temperatures and faster melt, the study found. Rapid changes in glaciers’ structures also means that new water-filled dams — and new flood risks — are emerging at individual sites, the study said.

Alaska’s glaciers are melting faster than those elsewhere in the world. The melt has varied and sometimes contradictory impacts on outburst floods, the 2023 study explains. Less ice overall has meant a reduced supply of meltwater. But accelerated melt can also increase the size of glaciers’ basins and weaken the ice dams that hold their meltwater. Rapid melt can also cause huge chunks of ice to calve away from higher elevations into the basins, boosting volume quickly.

Most of Alaska’s outburst floods have occurred in remote areas where there are no immediate threats to communities, like parts of sprawling Wrangell St-Elias National Park.
The Mendenhall Valley, however, is not remote.
The broad valley was carved into the landscape over millennia by its namesake glacier. It is a major suburb of Alaska’s capital city, home to about 12,000 of Juneau’s 31,200 residents. It holds neat neighborhoods where houses are more spacious than in the city’s upscale but tightly packed downtown district. It also holds abundant parks and trails, scenic views of mountains, meadows and coastline; and conveniences like shopping malls and commuter bus service. And, within the Tongass National Forest that surrounds the city, the valley is known for the big glacier that looms over it and draws hundreds of thousands of tourists each year.
Mendenhall Glacier has ebbed and flowed over thousands of years, but it has been in retreat ever since the Little Ice Age ended in the mid-1700s. As the climate has warmed — a trend amplified in far-north latitudes — the retreat has accelerated. That is the case not just for Mendenhall but for the other glaciers connected to the vast Juneau Ice Field that caps the mountains spanning Southeast Alaska and adjacent parts of Canada. The Juneau Ice Field lost a tenth of its glacier area from 2005 to 2019, according to NASA.
This melt created a relatively new gap within Mendenhall’s ice called Suicide Basin, reportedly named after the drop that ice above the basin would experience. Retreat of the smaller Suicide Glacier, which had been connected to Mendenhall, created the gap.
As glacial ice melts over each summer, the basin fills with water. As the water within the basin rises, it breaks through the ice dam and rushes down into Mendenhall Lake, Mendenhall River and, sometimes, over the riverbanks. The process is repeated year-to-year as ice dams are formed and then breached, though water amounts and speed of releases can vary.
Had modern technology and alertness existed in the past, the risk to the Mendenhall Valley could have been identified many years ago, Hood said.

	“Twenty years ago, someone could have looked at Mendenhall and looked at the side basins and said there could definitely be a problem in the future. Nobody did that,” he said.
The first Suicide Basin outburst flood was in 2011. “That pretty much caught people by surprise, although in hindsight, it shouldn’t have,” said Jason Amundson, a UAS geophysics professor and the principal investigator for the National Science Foundation-funded project.
Since then, floods have occurred almost annually, though at varying levels and intensities. Recent floods were big. A record 2023 flood, with a maximum crest of the Mendenhall River measured at 14.97 feet, was followed by the even-bigger 2024 flood.
Though it caused more damage, last year’s flood came and went quickly. “The whole thing lasted maybe 12 hours,” Amundson said..

There is not yet enough data to identify a clear pattern, making predictions difficult for now, Hood and Amundson said. But there is a good chance that Suicide Basin will continue emptying out huge amounts of water.
“If we keep having full drainage like we did last year, then I would expect that we would keep having big floods,” Amundson said.
Local officials, meanwhile, are looking beyond Suicide Basin as they consider future risks, said Robert Barr, Juneau’s assistant city manager.
“There very well could be other basins behind Suicide that will form as Mendenhall Glacier retreats,” he said.
Holding waters back
The municipal government, a partner in the flood dashboard, has embarked on another short-term response to the flood risk.

	It spent nearly $8 million on a flood barrier erected this year along the Mendenhall River. The barrier, a stout sandbag structure originally designed for military use, was recommended by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as a short-term fix. To recoup part of the cost, the local government is assessing a fee on the 466 property owners in the river area. The fee, about $6,300 per household, is to be paid over 10 years.
The Lindoff home is among those behind the new barrier, which bears the brand name HESCO. Danielle Lindoff, who has watched river waters rise and churn over the years, eroding the far bank and felling huge trees, said she is grateful for the protection. But her feelings are mixed.
“We bought this house because of the view,” she said. “Now we won’t even be able to see it.”
Barr, at the City and Borough of Juneau, concedes the barriers are not particularly pretty. But he said most homeowners accept their presence.
“I wouldn’t say the question was, ‘Do you find the HESCO barriers attractive or not?’” he said. “But they are our best effort, in consultation with the Army Corps and all the other experts that we’re talking with, to keep water in the river.”

	The barriers are temporary, Barr said.
For the longer term, the Army Corps of Engineers might design a bigger flood-control system, he said. That could be something as substantial as the diversion project installed in Fairbanks after a devastating 1967 flood. The Fairbanks system is large, subject to ongoing maintenance, and has cost $220 million to date. The Corps has already embarked on a technical study for the Mendenhall Valley, a project supported by $4.75 million in federal funds.

It is possible that the Corps will create something similar for Juneau’s Mendenhall Valley. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)

Whatever is done will depend on scientific research.
The University of Alaska Southeast-led team, which also includes scientists from the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Carnegie Mellon University, is using field and remote-sensing data to better understand how the glacier has changed in the past and to create models for how it will change in the future. Technologies used include LiDAR, which measures elevations and features through light beams; radar, which employs soundwaves to measure the thickness of glacial ice over bedrock; and drones, which capture aerial images that can be compared over time.
 


	Weather and tide data is important, too. The record 2024 outburst flood came on a night after a gloriously sunny and warm summer day. Things could be much worse if an outburst flood happens during a rainstorm or when tides in the adjacent Gastineau Channel are exceptionally high, experts say.
Beyond Juneau
The Mendenhall work being led by Amundson is about more than Juneau’s famous glacier. The risk-analysis systems the team develops for Mendenhall are intended to be applied to other glaciers in Alaska.
Beyond Mendenhall, Hood said, the second-highest priority for risk analysis is probably Snow Glacier on the Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage and just north of the coastal town of Seward.

	Though the Snow Glacier’s periodic floods have not reached communities beyond a popular campground and a smattering of nearby houses, they do threaten infrastructure. The Seward Highway, a major state thoroughfare, and the Alaska Railroad run right along that flood zone. The railroad is planning to raise the elevation of a bridge at the trouble site, and the Alaska Department of Transportation plans a related elevation rise to the highway. The estimated cost of the road project alone is $20 million.

	Hood and Amundson pointed out another spot where glacial outburst floods are threats: the Prince William Sound port town of Valdez, home to 3,900 people and site of the terminal where oil that passes through the Trans Alaska Pipeline System is shipped out.
In the mountains outside of town, the Valdez Glacier has been damming and releasing meltwater every year or two. Some years, releases are relatively slow and small; some years’ releases cause problems. An outburst flood in 2018 inundated part of Valdez.
Weakened federal partners?
Continued work to understand glacial outburst floods and the risks they pose to Alaskans depends on partnerships with academic institutions and agencies at various levels of government.
But federal agencies that are important partners have been weakened by deep budget cuts and abrupt firings that could hollow out scientific programs.
One partner is the U.S. Geological Survey, a branch of the Department of the Interior that has been doing both long-term monitoring of Mendenhall Glacier’s changes and collecting day-to-day data and imagery from Suicide Basin. The Trump administration is proposing slashing total USGS spending by nearly 40%, including an approximately 30% cut to the agency’s natural disaster programs.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service, is another key partner that has already been targeted for deep cuts and likely faces more. The administration’s budget for the coming fiscal years proposes eliminating all funding for NOAA research.
The U.S. Forest Service is another partner. It manages the Tongass National Forest, which covers most of Southeast Alaska, and Southcentral Alaska’s Chugach National Forest. Both are heavily glaciated.

	Among the Forest Service duties in Juneau is delivery of warnings and, at times, evacuation notices to tourists and campers at the Mendenhall Glacier Visitor Center. Mass firings by the Trump administration left the visitor center nearly unmanned earlier in the year, with only two employees still on the payroll there in February. Several workers have been rehired since, but staffing levels remain uncertain.
Barr said Juneau officials worry about losses at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, an important partner even though its general definition of flood zones does not consider glacial outburst floods.
The agency in April canceled its Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program, and halted work on all pending grant applications, even though the program has won praise for helping communities reduce costs of disaster emergencies.
Several states are pushing back against the program’s termination; 20 filed a lawsuit in mid-July challenging the administration’s decision.
“We are potentially concerned about hazard-mitigation grants and those going away,” Barr said. And along with loss of financial aid is the concern about “losing expertise” as veteran emergency and risk-assessment experts are pushed out of the agency, he said.
Uncertainty also affects the National Science Foundation, which is funding the Mendenhall research project. The Trump administration is proposing a 55 percent cut for the coming fiscal year.
The grant money was already paid, and so far, the project has remained intact, Amundson said. “As far as I know, everything is going forward,” he said.

,California,2025-08-02 13:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,California affordable housing programs are on the chopping block after Supreme Court ruling,Ben Christopher,,,,,https://calmatters.org/housing/2025/08/affordable-housing-developer-fees/,Many California cities require homebuilders to create affordable housing or pay fees to support construction of those units. A new lawsuit contends those fees are unconstitutional.,"In summary
Many California cities require homebuilders to create affordable housing or pay fees to support construction of those units. A new lawsuit contends those fees are unconstitutional.


East Palo Alto, like cities across California, has a law on the books that forces developers of new housing projects to foot the bill for the state’s shortage of affordable homes.
New residential projects need to set aside a share of the units they plan to build for lower-income renters and homeowners under the terms of the city’s “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Builders who refuse have to instead pay a fee, ranging from the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
An East Palo Alto homeowner filed a lawsuit in federal court on Thursday challenging the constitutionality of that law, likening it to “extortion” — and he had a little help from the U.S. Supreme Court.
The implications of the lawsuit range far beyond the Bay Area. A 2017 report estimated that 149 cities and counties across California have some form of inclusionary zoning rule, though the specific terms vary. That makes it one of the most commonly used affordable housing programs both in California and in the country. 
Now all that may be on the constitutional chopping block.
The case was filed in federal court in San Francisco by Wesley Yu, a husband and father between jobs, who was planning to build a home and backyard guest cottage for himself and his extended family on a neighboring parcel.
Because Yu was planning to construct two new structures, the city’s inclusionary zoning rules kicked in, requiring him to either sell or rent out one of the units at “affordable” rates or to pay a one-time fee of $54,891 to be deposited in the city’s affordable housing subsidy fund.
The core of Yu’s lawsuit, which was filed by the libertarian-oriented Pacific Legal Foundation, draws on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling from last year that also emerged from a heated California housing dispute. 
That case was brought by Placerville septuagenarian, George Sheetz, who contested that the government of El Dorado County had not done enough to justify the $23,420 traffic fee it placed on his home construction project.
Sheetz’s case drew on the U.S. Constitution’s Fifth Amendment, which puts limits on when the government can take private property. Decades of court rulings have said that if a local government wants to base approval of a construction permit on certain conditions, those conditions have to directly relate to the costs associated with the development. A city, for example, might be able to hold off on approving a new dump until a developer pays an environmental clean up fee, but not a fee to fund local arts and recreation. 
Courts have also ruled that such “exactions” on private development should be “roughly proportionate” to their cost. That is, the $23,420 that El Dorado County wanted to impose on Sheetz should match the cost of fixing the wear and tear his new home would leave on local roads.
The Supreme Court agreed that these standards ought to apply to the impact fee.
Now Yu and his legal team are asking a federal judge to apply that same rule to inclusionary zoning. For East Palo Alto’s program to pass constitutional muster, the city would have to show that the $54,891 fee or the requirement to set aside new units at a discount relates to and matches the cost that Yu’s development would impose upon the city.
The city won’t be able to show that, said David Deerson, the lead lawyer representing Yu.
“New residential development doesn’t have a negative impact on housing affordability. If anything, it has a positive impact,” he said.
A growing body of economic research has indeed found that local market-rate development puts downward pressure on neighborhood and city-wide rents.
Affordable housing in California zoning
In the past, California courts have ruled that the high constitutional bar set by the Fifth Amendment doesn’t apply to inclusionary zoning programs like the one in East Palo Alto. Requiring private developers to toss in some added affordable housing isn’t an “exaction,” the courts have found, but a standard land-use restriction akin to any other zoning rule. 
Whether a city decides it needs more schools, apartment buildings, businesses or, in the case of inclusionary zoning, affordable housing, it has broad power under the constitution to “decide, for the good of the general welfare, that we’re going to require this,” said Mike Rawson, director of litigation at the Public Interest Law Project. 
The state Supreme Court ruled as such most recently in 2015. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to weigh in, a tacit approval. 
“They can always change their mind,” said Rawson. “I don’t see a basis for it, though obviously that doesn’t necessarily stop them.”
The composition of the court has changed since 2015, veering sharply to the right. The Sheetz decision from last year has offered new fodder for legal challenges to inclusionary zoning.
“Sheetz really helps out here a lot” in that campaign, said Deerson. He pointed to other challenges in Denver and Teton County, Wyoming. “I would expect them to keep coming.”
Tradeoffs in housing policy
If and when the nation’s highest court takes up the issue of inclusionary zoning, it will be wading into one of the more politically charged debates in housing policy.
Evidence on the impact of these laws is mixed. Requiring private developers to build affordable units can and regularly does result in more local housing options for lower income tenants at no additional cost to taxpayers. By putting affordable and market-rate units side-by-side, they also promote economic and racial integration, supporters argue. 
But inclusionary requirements can also make any given housing project less profitable, meaning that fewer units get built, leading to higher prices and rents overall. In housing markets, like California’s, that see relatively little new development, the rate at which these programs add designated affordable units to the housing stock is also quite slow.
That policy debate isn’t relevant to the legal case, which will be fought and won over abstract constitutional principles. But for libertarian-leaning groups like the Pacific Legal Foundation, building industry groups and many “Yes In My Backyard” housing development advocates, an end to inclusionary zoning would be a win on both fronts.
“In addition to being illegal, I think that these inclusionary zoning policies are also frankly stupid,” said Deerson.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/012425-Affordable-Housing-DD-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-02 09:56:11.407167

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As the Trump administration shrinks and even considers eliminating the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Alaska Legislature is considering a substitute for one of the agency’s key functions.
A bill introduced by Sen. Bert Stedman, a Republican from the Southeast city of Sitka, would establish an Alaska flood authority and an Alaska flood insurance fund. As far as he knows, it would make Alaska the only state with its own flood insurance, Stedman said.
The veteran state lawmaker said his measure, Senate Bill 11, stems from his dissatisfaction with FEMA and its flood policies, feelings that predated the agency’s possible demise in the Trump era.
The federal agency is, for now, the only source of flood insurance in Alaska, as private carriers that offer policies elsewhere in the country do not operate in the state’s small market, Stedman said.
But Alaskans overall pay much more into the FEMA insurance pool that they receive, he said.
“There’s a cost factor involved here, with Alaska residents subsidizing the Mississippi Delta and the Gulf Coast and East Coast and all that compared to our losses,” Stedman said.
FEMA’s rules about insurance and assistance, which are aimed at flood-prone flat Lower 48 areas, are another source of irritation for Stedman. In Lower 48 areas, FEMA encourages communities to avoid building along coastlines, but in Southeast Alaska, where steep mountains rise from the water’s edge, there are few options for moving inland, he said. An only-in-Alaska flood program could consider local conditions and local governments’ zoning rules rather than FEMA national guidelines, he said.
The Trump administration’s antipathy toward FEMA and its mission has given his bill more urgency, he said.
“It’s reasonably likely that there’ll be significant changes to FEMA coming out of Washington, from restructuring to possibly elimination, so the timing of this bill might be, by happenstance, timely,” he said.
The bill moved through committees this year and is due for more work next year’s session, including an examination of funding options. If a system is established, Stedman said, it could potentially be expanded to another type of disaster that is occurring with increasing frequency in warming Alaska: landslides. There is no specific landslide insurance available in Alaska, Stedman noted.
That may be of interest to Jason Amundson and Eran Hood, University of Alaska Southeast scientists who are focused on glacial outburst flood risks. Though immersed in their project at Mendenhall Glacier, they do not live in the path of the meltwater. Rather, both live in the city’s downtown area, which clings to the lower slopes of steep mountains. There, avalanches and landslides pose the most serious risks.
“There’s hazards everywhere in Juneau,” Hood said.

GADSDEN — The coal ash lagoon at Alabama Power’s Plant Gadsden was supposed to be a model for how to close ash ponds by covering them in place, a process utilities insisted would protect human health and the environment from toxic contaminants in the ash.
Now, groundwater monitoring data and a federal lawsuit are challenging that contention.
The ash pond was the first in Alabama to be closed with a cover-in-place system in 2018, after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s 2015 coal ash rules, and Alabama Power planned to use the same basic technique at the coal ash ponds for five other power plants across the state.

But today, seven years after the Gadsden pond closure was completed, environmental groups say the facility is still leaking toxic substances into groundwater on the banks of the Coosa River and Neely Henry Lake, a popular boating and bass fishing destination in east Alabama.
The Southern Environmental Law Center, on behalf of environmental group Coosa Riverkeeper, filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Alabama Power, challenging what it called “unlawful and defective capping” of the coal ash pond at Plant Gadsden.
The groups say that as recently as October 2024, Alabama Power’s self-reported groundwater monitoring results show “levels of arsenic forty times the legal standard in groundwater,” as well as potentially harmful levels of boron, chromium and cobalt.
“The citizens of Gadsden and folks who depend on Neely Henry Lake deserve so much better than Alabama Power’s legacy of pollution,” Justinn Overton, executive director and riverkeeper at Coosa Riverkeeper, said in a news release. “Drinking water supply, booming ecotourism, and hard-working Alabamians are all threatened by Alabama Power’s recklessness.”
Coosa Riverkeeper is among numerous groups that have called for Alabama Power to excavate its coal ash and move the material to a lined landfill, rather than leaving the ash in unlined impoundments near rivers. Alabama Power has announced plans to cap all of its coal ash ponds in place, but Gadsden is the only plant where that process has been completed.
“It’s time for Alabama Power to do the right thing and move their ash,” Overton said.
A spokesperson for Alabama Power said “[a]s a matter of practice, we do not comment on pending legal matters.”
Coal ash, or coal combustion residuals, are the leftover solid material from burning coal, typically in a power plant or other industrial facility. According to the EPA, coal ash often contains contaminants like mercury, cadmium, chromium and arsenic which can be “associated with cancer and various other serious health effects.”
The EPA’s 2015 coal ash rules allowed for two possible cleanup options for the coal ash lagoons, which can be hundreds of acres in size, containing millions of tons of wet ash slurry. Utilities could dig out the coal ash and move it to a lined landfill, or they could cover it in place, as long as certain conditions were met.
In 2016, Alabama Power announced plans to use the cover-in-place option at all its plants. The permit for Plant Gadsden was approved by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management in 2020, two years after the physical work had already been completed.
But last year, the EPA denied approval of Alabama’s coal ash permitting program, saying that the state had approved permits that were “significantly less protective of people and waterways than federal law requires,” and that “coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure.”
The Riverkeeper lawsuit—filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama—contends that nearly 40 percent of the ash at Gadsden remains saturated in groundwater, constituting a violation of the EPA coal ash rules and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.
It is not yet clear how the coal ash regulations will fare under the Trump administration.
The groups filed a notice of intent to sue in May, and went forward with the suit Tuesday, after the required 60-day notification period.
In addition to the lake being a popular fishing spot, the ash pond is located less than a mile upstream of a drinking water intake, although the lawsuit does not allege any contamination of the drinking water.
The coal ash pond at Plant Gadsden is on the opposite side of the river from the old power plant, which was demolished last year. According to the lawsuit, the coal ash slurry was pumped through underwater pipes across the river for disposal in a lagoon.
“There is no excuse for a company with Alabama Power’s resources to risk a community and commercial riverfront with this type of hazard,” Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office, said in a news release. “Alabama Power must join utilities across the South cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps. This type of waste must be in safe storage away from waterways like the Coosa and Neely Henry Lake.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Coal-ash-pond-for-Aug-2-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-02 08:56:11.654961

(Photo by Emree Weaver for InvestigateWest)Throughout her two decades working on forestry issues, Jasmine Minbashian has often found herself at odds with the U.S. Forest Service and the timber industry. Her environmental activism started during the second wave of Pacific Northwest “Timber Wars” — an intense period of conflict between environmentalists and the timber industry that unfolded in the late 1980s and ’90s over logging in old-growth forests.
Instead of camping out in century-old trees or destroying timber-felling equipment in protest of sweeping logging practices on public lands, Minbashian took a different approach. She worked to bring disparate groups together to restore old-growth forests, supporting rural economies and reducing wildfire risk at the same time. 
So when she joined the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative in 2019, Minbashian felt cautiously optimistic. The organization — one of dozens of forest collaboratives that had sprung up across the West — brought together conservation groups, agency officials and timber companies to plan forest restoration projects in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. As the executive director of the small environmental nonprofit Methow Valley Citizens Council, she was excited to have a seat at the table to find common ground.
One of the group’s first major efforts focused on restoring 50,000 fire-prone acres near Twisp, the rural town where she lived. For years, the group collaborated closely with the U.S. Forest Service to design the Mission Restoration Project and garner community support. The plan included some commercial logging, but largely focused on thinning small trees, restoring habitat and decommissioning old roads — work Minbashian believed could protect communities without resorting to the kind of aggressive logging she had spent years fighting.
But when no timber companies bid on the commercial logging portion of the project, federal and state agencies quietly rewrote the plan to, as Minbashian put it, “sweeten the pot” by including more large trees — circumventing years of planning, environmental assessments and community outreach. The $1.1 million contract was ultimately awarded in 2021 to Hampton Lumber, a member of the collaborative, which trucked the logs more than 100 miles to its mill on the other side of the Cascades.
“That started some of the questioning of, like, what’s going on here?” Minbashian said.
When she later visited logged areas near the Libby and Buttermilk creek drainages, she was stunned. Some sections looked as expected. Others had been stripped of trees she thought were protected by the restoration project plan — including old-growth trees that are key to the forest’s health.
“When you’re talking about restoring forests and climate-smart forestry, you want to retain those old or big trees,” she said. “They’re the most fire-resistant. They store water. They just serve so many important ecological functions.”
Over the last decade, hundreds of millions of private, state and federal dollars have been funneled to forest restoration and wildfire mitigation projects spearheaded by the U.S. Forest Service and collaborative groups like the one in North Central Washington. The group is one of 19 forest collaboratives focused on public lands in Washington and Oregon that emerged in the wake of the “Timber Wars” in an attempt to find agreement around contentious forestry issues. 
These forest collaboratives, touted as a model of consensus-driven conservation, have quietly become influential engines for federal forest management decisions across the West. But critics worry the groups are too aligned with timber interests that prioritize commercial logging, and that they helped pave the way for the Trump administration’s latest effort to expand logging on public lands throughout the country by skirting environmental protection laws.
Some community groups and grassroots environmental organizations have become disenchanted with the arrangement, saying forest collaboratives offer a false sense of community engagement and transparency into forestry projects on public lands. Other mainstream environmental groups see timber’s influence in the projects as a double-edged sword. While the commercial logging aspects of the projects are often the most controversial, the timber sale can help fund other aspects of the restoration plans — like improving fish spawning areas and decommissioning roads that fragment wildlife habitats — to help keep the momentum going. But those funds aren’t always guaranteed.
“Everybody’s at the table because they have their own interests,” said Tiana Luke, the co-chair of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative and the senior conservation manager for The Wilderness Society, a national environmental policy nonprofit. “In this climate, we can’t do the important ecological forest restoration without that economic component.”
Unlike some forest collaboratives, the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative is not classified formally as a federal advisory committee, meaning the group isn’t required to follow accountability and transparency measures meant to limit the influence of special interest groups on public policy. 


The collaborative insists that it wields the same influence as any other community member when making suggestions to the Forest Service. But years worth of internal documents and emails obtained by InvestigateWest show the group has worked closely with the U.S. Forest Service at nearly every step of the process to carefully craft public messaging around logging projects, placate community concerns, and keep projects on pace and out of the courts. For at least one project, records show that a bid was awarded to the same timber company that had previously led a discussion among collaborative members about how to make the project more attractive to buyers. 
“It’s all because they want to rush the projects through,” said Ric Bailey, a Winthrop resident and a longtime environmental activist. “They’re showing the public, look, we are doing something to protect you from fire.”
But he sees no difference in the current approach to what he witnessed in the ’80s and ’90s, when the Forest Service’s main priority was meeting federally mandated timber quotas. 
“I looked at the projects, and I said, ‘These don’t have anything to do with fire or fuel reductions,’” he recalled thinking, referring to the Mission Restoration Project. “It’s just logging.” 
Public plans versus reality
In the wake of the Timber Wars, forest collaboratives emerged to bring lumber mill owners, environmentalists and local governments to the table to figure out how to move forward. Public perception had begun to move away from viewing national forests as “piggy banks” for economic benefit and resource extraction to treating them as ecological treasures worthy of protection, according to Steve Pedery, the conservation director at Oregon Wild, a Portland-based environmental organization that helped create some of the first collaboratives. 
But over the last decade, the pendulum has swung back toward timber interests, according to Pedery.
“There are still places where you will find functional collaboratives and their citizens who come together with loggers and the Forest Service and counties and community groups to hash out a common vision,” Pedery said. “But I would say that’s the rarity these days.” 
Pedery feels mainstream environmental groups participating in forest collaboratives have compromised their values in exchange for access to funding and a seat at the decision-making table — a dynamic that’s helped set the stage for the Trump administration’s current efforts to expand and expedite logging in national forests by 25%.
“There are a lot of people who had a little too much hubris over the last decade who helped create this mess that we’re in around losing what are really some of the existential environmental protections in the Pacific Northwest,” he said. 
The Trump administration claims that, in addition to reducing the country’s reliance on domestic timber, recent actions to expedite logging operations will improve forest health and reduce the risk of catastrophic fire by thinning out overgrown forests. But some legal experts and environmental scientists warn that while some thinning could help, excessive logging could have the opposite effect by creating drier conditions, altering forest structures to make them less resilient and increasing flammable logging “debris” across the landscape.
While many of the restoration projects being spearheaded by the Forest Service and the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative call for ecological restoration efforts aside from logging, those aspects often lag behind — calling into question whether the restoration plans are simply commercial logging under a different name. 
“Typically in the past, what would happen is that the commercial part would get done, but all the stuff that needed funding would not get done,” Minbashian told InvestigateWest in February. “So even though they did the (environmental assessment) for it, it doesn’t mean it necessarily happened.” 
That’s been true for the Mission Project, where 95% of the commercial thinning outlined in the environmental assessment has been completed as of June 2025; 69% of noncommercial thinning has been completed; and less than 5% of the planned prescribed burning has occurred as of July 2025, according to a Forest Service spokesperson. Only a quarter of fish culverts have been replaced, though 80% of the planned habitat improvement plans for streams have occurred. 
The collaborative, founded in 2013, gained momentum in the wake of two catastrophic wildfire seasons in North Central Washington — a time often cited in press releases and scientific reports as highlighting the need for restoration work.
On a windy, hot day in July 2014, lightning strikes ignited the Carlton Complex Fire, which went down in state history as the largest continuous wildfire, engulfing more than 250,000 acres, destroying over 350 homes, and leaving $98 million worth of damage in its wake. The following year, another million acres burned in the area, leading to renewed public outcry from residents wanting to see more done to prevent wildfires. 
“When people talk about the trauma of that fire event, and then the 2015 fires that devastated a huge area of Okanogan County, it’s real,” said Susan Prichard, a fire ecologist for the University of Washington whose family lived through the fire. “I can still choke up about it.”
As wildfires in the Pacific Northwest have become more frequent and more devastating, collaboratives like those in Washington have become increasingly vocal about the urgency of improving the ecosystem and addressing the long legacy of fire suppression from the U.S. Forest Service, which led to a buildup of “wildfire fuels” across the landscape.
For centuries, Indigenous people stewarded forests by thinning and resetting the landscape using fire, which is critical to ecosystem health. But the U.S. Forest Service’s longstanding practice of aggressive fire suppression led to a buildup of dense, dry forests, primed to burn. The resulting catastrophic wildfires triggered an influx of state and federal funds for “fuel reduction treatments” such as forest thinning — a broad term which can mean removing small branches and trees or conducting massive commercial logging projects — as well as prescribed burning.
“Fire is such a big component of the ecology of the forest here, and they have been historically fire-suppressed, and so we need to reintroduce fire,” Minbashian said. “But if you did that without some thinning first, it could lead to bigger fires than we want, which is what we’re seeing because of climate change as well.”
“Some thinning prior to fire can be helpful, but thinning alone is not going to get you the results you need,” she added. 
Tools meant to speed up the process
A major goal of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative is to speed up the approval process for restoration projects, which is made easier if the project is proposed to help address wildfire risks. 
To do so, the group pays private consultants to conduct environmental studies and surveys on behalf of the Forest Service in an attempt to circumvent federal bureaucracy. It also relies on condition-based management, a tool which allows the group to get planning approvals based on a broad-strokes outline of a decision, with the promise that the details will get hammered out later. But the practices also obfuscate the plans for the public and make it harder for environmental groups to sue, advocates say. And since the collaborative is part of the planning process so early on, it gives timber industry representatives who are part of the group a front-row seat to million-dollar timber sales they might ultimately bid on. 
During the planning phase for the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s first project, called the Upper Wenatchee Restoration project, Anjolene Price, the collaborative forestry manager for Hampton Lumber, led discussions within a subcommittee about how to design the project to entice buyers while remaining “cautious of anti-trust violations,” according to meeting notes obtained by InvestigateWest. Anti-trust laws are meant to promote fair competition and prohibit activity like price-fixing, bid-rigging and monopolization. 

Hampton Lumber ultimately received a $1.5 million timber contract in 2024, the first commercial sale awarded for the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project.
Price represents Hampton Lumber on several forest collaboratives in Washington, driving hundreds of miles each week to attend in-person meetings. In 2022, she became the co-chair of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative. 
With sawmills in Washington, Oregon and Canada, Hampton Lumber has the largest forestry footprint in Okanogan County and the second largest in the state of Washington. Over the last decade, the company has received $443 million worth of timber contracts to conduct logging on state-managed lands throughout the state. The company has completed five timber sales in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest since 2021 – including at least three projects that Price helped to design – accounting for nearly 58% of all the timber removed from the federally-managed forest, according to data obtained from the Washington Department of Natural Resources and the U.S. Forest Service. 
“When it comes to collaboratives and forest health treatment projects, it would be more difficult, even inappropriate, if the local mills were not involved,” Price, who declined numerous interview requests, wrote in a prepared statement. 
“The success of these projects depends on finding markets for any wood fiber that is removed; ultimately, the forest health treatment must pencil out in order to be implemented,” she wrote. “By participating, I can help inform what will work and what does not.”
The collaborative doesn’t define what would be considered a conflict of interest in its operating procedures, and some members within the group insist that no such conflict exists since all parties benefit in some way from the project. 
The group also doesn’t define what success looks like for the projects.
Luke, the co-chair of the collaborative and the senior conservation manager for the Wilderness Society, said it’s challenging to quantify the group’s successes over the last decade. The projects are complicated, span decades, and involve dozens of state and federal agencies and outside groups to pull off, she said. 
Personally, she’d like to see more monitoring happening to help answer that million-dollar question: Are these projects actually helping the environment? 
“Are we reducing the risk of crown fire in this stand or across the landscape as a whole?” said Luke, referring to wildfires that quickly spread through the “crown” or tops of trees. 
“If you look at a broader scale, are we doing that?” she added. “And sometimes the forest has funding and capacity to do that (monitoring), and then sometimes they don’t.”
In the final environmental assessment for the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project published in 2017, the Forest Service said it was working with partners to develop a “broad monitoring strategy” to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments and restoration actions. “While this strategy is still in development, it is expected to result in a monitoring partnership with collaborators and regular reporting of monitoring results,” the plans read. 
The North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s website says it is spearheading that effort, but Luke said questions about monitoring should be directed to the Forest Service. In response, a Forest Service spokesperson wrote in an email that they are collecting data on vegetation density and the size of trees within the areas that will be logged. “The Forest Service is coordinating closely with NCWFHC to inform future implementation strategies and adaptive management,” she said.
Still, the collaborative is celebrating the Upper Wenatchee Pilot Project as a success.
In May, a group of around 40 community members piled into two white Forest Service vans to visit a slice of the forest where the project took place, outside Leavenworth. 
Standing in a semi-circle in the middle of a recently logged area of the forest, the tour group was a mix of forestry experts and retirees — many of whom live along Lake Wenatchee, one of the most wildfire-prone areas in the country. Those involved in the project celebrated their decade-long collaboration, declaring that the nearby community was better protected from wildfire because of the work done. 
“We did it,” said Lloyd McGee, a founding member of the collaborative and the Washington forests program manager for the nonprofit The Nature Conservancy, as the crowd clapped. “We didn’t increase the pace, but we’re still learning from that.”
The project originally listed many of the same ecological goals as the Mission Project, such as decommissioning roads, restoring fish habitat and conducting prescribed burning — but much of the work remains incomplete, apart from two timber sales. Approximately 2,300 acres have been sold for commercial logging, with about 30% of the logging having been completed as of July 2025, according to a Forest Service spokesperson. Only a small fraction of the noncommercial thinning has occurred, and no prescribed burning or road decommissioning has taken place. 
“Maybe that’s step two or three,” Andrew Lakota, a staff member with the Wenatchee River Ranger District who helped steward the logging operations for the project, told the crowd. “I don’t know what step that is, but now we’re generating receipts from the timber, and we can start doing a lot of other (restoration) activities we identified.”
Public cut out of the process
When Ric Bailey moved to North Central Washington’s Methow Valley in 2014, tucked in the eastern foothills of the Cascade Range, he was hoping to retire. 
With the help of a local carpenter, he built a small yurt-style home just outside downtown Winthrop — 12 minutes from the edge of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. After decades of environmental activism to stop logging in old-growth forests and wilderness areas throughout the Pacific Northwest, Bailey was burned out and yearned for some stillness. But it wasn’t long before he found himself fighting the same fights. 
Bailey, alongside a small but mighty group of neighbors, has been critical of the North Central Washington Forest Health Collaborative’s behind-the-scenes role in crafting Forest Service projects, often years before community members have a chance to weigh in. They see the setup as nothing more than a mirage, offering the illusion of transparency and community engagement into plans that do nothing more than pad the profits of powerful timber companies.
“All we can do is document how they have cut the public out of the process,” Bailey said. “Once these (environmental assessments) are signed, all you got is litigation.”

The Forest Service isn’t required to listen to the collaborative’s recommendations, but they often do. Any citizen can submit a proposal for consideration during the agency’s environmental review, but the collaborative knows months — and even years — before the public knows what the project might look like, including how much timber companies might get. Unlike members of the public, collaboratives also work hand and hand with the federal agency to iron out the details. 
For example, in 2020, the Forest Service gave collaborative members a three-week “sneak peek” of a final environmental assessment for a contentious restoration project before it was released to the public for a 30-day comment period, according to emails obtained by InvestigateWest.
“They get a front-row seat,” Bailey said.
While the group’s quarterly meetings are open to the public, community members are not permitted in steering committee meetings or a project working group, where collaborative members discuss pending Forest Service projects and current collaborations on public lands. 
Meeting notes are also only sporadically posted online. The most recent quarterly meeting minutes available are from November 2024, the only notes posted since 2021 — though the new facilitator of the group said the lag is due to website issues.
Bailey and other community members have criticized the group for being insular, saying it contradicts their publicly stated goals of engaging the community on public projects. 
“There’s sensitivity on how we talk about work of the collaborative,” Price, the co-chair of the collaborative and Hampton Lumber representative, told members during a meeting in February in which she reiterated the group’s policy of directing media inquiries to the co-chairs. “We don’t want to be knocking ourselves.”
Bailey is also critical of the ways the Forest Service, with help from the collaborative, is trying to expedite “restoration” projects by speeding up the environmental review process using tools now openly championed by the Trump administration under the guise of wildfire mitigation. The tools include finding “flexible ways” to write environmental assessments that leave ample room for different interpretations on the ground. Those strategies also make it more difficult to sue, he said. 
Each project must be reviewed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), a landmark 1970 environmental law that requires federal agencies to assess whether an action will have a significant impact on the environment before a project is approved. But there are various levels of review, and the agency gets to determine which is the most appropriate. The Forest Service determined that the second-narrowest environmental review — for projects they consider to have no significant impact on the environment — sufficed for over 200,000 acres encompassed in the four major restoration projects unfolding in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. 
“How can you say that you’re going to reduce wildfire risk and reconstruct the forest, the whole forest ecosystem here, and not have a significant environmental impact?” Bailey said. “Are you kidding me?”
Restoration projects are also set to undergo even less review under the Trump administration. In an executive order issued in March, the Trump administration ordered agencies to expand the use of categorical exclusions, the least stringent type of environmental review, and to exempt timber thinning projects entirely to expedite logging throughout the country’s national forests.
While Prichard, the forest ecologist with the University of Washington, sees commercial logging as a necessary tool to thin out the forest and reduce wildfire risks, she remains cautious. “I’ve become more comfortable with the idea that we need mills to take the material out and help defray the very expensive cost of fire exclusion,” she said.
“Do I think that we should be really careful about next steps and provide a lot of oversight? Absolutely,” she said, referring to Trump’s executive orders regarding logging. “But the term commercial harvesting doesn’t set my hackles up the way it might some of my neighbors.”
Bailey isn’t opposed to fuel reduction projects like noncommercial thinning or even logging, if done thoughtfully. He’s worked on Forest Service projects and as a timber faller in the ’80s, and later as a wildland firefighter. But he takes issue with the collaborative and the Forest Service offering false hope to people that the projects will protect them from fire without providing the evidence to support their claims.  
“It’s a big smoke screen,” he said.
Bailey’s small community group celebrated a win in May. A federal court partially ruled in favor of an environmental group that had challenged the environmental assessment for another project the collaborative is working on, the 24,000-acre Twisp Restoration Project.
The court didn’t completely shut down the logging being done by Hampton Lumber, but paused it until the Forest Service could examine what cumulative effects the project might have on the landscape. The initial environmental assessment stated that the project would have “no substantial impact” on the environment. 
“It’s something,” Bailey said. “We will take it.”
But the timber industry also took it as a partial win. The ruling upheld “condition-based management,” the tool that was used to justify the increased logging for the Mission Project, setting an “excellent precedent,” Tom Partin, the president of the American Forest Resource Council, told fellow collaborative members during a meeting in June.
‘That’s a whole new variable’
Minbashian hasn’t completely lost faith in the collaborative process or the Forest Service. 
After her organization produced a monitoring report of the trees that were cut for the Mission Project, the Forest Service acknowledged that some of the logging didn’t go as planned and issued a statement in 2023 committing to making some changes going forward. 
Minbashian said since the Mission Project, she’s seen modest improvements on the ground. 
She’d still like more guardrails and transparency around the Forest Service’s reliance on logging plans that allow companies to decide in real-time which trees to cut, and clearer expectations for when large trees will be removed.
“Consistently, the way that the project is described in public documents and then the way it’s implemented is really different,” she said.
The lack of details in the plans makes it hard to compare what unfolds on the ground. “All the Forest Service does is say, ‘Oh, we’ll do better next time,’” Bailey said. “There’s nothing you can hold them to legally, that says you have to do something different than what you’ve been doing.” 
Minbashian’s organization is now working with the Forest Service to do baseline monitoring for the upcoming Twisp restoration project, in hopes that large trees are kept on the landscape and history doesn’t repeat itself. She still wants projects to succeed. 
“There’s a lot more components to it than just the commercial timber sale,” she said. “There’s road decommissioning and stream restoration, and understory thinning and all that to improve the damage that was done in the past.”
Minbashian understands where Bailey’s mistrust comes from. She feels it, too. But she thinks the people working locally with the Forest Service have good intentions, and she’s choosing to focus on that.
“You can say, well, of course, they did that. They’re the Forest Service; they’re going to have bad intentions,” she said, referring to the Mission Project. “Or you can say, well, there could be a variety of factors why it didn’t get implemented in the way we envisioned. And let’s look at that and what happened, and can we fix that going forward?”
“That’s just the approach we’ve decided to take, and we will see how it goes,” Minbashian said before pausing. “I think the folks who don’t see it that way may just think that this is another timber grab, and maybe it could be going forward under this new administration. That’s a whole new variable.”

Thousands of K-12 students in Detroit consistently miss days of school.
Chronic absenteeism is defined as missing at least 10% of school days – or 18 in a 180-day academic year. In Detroit, chronic absenteeism rose during the COVID-19 pandemic and remains a persistent challenge.
To encourage attendance, the Detroit Public Schools Community District is getting creative. This past year, Michigan’s largest school district awarded US$200 gift cards to nearly 5,000 high schoolers for attending all their classes during a two-week period, and Superintendent Nikolai Vitti also floated the idea of providing bikes to help students get to class. Some district students lack access to reliable transportation.
To understand the consequences of kids regularly missing school, The Conversation U.S. spoke with Sarah Lenhoff, associate professor of education at Wayne State University and director of the Detroit Partnership for Education Equity & Research, an education-focused research collaborative, and Jeremy Singer, an assistant professor of education at Wayne State University. Lenhoff and Singer wrote a book published in March about the socioeconomic drivers of chronic absenteeism in K-12 schools and how policymakers and communities, not just educators, can help.
Is chronic absenteeism the same as truancy?
No. Truancy is how schools have thought about and dealt with student attendance problems since the early days of public education in the United States in the 19th century and is still defined in state law across the country. It focuses on “unexcused” absences and compliance with mandatory school attendance laws. By contrast, chronic absenteeism includes any absence – whether “excused” or “unexcused” – because each absence can be consequential for student learning and development.
Chronic absenteeism is usually defined as missing 10% or more school days. The 10% threshold is somewhat arbitrary, since researchers know that the consequences of missing school accumulate with each day missed. But the specific definition of chronic absenteeism has been solidified in research and by policymakers. Most states now include a measure of chronic absenteeism in their education accountability systems.
How big of a problem is chronic absenteeism in Detroit’s K-12 public schools?
Detroit has among the highest chronic absenteeism rates in the country: more than 50% in recent school years. Prior to the pandemic, the average rate of chronic absenteeism nationwide was about 15%, and it was around 24% in 2024.
In one of our prior studies, we found Detroit’s chronic absenteeism rate was much higher than other major cities – even others with high absenteeism rates such as Milwaukee or Philadelphia.
This is related to the depth of social and economic inequalities that Detroit families face. Compared to other major cities, Detroit has higher rates of poverty, unemployment and crime. It has worse public health conditions. And even its winters are some of the coldest of major U.S. cities. All of these factors make it harder for kids to attend school.
Rates of chronic absenteeism spiked in Detroit during the COVID-19 pandemic, as they did statewide. The Detroit Public Schools Community District has come close to returning to its pre-pandemic levels of absenteeism. The rates were 66% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 62% in the school year right before the pandemic began, 2018-19.
Detroit’s charter schools have struggled more to bring down their chronic absenteeism rates post-pandemic, but the numbers are lower overall – 54% in the 2023-24 school year compared to 36% in 2018-19.
How does missing school affect students?
The connection between attendance and achievement is clear: Students who miss more school on average score worse on reading and math tests. As early as pre-K, being chronically absent is linked to lower levels of school readiness, both academically and behaviorally. By high school, students who miss more school tend to earn lower grades and GPAs and are less likely to graduate.
And it’s not just the absent students who are affected. When more kids in a class miss school regularly, that is associated with lower overall test scores and worse measures of skills such as executive functioning for other students in that class.
Does chronic absenteeism vary by family income or other factors?
Rates of chronic absenteeism are much higher among students from low-income families. In these cases, absenteeism is often driven by factors outside a student’s control such as unstable housing, unreliable transportation, health issues, lack of access to child care, or parents who work nontraditional hours. These challenges make it harder for students to get to school consistently, even when families are deeply committed to education.
School-based factors also influence attendance. Students are more likely to be chronically absent in schools with weaker relationships with families or a less positive school culture. However, even schools with strong practices may struggle if they serve communities facing deep socioeconomic hardship.
Ultimately, we don’t view chronic absenteeism as an issue of student motivation or family values. Rather, we see it as an issue related to the unequal conditions that shape students’ lives.
Does punishing absent kids or their parents work?
Many schools have suspended students for absences, or threatened their parents with fines or jail time. In some cases, families have lost social services due to their children’s chronic absenteeism.
Research shows these strategies are not only ineffective, they can make the problem worse.
For example, we found that when schools respond with punishment instead of support, they often alienate the very students and families who are already struggling to stay connected. Harsh responses can deepen mistrust between families and schools. When absences are treated as a personal failing caused by a lack of motivation or irresponsibility rather than symptoms of deeper challenges, students and parents may disengage further.
Instead, educators might ask: What’s getting in the way of consistent attendance, and how can we help? That shift from blame to understanding can help improve attendance.
What can policymakers, school districts and community organizations do to reduce chronic absenteeism?
Chronic absenteeism is a societal issue, not just a school problem. In other words, we need to recognize that chronic absenteeism is not a problem that schools can solve alone. While educators work to improve conditions within schools, policymakers and community leaders can take responsibility for the broader factors that influence attendance.
This could look like investing more resources and fostering collaboration across sectors such as health care, housing, transportation and social services to better support students and their families. Community organizations can play a role too, offering wraparound services such as mental health care, access to transportation, and after-school programming, all of which can support families. In the meantime, educators can focus on what they can control: strengthening communication with families, building supportive relationships and helping families connect with existing services that can remove attendance barriers.

(Frank van Manen/USGS)Here we go again.
The internet is abuzz with claims that animals are fleeing Yellowstone National Park and suggesting that the bears, elk and other creatures know something about Yellowstone’s volcanic system that humans don’t.
Hogwash.
The nonsense seems to have started on July 10, when a social media post suggested that “hundreds” of mountain lions were leaving Yellowstone National Park, heading south — never mind that there are only about 40 of those animals in the entire park. The video showed cougars walking on a snowy paved road, which is obviously not how Yellowstone looks in July.
A few days later, the rumors went into overdrive when the same account shared a video of bears walking past a few cars — the claim was, once again, that they were leaving Yellowstone. The animals were hugely fat and not behaving as they would in the wild, and the landscape and vegetation looked nothing like Yellowstone. Internet sleuths eventually traced the location of the video to a drive-through wildlife park in South Dakota.
Not that such inconsistencies mattered. Millions of people viewed the original post and the claims went viral, repeated and modified on numerous other platforms and made more and more fantastic and ominous. One post showed a herd of wildebeest crossing a river in Africa. It’s not clear if that post was trying to be sarcastic. Soon, even major media outlets were covering the “story,” and Yellowstone National Park staff members and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory Consortium scientists had to give interviews to counter the rumors.
The original post seems to have been a joke, but just like the children’s game of telephone, the more the story was retold, the more it was twisted.
The flames might have been fanned by this very Caldera Chronicles column, which on July 14, 2025, described the discovery of a new thermal feature in Norris Geyser Basin. That story, too, was picked up and reposted, but often with worrying overtones — for example, that scientists were supposedly “baffled” by the appearance of the new hot spring.
Maybe this is why all the bears were leaving Yellowstone? Except, of course, the spring at Norris Geyser Basin formed in December 2024, and several new features like that appear every year across the park — for example, the steaming vent near Nymph Lake between Norris Geyser Basin and Mammoth Hot Springs that formed in August 2024.
The myth that animals are leaving Yellowstone is nothing new. This rumor comes up every year or two, and sometimes, as in 2025, it grows to ridiculous proportions.

In 2014, an employee of a Yellowstone nonprofit organization filmed several bison running along a road and posted it online — he thought it was a fun video and not at all abnormal, given that bison are always running around Yellowstone National Park. But the video took on a life of its own, and it was reposted by people claiming the bison were running away from the park, even though they were actually running toward the park’s interior.
More than two weeks after the 2014 video was filmed, a M4.8 earthquake occurred near Norris Geyser Basin — the strongest earthquake in the region since 1975. This caused a further surge in claims that animals were running away, with some suggesting that the video of bison running was filmed after the earthquake because a volcanic eruption was imminent.

The speculation became so widespread that Yellowstone National Park put out a “rumor control” video explaining that, in fact, animals were not stampeding away from the park.
Earlier in 2025 a social media site known for satirical content showed a doctored photo of dozens of bears sitting on a road, supposedly in Yellowstone, and saying that the animals were blocking the entrances. Some bears were even carrying crudely drawn signs. Most people got the joke, but misleading reposts of the story caused concern among some who thought the animals knew something we didn’t.
Because of its incredible natural history and environment, Yellowstone can inspire our imagination. Where else but America’s first national park could you take in a view shaped by massive volcanic eruptions and featuring some of the country’s most iconic wildlife?
Perhaps, then, it is not a surprise that fantastic stories sometimes accompany this fantastic landscape. But the next time you hear that animals are, once again, fleeing Yellowstone in droves, we would suggest a healthy dose of skepticism. At least until those bears with signs learn to write more legibly, anyway.

A recently signed New Hampshire law will require doctors to follow patients’ wishes with regard to voluntary sterilization. (Photo by Getty Images)New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.
It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.
Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

When President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, he gave state leaders — not federal regulators — the power to decide whether and how to participate in the first-ever national tax credit scholarship program.
That decision now looms largest in blue states, where Democratic governors and lawmakers must weigh whether to reject the law outright on ideological grounds — or try to reshape it into something that reflects their own values.
“This isn’t the federal voucher program we were worried about five years ago,” said Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the left-leaning Brookings Institution who testified before Congress on earlier versions of the bill. “It still has serious problems — but states now have tools to mold it into something they might actually support.”
The final law gives states wide discretion, he said. They can opt out entirely. They can opt in passively, leaving the program to operate as written. Or, as Valant suggests, they can try to redraw its footprint — focusing less on private school tuition and more on public school supports like tutoring, transportation and enrichment services in underserved districts.
“My hope is that blue states take a hard look and ask: Can this be used to address our own needs?”
For progressives and education advocates who are wary of school vouchers, the decision is fraught. Opting in could draw criticism for approving what many see as a vehicle for privatization of K-12 education. But opting out could mean turning down federal dollars — education money that states with budding or robust private school voucher infrastructures, such as Arizona and Florida, will gladly take.
Idaho Gov. Brad Little signs law that directs state funds to private school tuition

“There’s money on the table, and it can be used for more than just private school tuition,” Valant said. “If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.”
Since 2020, private school choice programs — once limited to low-income or special needs students — have rapidly expanded.
In 2023, $6.3 billion was spent nationwide on private school choice programs — less than 1% of total public K-12 operational spending, according to EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures. From 2023-24 to 2024-25, participation in universal private school choice programs surged nearly 40%, growing from roughly 584,000 to 805,000 students in just one school year.
By 2026-27, about half of all U.S. students will be eligible, according to estimates by FutureEd, an independent think tank at Georgetown University.
These trends, combined with new federal tax credit, could fundamentally reshape the education funding landscape across state governments, experts say.
“States will need to decide whether to encourage the redirection of funding to support private and religious schools — either by expanding existing voucher programs or, if they don’t have one, by introducing such a program for the first time,” said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. The group opposes the national voucher plan.

 States without programs face rollout decisions without clear federal guidance, advocates say

As of this May, 21 states operated tax credit scholarship programs with varying degrees of funding and oversight. According to the EdChoice Friedman Index, the states of Florida, Arkansas, Arizona and Alabama rank highest in private school access, with 100% of students eligible for school choice programs.
Administrative costs for Idaho’s private school tax credit rise to $675,000

Some states, like Florida and Arizona, already have extensive tax credit scholarship systems. Others, including Texas, are building new infrastructure such as statewide voucher programs and education savings accounts, known as ESAs.
States with no current programs face decisions about participation, regulation and equity, but without clear federal guardrails, education advocates told Stateline.
The federal policy builds on existing state-level tax credit scholarship programs — such as Alabama’s — but significantly expands eligibility, removes scholarship caps and broadens allowable uses to include not just tuition, but also tutoring, therapy, transportation and academic support services. Beginning in 2027, scholarships will be excluded from federal taxable income.
Valant, of Brookings, told Stateline that some of his initial concerns were addressed in the version of the bill signed into law.
“There was a very realistic scenario in the earlier version of the bill where a small number of very wealthy people could essentially make money off this,” Valant said. “That was mostly addressed.”
The enacted version eliminates stock donations and caps individual tax credits at $1,700. And with states that opt in having the power to shape their own program, Valant said that gives them the chance to establish their own guardrails, such as income eligibility caps or nondiscrimination policies for participating schools.










If blue states want to keep that money from reinforcing inequality, they’ll have to get creative, and act fast.


– Jon Valant, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution


The scholarship-granting organizations, known as SGOs, would then be subject to new state regulations about where the money can go.
“States could say SGOs can’t give money to schools that discriminate based on sexual orientation. … There’s quite a lot of room here for state regulation,” he said.
Looking ahead, Valant said he’ll be watching how states interpret their regulatory powers — and how effective scholarship-granting organizations are at fundraising under the new rules, which prohibit large stock gifts and rely instead on millions of smaller donations.
“Now it’s a strange pitch: ‘Can you front me $300 to give to the SGO? I swear the IRS will give it back,’” he said. “It’s going to take time to figure out how to sell this to families.”
Concerns over transparency and equity remain. The program allows donors, scholarship-granting organizations and families to direct funds with little public accountability, critics say. And in states without robust oversight, Valant warns that funds could be misused — or channeled to institutions that exclude students based, for example, on identity or beliefs about sexual orientation.
He also emphasized that early participation is likely to skew toward families already in private schools, particularly in wealthier ZIP codes — mirroring patterns seen in programs in Arizona, Florida and Georgia.
“One big risk is that the funds will disproportionately flow to wealthier families — just like we’ve seen in many ESA programs,” Valant said.
 What do these programs look like across the country?

FutureEd studied eight states — Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia — where 569,000 students participated in school choice programs at a cost to taxpayers of $4 billion in 2023-24.
The FutureEd analysis found significant differences among the states in design, funding and oversight.
Arizona’s ESA program was the first of its kind in 2011, and also the first to shift toward universal eligibility in 2022.
Florida operated the largest and most expensive program, with broad eligibility, no caps or accreditation requirements, and a major influx of higher-income families, though it mandated some university-led performance reviews. Iowa fully funded ESAs and, like other states, saw mostly existing private school families benefit.
New national school voucher program included in ‘big, beautiful’ law, with no cap on cost

Arkansas had a cautious rollout due to legal delays and geographic clustering of participants, while West Virginia allowed spending across state lines with no performance reporting.
Newcomer North Carolina began with income-based prioritization but quickly expanded under political pressure or demand, while Alabama and Louisiana will launch ESA programs in 2025-26 using general state revenues.
Utah enacted a universal voucher program in 2023, providing up to $8,000 per student for private school or homeschool expenses. A state teachers union sued, arguing that participating schools were not “free and open to all children” and that the program diverted public school funds. A state court this April ruled the program was unconstitutional.
As the new federal law opens the door for tax-credit-funded tuition support, Texas is building its first universal school voucher program, aided through ESAs to begin in the 2026-27 school year. The program is funded with $1 billion over two years, with $10,000-$11,000 per student — up to $30,000 for students with disabilities and $2,000 for homeschoolers.
The Texas comptroller will oversee the program, and private schools must be open for at least two years to be eligible for funds.
Voucher programs can drain state budgets, and budget wonks predict the cost for Texas could rise to around $4.8 billion by 2030, The Texas Tribune reported.
A spokesperson for the Texas comptroller’s office said that details are still being finalized; the state has issued a request for proposals due Aug. 4 to select eligible educational assistance organizations that would help funnel scholarship dollars to schools.
Other states may be more cautious. The Missouri National Education Association filed a lawsuit this summer to block $51 million in state appropriations to private school scholarships through the MOScholars program. The suit argues that using general revenue rather than private donations violates the state constitution and undermines public education funding.

Democrats will fight it, but a united Republican majority with more than two-thirds of the seats in both chambers can force it through if they wish.
Missouri Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, speaking Friday on KSSZ-93.9 in Columbia, said it is “likely” that lawmakers will be called in. She was in Jefferson City for discussions about a special session, but she had seen no map proposals and was unsure on the timing.
She first heard that President Donald Trump was urging Republicans to redistrict the state from discussion of social media posts by Republican members of Congress, O’Laughlin said.
“Lots of things run downhill,” O’Laughlin said. “So I thought, ‘well, this will be ending up in our neighborhood here before long.’ And it has.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe would need to convene a special session. His office did not respond to an email inquiry asking for comment on Friday.
In a little more than a week, the idea of redrawing Missouri’s congressional district lines has gained enough momentum to seem inevitable, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Kansas City Democrat, said in an interview with The Independent.
Republican members are “gung-ho,” she said, while Democrats are looking for ways to derail it. The chances of that are slim, she added.
“I’m kind of just waiting, I suppose, but I fully expect it to happen,” Aune said. “Everyone I’ve talked to, especially on my side of the aisle, expects to go down and get steamrolled on the issue during a special session.”

Missouri has eight seats in the U.S. House, six held by Republicans and two held by Democrats — the same total and partisan division it has had since a seat was lost after the 2010 census. Of the eight members, only U.S. Rep. Ann Wagner, a St. Louis County Republican, has won with less than 60% support in the two elections since the maps were redrawn to reflect the 2020 census.
Wagner represents the 2nd District, which has portions of St. Louis, St. Charles and adjacent counties.
The target for Republicans is the 5th District, held since 2005 by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat. He won his two most recent elections with 61% in 2022 and 60% last year. The two adjacent districts, the 4th and the 6th, are held by Republican U.S. Reps. Mark Alford and Sam Graves, who each received more than 70% of the vote for the past two elections.
A major hurdle for any special session on redistricting is that it will have a purely partisan intent, to gain an advantage for the Republican Party. This year saw a major break between Republicans and Democrats in the state Senate when partisan priorities were slammed through with a motion, rarely used in the upper chamber, to shut off debate.
The previous question, or PQ, was invoked to overturn the voter-passed initiative providing minimum standards for paid sick leave at most businesses and to send voters a constitutional amendment repealing the abortion rights measure approved in November.
It would almost certainly have to be used again to bring a redistricting bill to a vote because, otherwise, Democrats could use the rules that put no limit on how long a member can hold the floor to block it.
After the Senate adjourned at the regular session, Democrats vowed to punish Republicans by clogging up the chamber so little work can be accomplished as a way to prevent a repetition. State Sen. Stephen Webber, a Columbia Democrat, forced Republicans to bring 17 senators from their homes in late May for what was supposed to be a largely ceremonial day of final paperwork from the session.
A truce of sorts prevailed in the Senate during a special session in June that approved stadium financing for professional sports teams and aid to storm victims in St. Louis. 
A redistricting special session would 
 “The point is to discourage future PQs and get us back on track to functioning and working together,” Webber said. “The more times that the process is abused, probably the stronger the correction has to be, which would mean that, for a larger correction, you need more consequence, more intervention.”
Some Republicans aren’t enthusiastic about redistricting now. The only time Missouri lawmakers have revised maps between census-determined allocations was in the 1960s following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that districts must be nearly equal in population.
State Sen. Mike Moon, a Republican from Ash Grove, in 2022 was an enthusiastic supporter of drawing a map that made it likely Republicans would win seven of the state’s seats. He’s not sure he wants to vote for a bill to do that now.
“I started thinking about, what if the tables were turned and the Democrats had the majority?” Moon said. “If we’re honest with ourselves, I would say that we would not want the tables turned the other way. And you won’t get many people to say that publicly.”
The other danger, House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowling Green said, is that voters the GOP takes for granted may not be so firm.
“I don’t know that a 7-1 map ever existed,” Perkins said. “I think a 7-1 map is easily a 5-3 map in a year that doesn’t go the way that conservatives want it to go.”
State Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, said that is not something that worries him. Schroer, the leader of the Missouri Freedom Caucus, said he wants to change district lines on the eastern side of the state as well, to put all of St. Charles County into the 2nd District with portions of St. Louis County. 
But cutting off discussion won’t make next year worse, he said.
“It’s politics. You’re going to have fighting no matter what. You’re going to have some strange moments,” Schroer said. “But look, the use of the PQ is not a new thing. I mean, it comes and goes. It’s like a roller coaster.”
Texas lawmakers are in special session looking at redrawing districts in that state to give Republicans an additional five seats. Democratic governors in California, Illinois and New Jersey have suggested they would do the same in response.
 Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowing Green speaks during debate Feb. 11 on his bill exempting capital gains from the state income tax (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
If Missouri Democrats are upset about a new redistricting plan at home, they should also be saying Democratic states shouldn’t do it, either, Perkins said.
“To someone on the left, your fury and outrage needs to be directed equally to Illinois and California for doing the same thing,” Perkins said
Vice President J.D. Vance, in a social media post, attacked the way California is currently drawn.
“The gerrymander in California is outrageous. Of their 52 congressional districts, 9 of them are Republican. That means 17 percent of their delegation is Republican when Republicans regularly win 40 percent of the vote in that state,” Vance wrote. “How can this possibly be allowed?”
In the November election, no Democrat running statewide received less than 37.9% of the vote, and Democrats hold 25% of the U.S. House seats, which would fall to 12.5% if the 5th District became Republican.
Vance’s criticism of California could be applied to Missouri, Perkins said.
“Do I think that it’s ethical to be the same across the board, to have your opinion applied the same to all things?,” he said. “Yeah, I think it probably is right.”
With Republicans holding a slim majority in the U.S. House, Republicans at the state level have a responsibility to their voters to do what they can to shore it up, Schroer said.
“It’d be a disservice to them to not revisit this issue to see if we can make the manual cleaver spot a competitive seat,” Schroer said.
O’Laughlin, in the radio interview, said she understands the criticism from Democrats.
“The biggest concern that people have, first of all, is that the Senate doesn’t like to do something out of the ordinary like that, because it’s viewed as just not listening to the other side, not working with other people,” O’Laughlin said. “And I understand why they would feel that way.”
But with Democratic states preparing to redistrict, she said, Republicans need to rally to protect the Trump presidency and what they view as its achievements.
If Kehoe issues the call, Democrats intend to paint him as Trump’s puppet.
“I don’t think anybody that I’m aware of was talking about redrawing maps in the middle of the census until Trump started pushing it,” Webber said.
In a video shared on social media by the Missouri Democratic Party, Webber bluntly assessed the push for redistricting as a distraction from the biggest issue plaguing the president right now, the demands from his supporters to release files on child sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein.
“This entire thing is to make sure there (are) not investigations into the Epstein files,” Webber said. “Because if you’re a pedophile that raped kids on Epstein island, the biggest winner of this would be those people.”
Aune, who said Moon’s comments give her a small hope Republicans will resist Trump’s demands, said Kehoe’s actions will show who he is.
“Who needs a governor,” Aune said, “and even who needs a Republican super-majority legislature, when we have daddy Trump in the White House pulling the strings?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012424_olaughlin1-1024x713.jpg,,,2025-08-02 06:56:32.988249

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)To me, our government has become more and more out of step with the general public every year. At both the federal and state levels, legislatures are passing laws that face big public opposition while ignoring policies that have supermajority public support. 
If our government is supposed to reflect the will of the people, it’s clearly failing.
Our plurality elections are a big reason for this failure. Even though it’s all we’ve really used in Kansas, plurality is not benign or neutral. I believe it actually harms most voters. It works to shut out those who are in the opposition. It also harms voters in safe districts by denying them a voice. Their representative has been chosen long before any votes have been cast. Plurality elections are also very easy to gerrymander, as we see in each redistricting cycle.
Is this the best way to choose our representatives? To minimize the number of votes that actually make a difference? I understand why some may support plurality if they believe it best advances their interests, but I like to think that most people agree that the current way of doing things is fundamentally unfair.
One’s opinion on a voting system is a moral choice as much as it can be a strategic one. This is why I advocate for proportional representation in our elections. Such a system allocates seats by vote share, so parties will still gain seats in districts where they are in the minority. This does a better job of electing bodies that reflect the priorities of the entire electorate, and not only the whims of one group. If the goal of our government is to give all voters an equal voice, then proportional representation will get us much closer to that ideal than plurality.
Of course, there are high barriers to passing election reform. The largest beneficiaries of plurality are our elected officials and their donors. Even if they don’t explicitly say it, they have a great motivation to keep things the way they are. I can understand why representatives in safe districts wouldn’t want more competition for their seats, but I also think that it says a lot about their character that they’d rather benefit from a broken system than use their power to fix it.
There are some politicians who support reform, but they are in the minority. In Kansas, former Republican state Sen. John Doll is one such supporter. In the 2023 session, he introduced Senate Bill 202. This bill would have allowed proportional representation in our state using ranked ballots, but it died without a hearing. His party colleagues then went on to ban ranked ballots this year so local governments couldn’t adopt that reform themselves.
With these barriers in mind, I went looking for historical examples of election reform to understand how they succeeded. In our original Kansas constitution, the state House was apportioned such that every county had a minimum of one seat. By the 1950s, a report by professor C. Stewart Boertman of Emporia State showed that this created a massive malapportionment between the rural and urban areas.
From the report: “For Greeley county one representative represents 1,966 persons; for Sedgwick one representative represents 85,620 persons. Thus, if Greeley county receives one member for about 2,000 persons, Sedgwick should have approximately 128 representatives.”
Today, our state House seats are apportioned into districts of roughly equal population. I wish I could share an uplifting story in which our representatives put aside their self-interest and came together to pass a constitutional amendment, but that’s not what happened. It was the U.S. Supreme Court’s “one person, one vote” rulings in the 1960s that first forced the state to reapportion the House by population.
That isn’t to say that there was no advocacy for reform, as there certainly was. Most notably, the Hutchinson News won a Pulitzer Prize in 1965 for its years-long campaign “to bring about more equitable reapportionment of the Kansas Legislature, despite powerful opposition in its own community”. When the Legislature finally got around to amending our constitution to align with the ruling, voters easily approved the measure.
Does this mean we’d need to wait for another favorable Supreme Court ruling for further election reform? Thankfully, no. Ordinary people still have the agency to make this change happen. Canadian political scientist Dennis Pilon found that significant election reform in western countries most often happens as a result of multi-party agreements. The motivations for this agreement could be different – some parties may want reform as it aligns with their principles, while others may see it as a hedge against a total loss of power.
If proportional representation becomes a reality, it would come from popular support for the issue. It would come by elevating politicians who support reform and drive their parties to adopt the policy as a plank in their platform. It would come from sustained advocacy from the media and grassroots organizations.
The moment for reform might come when those who currently work to maintain the status quo end up getting burned by plurality’s failings. As political scientist Lee Drutman suggests, if Elon Musk’s America Party spoils a handful of Congressional elections in 2026 then that could create more of an appetite for reform at the national level. Or perhaps the proposed mid-decade gerrymander by Republicans backfires and leads to them losing seats overall. Whatever the case, proportional representation must be part of the conversation when that moment comes.

Shown is the downtown Lincoln campus of Southeast Community College. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)The U.S. bioeconomy is driven by access to domestic feedstocks and our ability to successfully convert those feedstocks into the manufactured goods that we use every day. America’s heartland is a rich source of these feedstocks — including corn, soybeans, and sugar beets — that can be used by bioindustrial manufacturers to realize the promise of the bioeconomy.
Specifically, Nebraska has abundant natural resources and a strong, capable, resilient, workforce. Gov. Jim Pillen has said, “The biobased economy is gigantic for the future. It’s [Nebraska’s] Silicon Valley.”
While the U.S. tries to reach its full potential of this bioeconomy, many factors have fallen into place that could allow Nebraska to emerge as a leader, including political support, government and private sector funding and workforce development. Growing the bioeconomy is a state priority, and Lincoln-based Southeast Community College (SCC) is working to help meet the current and future demands of our state.
SCC serves a primarily rural 15-county area in southeast Nebraska, including the future home of Citroniq Chemicals’ decarbonized plastics production facility, the largest in the world. To ensure our workforce is adequately prepared, SCC in 2021 launched a new biotechnology program featuring three stackable credentials to prepare the next generation of skilled technicians to work in the industry.
Students acquire industry-relevant skills, along with the knowledge of how to work in a regulated environment. Twice a year, industry professionals provide input on the most relevant skills they hope new employees hold — to ensure that graduates fit industry needs. Furthermore, SCC’s programs ensure that agreements are in place and that courses remain transferable to 4-year institutions, so that education opportunities can extend beyond a 2-year degree for those who want them.
Another key priority has been to ensure that a full pipeline has been built from middle school through graduate school, resulting in key partnerships with educational institutions and industry partners.
One success has been the development of an industry-relevant citizen science research project that links dog genetics to attachment behavior. SCC’s industry partner Neogen runs an animal genomics facility, also located in Lincoln, and many graduates of this program have gone on to lead successful careers at the site.
Furthermore, middle and high school teachers have been trained in summer workshops onsite at Neogen. During the school year, teachers are supported with equipment, materials and in-person assistance as they incorporate the research project into their classes. Career awareness helps expose teachers and students to the breadth of careers available in the bioeconomy. From the network of over 40 teachers trained, many are interested in adding more biotechnology to their current courses, as well as dual credit biotechnology courses. SCC is working to expand our capabilities and this network of teachers.
Collaborating with industry partners in the development of relevant curriculum is also a feature of SCC’s work. In partnership with Bluestem Biosciences and their recently funded BioMADE project to scale up production of bioacrylates, SCC is creating a module of related bioindustrial manufacturing curriculum. This will include study materials, assignments, and assessments designed to expand resources for community college programs in bioindustrial manufacturing.
This initiative supports Bluestem’s commitment to leveraging existing bioethanol assets in the Midwest, which includes cultivating workforce talent. The curriculum will provide an engaging introduction to fermentation and purification of organic acids, life cycle assessment and environmental justice.
It will also be crafted to resonate with Gen Z and Gen Alpha students and to align with best practices in educational content creation. The approach fits with BioMADE’s efforts to equip the next generation of technicians, engineers, entrepreneurs and plant operators.
Lastly, SCC has partnered with trade organization Bio Nebraska in its Fermentation Collaborative that seeks to increase collaboration between industry and educational institutions to improve opportunities for seamless work between 2- and 4-year institutions and raise awareness of the usefulness of precision fermentation. These collaborations have led to more connections with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, allowing for more opportunities for SCC students to engage in summer research and improved transfer opportunities.
Collectively, this work demonstrates the important role of community colleges in ensuring industry needs are met in the short term while also facilitating long-term partnerships that lead to future gains for a trained workforce. There are opportunities to participate in STEM careers at all education levels. Together, this will bring bio-based solutions to global problems.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska lawmakers prepare to convene back at the Alaska State Capitol on Saturday for a special session, on the agenda for lawmakers is a vote on whether to override a veto by Gov. Mike Dunleavy of a portion of the state budget.
If the veto is overridden, the Legislature would provide more than $50.6 million for K-12 schools this year. 
The vote comes just weeks before the start of the school year, and many Alaska school officials say the funding is essential for education, from managing class sizes, to hiring or keeping teachers and staff, academic and enrichment programs, as well as maintaining stability for students.
Fairbanks North Star Borough School District Superintendent Luke Meinert called the impacts of “chronic underfunding” devastating for the district’s more than 12,000 students. “In the last five years, we’ve closed seven schools, reduced administrative staffing by 25% and eliminated more than 250 positions in our district,” he said. “These aren’t just numbers. These are real people who spend time with our students every day.”
For Fairbanks, the governor’s budget veto represented a $2.5 million shortfall in June, following months of grappling with a $16.5 million deficit, and cuts and closures of three schools this year. 
Meinert called for adequate funding for schools that keeps up with the costs of inflation.

“Instead, we’ve been forced to make painful cut after painful cut, classrooms are more crowded than ever. Support services are reduced, and many students have lost access to critical programs that once supported them,” he said. “These cuts are not a sign of inefficiencies, they’re symptoms of a system in crisis.” 
Meinert joined a group of superintendents, education advocates and students on the steps of the Capitol in Juneau on Friday to urge legislators to vote “yes” on the veto override on Saturday, and funding a $700 increase in per student funding for schools. 
Siena Farr, a rising senior at Juneau-Douglas High School: Yadaa.at Kalé, spoke about her experience last year when Juneau’s two high schools combining into just one, doubling class sizes and straining teachers. “In my first week of school, my AP US History class had 50 students,” she said, which would have violated fire safety limits. “This ultimately led to 10 students willingly devaluing their education and switching to a less challenging class. … Increased funding would mean more teachers to teach high demand classes and cover for other teachers who might need it.”

Ida Meyer, a recent high school graduate in Juneau, said the increasing cost burden on students ultimately leaves some out. “When students have to constantly fundraise and pay out of their own pockets to be able to participate and travel for sports and activities or even buy school supplies that were once paid for by school funding, the equity of education has been left behind, along with the students that are unable to participate and reap the benefits of school activities,” she said.
Dunleavy issued budget vetoes in June, axing $200 per student from the base student allocation, which is the core of the state’s funding formula. This reduced the annual increase to a $500 per student, which was less than a one-time boost last year. The governor cited declining state revenues, as well his position that his priorities for education policy changes should be enacted ahead of more state funding. 
On Friday, Dunleavy issued a statement calling the Legislature’s lack of attention on his policy changes “a shame.” He repeated his criticism of providing more funding without more progress on education outcomes. “Instead, the public discourse is all about money. They say if we only spent more of it, the scores would improve. That is the same excuse that has been made for decades. As soon as more money is approved, the special interest groups and unions get very quiet.”
After the governor’s veto, the amount of public-school funding through the base student allocation is 5.6% less than it was last year, a year-over-year funding cut, according to the Legislative Finance Division. That is due to the loss of the one-time funding.
The governor’s veto represented a $1.4 million loss in funding for Juneau schools and its more than 3,800 students, according to the district, roughly equal to the cost of employing 12 teachers. But district officials had budgeted for a $400 base student allocation increase, so were safeguarded against further cuts.
In an interview on Monday, Juneau School District Superintendent Frank Hauser said he supports the veto override, and noted that even a $700 per student increase does not cover Alaska schools’ costs of inflation. “What a lot of people don’t realize is, well, that’s one of the most significant increases to the base student allocation that public education has received since 2011. It’s still a cut from what was received as one-time funding the previous year,” he said. “Public education funding is not keeping up with inflationary pressures across the state.”
If funding is restored, Hauser said it will go toward classrooms. “It’s going to support, potentially, reducing the pupil-teacher ratio. It’s going to provide maybe those elective programs. Some school districts weren’t able to hire a music teacher or an art teacher, or some other language teacher. That is funding that will go directly to supporting students.”
Hauser added that hiring new teachers or previously laid-off teachers back this time of year is difficult. “The hiring season is December to February,” he said. “So you just don’t have the staff or the potential applicant pool.”
Kuspuk School District Superintendent Madeline Aguillard emphasized her district’s need for school building repairs and major maintenance, which has received national attention, as the Legislature and Dunleavy have approved minimal funding for maintenance.
“No school district should have to choose between replacing a 10-year-old curriculum or repairing fire sprinklers to keep schools safe. But that’s the impossible choice districts are facing every day because the state has failed to meet its constitutional obligation over the last 25 years,” she said. 
This year, the Legislature passed about $40 million for school maintenance and construction, about 5% of the nearly $800 million that districts say they need to operate safely. Dunleavy vetoed nearly $28 million. Aguillard says it forces rural districts to draw from base student allocation funding meant for classrooms. “When the governor’s budget is consistently zero for maintenance, and what little funding the Legislature secures gets vetoed, then crumbling schools become the norm, not the exception,” she said. “We’re now forced to pull from the BSA to make major repairs.”
It’s unclear whether the Legislature will take up a veto override vote on school maintenance funding on Saturday. 
The Anchorage School District is the state’s largest by population, serving more than 43,000 students. For the district, the governor’s veto represents $4.3 million. Earlier this year, the Anchorage district reduced its budget by $30 million in salaries, benefits and services, and cut 42 staff positions. 
In an interview on July 18, Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt said if the funding is restored, it would go toward a major priority for the district: lowering class sizes. 
“When I talk to families, they say that the best thing we can do for their kid is to lower their class sizes,” he said. “But the state has to remember, you can’t lower class size if your teachers don’t trust your state to fund their salaries. And salaries should only be funded from the base student allocation. You can’t fund that with a block grant. You can’t fund that with a promise, and you certainly can’t fund that with all of the negativity that we’ve been seeing from the state to date.”
Bryantt emphasized that the back and forth between the Legislature and Dunleavy on school funding, with vetoes and override votes over the last several months, has been challenging. “So I just want the legislators to understand how trust has been extremely eroded by state leaders,” Bryantt said. “And this is their moment to make it right. This is their moment to tell the governor, once again, that this is where our community stands on this issue.”
For the Valdez School District, Superintendent Jason Weber said the district was able to balance its budget this year, with some cuts and reserve funding, despite an unexpected $300,000 insurance premium increase. In an interview Friday, he said if the veto is overridden, he sees those funds going toward future costs. 
“Unfortunately, inflation will eat right back in, whether it’s employee salaries going up, which they are, you know, where we’re bound by negotiated agreements, as well as … rising cost of utilities and insurance,” he said.
“So even if we’re on fiscally this year, we will be off fiscally next year already, just because those costs escalations are beyond our control.”

Philip Chad Wilson was sentenced to a 99-year sentence after his conviction and argued that  under subsequent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court and the Alaska Court of Appeals, his sentence was illegal because it amounted to a de facto sentence of life without parole.
On Friday, the Alaska Court of Appeals upheld a lower court ruling that rejected his argument, noting that Wilson could receive discretionary parole by the time he turns 50 years old.
Alaska’s parole board granted only about one-third of requests for discretionary parole last year, and Wilson had argued that the parole board’s approval rate is so low that it doesn’t amount to a meaningful opportunity for release.
In 2020 and 2021, the appeals court approved fewer than one in five requests for discretionary parole. Those rates were significantly lower than historical standards; during the administrations of former Govs. Sean Parnell and Bill Walker, the parole board approved more than half of all discretionary parole requests each year.
“We conclude that Wilson’s challenges to the Alaska Parole Board’s procedures are premature because he has not yet gone through a parole hearing. And we hold that 33 years of incarceration is not a de facto life sentence,” wrote Judge Timothy Terrell, an appointee of Gov. Mike Dunleavy, on behalf of the court. 
In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Eighth Amendment prohibits courts from sentencing children to life in prison without the possibility of parole, except in homicide cases.
Two years ago, the state appeals court ruled that the Alaska Constitution imposes further limits on top of those provided by the U.S. Constitution.
In that case, which involved a 14-year-old girl who pleaded no contest to three murders, the appeals court found that any sentence “that (requires) a juvenile offender to serve 45 years or more in prison before any type of parole release qualifies as a de facto life sentence.”
In Wilson’s case, a superior court judge ruled that because Wilson could receive parole after 33 years, his appeal fails the appeals court’s test.
Writing Friday, the appeals court said that multiple state supreme courts and legislatures have allowed children to be sentenced to 33 years or more in prison before parole. Wilson’s sentence is not unusual in that regard, it wrote.
With regard to the parole board’s performance, the court wrote, “Wilson’s statistics showing that the Board has granted parole to a minority of applicants in recent years does not prevent the Board from granting parole to any given applicant.”
Writing an amendment to the ruling, Terrell added that if the parole board were to postpone a parole hearing for Wilson and for similar child offenders, it “would be legally problematic … because this may extend their sentence to a length that could make it a de facto sentence of life without parole. I assume that the Parole Board will give full consideration to the applications of such offenders when they first apply for discretionary parole.”

As galling as it has been to watch a Jacksonville sheriff’s deputy break a car window and punch a non-combative man in the face, the feeble justification from the sheriff and a determination from the state attorney that cops did nothing wrong is just as infuriating.
The Feb. 19 videotape of an encounter with William McNeil, Jr. and a posse of rogue officers from the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, and their brutal response, is a searing reminder of everything wrong with policing in America.
These officers appear to have forgotten that they are supposed to “protect and serve” the communities they police. Rather than being respectful in their dealings with members of the community, too many times, those in uniform operate as if the people work for them. Because of their mindset, they operate as an occupying force that has to subdue a hostile populace.
In a recent press conference held to react to a videotape that captured the police assault of McNeil, Sheriff T.K. Waters was defensive. He refused to condemn his officers’ egregious behavior and, in a move right out of the victim-blaming handbook, had the temerity to question why McNeil released the video five months after the incident and concluded that he intended to inflame the public.
Waters was probably embarrassed because his men look like neanderthals who escalated a situation for no reason other than to show who was in control. I’m glad that the confrontation did not end with McNeil shot, injured, maybe dying on the street, because a cop “feared for his life.” This happens much more frequently than we are willing to admit.
 Troubled relationship
The relationship between African Americans and law enforcement has always been fraught with suspicion and hostility. America has never come to terms with policing’s slave origins and racially troubling past, their earlier role in controlling the movements of enslaved African Americans and the current role of monitoring the movements and activities of Black people, the poor, and working class.
The American Bar Association discusses the deep ties between chattel slavery and American law enforcement.
“American policing has deep historical roots in the system of slavery, with early forms of law enforcement in the Southern states, known as slave patrols, established to control enslaved populations and maintain the institution of slavery. These patrols were authorized to enforce slave codes, apprehend escaped slaves, and suppress potential revolts, using methods of terror and violence.
Waters claims there’s more to the story than the cellphone video that went viral. The sheriff warned against “a rush to judgment,” but McNeil’s lawyers, famed civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump and Harry Daniels, said the video captures a clear and compelling case of police brutality.
“He didn’t do anything but suffered tremendously. He suffered very significant injuries, including memory loss and closed head injuries,” said Daniels. “We’re seeking justice and legal redress. We’re planning on filing a lawsuit and doing everything to achieve justice in this matter.
“The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is unhinged. We’re pursuing all actions to achieve accountability and responsibility for what these rogue cops did.”
Daniels told News4JAX that McNeil’s injuries included a chipped tooth and concussion, adding that he needed stitches.
“This is one of these days that we have echoed over and over that the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office is out of control. This is not a one-off. This is a systematic continuum of assault on folk in Jacksonville,”
 ‘Things we need to look at’
The police report of the traffic stop said McNeil was ‘verbally combative’ and reached towards a knife that was in the vehicle. Waters said McNeil was charged with resisting an officer without violence, driving on a suspended license, and possession of less than 20 grams of marijuana.
When asked by a reporter about the first punch that a cop standing by the door threw, Waters said it wasn’t a sucker punch.
“I’m not excusing it administratively. There are things we need to look at. The context of this video should tell you everything you need to know. It is what it is,” Waters said during the press conference. The video “provides a lot of information to the public. You’re not allowed to resist a police officer when he’s doing his lawful duties. It’s necessary to get you under control and take you into custody.”
According to ABC News, “in the video, officers with the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office say they pulled McNeil over because the vehicle’s headlights were not on. McNeil questioned the traffic stop because it wasn’t raining and it was still light outside.
“An officer, who cannot be seen in the video, is heard saying, ‘It doesn’t matter, you’re still required to have headlights on.’ An officer asks McNeil to step out of the car, and when McNeil asks for the officer’s supervisor, another officer punches the driver’s window until it shatters. The officer then punches McNeil in the head before unlocking the vehicle door, unbuckling his seatbelt and forcibly removing him from the driver’s seat.
“Once out of the vehicle, multiple officers then gather around McNeil. One officer is seen grabbing McNeil’s head and punching him in the chin before forcing him to the ground.
 Unenviable task
Daniels wrote in a news release on Sunday that this incident is “only the latest in a long line of excessive force incidents involving the JSO.”
“In September 2023, the department was the focus of a national outcry after a video of JSO officers violently beating 24-year-old Le’Keian Woods while he was unarmed went viral,” Daniels explained. “In 2019, JSO officers faced a federal lawsuit for killing 22-year-old Jamee Johnson after pulling him over for an alleged seat belt violation,” the attorney said.
It’s clear that if there were no video, Sheriff Waters would have leaned on the fact that an internal “investigation” cleared the officers involved.
Waters explained that he was “aware of a video circulating on social media showing a traffic stop represented to be from February 19, 2025. … We have launched an internal investigation into it and the circumstances surrounding this incident. We hold our officers to the highest standards and are committed to thoroughly determining exactly what occurred.”
Yeah, right.
Waters, police brass, and civic leaders have the unenviable task of rebuilding public trust. But we shouldn’t hold our breaths because we’ve seen this before. There is a critical need for oversight by the public and civil society to investigate and prosecute cases of racial profiling and widespread abuses of power including use of excessive force, brutalizing protesters, bystanders, and others exercising their constitutional right to free speech and dissent.
But that is not happening.
 Clear and present danger
Law enforcement in the 18,000 police departments and across history in America has proven to be a clear and present danger to African Americans, Native Americans, Latinos, and other non-white people. Given DeSantis’ his record, and past comments, Floridians shouldn’t be holding their breath for him to use the considerable power entrusted in him to attempt to level the playing field and hold law enforcement more accountable.
Asking law enforcement to police itself is like inviting wolves into the henhouse. It never ends well.
I interviewed retired Seattle Washington Police Chief Norm Stamper, a fierce critic of modern American policing, and he was clear about what’s needed.
Stamper argues that what the United States needs is to “reimagine a public safety system that has armed professionals working with citizens.”
“There is a way of imagining and constructing a system with a commitment to genuine partners — the community and elected officials,” he said. “We need to see it as a 50-50 partnership. Others who have a stake would help create a new system with [police] unions ceding and sharing power.”
That reform includes bringing an end to racial profiling, excessive force, police brutality, corruption, and other law enforcement problems.
The epidemic of police violence in this country is not an issue of “bad apples.” Modern policing is rotten at its core. This must change now. Real change will come when we make meaningful changes to how police are funded.
Stamper, author of two books on good policing, has been a persistent and vocal critic of existing police tactics and the way departments interact with Black communities. “The entire criminal justice system and policing is broken,” he said.
 ‘Tainted and toxic’
Stamper describes America’s police departments as “tainted and toxic,” institution, saying the way officers act is a function not just of the culture, but also the power they wield, which makes them feel as if they can do what they want with no consequences. It is that attitude — and the deadly consequences particularly for African Americans — that has so angered protesters.
“It’s an arrogance that afflicts too many officers,” he said. “It causes them to believe that they’re above the law. What we’re facing from institutions in Seattle, San Diego, the NYPD, is an undercurrent of racism and abusive practices that lead to excessive force, lethal force, and sexual predation.”
Stamper said resistance from police unions and rank-and-file officers has hampered the radical restructuring of public safety.
“The public safety mechanism must be reliable, effective, and aligned constitutionally. I think that we must have the capacity to fight violent crimes, but we have to hold individuals accountable,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/1920px-Jacksonville_Florida_2382086928-1024x417.jpg,,,2025-08-02 00:56:12.959301

A small coastal community in Kivalina, Alaska sued several major oil and gas companies, including Exxon Mobil, in 2008. Local representatives argued that greenhouse gas emissions from these companies were contributing to the erosion of the coastline and causing irreversible damage to their village by heating the climate.
But the U.S. Court of Appeals dismissed the claim, citing a lack of evidence linking the corporate emissions with coastal erosion.
In France, 2024, climate campaigners filed a criminal complaint against the major shareholders and the board of directors of TotalEnergies. They alleged that fossil fuels extracted by the company produced emissions that caused floods and storms that damaged property and irreversibly depleted biodiversity.
Despite acknowledging damage related to climate change generally, the Parisian criminal court also dismissed the case. Again, it said there was insufficient evidence to link the activities of TotalEnergies and damage from extreme weather.
Between 2008 and 2024, significant advances were made in climate science that enable us to understand how specific activities affect the climate, and contribute to wildfires, extreme heat and flash floods. The science linking these disasters to fossil fuel giants remains insufficient in the eyes of courts, however.
That’s because climate attribution science generally fails to meet the necessary standard of legal evidence to assign liability. For example, a recent advisory opinion published by the International Court of Justice acknowledged that states have a responsibility to address climate change, and that it is possible to establish a link between a state’s wrongful acts or omissions and the damage resulting from climate change. Despite this, claimants still sometimes fail to prove such a link in court.
However, a new study has demonstrated a computer model that can reduce scientific uncertainty around linking emissions from a particular source to outcomes related to climate change. This end-to-end attribution model, as it is called, could strengthen legal claims against entities damaging the climate.
Tracing emissions to damages
The end-to-end attribution model uses a three-step process to assign liability for climate damage.
First, using historical emissions data from online databases such as Carbon Major, the model simulates two scenarios: one with all historical emissions (the real world), and the other where the emissions from a particular company are excluded. The difference in emissions between these two scenarios is then paired with the concomitant increase in the global temperature, which shows how much warming can be directly attributed to that company.
Using statistical methods, the model can then connect the relevant global temperature increase to changes in the intensity of heatwaves in a particular region. It could, for instance, calculate how much hotter the five hottest days of the year have become in a given year because of the company’s emissions.
The model estimates the economic impact of these intensified heatwaves. It can do this using data on the consequences of reduced productivity and crop losses for growth, for example. It calculates how much money a region lost because of the heatwaves linked to the company’s emissions and gives a dollar value for the damages.
By combining these three steps, the model traces the path from a company’s emissions to specific economic losses, theoretically making it possible to hold emitters financially accountable for climate damages.
In doing so, the study estimated that emissions from Chevron alone caused between US$791 billion (£589 billion) and US$3.6 trillion (£2.7 trillion) in heat-related economic losses globally between 1991 and 2020, and that without emissions from 111 large oil, gas and coal producers (collectively referred to as “carbon majors”) such as ExxonMobil, BP, Saudi Aramco and Gazprom, the global economy would be US$28 trillion richer.
The advantages for claimants
Climate court cases in which claimants seek to assign liability to oil and gas companies are on the rise worldwide.
About 230 lawsuits have been filed against fossil fuel giants and trade associations since 2015. More than two-thirds of these were filed between 2020 and 2024, and many are awaiting a final decision. For such cases, end-to-end attribution could be helpful.
End-to-end attribution can assist claimants in meeting the commonly used “but for” test, by demonstrating that, but for a specific company’s emissions, certain climate-related damages would not have occurred. The method can also meet other liability tests. One is called proportional liability, and it attempts to quantify the extent to which a company’s emissions contributed to increased risk or the severity of damage. This flexibility strengthens the method’s applicability across different legal systems.
The end-to-end attribution method enables claimants to connect global warming to local disasters, such as the 2021 Pacific Northwest “heat dome”. This is crucial, as climate litigation focused on single, high-impact events is usually more successful.
It is well established that emissions from companies in the U.S. and Europe have caused significant harm which is disproportionately suffered in the global south. End-to-end attribution strengthens the evidence base for such climate justice arguments in courtrooms.
There are no established standards for how courts worldwide evaluate scientific evidence. Consequently, while the end-to-end attribution method can link fossil fuel companies and climate-related legal injuries, the courts, depending on differences between jurisdictions and the context of each case, may require higher thresholds to trigger criminal or civil liability.
Additionally, fossil fuel companies often argue that any harm caused by their activities should be weighed against the benefits their products also provide. However, the benefits of fossil fuels should not exempt companies from climate-related liability, because climate change is an existential threat.
End-to-end attribution provides a vital scientific tool for making fossil fuel companies accountable, and could reshape climate litigation globally.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The U.S. Supreme Court has expanded the scope of a Louisiana redistricting case that could weaken key provisions of the landmark Voting Rights Act. 
In a brief order released Friday afternoon, the court reframed the appeal in Callais v. Louisiana, a lawsuit that non-Black voters filed against the state over the creation of a second majority Black district for the state in the U.S. House. The justices intend to look at whether a state violates the U.S. Constitution when it seeks to remedy a violation of the Voting Rights Act. 
In the order, the court asked parties to the case to answer “Whether the State’s intentional creation of a second majority-minority congressional district violates the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.” 
The 14th Amendment, in part, covers representation in Congress, and the 15th Amendment prevents citizens from being denied the right to vote based on their race.   
If the justices determine Louisiana violated the constitution with its latest congressional map, it could undermine the Voting Rights Act. The legislation was approved in 1965 to bolster the protections granted in the 14th and 15th Amendments. It has been amended five times since then to strengthen its provisions, though voting rights advocates note federal court rulings over the past decade have chipped away at the law.

At question in the Callais case is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group.  
John Bisognano, president of the National Redistricting Foundation, a voting rights organization, said courts have never ruled there is a conflict between the Constitution and Section 2. The Supreme Court upheld Section 2 in its 2022 decision in Allen v. Milligan, the Alabama case that required lawmakers there to add a second majority-Black congressional district. 
“To comply with that law, Louisiana must have a congressional map that includes two Black opportunity districts,” Bisognano said in a statement. “If the Court decides to now undo that precedent, it would be a head-spinning reversal of itself.”
Bringing the Voting Rights Act into question makes the case among the most important the court will rule on in its upcoming term. The decision could have nationwide implications, as it could set the standard for the degree to which race can be considered during the election map-drawing process that must occur after each decennial census. 
In June, the Supreme Court punted a ruling in the Callais case, indicating it needed to hear additional arguments before reaching its decision. The rare move came with little explanation and essentially meant a new congressional map, if ultimately necessary, would not be in place until the 2028 election, when the 2030 census count would be underway. 
The court has given Louisiana until Aug. 27 to file a response to their question. White plaintiffs challenging the map will have until Sept. 17 to respond. 
Friday’s announcement complicated an already long and winding process in Louisiana that began with the 2020 census, which state lawmakers used in 2022 to redraw the state’s congressional districts. The original map, which did not add a Black district in Louisiana despite the state’s Black population increasing, was found to be unconstitutional, leading state lawmakers to redo the boundaries in 2024. 
The 2024 redistricting special session, called by Gov. Jeff Landry in his first days in office, brought together a set of strange bedfellows: Black Democrats, who wanted more minority representation; and white Republicans, who used the opportunity to unseat 6th District U.S. Rep. Garret Graves, who fell out of favor with fellow Republicans at home and in Washington, D.C. 
To unseat Graves, Republicans had to draw a map that complied with fewer traditional redistricting principles, creating district lines that run from Shreveport to Baton Rouge, slashing down the center of the state and veering to pick up clusters of Black voters along the way. 
During oral arguments in March, Chief Justice John Roberts described Louisiana’s 6th District as a “snake” and raised concerns it might violate the compactness standard typically expected in voting districts. 
In spring 2024, an appellate panel of three federal judges — one appointed by former President Bill Clinton and two by President Donald Trump — found the new lines for the 6th Congressional District were illegal, though it was allowed to be used for the 2024 election. They ruled the boundaries had been drawn based on race, rejecting the state’s argument that politics drove its boundaries. 
Black voters and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund preferred the map with the more condensed, northeast Louisiana-based district. Some of those Black voters have intervened as plaintiffs in the Callais case.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The author of the new map, state Sen. Glen Womack, R-Harrisonburg, was explicit during the 2024 redistricting special session that protecting U.S. Rep. Julia Letlow, R–Start, who sits on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Shreveport, and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-Jefferson, was his objective. 
Notably left off his list was Graves, who had ruffled feathers at home and in D.C. because he was widely viewed as insufficiently supportive of Scalise’s failed bid for U.S. House speaker. Graves also endorsed Stephen Waguespack, one of Landry’s opponents in the 2023 governor’s race, potentially putting him crosswise with a powerful incoming governor whose interests drove the special session. 
The appellate court panel disagreed that GOP politics was the driving force behind the map’s lines. 
“Given the slim majority Republicans hold in the United States House of Representatives, even if such personal or intra-party animosity did or does exist, it is difficult to fathom that Louisiana Republicans would intentionally concede a seat to a Democratic candidate on those bases,” a footnote from the majority opinion reads. 
“The Court finds that … District 6 does not satisfy the ‘geographically compact’ and ‘reasonably configured’ Gingles requirement,” the opinion continues.
The Gingles test arose from a 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that set standards for determining whether election districts meet federal standards.

(Photo by Michelle Griffith/Minnesota Reformer)Citing “credible allegations of fraud” and “exponential growth in spending,” the Department of Human Services asked the federal government for assistance in terminating a state  housing program, according to a letter signed by DHS Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi and released Friday.
The end of the Housing Stabilization Services program — which resides under the umbrella of the federal-state Medicaid program — comes after Gov. Tim Walz on Monday said his administration halted payments to 50 of the largest providers. Federal investigators say the program has become the source of a massive fraud scheme.
Gandhi’s letter to the federal Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services notes that “the DHS Office of Inspector General has suspended payment to 77 housing stabilization providers this year based on credible allegations of fraud.”
Earlier this month, the FBI raided five Minnesota businesses that have received millions in Medicaid money for services they didn’t provide, according to unsealed search warrants. The Housing Stabilization Services program is intended to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing.
Since its inception, the program’s growth has exploded. The Star Tribune reported recently that when the bill creating the program passed in 2017, analysts expected the cost to be  $2.6 million a year, but by 2024, the cost was $107 million. Meanwhile, DHS data showed more than 700 companies were paid for services in 2024.
Acting U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson told KSTP recently that the “vast majority” of the Housing Stabilization Services program is fraudulent.
KARE 11 first reported on the program’s flaws last month, including widespread reports of payment for no actual services to people in need.
The failure of the program — in concert with the hundreds of millions lost via other programs — is sure to become political fodder, especially should Walz run for a third term.
Thompson said recently that when his current investigations are finished, fraud in programs administered by Minnesota could exceed $1 billion, stemming from a pandemic-era food aid program known as Feeding Our Future, the state’s autism program and rapidly increasing sums allegedly pilfered from other Medicaid programs.
Thompson says the problem is systemic.
“This fraud crisis didn’t come out of nowhere. It’s the result of widespread failure across nearly every level of leadership in Minnesota: Politicians who turned a blind eye. Agencies that failed to act. Prosecutors and law enforcement who didn’t push hard enough. Reporters who ignored the story. Community leaders who stayed silent,” he told the Star Tribune recently. “And a public that wanted to believe it couldn’t happen here.”
Walz will argue he took decisive action once evidence of fraud began to emerge in the housing stabilization program.
In the wake of the Feeding Our Future scandal, Walz and his administration faced years of criticism for being slow to act despite red flags about the program.
Even when the state Department Department of Education — which administered the food aid progam — sought to stop payment to some suspicious vendors, however, they sued the department and won in court.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3114-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 20:56:13.717626

The American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska announced Friday that it had filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against federal and local immigration authorities on behalf of a single mother arrested during the June 10 Glenn Valley Foods raid.

Maria Reynosa Jacinto remains in a North Platte jail despite an Omaha-based immigration judge ruling on July 15 that she could be released on a $9,000 bond. 
The lawsuit challenges her prolonged detention.
 “There is no due process when the government, who lost the argument in court, gets to do what they want anyway,” the ACLU wrote.
 Stolen IDs alleged

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. They’ve said repeatedly that the focus from the raid should be on U.S. citizen “victims” whose identities were allegedly stolen by undocumented immigrants to work at the Glenn Valley plant.
The Guatemalan worker’s 19-year-old daughter Andrea Rafael Reynosa is a U.S. citizen. The ACLU says the mother had been working in the U.S. for 20 years, has no criminal convictions and was her family’s primary earner.

Prairielands Freedom Fund tried posting the bond money on Reynosa Jacinto’s behalf, but learned that ICE officials had issued an automatic stay of her release. That blocked her from getting released on bond while her legal team works on building the case for her to stay in the U.S.
ACLU Nebraska argues that the automatic stay unlawfully violates the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment and goes beyond ICE authority by overriding the judge’s decision on bond, making the judge’s determination that there was no danger or flight risk “meaningless.”
 Trump administration policy change

ACLU officials linked the automatic stay to new “interim guidance” issued by the Trump administration July 8, which asserts that nearly all detained immigrants in removal proceedings are ineligible for release on bond. The new no-bond practice is the subject of a class action lawsuit filed earlier this week by ACLU’s national organization and other immigrant rights advocates.
ACLU officials believe the practice is a tactic to drag out detention to the point that unauthorized immigrants choose to leave the country, basically deporting themselves.
ACLU helps free worker snagged in Omaha immigration raid, says case reflects ‘cruel’ changing policy

ICE has said the change in approach “closes a loophole to our nation’s security” that the Biden administration and others had based on what it describes as an “inaccurate interpretation” of federal law. 
The July 8 memo was key to an earlier and similar ICE attempt to keep a different Glenn Valley worker behind bars after a judge had granted him a $10,000 bond. That man ultimately was released on the bond, also provided by Prairielands, but only after the ACLU stepped in and an ICE official reportedly admitted having made an “oversight.” 
ACLU representatives said that ICE in that case, unlike in Reynosa Jacinto’s situation, failed to file the automatic stay paperwork.
Jennifer Houlden, acting legal director at ACLU Nebraska, said the automatic stay provision was used for decades previously “only in the rarest of cases.”

“It halts an immigration court judge’s bond order instantly without any reason particular to the person and without any opportunity for them to be heard on the issue,” she said. 
Houlden said that everyone has a right to due process under the law, including immigrants.
“The use of an automatic stay in situations like our client’s clearly violates that right,” she said.
Reynosa Jacinto’s lawsuit seeks a court order for her release on bond, or that immigration authorities demonstrate that her continued detention is lawful.
About 23 others detained in the June 10 Glenn Valley raid also remain in custody at the North Platte jail. More than 70 workers in all were apprehended. Some have been removed from the country and others are out on bond, ICE has said.
Mindy Rush Chipman, ACLU executive director, said the no-bond situation is more broadly impacting ICE detainees in Nebraska and across the nation.
“It’s affecting Nebraskans from all over the state no matter how they were intercepted and detained initially,” she said, adding that the ACLU likely will be filing more lawsuits. 
In a statement provided by the ACLU, the worker’s daughter said the period since her mom’s June 10 arrest is the longest they’ve been apart.
“It’s just us two and she’s always been there for me, working hard to provide a better life for us both,” said Rafael Reynosa. “It really makes me emotional that she’s still where she is and I’m here by myself even though she should have been out weeks ago.”
  “I was in shock when my mom was detained,” Andrea Rafael Reynosa, 19, says of Maria Reynosa Jacint0. (Courtesy of American Civil Liberties Union of Nebraska)

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on July 31.
Lamoille County’s new affordable housing nonprofit has spent the last seven months settling into its new role as some towns look for assistance in addressing the ongoing housing crisis.
Downstreet Housing and Community Development, the Washington County-based nonprofit has taken over an array of affordable housing properties previously overseen by Lamoille Housing Partnership in Cambridge, Johnson, Morrisville and Stowe, even as the full merger of the organizations is not yet completed.
The merger should be finalized in September, according to Downstreet executive director Angie Harbin. In anticipation of the resolution, the organization has added three seats to its board.
Even as the nonprofit sets up in the county, the need for its services have grown.
“Just like the entire state, Lamoille County needs more affordable housing,” Harbin said. “There’s probably not a community in Vermont right now where that’s not true.”
A statewide housing assessment conducted by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency published earlier this year said that 13% of the county’s rental stock was built with public funding, and 6% of that rental housing is available with income-sensitive rental assistance. That same report identified a third of Lamoille County occupied households as cost-burdened, where residents use more than 30% of their annual household income on housing.
Though no specific projects have been announced, towns particularly eager to expand or replace their affordable housing, like Johnson and Stowe, have begun identifying Downstreet as a potential partner in that effort.
Part of the incentive for the merger, outside of the leadership vacuum at Lamoille Housing Partnership, was Downstreet’s size — roughly double the Partnership — and thus capacity to access more federal funding and expand faster.
In Stowe, where committees are exploring potential solutions to the lack of accessible housing, town officials identified Downstreet as a potential partner that could operate and administer housing through a a community trust fund, according to a recently published housing needs assessment.
In Johnson, DEW Construction has proposed a project like the one it oversees in Barre by coordinating with Downstreet on the grant-funded construction of housing on town-owned land. The nonprofit and builder could potentially build a mix of housing types, including single-family, owner-occupied and mixed-use rentals.
The town is hoping to potentially move quickly to take advantage of $67 million in community development funds recently announced by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development, which are intended to assist communities hardest hit by the July 2023 flood. “A majority of funding will be focused on creating new housing units outside of flood plains and supporting infrastructure in the identified regions,” according to an agency press release.
“Not only are we operating existing affordable housing in Lamoille County but also making sure that we have the capacity to continue to develop there,” Harbin, the Downstreet executive director, said, noting that the group is currently exploring some properties in Johnson. “We are really committed to making sure that there’s at least one housing project that’s utilizing that (block grant) funding. We’re generally exploring real estate development opportunities in Lamoille County.”
Downstreet, like other affordable housing developers, is attempting to balance demand and funding. The Vermont Housing and Conservation Board is no longer replete with pandemic-era money, and there is now a great deal of uncertainty around federal funds amid the disruption of the Trump administration.
“We were seeing pretty significant cuts at the state level, because there has been so much Covid-era funding that was winding down, so we’re already looking at far fewer affordable housing projects developed across the state, and then there’s the federal funding,” Harbin said. “We don’t have a clear idea what’s going to happen or what’s going to be cut as at this point.”
Evictions avoided
The transfer of properties from the Lamoille Housing Partnership portfolio hasn’t been without its share of hiccups, particularly for a Jeffersonville property with a history of management issues.
Last October, just as Downstreet was about to take over management of the building, the Mann’s Meadow senior housing apartment complex was beset by a disabled elevator, stranding some of the less mobile residents on the upper floors of the building. At the time, Harbin requested patience as the nonprofit assessed each property and its maintenance needs.
Several residents at Mann’s Meadow recently received “notice to terminate tenancy” letters and warnings despite not owing any back rent. The notice was concerning enough to tenants that they reached out to the Cambridge Selectboard for help.
By the time selectboard members could inquire about the issue, according to a discussion at the board’s July 15 meeting, it had already been resolved. Downstreet had received incomplete information from the building’s former property management company, according to Harbin.
The former company abruptly ended its property management services at Mann’s Meadow, and transitioning to a new property management system quickly proved tricky.
“It’s a very alarming (notification) to receive, and we also weren’t aware that the previous property management company wasn’t using this type of notification, because it is typical all over the state,” Harbin said. “All of that has been straightened out, which is great, and we’ve been leasing up units right now, some at a bit of a clip, as we’ve been turning them over, getting them ready to lease up and then moving new folks in.”

Activists argue that immigration officials are using new tactics by moving detainees beyond traditional public access routes into the airport.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have begun quietly moving detainees through a nonpublic side entrance at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, according to activists. The new tactic, activists say, bypasses public scrutiny and calls into question previous statements airport officials have made regarding their involvement in transfers.
Activists, who have been monitoring the airport for months and argue that ICE is carrying out illegal transfers of immigrant detainees, told VTDigger they observed ICE officials escorting a group of people through a side door early Thursday morning.  
A video taken by activists and shared with VTDigger shows a white 15-passenger van parked around 3:30 a.m. Thursday at a side entrance of the airport that appeared to lead to the security screening area. An unidentified man in a gray shirt at the back of the van is seen holding out both his hands and telling two activists, “Y’all need to stay right there.”
Unidentified people can also be seen walking through a heavy metal doorway.

Julie Macuga, a Burlington resident and activist who has helped surveil the airport, and Leif Taranta, a second activist, attempted to get information from the people moving inside the airport before they disappeared into the building, along with the man in the gray shirt. 
The video then shows the activists walking inside the airport to find that a metal gate closed off the Transportation Security Administration security screening area.
The activists said ICE’s 3:30 a.m. arrival was earlier than usual and before TSA opened for the day. It’s the second time in less than a week they’ve witnessed ICE officials move detainees through a side entrance, according to videos and emails the activists shared with VTDigger. 
Airport security later told the activists that they were aware of the activity, and that the people they had seen go through the door included ICE agents, one video showed.

Activists confront ICE agents using side door at Burlington airport in Vermont
An additional video reviewed by VTDigger, taken on July 25, shows unidentified men in masks moving people from a white van parked behind a BTV airport truck through a different side door and directly into the airport’s TSA security checkpoint line.
In response to criticism about the large number of detainees passing through the Burlington airport, airport officials have suggested in previous meetings and interviews that they don’t know when ICE transfers happen and that they have little interaction with the agency.
“We don’t get advised. We don’t get any communication,” said Nic Longo, the airport’s director of aviation, at a recent airport commission meeting. 
In an email response to VTDigger’s questions, David Carman, deputy director of aviation at the airport, said the use of the side door does not represent a change in airport policies. 
“Airport staff do not get involved with assisting with ICE/DHS detainee movements, nor does the airport have any communication with ICE on when or how the movements are taking place,” Carman said in the email. 
For years, federal law enforcement agencies “have had access to the secure areas of the airport for the purpose of law enforcement and supporting other federal law enforcement agencies,” he said. 
“Any actions pertaining to ICE detainee movements and how they bring detainees to the post-TSA checkpoint public spaces of the airport (where passengers board aircraft) are federal law enforcement and DHS decisions, and completely outside the purview of the airport,” he added. 
But activists say the apparent use of a nonpublic side door represents a change in the way ICE agents are using the airport. 
When pressed by activists at a recent airport commission meeting, Longo said airport staff have pushed back against ICE when agents parked in areas where parking wasn’t allowed — nearly towing the vehicles in some cases. At the time, Longo said the airport’s goal was to treat the agents like other law enforcement officials or members of the public. 
Almost two weeks later, Longo said it’s extremely rare for airport staff to interact with ICE, but because the airport receives federal grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration, it was obligated to cooperate with the federal government.
Longo told VTDigger that airport officials allow ICE to transport detainees through the airport because it’s a public use facility, and he can’t pick or choose federal agencies or members of the public who can use the facility. 

A police officer in Burlington tells activists he won’t ask ICE officials questions
“Our obligation is to cooperate and not impede U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” Longo told VTDigger on July 15. 
When asked about federal agents using the side door at the Burlington airport, James Covington, a spokesperson for ICE’s Boston field office, told VTDigger that “ICE Boston does not wish to comment on security protocols.”
‘They’re in the custody of government agents’
One of the videos taken Thursday shows advocates going to the closed airport police office, which the Burlington Police Department operates, according to Carman. They called the airport police number and told the responder they had witnessed people being in through a side door. 
“I’m aware of what you’re referring to and those people have been identified as ICE agents,” the police officer responded. 
Taranta asked if police had reviewed legal documents. 
“I know that as police you’re allowed to ask them for documentation that the transport itself is legal,” Taranta said.
“Yeah I have no reason to ask them for that,” the officer said.
“So the fact that there have been past illegal transfers doesn’t make you as an airport security make you think you should ask that this one is legal?” Taranta asked. 
“Nope, I’m not doing that,” the officer said. “I’m aware of what’s going on here. I’m confident that they are who they say they are.” 
“Are you sure the detainees are legally being taken from this country?” Macuga asked. 
“They’re in the custody of government agents,” the officer said. 
Macuga told him that wasn’t an answer. 
“Well it is,” the officer said. “I’m not going to debate this any further with you. I’ve got other stuff going on.”
The Burlington Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

‘I have to do my job right now’
ICE detentions and deportations have skyrocketed under the second Trump administration, with more than 36,700 people booked into ICE detention in June, and more than 56,800 held in ICE custody as of July 13, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization housed at New York’s Syracuse University. 
A study by the loose group of activists, which includes Macuga and Taranta, showed roughly 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through Vermont’s largest airport since January.
The videos shared with VTDigger show the potential escalation by ICE officials in moving detainees beyond traditional public access routes into the airport to avoid detection as activists continue airport surveillance, according to Macuga.
The group of activists sent an email to the mayor’s office and Longo, Burlington airport aviation director, following the event. 
In the email, the group told officials that activists were in the public portion of the airport over the past week “as a stop gap measure while the airport and city improve their policies.” 
The mayor’s office did not respond to a request for comment. 
“We thought it was heading in a good direction,” Macuga said of prior conversations with city officials. “But then things really started to escalate in the past week to a point we haven’t seen the whole time we’ve been doing this work.”
Macuga said the activists’ work has led people across New England to reach out to them and that a network is forming of people who want to take on similar work at their own airports. 
They’ve also been training people to be bystander activists, including learning basic Spanish phrases. Over the last two weeks, someone in their advocacy network has stayed at the airport multiple days a week, Taranta said. 
“We want people to be safe, and to be told by TSA agents that investigating human trafficking in an airport is not their job is very chilling,” Taranta said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.)MADISON — Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and other Democratic governors said responding “in kind” to Republican mid-decade redistricting is necessary at a Friday Democratic Governors Association press conference.
Kelly said she thinks courts would rule that redrawn maps from Republicans and Democrats are unconstitutional. If Republicans take this path, however, Democratic governors must also pursue mid-decade redistricting to “protect the American people,” she said.
“It’s incumbent upon Democratic governors, if they have the opportunity, to respond in-kind,” Kelly said. “Things are bad enough in Washington right now. What it would look like if there’s even a greater majority that this President controls — God help the United States of America.”
Kelly and other Democratic governors were in Madison for the DGA’s summer policy conference. 
Discussion over redistricting ahead of midterm elections started in Texas, where President Donald Trump’s political team pressured state leaders to redraw its map to gain more seats in the U.S. House and help Republicans maintain their congressional majority in 2026. Trump said a “very simple redrawing” of the state’s maps could help pick up five seats. 
Redistricting, the process of redrawing state legislative and congressional district boundaries, typically happens every ten years after the U.S. Census. 
Other Republican-led states, including Florida and Ohio, also said they would look at redrawing their maps mid-decade.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was not at the press conference, was the first Democrat to float the idea of gerrymandering the Democratic state to have fewer Republican seats in response. Democrats in New York and Maryland have also been looking for a path to gain additional seats in their states as well. 
None of the governors at the press conference said they would pursue that route but said they supported those that had a path to use it. Kelly joked that she “could” do mid-decade redistricting. “But what would I do? I’d just give them another Republican.” 
Evers said the blatant direction from Trump to pursue redistricting is a “constant threat to our democracy.” 
“I’m really pissed frankly, and we’re going to do whatever we can do to stop this,” Evers said, adding that Wisconsin would not be changing its maps. He said the state has already worked hard to “get fair maps.”
The Republican-led Legislature and Evers adopted new maps for the state Legislature in 2024 following a state Supreme Court ruling. Some have been calling for new Congressional maps, though those efforts have so far been rejected by the state Supreme Court. 
Wisconsin’s current congressional maps were drawn in 2022 by Evers and selected by the state Supreme Court with a conservative majority at the time. Democrats and their allies filed a new challenge to the maps in Dane County Circuit Court in July, arguing they are unconstitutional because they’re anti-competitive. Republicans currently represent six of Wisconsin’s eight congressional districts. 
“Because of those fair [state legislative] maps that we had, we were able to pass a relatively bipartisan budget, and it was a good budget, and so, in my heart of hearts, this is where we have to be, but… when you have a gun up against your head, you gotta do something,” Evers said.
  “I’m really pissed quite frankly, and we’re going to do whatever we can do to stop this,” Gov. Tony Evers said about mid-decade redistricting. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
“This move is unconstitutional. It’s again breaking the system. It’s, again, meant to game the system,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said. “Democrats are expected to have the decorum — we’re expected to protect the institutions, we’re expected to follow the rules on this.”
The times call for a different approach, however, he argued. 
“We’re not playing with a normal administration,” Walz said. “We’re playing with one that has thrown all the rules out of there… I think it is incumbent upon states that have the capacity or the ability to make sure that we are responding in kind.”
Governors criticize GOP over effects of the Republican megabill 
The Democratic governors also warned about the potential effects of Republicans’ federal reconciliation package. Kelly, who chairs the Democratic Governors Association, said government systems and programs being cut are not set up for states to operate on their own. 
“They were set up with the federal government as a very robust partner, and without them being a partner, there is no way that any of our states will be able to pick up the tail,” Kelly said. “The best we could do is perhaps mitigate the pain, but even that will be difficult.” 
The legislation, ” signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, made major changes to the federal Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
Trump and Republicans in Congress are “trying to gut programs that Wisconsin families count on,” Evers said. “They’re willing to break our constitutional system to make that happen.” 
The megabill is just one tool, he suggested. “Whether it’s the Republican budget or the continued illegal action to fire Wisconsin workers, strip funds away from our state, damage public education, we have to fight.” 
A memo released this week by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau found that the exact effects of the federal reconciliation law on Medicaid and FoodShare in Wisconsin are uncertain, but will likely result in fewer enrollees.
Currently, about one in five Wisconsin residents rely on Medicaid for health care coverage. 
“The full impact of the Act’s Medicaid provisions on the state’s MA enrollment and costs remains uncertain,” the fiscal bureau memo states. “This is partly because some of the details of implementation requirements will depend upon forthcoming federal guidance, but also because the eligibility and enrollment requirements are new for the program and so little is known about their actual effects.” 
Starting in January 2027, childless adults will be required to complete 80 hours per month of paid work, school, employment training or community service per month to maintain their Medicaid eligibility. There are about 184,000 childless adults currently enrolled in Wisconsin. DHS estimates that 63,000 Wisconsinites will be at high risk of losing their coverage.
The LFB memo said that enrollment will likely drop due to the work requirement provisions. 
“Enrollment reductions could occur either because of the additional complexity of the application process or because the work requirements cause some individuals to increase their earnings to above the eligibility threshold. The magnitude of the program disenrollment, and associated reduction in [Medicaid] benefits costs, is uncertain,” the memo states. 
The governors warned that hospitals still face a difficult environment under the federal law. 
“Our rural hospitals in particular are extremely at risk,” Kelly of Kansas said. “We’ve already closed 10 of them in those 10 years and many more are on the brink, and this reconciliation bill is going to throw them over the edge.” 
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said 35 hospitals are at risk in his state, making it the state with the most hospitals at risk in the nation. 
“Donald Trump’s big ugly bill is the single worst, most devastating piece of legislation that I have seen in my lifetime. It is a direct attack on rural America,” Beshear said. 
Three hospitals in Wisconsin have been identified as at risk of closure. 
Costs for the SNAP program will increase in Wisconsin as the law reduces the federal share of the program — known as FoodShare in Wisconsin — from 50% to 25%. This will leave states responsible for 75% of the costs, a change that the Wisconsin Department of Health Services estimates will require an additional $51 million annually from the state. 
The FoodShare program currently helps nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites access food, and nearly 90,000 Wisconsinites will be at risk of losing their benefits due to the new federal provisions, according to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. 
Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee echoed concerns over the ability of the state  to pick up the gaps left by federal cuts in social programs.
“We’re not going to be able to absorb in funding what’s coming our way,” McKee said. “The taxpayers are going to pay for it in our states or the benefits are going to get reduced.” 
The law extends work requirements for SNAP recipients from the current top age of 54 to age 64. It narrows the work requirement exemption for caregivers and parents by changing the definition of “dependent child” from under 18 years of age to under 14, meaning that parents of 15- to 17-year-olds could now be required to have employment in return for their SNAP benefits. 
It provides an exception from work requirements for a married person responsible for a child under age 14 and residing with someone who complies with the work requirements. It also exempts individuals who are eligible for the Indian Health Services. 
“While Wisconsin just passed a Wisconsin budget that invests in our kids, cuts taxes for working families and supports our rural hospitals, Trump and Congressional Republicans are moving in just the opposite way,” Evers said. “Democratic governors aren’t going to just sit idly and watch it happen. When Trump tried to strip hospital funding, we moved real quickly to protect $1.5 billion dollars in health care funding for Wisconsin. When they threaten our schools, we stand up and fight back. When they attack programs that matter to working families, we find ways to fill the gaps.”
“Republican governors fall in line behind Trump’s agenda. Democratic governors are standing up for the people that we serve,” Evers said before mentioning 2026 elections. He said Wisconsinites will “make a choice about the future of our state when they elect our next governor. They’re going to choose a leader who will work together and expand health care, support working families and build an economy that works for everybody.”
Evers announced on July 24 that he would not be running for a third term in office, setting up the first open race for governor in Wisconsin since 2010.
“I know that [Evers’] leadership is not going to end just because the title might, and that he is going to be out there fighting for what he believes in moving into the future,” said Kentucky Gov Andy Beshear, who won’t be able to run for another term in 2027 due to term limits.
So far, Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez has announced her campaign, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley is planning on entering the race and other Democrats are still mulling a decision. There will likely be a crowded Democratic primary. Two Republicans have officially launched their campaigns for governor, while U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has been teasing a run.

Weather stations across Vermont have reported higher than average — though not quite record-breaking — temperatures.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  You’re not imagining it: This summer is hot.","From Burlington to Bennington, Vermont is having a rather hot summer, according to National Weather Service data. 
The average high temperatures for June and July this year were above the 30-year average for at least four longstanding weather stations across the state: Burlington, Montpelier, St. Johnsbury and Bennington. 
To get a read on how the whole summer measures up, we’ll have to wait. The National Weather Service defines the “meteorological summer” as June, July and August.
It’s also been drier than average in Burlington, Montpelier and St. Johnsbury, although Bennington had more typical rainfall for June and July. 
None of those locations quite broke the record for average monthly temperature so far this year. But weather service meteorologist Matthew Clay said multiple one-day records were hit — like in Burlington on June 23, when the daily high hit a whopping 99 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Those instances are becoming more common. 
“If I could go and look at every record statement that we sent out for a year, the vast majority of those are going to be record highs compared to record lows,” he said. 
The Burlington weather station has records going back more than a century. They show that the city has experienced a gradual rise in the number of very hot days over the past 20 to 30 years. 
The weather service has also issued six heat advisories so far this summer, a reflection of the health and public safety dangers of extreme heat. But Clay said it was difficult to compare that with previous years because the weather service lowered its threshold for issuing advisories from 100 degrees to 95 degrees in 2018. 
Also, the weather service’s threshold for heat advisories is lower in Vermont than in hotter places in the country, in part because Vermonters may be less able to handle the heat when it arrives.
“If it’s your first 90-degree day right after 50-degree weather, your body’s not acclimated,” he said. 
There’s also fewer homes with air conditioning in this part of the country compared to, for example, Arizona, Clay noted. 
“We don’t have centralized air in a lot of places in New England, so we don’t have the ability to cool off like they do in the South, where the air conditioning is more prevalent,” he said. 
Emergency room visits for heat-related illnesses spiked the week of June 22, when temperatures rose in Burlington and elsewhere, according to the Vermont Department of Health. 
Heat-related illnesses have fluctuated year to year, but “rates have been trending upwards since 2003,” according to the health department website. The department also has recommendations on how to keep cool and prevent heat-related injuries on its website.  
The weather is expected to stay cooler — in the 70s and low 80s — over the weekend, but parts of the state could see temperatures rise to the mid-80s next week, according to weather service predictions. 
Clay said that heat does tend to come in “waves.” 
“Sometimes you have these warmer spells, you have cooler spells,” he said. “You can’t just say that it’s all related to one thing or another, but we are seeing that, overall, our temperatures are warming.”

Left to right: Lona McCastlain, William ""Dubs"" Byers, Chairman Benny Magness, Lee Watson, Brandon Tollett, Grant Hodges. Board member Alonza Jiles attended remotely. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Board of Corrections shut down its live stream of its Friday meeting after a hacker twice began playing a racist video containing racial slurs and the Confederate flag, along with swastikas and sexual imagery.
Board of Corrections Chairman Benny Magness was irate over the hacks, standing from his seat and demanding staff cut off the individual playing the video. The online meeting room on Zoom was shut down, but later reopened — only for it to be interrupted again. The meeting room was then taken offline for the rest of the day-long meeting.
In a statement sent by Department of Corrections spokesperson Rand Champion, the board acknowledged the hack, calling it “unfortunate.”
“The Board wishes to convey an apology for those who were on the stream and were subjected to the content of the hack,” the emailed statement said. “It is a known issue affecting Zoom, and the Board will pursue other more secure options for future meetings.”
The hack was the loudest part of an otherwise hard-to-hear meeting, which was held at the Central Arkansas Community Corrections Center in Little Rock.
Another moment of contention came later in the meeting, when Department of Corrections Chief Financial Officer Chad Brown informed board members he had received invoices from an architecture firm for work on three projects he was not sure had been approved by the board.
“On the three projects, the cart was put before the horse,” Brown explained to the Advocate after the meeting. “We’re going to hold those over until the next board meeting” to look into “what went wrong.”
The projects are for roof repairs at the Wrightsville Unit, door controls at the Grimes and McPherson Units and fencing at the Pine Bluff Complex. The board opted not to vote on the invoices while DOC performs its review.
Board member Lona McCastlain expressed frustration about the unexpected invoices, noting that if the projects hadn’t been approved, then the firm shouldn’t have done the work it was invoicing for.

Northfield Police Chief Pierre Gomez was dressed in his uniform and heading into the town office on Main Street on Tuesday morning, when he said he was accosted by a resident who “ranted and raved” at him using racist terms.
The man, whom Gomez later identified as Northfield resident Gary Allen Smith, proceeded to call him “boy,” “scumbag chief,” told him to “do your fucking job” and to “go back to Pennsylvania,” according to an audio recording of the encounter Gomez shared with VTDigger.
“He was cursing. He was getting in my face, pointing and referencing me as ‘boy’ several times,” said Gomez, a Black Latino man. 
He said he had never met the man before and did not provoke him.

Gomez said he encountered Smith in the vestibule of the office building, as Smith held the door open for him. Gomez said he thanked him but told him he was not exiting. 
That’s when the man yelled, “Get out of here,” he said.
Smith could not be contacted to comment for this story. Calls to phone numbers associated with someone with his name and age were not answered.
Scott Kerner, owner of the nearby Good Measure Pub and Brewery, said he was on his way to the bank next door when he witnessed the incident.
“I heard somebody yelling, and I looked up, and there was a guy with a tie-dye shirt yelling and pointing very close to Chief Gomez’s face in front of the town office,” he said. “It felt very threatening.”

Kerner said he walked up toward them because he was worried about the man’s tone and how aggressive he sounded. 
“I like Chief, and it just seemed like this guy was really out of hand,” Kerner said.
He said he heard the man call the chief “boy” and say “do your fucking job.” 
“The guy continued to yell at Chief, walked across Main Street yelling, then walked back and got back in his face and yelled at him again, all while I was standing right there,” Kerner said.
Through it all, he said, Gomez remained calm.
Trained in his past law enforcement work on how to react “as far as race-baiting is concerned,” Gomez said he was able to not react in a negative way. Although, as a person of color, he said he found the multiple “boy” comments racially charged.
Smith, who is 54 and was recorded as recently living in Northfield Falls, according to court documents, was convicted for assaulting a Northfield police officer in 2023.
Gomez said he reported the latest incident to Northfield Town Manager Jeff Schulz and others. Schulz said he is aware of the encounter and has the recording of the confrontation that occurred in front of the municipal building.
“The incident is very unfortunate and very disrespectful to the Chief,” he wrote in an email Wednesday. “Please note that as the Town Manager and a representative of the Town of Northfield, I strongly condemn all forms of racism and harassment.”
Mia Schultz, president of the Rutland Area NAACP, said Gomez has faced the everyday pressures that come with the job and has carried the weight of systemic racism since the day he arrived in Northfield. She said town leaders must publicly declare their support for the chief.
“Chief Gomez was verbally attacked in broad daylight,” Schultz wrote in an email. “He was repeatedly called ‘boy,’ a word with a long and violent history that has been used to strip Black and Brown men of their humanity and authority. This is not just a personnel matter. This is a moral failure.”
Merry Shernock, the co-chair of the Northfield Selectboard, has been the most vocal of the five board members — at the last meeting and via email — in her condemnation of the continued racism and harassment Gomez has faced.
“I have nothing except respect and admiration for Chief Gomez,” she wrote in an email this week, adding that the sentiment is shared by the majority of residents. She prefers not to pay attention to those who express hate, she wrote, “but I am aware, much to my dismay, that they are among us.”
The board has initiated an investigation related to Gomez that remains ongoing, she said. Schulz and Gomez said they are unable to discuss details of the investigation itself as it involves personnel issues, which fall under protected information.
Shernock said she has been charged with organizing the racial bias training that was started at the April 28 meeting by a member of the state Office of Racial Equity. She expects that training will resume in October. A Northfield resident has also requested community racial bias training, and she said she is hopeful she can look into it this fall.
While Schulz wrote he condemns racism and found the harassment Gomez faced this week “unfortunate,” the town manager has not responded to multiple rounds of emails from VTDigger asking if he explicitly supports the police chief and his work. 
A pattern of harassment
Originally from Pittsburgh and in law enforcement for about 20 years, Gomez, 58, was a Philadelphia police officer and, later, a detective in the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office.
He was hired in September 2023 as chief of police in Northfield, a Washington County town of about 6,000 and home to Norwich University. Gomez told VTDigger he has faced multiple instances of harassment and discrimination in the overwhelmingly white town since he took the job in wake of former chief of police John Helfant retiring amid controversy in May 2023.
Vermont has had only three police chiefs of color — in Northfield, Montpelier and Brattleboro. Brian Peete became the capital’s first Black police chief in 2020 but left for a job in Kansas after two years. Norma Hardy has led the Brattleboro police department since 2021 and is the first Black woman police chief in Vermont.
Earlier this year, at an April 8 selectboard meeting — a YouTube recording of which now has 1,600 views —  Lynn Doney, a disgraced former selectboard member, took issue with Gomez wearing a gray hoodie on duty instead of his uniform: “so he looks like a police chief and not a gangster off the street that’s just driving our cruisers around,” Doney said.
On April 23, more than 60 residents packed the room at the following selectboard meeting, the majority in support of Gomez. Many of them denounced Doney’s racist remark at the earlier meeting and wore hoodies themselves in a show of solidarity.
Gomez said he sent a letter to Doney asking him to cease and desist from such personal attacks. “It is unlawful for an individual to make deliberate statements that intend to harm the reputation of another party without factual evidence or simply based upon hearsay,” the letter he shared read.
Doney did not respond to VTDigger’s requests for comment then or this week but responded to Gomez’s letter in April. The letter signed by Doney, shared by Gomez, reads, “I will not apology to you or anyone else as everything I have said is true.”
Since that incident, residents and racial justice leaders have pointed out that racism and retention issues are problems many predominantly white towns face when they hire people of color and urged Northfield officials to be better about calling out racism and in vocalizing support for the chief. 
“He’s an excellent leader for our town and I am well aware … of what he’s had to deal with here. So, you know, we support him,” Kerner said Thursday.

Starting Aug. 1, New York will offer free phone calls in state prisons, becoming the sixth state to do so — and the first to enact the policy without legislation. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)New York will offer free phone calls to people incarcerated in its state prisons starting Aug. 1, becoming the sixth state to do so. 
The change is projected to save roughly 30,000 families across the state an estimated $13.3 million per year in phone call fees, according to Worth Rises, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to dismantling the prison industry.
New York joins California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Minnesota in offering free phone calls in state prisons, though Colorado’s policy won’t take full effect until 2026. New York, however, is the first state to implement the change administratively, without any legislation.
Previously, incarcerated New Yorkers were charged $0.024 per minute for domestic calls under the state’s contract with Securus Technologies and received three free 15-minute calls per week, according to the department’s news release.
Cash assistance may curb recidivism among people leaving prison, study says

The new policy eliminates all charges for calls made from facility phones or tablets. The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will cover the costs through its operating budget and expects to spend $9 million this fiscal year.
Some research suggests that incarcerated people who maintain consistent contact with loved ones are significantly more likely to succeed upon release and are less likely to reoffend.
The policy change also comes as the department continues to work to restore operations following a three-week correctional staff strike earlier this year, which has left thousands of officer positions unfilled and led to cutbacks in visitation, programming and recreation. Some facilities have extended officer shifts up to 12 hours and increased cell confinement to up to 20 hours a day.
“Understanding the value of family ties while in prison is crucial – not only for emotional support, but for improving an individual’s outcomes while incarcerated and when returning to society,” Daniel F. Martuscello III, the corrections department’s commissioner, said in a statement.
This latest initiative also aligns with the department’s goal of reducing New York’s recidivism rate to 17% by 2030. The state recently reported a historic low of 18.9%, according to the state corrections department’s news release.
The new phone policy also builds on other efforts to reduce financial strain on incarcerated people and their families. The department has increased the amount of “gate money” or money provided upon release from $40 to $200, eliminated work release program fees and expanded Wi-Fi access and secure messaging on tablets to improve communication beyond phone calls.
New York’s new policy change also comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission abruptly announced a two-year delay in implementing new rate caps for prison and jail phone calls. The rules, which passed unanimously last year under the Martha Wright-Reed Just and Reasonable Communications Act, aimed to significantly lower the cost of calls for incarcerated people.
Facilities that haven’t yet lowered their phone and video call rates — or that decide to roll back recent changes — can continue charging higher rates until at least April 2027. The FCC had approved rate caps of 6 cents per minute for phone calls in prisons and large jails, 16 cents per minute for video calls in prisons, and 11 cents per minute for video calls in large jails, though those rates may change again before the rules take effect.

Josh Shapiro visited Philadelphia’s Community Education Center on Aug. 1, 2025 to discuss funding for the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency (PCCD)’s Violence Intervention and Prevention (VIP) program. (Commonwealth Media Services)As the calendar turned to August, the state budget in Pennsylvania is one month overdue. Gov. Josh Shapiro and leaders in the General Assembly have said they are continuing to make progress, but have not reached an agreement.
“We all understand the issues that need to be resolved in order to reach a final agreement,” Shapiro said to reporters in Philadelphia on Friday. “I think we’re working together respectfully to get that done.”
Shapiro said both sides know what the key issues are and it’s frustrating that they have yet to come to an agreement.
“But I also acknowledge that we’re working at a time where we not only have a divided legislature, we’ve got a lot of division in our society, and finding that common ground — that’s critically important,” Shapiro said. “It’s taken longer than I would like, but I think we’re going to get there and we understand the important issues that need to be resolved.”
On July 14, the Democratic-controlled state House advanced a $50.6 billion proposal to the GOP-led state Senate. Since then, House Democrats have maintained that it is up to the Senate for the next step in the process.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) wrote on social media on Wednesday, “We have different visions for the future of the Commonwealth, but we’re working together across the aisle to move this budget forward. Regardless of divided government or political philosophy, some of these issues are just extraordinarily complex & need to be done correctly.”
House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) told Newstalk 103.7 FM on Friday that “it is moving very slowly,” but said the reason why leaders are saying it’s been positive is because “nothing has blown up to a point (that) sides aren’t talking yet.”
“The reason why this is so difficult is because the issues we’re talking about are so transformational in terms of our future, and the two sides simply see it so differently,” he added.
Topper said they want to work towards a compromise, but warned “if we don’t get some of the policy initiative changes in terms of parental empowerment and school choice reform, in terms of entitlement reform and benefit integrity, economic growth and changing our regulatory policy in Pennsylvania, then in three years, we’re going to be looking at either massive … cuts that will significantly affect a lot of people in their everyday lives, or a massive tax increase, which nobody’s going to want to see.”
One of the issues that has taken center stage during negotiations is funding for mass transit agencies, as service cuts and fare hikes loom the longer the impasse continues. In June, the House passed a transportation funding package that would provide nearly $300 million of new funding into mass transit and a half-billion dollars to repair roads and bridges.
Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D-Allegheny) said during an update on budget negotiations Friday that mass transit funding is “high” on the list of priorities.

“Our Senate Democratic Caucus stands ready with 23 votes to support Gov. Shapiro’s proposal with respect to mass transit funding for the whole commonwealth,” Costa said. 
Costa also highlighted funding for roads and bridges, education, and protecting social and human service programs as important.
At least two Republicans in the Senate would need to support funding for mass transit, even if every Democrat voted for the package.
On Thursday evening, Pittman said, “Our state is faced with a structural deficit just like SEPTA. Along with the discussion of any additional dollars for mass transit, this reality necessitates meaningful reforms and accountability measures must be implemented to ensure the long-term success of mass transit.”
Shapiro told reporters on Friday he understands “how critically important” mass transit funding is for the state, noting that he proposed it twice in his budget and that he previously flexed federal highway funds in November to stave off immediate fare hikes and increases for SEPTA.
“We’re going to keep working at that issue,” Shapiro said.
Last week, three Republican Senators introduced a package of bills that would provide additional oversight and new accountability measures over SEPTA. However, the package did not include funding.
When asked if he supported the proposals, Shapiro said he wants to “make sure that we fund mass transit, and we will have a broader dialogue of other legislation that may or may not accompany that.”
“I’m not going to get into that here in this setting,” Shapiro said.
SEPTA has been placing signs at bus stops throughout the Philadelphia area warning riders that if funding does not come to the agency, service cuts will begin on Aug. 24. 
“If that person lives in Northeast Philadelphia, call Senator (Joe) Picozzi, who’s a Republican in the state Senate, and tell him to go back to Harrisburg and vote to pass transit funding the way the House Democrats did,” Shapiro said.
Picozzi, who is one of the GOP authors of the SEPTA accountability package, has said he supports funding mass transit. Following Shapiro’s comments, the Republican lawmaker told NBC Philadelphia that “the people of the Great Northeast want to see a better SEPTA. We want funding and accountability for results on fare evasion, safety and cleanliness.”
On Tuesday, Spotlight PA reported Pennsylvania Secretary of the Budget Uri Monson warned that the state wouldn’t be able to make at least $2.5 billion in payments to schools, counties, and others amid the ongoing budget impasse.

Topper criticized that move, claiming that he thought it was “premature for the governor to send that message out,” arguing the state treasurer “can release funds to those, if needed.”
“But at the end of the day, it’s my responsibility and others to ensure that this budget is sustainable and that we’re doing everything we can to get a quality product,” Topper said. “And if the governor wants to try and use some of these tactics to push for any kind of an agenda of his, then I’d like to know…what that agenda is, other than being on TikTok.”
Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) also seemed to ramp up the criticism of Shapiro on Friday, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that those letters are an effort to “just trying to get people all riled up.” She added “this is the biggest gaslighting administration I have ever worked with.”
Costa, the Democratic leader in the Senate, seemed to echo Shapiro’s sentiment saying that “we are moving slowly, slower than I would like of course, but I think at the end of the day, we’re making progress, and I think that’s what’s important for the people of Pennsylvania.”
Shapiro said there is one thing both sides can agree on.
“We all have to compromise, and that’s what we’re doing right now,” he said.

Cindy Holscher, a candidate for governor, is critical of Kelly administration's pressure campaign to deter certain Democrats from running for the job.","Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Johnson County Democrat seeking the party's nomination for governor in 2026, said staff in the administration of Gov. Laura Kelly attempted to pressure Democratic lawmakers into idling their campaigns for governor so a preferred candidate could prevail. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State Sen. Cindy Holscher expressed frustration Friday with behind-the-scene involvement of Gov. Laura Kelly’s staff in attempting to influence who launched a campaign for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Holscher, who announced her bid for governor in June, said she was among three Democrats in the Kansas Senate told by the Kelly administration to stand aside so Democratic primary voters would be more likely to nominate Lawrence attorney Chris Mann in the race to determine who would be the party’s choice to replace the term-limited Kelly.
Holscher said she as well as Sens. Dinah Sykes and Ethan Corson, also of Johnson County, were initially discouraged from impeding Mann’s path in the August 2026 primary for governor.
“All three of us were told basically ‘do not run’ because Chris Mann’s the guy,” Holscher said. “Why are insiders picking candidates? We’re being bullied, essentially.”
After the dust cleared at the end of July, Mann had chosen to launch another campaign for attorney general after narrowly losing to Republican Kris Kobach in 2022. Corson and Holscher had declared their campaigns for governor. Kelly threw her support to Corson. Lt. Gov. David Toland, at one point the presumed frontrunner in a Democratic gubernatorial race, said he wouldn’t run. Sykes remained on the sideline.
Will Lawrence, Kelly’s chief of staff, said the two-term governor met with potential Democratic candidates for governor and offered advice on how each could approach the 2026 election cycle.
“No one told them, ‘You can’t run.’ They can make their own decisions,” Lawrence said. “There’s a lot of give and take in those conversations. It was never forceful. Cindy was the one that kept coming to the governor trying to get her support. The governor kept saying, ‘I’m not going to support you in the governor’s race if that’s what you choose to do.’ The governor was very clear about that.”
Lawrence said Kelly would prefer Democrats didn’t set the stage for grueling primary battles in statewide races.
 
‘Gone backward’
In an interview, Holscher said it was disappointing Lawrence had participated in an effort to essentially anoint a Democratic nominee for governor.
Holscher also asserted Lawrence attempted to leverage future political support from the governor to secure Holscher’s vote for a bill altering regulation of child care facilities and exemptions to vaccination mandates. Holscher said it was concerning that Lawrence wielded financial influence over Democratic campaigns by controlling the governor’s Middle of the Road political action committee.
“This whole situation is what frustrates Democrats,” Holscher said.
She said Democrats suffered under Republican supermajorities in the House and Senate. In the Senate, the GOP edge stands at 31-9 — the same mix as in 2018. The House GOP majority is 88-37, representing the addition of three Republican representatives since 2018.
“If you take a look, you know, we’ve had the governor’s office the past seven years. We haven’t advanced in terms of growing our numbers. We’ve gone backward,” she said.
Lawrence, who has held a leadership role with the governor’s $2.3 million PAC, made a push during the 2024 elections to alter the balance of power in the Legislature. The Republican supermajority was targeted by Democrats because the GOP’s numerical advantage made it easier to override Kelly’s vetoes. Outcome of the 2024 election was a disappointment for Democrats up and down the ballot, Lawrence said.
 
‘Extremely disappointing’
Holscher notified Lawrence in mid-June about her views on the Kelly administration’s involvement in the development of Democratic campaigns for governor. Holscher sent a text to Lawrence, obtained by Kansas Reflector, that included a warning that Holscher would “swiftly hand over all the proof I have to the press” of the governor’s intervention in Democratic campaigns.
“I am so done with the games coming from you and the governor’s office,” Holscher’s message to Lawrence said. “I want to be very clear about something.”
Holscher vowed she would go to the media if anyone affiliated with the Kelly administration “says anything negative about me or my candidacy,” attempted to interfere with Holscher’s hiring of campaign staff or in signing  up volunteers, “does so much as attempt to put a thumb on the scale in any way to interfere with this election” or made use of the Democratic Governors Association, which is led by Kelly, to “impede or negatively influence” her Democratic primary.
In the interview, Lawrence said language used by Holscher in the text could be interpreted as an attempt to intentionally gain something of value from Lawrence or Kelly against their will.
“It would be worthwhile for Cindy to take a look at the statute and reassess how she communicates with people,” Lawrence said. “Extremely disappointing behavior. Questionable behavior. Not someone who has gubernatorial temperament, who has to compromise and negotiate on things every day in this building.”
In a July social media post after Kelly embraced Corson’s candidacy for governor, Holscher offered an explanation as to why Kelly chose to support Corson.
Holscher wrote pressure had been applied by Lawrence regarding an upcoming vote during the 2025 session on House Bill 2045. It rolled back child care safety standards and tinkered with exemptions to vaccination mandates. Holscher voted against the bill, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan votes and was signed into law by Kelly.
“I had received tons of emails from constituents adamantly opposed to the bill,” Holscher’s post said. “The gov and Will (her chief of staff), told me that if I didn’t support it, the governor’s office wouldn’t be supportive of me in future races. I wasn’t going to go against my district and the people I represent, so I voted ‘no.’ So, it looks like they are holding true to that threat.”
Lawrence said he didn’t agree with Holscher’s analysis of meetings the senator had with the governor about the legislation.
“That vote has nothing to do with the gubernatorial election,” Lawrence said.
 
‘Haven’t paid attention’
Holscher, elected to the House in 2016 and to the Senate in 2020, has been endorsed by former Lt. Gov. Lynn Rogers. He served in Kelly’s first term before appointed to the job of Kansas state treasurer in 2021.
Corson, who entered the Senate in 2021, said in an interview at the Capitol that he appreciated Kelly’s expression of support. It was helpful to voters because Kansans wanted the kind of bipartisan, moderate leadership delivered by Kelly since sworn into office in 2019, Corson said.
He said he hadn’t taken notice of social media chatter about Holscher’s claims of how the Kelly administration handled legislators who declined to fall into line with the governor.
“I just haven’t seen any of that,” Corson said. “I haven’t paid attention to it. We’ve been out there talking to folks and trying to meet people in real life.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa Department of Natural Resources reported Friday that air quality in Iowa will be at levels “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Saturday, due to smoke from wildfires in Canada. 
The National Ambient Air Quality Standards advise that fine particulate matter should not exceed averages of 35 micrograms per cubic meter in a 24-hour period. 
Air quality monitoring from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s AirNow site shows a majority of the state in conditions “unhealthy for sensitive groups” with fine particulate measurements above 40 micrograms per cubic meter. A north-central portion of the state was in unhealthy air quality conditions Friday afternoon, with concentrations greater than 50 micrograms per cubic meter.

DNR said while continuous monitors showed exceedances across most of the state beginning on Thursday, final particulate values will not be available until reference monitors have been manually weighed. 
Older adults, people with heart or lung disease, children and outdoor workers are considered sensitive to particulate matter and are advised to limit their intense outdoor activities. 
The department expects the smoky conditions will remain over Iowa until around midnight on Saturday, though some residual impacts may persist Sunday. 
This is not the first time smoke from Canadian wildfires this summer have drifted down to Iowa. The last significant instance occurred in early June.

(Kate Russell)On Friday afternoon, the New Mexico Department of Health announced that a child from another state had visited New Mexico while infected with measles and might have exposed other people at a few locations in Santa Fe — including the popular interactive Meow Wolf installation: House of Eternal Return.



NMDOH says people may have been exposed during the following times and days at the following locations:
10:45 a.m. to 3:45 p.m., Saturday, July 26, Meow Wolf, 1352 Rufina Circle, Santa Fe
10:00 p.m. Friday, July 25 to 12:30 p.m. Saturday, July 26. The Hampton Inn, 3430 Cerrillos Road, Santa Fe



The department says people who have recently been at any location should check check their vaccination status and report any measles symptoms in the next 21 days to their health care providers.
The out-of-state resident’s infection does not count toward New Mexico’s total measles case count, which remains at 96.
“Summer travel can increase the risk of catching measles,” NMDOH medical epidemiologist Dr. Chad Smelser said in a statement. “We urge New Mexicans to be sure they are up to date with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination before traveling.
According to the state, 46,145 New Mexicans received the MMR vaccination between Feb. 1 and July 31.
Measles, one of the most contagious airborne viruses, spreads through contact with droplets from an infected person’ coughs and sneezes. The virus can survive in the air for hours, and can spread days before and after symptoms appear. Additionally, patients can take one to three weeks to develop symptoms such as headache, fever, cough, red eyes and the spotty red rash.
Complications can include ear infections and pneumonia. Health officials urge people with measles to stay home to prevent further spread and contact either a health provider or the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773) for further guidance.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)This week, Utah joined a growing list of states getting requests for confidential voter roll data from the federal Department of Justice. If these states say “no,” the law, federalism, and election security are on their side. That is exactly what they should do.
Back in March, the Trump administration issued an executive order on election integrity. This order sought to standardize some state election laws and security standards, citing federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act and Help America Vote Act. Among other things, it criticized states for embracing various methods of voting and ballot counting.
Fast forward to today. In recent weeks, states from Maine to California (including my home state of Utah) have gotten letters from the federal Department of Justice requesting private voter information. It has been reported that the DOJ told the National Association of Secretaries of State that it intends to send these letters to all 50 states. These letters cite the Help America Vote Act and suggest that the DOJ is seeking to ensure compliance with this federal law.
The requested information includes descriptions of various state election processes and procedures, as well as a state’s “current statewide voter registration list.” The latter presents a serious problem that jeopardizes legal compliance and election integrity.
Some of the information on voter rolls is public information that is required to be public under federal law. On the other hand, some voter roll information is sensitive, private identifying information.
When it comes to disclosing confidential voter roll information, election officials in Utah and elsewhere should follow the wisdom taught to school children in dealing with people pushing harmful things on them: “Just say no.”
Sound legal analysis puts the law on the side of doing so. The federal Privacy Act of 1974 requires federal departments like the DOJ to provide public notice of any effort to collect data – even publicly available data – to allow public discussion and comment on the desired federal data gathering before it takes place. That hasn’t happened. Additionally, states that share voter roll information with the DOJ without entering into data-sharing agreements required by law may be subject to legal liability.
Just as problematic is how the DOJ request for voter roll information undermines election security by making it easier to commit election fraud.
The foundation of the integrity of American elections lies in our tendency to avoid centralizing authority and information regarding elections – prioritizing federalism over politics. Federal entities create voter equipment standards, states typically maintain voter rolls, local election officials handle and count ballots, and voters themselves ensure their ballot remains secure until it is cast.
In other words, widespread voter fraud in the United States under the current system requires the co-opting of all levels of government or society simultaneously. This is why there is so little concrete evidence of actual voter fraud in America, even with so many elections happening every year. There are anecdotal stories that raise the specter of possible fraud, such as when someone’s friend or relative is sent a ballot that they shouldn’t have gotten, but these stories primarily illustrate how the people themselves are preventing possible fraud.
It is federalism – the disbursed responsibilities and safeguards at every level of government across the nation — not top-down federal attempts like this latest DOJ compliance effort, that ensure election integrity.
How much easier would election fraud become if the DOJ collected all voter data in a central database? Potential fraudsters would breathe a sigh of relief if they only had to hack one federal voter database instead of 50 state voter databases.
Whether based on the law or election security principles, and regardless of which party controls the federal executive branch, states should say “no” to the federal DOJ request for private voter information. They will be protecting election integrity if they do.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Election-Day_40-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 18:56:24.876573

(Photo by Twenty47studio/ Getty Images)Maine Public will “still be here for you tomorrow,” said the organization’s president and CEO, Rick Schneider, after news broke Friday that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be shuttering its doors due to a lack of federal funding.
The announcement came just one day after a major Senate appropriations bill omitted funding for the nonprofit that funds public media and a week after President Donald Trump signed a bill into law that yanked $1.1 billion in previously approved spending for CPB. 
Schneider said while the news is not a surprise, it is still “a very sad day to see that CPB is actually taking the steps to wind down.” 
He said after Congress voted to rescind previously approved public media funding, it was “inevitable, but it is still a blow to see it happening. That said, it’s not the end of PBS programming, or of NPR, or of Maine Public.” 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

 
Maine Public was slated to receive about $2.5 million in grants from CPB for the coming year and $5 million over the next two years, Schneider said, noting this amounts to 12% of its overall budget. Maine Public will now have to “figure out different ways” to plug that budget hole, he added. 
Since the Trump administration first announced its intentions to claw back public media funding, there has been “an outpouring of support for local public broadcasting stations” nationally and in Maine, Schneider said. 
“We are grateful for all the people stepping up now, and we will have to convince them and let them know that this is support that we will need on an ongoing basis,” he added. He also emphasized his gratitude for the listeners who contacted lawmakers in support of public media.
The state also contributes 9% of Maine Public’s budget, but Schenider explained that covers costs for the extensive network of transmitters across Maine. As the only statewide broadcaster, with seven FM stations, he said the organization is the “backbone” of Maine’s emergency alert system, coordinating with the Maine Emergency Management Agency to get alerts out that are then picked up by commercial broadcasters.
It is not yet clear what CPB’s closure will mean for the out-of-state public radio programming that is picked up by the local broadcaster. Schneider explained that local outlets pay dues to NPR, which make it possible to produce distributed programming, “but if there are less stations, or less stations that can pay those fees, we are all interconnected, and that will be hard.”

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Chris Jones, the unsuccessful 2022 Democratic candidate for Arkansas governor, will challenge Republican U.S. Rep. French Hill in the 2026 congressional election.
Jones filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on July 21. He has yet to make a formal campaign announcement.
Hill has represented Arkansas’ 2nd Congressional District since 2015, encompassing much of Central Arkansas. As of 2022, the district consists of most of Pulaski County and all of Saline, Faulkner, Perry, Van Buren, Cleburne and White counties. Hill and Jones both live in Little Rock, which is split between the 1st, 2nd and 4th congressional districts.

Chris Jones statement of candidacy 
Jones is a pastor and scientist who grew up in Pine Bluff. His first foray into politics was his 2022 gubernatorial candidacy, in which he defeated four Democratic primary opponents but lost the general election, receiving 35% of the vote compared to Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ 63%.
Since then, Jones has co-chaired the national Dirt Road Democrats political action committee. He ran for, but did not win, a vice chair position on the Democratic National Committee.
Hill is a banker and a former aide to Sanders’ father, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. Hill filed his 2026 statement of candidacy with the FEC in November 2024, shortly after winning reelection to his sixth term.
The Democratic Party of Arkansas called Hill “a rubber stamp to [President Donald] Trump’s extremely unpopular agenda” in a Friday statement on Jones’ anticipated run for Hill’s seat.
“It’s clear: Arkansans deserve better, and it’s no surprise that Democrats are stepping up to make their case to voters,” party spokesperson Micah Wallace said in the news release. “…We’re anticipating a robust primary, and we’re wishing all of the candidates the best on the trail.”
Jones will face Zackary Huffman in next year’s Democratic primary, while Hill will face Chase McDowell in the Republican primary, according to FEC documents.
Last year, Hill defeated Democratic retired Army Col. Marcus Jones, 59% to 41%. Hill also survived challenges from then-state Sen. Joyce Elliott in 2020 and then-Rep. Clarke Tucker in 2018.
Arkansas farmer challenges Cotton for U.S. Senate seat

Arkansas’ other three U.S. representatives — Rick Crawford of the 1st District, Steve Womack of the 3rd District and Bruce Westerman of the 4th District — also filed FEC statements of candidacy in November.
All six of Arkansas’ members of Congress are Republicans, and U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton has said he will seek a third term next year. Hallie Shoffner, a Newport farmer and businesswoman, announced her Democratic bid for Cotton’s seat in May. James Russell III, who lost the 2022 gubernatorial primary to Chris Jones, has also announced his Democratic candidacy for Cotton’s seat.
Additionally, Jonathan Pittman of Forrest City and Dan Whitfield of Bella Vista have both filed FEC statements of candidacy in the Democratic Senate primary.

Without use of the town's water and sewer systems, Twin Pines Housing is prepared to walk away from the Upper Valley project, the nonprofit's executive director Andrew Winter said.

This story by Emma-Roth Wells was first published in the Valley News on July 30, 2025.
HARTFORD — The Norwich Farmers’ Market and Twin Pines Housing both have big plans for a parcel in Norwich, but in order for those plans to come fruition, the nonprofits need access to Hartford’s water and sewer infrastructure.
Last week, the Hartford Selectboard voted unanimously (outgoing board member Brandon Smith and Chairwoman Mary Erdei were absent) to continue exploring the possibility of allowing the two nonprofits to hook up to Hartford’s infrastructure.
The town has the capacity to support these projects but a study needs to be done, at the nonprofits’ expense, to see whether there needs to be upgrades to the system downstream to ensure no current water and sewer customers would be negatively affected, Chris Holzwarth, Hartford’s assistant director of planning and permitting, said during the meeting.
Allowing Twin Pines and the market to hook-up to Hartford’s infrastructure could be a money maker for the town.
“This is essentially revenue in,” Holzwarth said.
The board’s vote came after it heard a presentation by Andrew Winter, executive director of Twin Pines Housing, and Peggy Allen, board member of the Upper Valley Agricultural Association and co-owner of Junction Fiber Mill.
“We were thrilled the Selectboard was willing to entertain this initial request,” Winter said in a phone interview.
The Upper Valley Agricultural Association, a nonprofit formed by the Norwich Farmers’ Market, has signed a purchase and sale agreement to buy a 35-acre parcel for $750,000 across Route 5 from the market’s current summer location. The aim of the purchase is to give the market a permanent location and more space.
Twin Pines Housing — a nonprofit that develops and manages affordable housing in the Upper Valley — hopes to build approximately 30 affordable rental units on land owned by the Unitarian Universalist Congregation of the Upper Valley on Palmer Court adjacent to the farmers’ market’s new parcel.
The Unitarian Universalist church’s property is one of two lots in Norwich that is already served by Hartford water and sewer, John Haverstock, Hartford’s town manager, said. The other is The Family Place Parent Child Center, located across the street from the church.
Both nonprofits say access to to Hartford’s water and sewer infrastructure is important to allow the projects to move forward.
Without Hartford’s municipal water and sewer, Twin Pines is prepared to walk away from the Norwich project, Winter said.
“There’s a lot of risk without public water,” he said.
In 2023, Twin Pines applied for a permit to connect to the New London-Springfield Water Precinct system for a 60-unit workforce housing project on Country Road in New London. The precinct denied the project, citing a lack of capacity on the system.
After the denial, Twin Pines drilled five wells before getting one with sufficient water supply, only to find the ground water had been contaminated by a nearby dry cleaning business.
The project is still tied up over water access issues.
“It’s cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Winter said during the meeting. “It’s something that we’re not prepared to undertake again because you don’t know when you’re drilling for wells what you’re going to find.”
The Norwich rental units would be the first of their kind in the town. The town’s affordable housing is limited to Starlake Village, an affordable home ownership program with 14 houses managed by Twin Pines, and 24 units of affordable senior housing owned by the Norwich Housing Corporation, a nonprofit developed in the 1970s, Winter said.
“Folks have said to me frequently that Norwich really needs to do its part,” Winter said during the meeting referring to Norwich’s lack of affordable housing. “We need water and sewer to do that.”
Twin Pines has been discouraged from exploring housing development in Norwich because of the lack of infrastructure, Winter said.
Meanwhile the Farmers’ Market is committed to carrying out plans for a 7,000-square-foot building on the new parcel even without Hartford’s infrastructure. Still, a feasibility study found that building a septic system to support a building of that size on the property would be challenging, Allen said.
The farmers’ market currently leases property from Co-op Food Stores from May to October for its summer market and holds its winter market in Tracy Hall.
Overall, the Farmers’ Market “is an incredible success,” Allen said at the meeting.
The market, which will have its 50th anniversary next year, has up to 2,500 patrons each Saturday in the summer season, Allen said.
For some of the farms that have a regular spot, sales at the market represent 50-75% of their annual income, Allen said. “It is a vital outlet for the farms in our region,” she said.
But the market could be better. “A lot of locals are choosing not to go because the parking is abysmal,” she said. Flooding, cars getting stuck and vendors being “knee-deep in mud” at the summer market is also an issue.
In addition to addressing the parking situation, the plan aims to give vendors “a little more elbow room,” by constructing the building to host the market and agricultural education year-round, Allen said.
“We’re just incredibly excited about the potential to have an open space with parking,” she said.
Allen envisions workshops on how to preserve produce, seminars on invasive species and lessons on how to conserve land all held at the potential building.
“This market that represents the Upper Valley deserves a permanent home,” she said.
Hartford resident Linda Miller spoke out in support of the projects at last week’s meeting.
“This is the first time I’ve heard a proposal for a project from Twin Pines that I’m so excited about,” she said. “It’s answering the question I’ve been asking: Why aren’t other towns stepping forward? And this will be another town stepping forward.”
A former vendor at the Norwich Farmers’ Market, Miller said she has not been to the market this summer because of the lack of parking. “I miss it, so this would be huge if Norwich Farmers’ Market could move across the street and have a little elbow room,” she said.
While both projects are still in the preliminary stages and no final decisions about whether either will be able to use Hartford’s water and sewer have been made, Selectboard member Miranda Dupre expressed her excitement.
“I’m really proud of our town and nonprofits for working across these lines,” she said.
Winter expects studying the feasibility of using Hartford’s water and sewer system for the projects will be completed over the course of the next year.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA) A report from the Center for Rural Affairs found that funding from the Inflation Reduction Act had a “significant impact” on the adoption of conservation practices in Iowa. 
The report examined two popular programs that fund practices to improve soil health, water quality or conservation. The boost in funding to these programs from IRA was redirected by the recently enacted federal tax and spending bill, but the programs are set to persist through 2031 with an increased baseline.
The report focused on the Conservation Stewardship Program, or CSP, and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP, both of which help farmers implement more sustainable practices by helping to cover some of the costs.

EQIP and CSP popular programs 
— Cover crops: A practice of seeding a crop between cash crops cycles to keep roots in the soil. This can improve soil health and keep nutrients and soil in a field rather than washing off.
— Rotational grazing: Ranchers move livestock between multiple pastures to prevent overgrazing. This allows healthy pastures and often a greater diversity of vegetation in the fields as cattle eat, defecate and move plant material around. 
— No till/reduced tillage: Farmers reduce or stop tilling the land which helps to keep nutrients and soil on the field and keeps sequestered carbon in the ground. 

EQIP funding is typically used to support one element, like supplementing the cost of seeding a cover crop on a field, or the cost of fencing for a rancher who wants to implement rotational grazing practices. 
CSP contracts are usually longer than EQIP contracts and require producers to implement multiple regenerative or conservation practices in their operations. 
According to the report, these programs have been historically oversubscribed, with only about 25% of applicants receiving contracts in 2022. 
The Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022, allocated $8.45 billion for EQIP and $3.25 billion for CSP through 2026. 
This allocation significantly increased the funding that was allocated under the 2018 Farm Bill. 
IRA funding meant Iowa had a 77% increase in CSP obligations and a 108% increase in EQIP obligations in 2024 compared to 2022, according to the report. 
“The underlying significance of this data is that Iowa was able to forward 100% of the funding they received for EQIP and CSP from the IRA on to Iowa’s farmers,” Kalee Olson, who authored the report,  said in a release. “It demonstrates the dedication of local (Natural Resources Conservation Service) staff and the willingness of producers to go the extra mile for their operations and our natural resources.”
Contracts funded by IRA had to employ “climate-smart agriculture practices” which the NRCS defined as those that respond “to climate change by reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and adapting and building resilience (adaptation), while sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes.” 
Practices included cover crops, planting pasture or hay, planting in critical areas, no till, prescribed grazing and more.

According to the report, cover cropping and tillage reduction were the most popular methods utilized by Iowa farmers with CSP or EQIP contracts. An analysis in the report shows eight of the top 10 practices implemented by farmers in these contracts in 2023 and 2024 were climate smart practices, regardless of if the project was funded by IRA or not. 
The report said there is “no indication” that interest in the programs will decline, and that the additional funding has made a “significant impact” on the implementation of practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state. 
“Moving forward, lawmakers and other federal decision makers must support policy and administrative action that continue to meet the demand of producers in Iowa and across the nation,” the report said. 
The IRA funding was set to stretch through 2031, but much of the law has since been scrapped since the change in administration. 
The tax and spending cuts package known as the “one big beautiful” law rescinded unobligated IRA funding for EQIP, CSP and several other conservation programs with USDA, but it increased the permanent farm bill baselines for the programs. 
Under law, which President Donald Trump signed July 4, EQIP is funded by fiscal year at $2.6 billion for 2026, $2.8 billion for 2027, and $3.2 billion annually from 2028-2031. CSP funding under the bill is at $1.3 billion for 2026, $1.3 billion for 2027, $1.3 billion for 2028, and $1.3 billion annually for 2029 through 2031.
An analysis of the bill from American Farm Bureau Federation said this funding represents a “redirection” of IRA funding rather than program expansions.

It came days after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier threatened the mayor and all six county commissioners that their failure to do so would result in their removal from office by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
“Yeah, we signed the damn thing because we really had to. We were put in a tough spot,” Demings said during a late afternoon press conference in Orlando. “I can’t let our entire board of county commissioners and myself be removed from office.”
Demings signed an addendum to modify the 287(g) Warrant Service Officer (WSO) Memorandum of Agreement that will allow county jail officials to transport immigration detainees to ICE facilities — although he said he still needs to assess the readiness of his corrections department staff to do so while keeping everyone safe at the county jail. He said that there are 212 vacancies within the Orange County corrections department right now, a vacancy rate of 24%.
Speaking in Orlando earlier on Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis said that local governments could apply for grants from the state to reimburse their costs for detaining and transporting detainees. “I think the detention transport, that’s something that would be appropriate to do, and we approved the guidelines for the grants to go out,” he said.
In his letter posted on X earlier this week (which Demings said his office had just received on Friday), Uthmeier wrote that 
	

	rohibiting your corrections officers from transporting arrested aliens to ICE-approved detention facilities squarely prevents your corrections officers from cooperating with ICE and participating in federal immigration operations.”
Failure to back down, he added, would result in removal from office by DeSantis.
Demings, the former chief of police for Orlando who has led Orange County since 2018, said earlier this week that he was not going to allow Uthmeier to “bully” him or other Orange County leaders. But he said on Friday that with the possibility that not signing the addendum would allow DeSantis to “insert his minions,” he really had no choice in the matter.
“I thought it was urgent that we had to take action now to preclude the possibility that the elected body here in Orange County could be removed from office,” he said. “I hope you understand that. That was a calculated risk that we had, obviously. People that had no elected responsibility to our county would be inserted or put in place. That would be catastrophic to the continuity of government here in Orange County. That is something that I certainly did not want to happen.”
Uthmeier and DeSantis have previously asserted that other local governments in Florida that do not fully cooperate with ICE would be defined as employing “sanctuary” policies, which are prohibited in Florida.
In doing so, they ensured that local governments in Fort Myers and Key West ultimately did sign 287(g) agreements with ICE, though in fact cities are not legally required to sign such agreements under Florida law — even if counties are.
Demings said he didn’t understand why state officials had to be so confrontational when it came to enforcing immigration policy in Florida.
“We’re not enemies,” he said. “Local governments are subdivisions of the state. Our state officials in government should act like it. They should remember that we are part of the state of Florida. The state of Florida works best when we work in collaboration, across political lines. The comments I’m making today have nothing to do with partisan politics. It has everything to do with public safety in our community.”
The Orange County Commission must still approve the addendum. Members are scheduled to meet next Tuesday.

(Photo by Daniel Sone/National Cancer Institute)The world’s leading manufacturer of DNA sequencing systems will pay $9.8 million to resolve allegations that it knowingly sold products with security vulnerabilities to federal agencies, Rhode Island’s Acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom announced Thursday.    
The settlement avoids a lengthy court battle for biotech manufacturer Illumina by ending a 2023 suit filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island by whistleblower Erica Lenore, a former platform management director at the San Diego company who raised concerns about product security and was eventually let go. 
The $9.8 million settlement allocates $1.9 million to Lenore for initiating the suit and cooperating with federal agencies. Another $4.3 million is specifically labeled as restitution for the government. The company also needs to pay 4.33% interest on the settlement money, backdated to March 2025. 
The settlement text does not specify how the remaining funds are broken down. The court case, which has now been dismissed and unsealed, rested upon the False Claims Act, which allows for prosecution of people and companies who knowingly defraud the government. False Claims settlements typically include money for other penalties or court fees. 
The settlement resolves the government’s civil allegations, and the government has not filed any criminal charges against Illumina, although the settlement allows for future legal action. A separate agreement settles Lenore’s personal civil claims.  
According to the 2023 court filing, Rhode Island’s federal court was eligible for jurisdiction over the case because of a research initiative at the University of Rhode Island — the Rhode Island IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence — that is funded in part by National Institutes of Health grants and used Illumina equipment. 
The lawsuit says that university researchers used the company’s MiSeq line, which was recalled in 2023 over cybersecurity concerns.
Thursday’s settlement was obtained through a joint effort by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Rhode Island, and the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch and Fraud Section, with additional assistance from other federal investigators.
Among the federal agencies that purchased and used vulnerable Illumina products from 2016 to 2023 were the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, the Interior, Energy, Commerce and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Smithsonian, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
Since 2001, Illumina has received $530 million in direct federal funding, with $43 million in 2022 alone, according to court documents. It also receives pass-through money via Medicare reimbursements, as clinical labs use Illumina systems for genetic testing. 
The security issues in Illumina’s products “allowed thousands of Illumina insiders and everyday users of its products the ability to access and manipulate HIPAA-protected patient genomic data including test results and to do so without detection,” the suit argued. 
Christine Douglass, a spokesperson for Illumina, shared a statement via email Thursday that denied the allegations. The company settled, Douglass wrote, to forego “the uncertainty, expense, and distraction of litigation.” As part of the settlement, it did not admit any wrongdoing. 
“Government agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), are important customers and Illumina values these relationships,” Douglass said. “Illumina takes data security seriously and has invested significantly in its programs to align with cybersecurity best practices for the development and deployment of our products. We are pleased to put this matter behind us.”
Douglass said that Illumina “successfully remediated” security issues for its customers from 2022 to 2024.

What the lawsuit says 
The 72-page lawsuit explains that Illumina is the only servicer for its products, like the MiniSeq and NextSeq, both of which are named in the suit. Because Illumina is the only servicer for its products across their lifecycle, the company needs to contract with government agencies to provide maintenance as needed. 
The lawsuit alleged these government contracts were violated when it was discovered that Illumina had been selling products with unaddressed security holes, such as human-readable passwords coded into software.
“Illumina improperly hard-coded credentials used to access confidential patient genomic data stored in the cloud, allowing everyday users to see the login information in plain text,” the lawsuit alleged.  
Another vulnerability involved software that was too liberal with elevated privileges for user accounts. That meant that “thousands of everyday users,” could exert considerable control over Illumina systems.
“Illumina has improperly allowed elevated privileges to users running genetic tests on Illumina products that are connected to an open network,” the suit reads. “These users include everyone — research assistants, third-party vendors, laboratory technicians, scientists, clinical investigators, engineers, and research and development staff — individuals who have no need for access to confidential and HIPAA-protected patient data including genomic test results.”
Federal prosecutors strengthened their case for False Claims Act liability with several eyebrow-raising examples that the company was verifying compliance with government standards while knowing otherwise. In 2022, Illumina initiated a product recall only after its customer, the pharmaceutical giant Roche, informed it of a vulnerability in its sequencing software. Roche routinely tests software and hardware it uses for security flaws, but according to prosecutors, Illumina had not performed its own testing on the product in question.     
The lawsuit says that, in another instance, an internal Illumina report noted that a product it was about to launch could most likely be hacked by “a disgruntled ex- or current staff member, with access to the [local] network.” Illumina launched the product three days later and did not disclose the security concerns to the feds.
Lumina did recall products multiple times, but the court complaint calls some of these efforts a “half-truth,” as Illumina allowed different products with the same vulnerabilities to stay on the market.
The company, which made $4.372 billion last year, accounts for about 80% market share of the genomic sequencing industry. Their products are used in research, medicine, and commercial gene testing.
“Illumina’s cybersecurity failures have been driven by its singular goal to maintain its dominant market presence,” the complaint reads. “When faced with customer complaints related to the accessibility of data in its products, Illumina took fatal shortcuts.” 
Whistleblower Lenore — described in the complaint as a “respected professional in the field of life sciences technologies and was hired by Illumina to oversee all of Illumina’s on-market products” — noticed some of these shortcuts during her time at the company, during which she balanced overlapping roles in product management. 
Lenore became concerned about security issues that popped up and repeatedly brought her concerns to higher-ups, but was “ignored, reprimanded, marginalized, and retaliated against by Illumina.” Lenore ultimately lost her job in what the company called a “restructuring,” the lawsuit reads.

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Friday that she’s joined a multistate lawsuit challenging the Trump administration’s effort to restrict access to medically-necessary care for transgender, intersex and nonbinary youth.
The lawsuit challenges recent federal action to deter doctors and medical providers from offering gender affirming care to youth under the age of 19 years old, including states like Michigan where that care is legal and protected.
Nessel and other attorneys general have asserted that President Donald Trump’s White House is overstepping its authority, using threats of criminal prosecution and federal investigations to pressure health care providers.
“The Trump Administration is attempting to strip away lawful, essential healthcare from vulnerable youth. These orders are illegal and dangerous and have no medical or scientific basis,” Nessel in a statement. “I will continue to protect families, defend doctors, and stop politicians from putting our kids’ lives at risk.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump in the beginning of this second administration signed an executive order stating that the U.S. would only recognize two sexes, and called for an end to what Trump labeled “gender ideology.” A second order focused on medical restrictions, directing the U.S. Department of Justice to pursue enforcement actions related to that care.
Since then, Nessel’s office said the Department of Justice has issued subpoenas to providers under the guise of criminal law enforcement, but the attorneys general filing the lawsuit Friday argue those efforts lack legal standing and are intended only to intimidate.
“Health care decisions for kids should be made by parents and doctors, not by politicians,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, a LGBTQ+ advocacy group, in a statement. “The federal government is using funding as a weapon to force providers to abandon their patients and override parents’ rights to make health care decisions for their own children.”
Patricia Wells, a doctor and the medical director of The Corner Health Center, said in a statement that she and her colleagues are distressed by new punitive changes to funding and regulations, which threaten to dismantle essential care.
As Trump admin axes LGBTQ+ crisis support, ally parents are offering support for trans youth

“These policies do not protect children; they endanger them,” Wells said. “They undermine trust in the medical system and place affirming providers in an impossible position, forcing hospitals to close clinics and providers to stop offering the very care that helps young people survive and thrive. The loss of these services would not simply be a policy failure; it would be a moral one.”
Wells said the nation must do better. 
“These young people deserve our compassion, our evidence-based care, and our unwavering commitment to their well-being,” she said. “I applaud the leadership of the state of Michigan for protecting transgender and gender nonconforming youth, their families, and the caregivers who are saving lives every day.”

(Providence City Council Photo)Providence City Councilor Helen Anthony announced Friday she will step down from her post Sept. 1, citing her continued recovery from injuries sustained in a serious accident in a California state park two years ago. 
The Ward 2 councilwoman, who chairs the council’s finance committee, announced her resignation in a letter to her constituents Friday.
“As I continue to heal from the traumatic injuries I suffered when I was struck by a van in June 2023, my neurologist has recommended that I devote more time to my recovery,” Anthony wrote. “I’m proud to have served Ward 2 and the City of Providence and to have chaired the council’s Finance Committee. Unfortunately, the demands of those roles is hindering my ability to heal.”
Anthony, who has served on the council since 2019, also submitted a formal resignation letter to the city clerk, which will be on the agenda for the City Council’s next meeting on Sept.4. The City Council is in recess for August.
The council will formally accept Anthony’s resignation at its September meeting, triggering a special election within 90 days, per the city charter. The Board of Canvassers will set the date once the seat is officially declared vacant. 
Ward 2 covers a portion of the capital city’s East Side and includes the neighborhoods of Blackstone, College Hill, and Wayland.
“The residents of Ward 2 have had a wonderful representative; residents of every neighborhood have had a steadfast advocate in Helen,” Council President Rachel Miller said in a Friday statement. “While I will miss her leadership on the council, and in particular her deft stewardship of the Finance Committee, I am proud of her decision to prioritize her health.” 
“As Helen’s colleague and friend, I was in awe of her resilience and tenacity as she recovered from the accident, and I am in awe of the grace with which she is making this difficult decision today,” Miller added.
Anthony was struck by a large, van-sized ATV in a crosswalk at Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, the Boston Globe reported in October 2023. The vehicle’s driver, an 82 year-old park volunteer, had mistakenly hit the gas pedal. Anthony’s extensive injuries — including a brain bleed, broken bones, and a bruised heart — required her to be hospitalized in California for more than two weeks, where she underwent multiple surgeries. She returned to the City Council in October 2023. 
“I take immense pride in the stands I have taken for transparency. It was not always easy, but I have done my best to communicate with you and to represent the city’s long-term interests,” Anthony wrote in her letter to constituents. “This year’s budget was particularly difficult given the financial challenges facing the city. While no single councilor can solve the city’s problems, I am proud that my team and I set a new bar for educating colleagues and residents about how the city’s budget and taxation processes work, and striving to encourage meaningful public input.”
During the transition period after Anthony leaves her post, the City Council Office encourages Ward 2 residents with concerns or questions to call constituent services at (401) 521-7477 or email council@providenceri.gov.

The dwellings would be a mix of rental, for-sale and rehabbed properties in a 770-block area around the streetcar’s initial downtown-midtown route, which is set to be up and running in 2027.
They’re to be targeted to people making under a certain income. And they’ll be built by developers selected by Front Porch Investments, the nonprofit partner the city chose to distribute the millions in the form of grants and low-interest loans.

Friday, Mayor John Ewing Jr. and Jody Holston, Front Porch’s executive director, laid out more details of the vision Ewing shared with the Nebraska Examiner earlier this week. 
It comes as Nebraska towns statewide continue to seek ways to tackle what a 2023 state report deemed a housing crisis. The report said the state’s economic future hinged on solutions, and called for goals including cutting the share of low- to- moderate-income households paying more than 30% of their earnings for rent from about 44% to 33%.
 It’s personal 

Streetcar supporters previously said that affordable housing, bike routes and other mobility improvements would be possible with the tax-increment financing stream the city is counting on to cover its streetcar cost. The city recently increased its estimate of how much the city’s portion of streetcar costs would be, to $421 million.
Ewing said his newly announced strategy — if approved by the necessary channels that include the Omaha City Council — would allow related housing production to start as soon as 2026, years before the 2031 or later that the project’s supporters previously envisioned.
Omaha mayor urges ‘single largest investment’ in affordable housing, with help from streetcar

Beefing up the city’s affordable housing options was an issue Ewing campaigned on, and one he described Friday as personal. He said his own parents weren’t able to buy their first home until he was 15, a sophomore in high school.
“I understand the importance of affordable housing and what it means … when it comes to providing stability for families and children, as well as the opportunity to begin to build generational wealth,” he said.
 Anonymous funder

City officials, during a news conference at City Hall, described the financing strategy this way:
An “anonymous funder” has offered to buy $40 million in city bonds, which the city would grant to Front Porch to start distributing to housing developers.
The city would guarantee payback from tax-increment financing (TIF), tied to the streetcar. TIF is a state-authorized tool that, upon city approval, essentially allows future property taxes generated on an improved site to go toward paying qualified redevelopment expenses.
Steve Jensen, an Omaha mayoral aide, said the city has anticipated that the streetcar will spur $4 billion in new development that’s expected to generate $980 million in new property taxes. He said the city council earlier approved total bond funding of $490 million, and specified that $440 million (and related interest) could go to streetcar construction.

When the private funder buys the $40 million in municipal bonds, it would generate immediate funds, accelerating the ability of the city to spend part of the money on affordable housing. The remaining $10 million would be available, he said, for later housing, biking or mobility projects.
“There will be no citywide property tax rate increase, no money diverted from other city projects and no money used from properties outside the streetcar corridor,” said a city statement. “Only revenue from new or redeveloped income-producing commercial and multi-family properties within the corridor will be used to fund the streetcar, affordable housing  bikeways or other mobility improvements.”
Critics of TIF point out, however, that new property taxes generated on TIF-related development are diverted for up to 20 years from other traditional property tax recipients such as schools and local governments.
 North and South Omaha? 

More specifically, city officials said, the boundaries in which this batch of housing units can be created is Cuming Street to the north, Woolworth/William Streets to the south, the Missouri River to the east and as far as 50th Avenue to the west.
While that does not cover the hearts of North and South Omaha, Holston said Front Porch’s ongoing program currently serves the North and South Omaha areas. Ewing said he hopes to expand farther into North and South Omaha later, but that the boundaries are limited currently to the current TIF streetcar zone and the Urban Core Housing and Mobility Redevelopment Plan that must be amended. 
Holston of Front Porch called the partnership a “perfect example” of what is possible when city leadership and community priorities align. Front Porch has a history with the city, as the former Mayor Jean Stothert administration in 2022 granted the nonprofit $20 million from the city’s share of federal ARPA funds to boost affordable housing options.
Results so far from that fund are the basis for the estimated number of housing units expected to come from the $40 million, 1,900 homes. 
As of July, the city’s ARPA funds, matched by $20 million from philanthropic sources, have led to 2,359 new or rehabbed units, nearly 1,700 of which are described as affordable. About $5 million from the original fund remains.

What is affordable? Holston said the projects Front Porch selects for funding typically are restricted for 20 years for people who make under a certain income.  Eligible income levels can vary, she said, but homes generally would be limited to households making 30% to 80% of the area’s median income, and others to those earning 80% to 120% of median income.
 ‘Uniquely positioned’

Holston said Front Porch is “uniquely positioned” to partner in the venture, as it has been working for four years to close the local affordable housing gap.
“The cost of building any type of housing continues to increase due to construction costs, labor, interest rates, insurance,” she said. Without gap funding, developers and housing advocates are hard-pressed to find ways to make homes available to lower-income and working families.
She said stable housing offers benefits including enhanced educational and health outcomes and worker retention.
“We have the opportunity to ensure that families can meet their basic needs while setting them on a course toward financial stability,” Ewing said. “I’m so excited we’ll be able to do it at this scale and at this time.”

(Dave Britton/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)This story originally published Thursday on Idaho Reports. 
Two-thirds of the way through summer, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced it has not yet detected any quagga mussels after two years of aggressive treatment in the Snake River.
However, the microscopic mussel veligers were not detected in the water near Twin Falls until late September in both 2023 and 2024. ISDA treated the infected river with a copper-based solution both years.
“Monitoring efforts in the Snake River are ongoing and remain a top priority. While early negative results are a good sign, long-term monitoring is essential to determine the full effectiveness of treatments,” according to an ISDA press release.
The department has collected over 200 negative samples from the affected area this season, the press release said.
The department said it has collected more than 2,500 water samples statewide this year to test for quagga mussels.
The Idaho Fish and Game Commission on April 15 rescinded their closure of the Snake River near Twin Falls to hunting, fishing, and trapping. The closure had been in place since September 29, 2023.
All watercraft entering or moving throughout the state must be clean, drained, and dry to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species.
All watercraft entering or exiting the section of the Snake River between Broken Bridge (Yingst Grade) and Hansen Bridge must undergo mandatory inspection prior to launch and decontamination upon exit.
According to ISDA, the Centennial Waterfront Park, Shoshone Falls, and Twin Falls Reservoir check stations have completed over 16,361 inspections so far this year.
“Our roadside watercraft inspection stations along with our roving crews have completed more than 112,479 inspections,” the department noted. “We are on track to break our record of 157,356 inspections from 2024.”

Five months after President Donald Trump announced he was nominating a former Wyoming game warden to lead the federal agency, the confirmation process is complete. 
The post Trump’s pick Nesvik confirmed as Fish and Wildlife director with some bipartisan support appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming’s former top wildlife official is now the nation’s top wildlife official.
It’s a post that puts Brian Nesvik in charge of achieving the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s mission, which is to “conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people.”
Confirming Nesvik was a protracted process, not unusual for the Trump administration’s other political nominees in the opening half year of the administration. At around 1 p.m. Friday, however, a vote materialized and Congress’ upper chamber voted mostly along party lines 54-43 to confirm the nomination.  
Two western state Democrats defected from the pack and voted to confirm Nesvik: Sen. Jacky Rosen of  Nevada and Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico.

All Republican senators who were present for the roll-call vote submitted an aye, which was not surprising. In many circles, and especially in Wyoming, Nesvik’s appointment was received favorably. 
“There simply has never been a more qualified Director for the agency,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement issued shortly after the Senate’s vote on Friday. “He brings decades of wildlife expertise, a collaborative approach to addressing complex issues, and exemplary leadership to the role.”

Gordon named Endangered Species Act reform and grizzly bear delisting as top issues he’s eager to take on with his former Game and Fish director at the helm of the federal agency. 
Sen. Cynthia Lummis, Wyoming’s junior senator, also broadcast her praise, calling Nesvik a “breath of fresh air.” 
“Brian brings a proven track record from Wyoming, where he effectively collaborated with federal, state and local partners to achieve important conservation goals,” Lummis said in a statement. 
Praise for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife’s new director isn’t universal. Around the time of his first confirmation hearing, where Nesvik fielded little criticism, a coalition of 125 organizations signed onto a letter opposing his nomination. The oppositional parties included the Wyoming-based organizations Wyoming Untrapped and Wyoming Wildlife Advocates.
“In 2024, Nesvik faced major national blowback after his agency failed to take strong action against a man who ran over a young female wolf with his snowmobile,” the letter stated. “Mr. Nesvik’s lackadaisical response to the tormenting of the young Wyoming wolf speaks volumes about his lack of care for wildlife and is a foreshadowing of the attitude he will bring to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.” 
A development in that case came just this week: Sublette County law enforcement officials are convening a grand jury to consider a felony animal cruelty indictment of the wolf captor, Cody Roberts.

A longtime member of the Wyoming Army National Guard, Nesvik rose through the ranks at the Wyoming Game and Fish Department after being hired as a warden in 1995. After wardening stints in Casper, Elk Mountain and Pinedale, he took a post supervising the state agency’s Cody Region in 2010. He also spent many years working as Game and Fish’s lead mounted horse patrol instructor. 
A promotion to chief warden brought Nesvik to Cheyenne in 2011, and in 2019, he was promoted by Gordon to direct Game and Fish. He retired last fall. 
The U.S. Senate delayed its summer recess this week to make progress on reducing a long list of appointees — more than 100 positions  — who lacked confirmation. The sluggishness of the approvals has been a source of frustration for the Republicans who hold the majority. 
Nesvik is joined by another Wyomingite at the Trump administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service. Josh Coursey, a co-founder of the Muley Fanatic Foundation, was named senior advisor to the director in April. That position did not require a Senate confirmation. 
The duo will have their work cut out for them in running a federal agency that struggled mightily with a lack of resources even before Trump’s friend-turned-foe, Elon Musk, slashed into the staff through his Department of Government Efficiency. A recent inventory from within the Fish and Wildlife Service found that out of 573 national wildlife refuges around the country, not a single property had adequate staff and funding to “fully achieve administration, management and mission goals and objectives.”

The worker in question had been on the staff for roughly one month. In a written statement referenced by inspectors in their report, the worker indicated he didn’t understand that the resident needed physical assistance standing and showering and so he sat a few feet away from the bathroom while the resident showered. Within a minute of the resident entering the shower, the worker reportedly wrote, the man fell.
“I lacked the proper training on the proper stand-by procedure,” the worker allegedly wrote in his statement. “Due to this lack of training, I thought the shower mat that’s normally down — but was up that day — should remain up.” … and “once [Tenant C1’s] in the bathroom, I leave the bathroom as to what I was taught before and leave the door half open while I sit in a nearby chair … Around a minute into the shower he falls.”
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing fined Allen Place $10,000.
Other Iowa care facilities recently fined by the DIAL include:
— Hallmar Village, a Cedar Rapids nursing home where a resident sustained two broken legs while being transferred to bed in a mechanical lift, was fined $20,500 by the state. The resident was facing amputation of one leg before being assigned to hospice care a few days later, according to state records.
Inspectors reported that one employee of the home, a certified nursing assistant, indicated the staff at the home had been using a modified method of using the mechanical lift with the resident that involved the use of a pillow and avoided the use of leg straps intended for safe transfers. The CNA reportedly told inspectors she felt the modifications by the staff posed a risk to the resident and said she relayed her concerns to a nurse.
The CNA also told inspectors that because the transfer process looked unsafe, she asked to work a different floor at the home. A state review of training records indicated the nurse and two CNAs at the home “did not have training on the use of a mechanical lift,” according to inspectors.
— Bickford Cottage I, a Sioux City assisted living center, was fined $7,000 after a resident wandered from the facility on July 5 and wasn’t found for several hours. The resident was admitted to a local hospital due to acute kidney injury, dehydration and elevated creatine levels.
— Windsor Manor, a Grinnell assisted living center, was fined $5,000 after a male resident of the home was given seven separate medications intended for someone else. The resident who was mistakenly given the drugs became unresponsive and was admitted for a short time to a local hospital.
— Azria Health-Longview, a Missouri Valley nursing home, was fined $7,000 after a resident fell on June 30 and sustained a serious head injury. Inspectors noted the facility was to have placed non-skid strips near the resident’s bed, but the work order calling for that to be done included the wrong bed number. The resident suffered multiple facial fractures and had to be hospitalized. As of July 16, the resident was still hospitalized.
— Bickford Cottage, an Iowa City assisted living center, was fined $5,000 after a female resident wandered from the facility about 8 p.m. on June 1. About one hour later, an off-duty paramedic found the woman 1.3 miles from the facility.

This week, Montana added to that history by beginning the constitutional initiative process aimed at challenging dark money, corporate spending and the Citizens United ruling.
Leaders who have signed on the measure admit: They have a steep hill to climb. Citizens United, decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, said that the power to spend money in elections is tantamount to free speech and so most attempts to thwart or limit it have run afoul of the U.S. Constitution and the nation’s highest courts.
However, the wording of the new initiative seeks to limit the amount of money corporations can spend – not through traditional campaign laws or limitations, but rather by limiting corporate charters.
The new and untested method would leverage the state’s inherent power to regulate corporates through the charter process. The language of the proposed state constitutional amendment would prohibit corporations from making political contributions, except in very specific circumstances. Meanwhile, individuals would be free to spend on candidates and causes.
The idea, said Jeff Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, is conservative in nature: The state has the power to put limits on the corporations it charters to do business in the state; this one would simply not allow them the power to participate in elections directly, while still leaving a path for political action committees.
The key, Mangan said, is about transparency. He said the current system allows private corporations to be established and collect money, but to keep those donors and the amounts hidden from public view. Those corporations, which can consist with as few as one donor, can give to candidates and causes under the corporation name, although the people supporting that corporation and the amount of money donated are unknown, leading to the term “dark money.”
The change in Montana law would simply not grant the corporations the power to give to candidates or causes, but would allow individuals to give, but those donations would be tracked.
The proposed legislation is the first-of-its-kind and takes a different approach to the problem of campaign finance in spending. For example, last year’s U.S. Senate race in Montana, which saw Republican Tim Sheehy beat incumbent Democrat Jon Tester, had more than $275 million spent in a state of roughly 1.2 million people.
“Basically the only difference is that corporations won’t be able to spend in our elections,” Mangan said.
The specifics of the proposed constitutional amendment would carve out exceptions for organizations like political parties and even media organizations whose coverage could possibly run afoul of the amendment’s language.
“If a person wants to spend money, then they have to put their name on it. It’s full disclosure. That’s what this is all about,” Mangan said.
Constance Van Kley, an assistant professor at the University of Montana law school, said it’s unknown whether this idea will get around the Citizens United ruling, as well as clear the First Amendment, but she said it nonetheless attempts a new solution.
“There’s nothing that I am aware of that squarely forecloses it, though,” Van Kley said.
She teaches constitutional law in Missoula and said that since the United States Supreme Court has said that money equals political speech, and political speech is the most protected part of free speech. Many campaign finance laws have been evaluated in terms of whether they restrict, prohibit or curtail free speech. However, Van Kley said, this initiative is different and limits corporations using the power states have inherently in their power to issue a charter.
“The question that has not been decided to my knowledge is whether this can get by the First Amendment,” she said.
Mangan told the Daily Montanan it eliminates the vaguely named organizations, which often become nothing more than shields to hide where the money is coming from.
“This is not limiting anyone’s speech. They have the right to do whatever they want with their money, they just have to put their name to it,” Mangan said. “But it has to come from individuals. And, I think the individuals — the rank-and-file folks — they are tired of the money in politics and they’re just waiting for someone to do something about it.”
He said because of the Citizens United decision and its connection to free speech and the First Amendment, many believe the solution to the dark money in politics is insurmountable.
“Many citizens are just resigned. You know: It is what it is,” Mangan said. “People are born, but corporations are created with rights by a piece of paper and pen. That means that states can change corporate rules the same way. States have always had the right to change charters.”
Mangan said he expects opposition from corporations who like putting money into campaigns to protect their business interests. However, people who work for companies or corporations may not like or support their employer’s political decisions. This initiative, Mangan said, would stop that.
Van Kley said that this measure is different because not many politicians have been actively fighting against the Citizens United ruling because the decision has meant a tidal wave of money pouring into both parties, despite the public being opposed to the ruling. Van Kley said the movement to change campaign financing has not had state legislatures and politicians chipping away at it like the countless challenges to other issues, like abortion, which finally chiseled it away enough to lead to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade. She said that makes this particularly constitutional initiative a challenge to predict because so much of it has not been explored by the courts.
“Especially in Citizens United, most people have thought that the only pushback to it would be by an amendment (to the U.S. Constitution) because it involves freedom of speech,” Van Kley said. “Is it the first step to rethinking First Amendment and campaign finance law?
The initiative has several major hurdles to clear before it would even get in front of the voters. The language must first be approved and checked with the Attorney General’s Office. Then initiative supporters must collect signatures throughout the state, a daunting task because of the requirements. The initiative will take about 63,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot, so Mangan said they’ll likely need to aim for double that amount just to ensure those signatures can all be verified.
“We trying to get things back to the way they were,” he said. “We tell them right up front, we’ll be transparent with our donors for anyone who ask. Montanans shouldn’t have to do this. It shouldn’t cost this much. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican, it just doesn’t make sense.”
Van Kley also sees this initiative as a bit of history repeating itself.
“Montana and Alaska,” she said. “They have been the places that have had incredibly rich natural resource and not a lot of people, which has made them victims of extraordinary political corruption, historically.”
 



 
 THE MONTANA PLAN PROPOSED BALLOT STATEMENT 


CI ____ would amend Article XIII of the Montana Constitution to redefine the powers of artificial “persons,” including corporations. It defines their powers as only those the constitution expressly grants and provides that artificial persons have no power to spend money or anything of value on elections or ballot issues. It affirms that the people of Montana never intended for artificial persons to have the power to spend on elections or ballot issues. CI ____ provides that actions beyond those expressly granted powers are void. The initiative permits political committees to be granted the power to spend on elections and ballot issues. It allows enforcement through forfeiture of state-conferred privileges. The initiative includes a clause that ensures that valid portions of the initiative remain effective even if other parts are invalidated.
 



 





 THE COMPLETE TEXT OF CONSTITUTIONAL INITIATIVE NO. *** (CI-***)


BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF MONTANA:
NEW SECTION. Section 1. Article XIII of The Constitution of the State of Montana is amended by adding a new section 8 that reads:

Section 8. Powers of Artificial Persons.
(1) Artificial Persons exist only by grant of the state and shall have no powers or privileges except those this constitution expressly provides.

(2) (a) The legislature may by statute create Artificial Persons consistent with subsection (1).
(b) The people never did, and do not, intend the powers of Artificial Persons to include Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity. This section retracts all Artificial Persons’ powers and re-grants only those powers that the people deem necessary or convenient to carry out an Artificial Person’s lawful business or charitable purposes, as described in (3)(e). Powers related to Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity shall not be deemed necessary or convenient to those purposes.

(3) Definitions.


(a) “Artificial Person” means every entity whose existence or limited-liability shield is conferred by Montana law, including, without limitation:

(i) business corporations;
(ii) nonprofit corporations (public-benefit, mutual-benefit, religious);
(iii) limited-liability companies;
(iv) unincorporated associations, limited-liability partnerships, statutory trusts, professional corporations, cooperatives, and any successor form;
(v) Foreign Entities that are authorized to transact business, are otherwise transacting business, or hold property in Montana. Any Foreign Entity that directly or indirectly undertakes, finances, or directs Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity in the state of Montana is conclusively deemed to be transacting business in this state.


(b) “Election Activity” means paying, contributing, or expending money or anything of value to support or oppose a candidate, political party, or political committee.
(c) “Ballot-Issue Activity” means paying, contributing, or expending money or anything of value to support or oppose a ballot question or initiative.
(d) Election Activity and Ballot-Issue Activity do not include any bona fide news story, commentary, or editorial distributed through the facilities of any broadcasting station, or of any print, online, or digital newspaper, magazine, blog, or other periodical publication, unless such broadcasting, print, online, or digital facilities are owned or controlled by a political party, political committee, or candidate.
(e) “Artificial Person Powers” means powers necessary or convenient to carry out lawful business or charitable purposes, excluding any power to directly or indirectly engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity.
(f) “Charter Privilege” means any benefit to Artificial Persons that exists only because the state of Montana confers it, such as, without limitation, limited liability, perpetual duration, succession in its corporate name, and tax credits and abatements.
(g) “Foreign Entity” means an Artificial Person organized or existing under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the state of Montana.


(4) Total Revocation of Previous Power Grants.

(a) The creation and continued existence of an Artificial Person is not a right but a conditional grant of legal status by the state and remains subject to complete withdrawal at any time. All powers previously granted to any Artificial Person under Montana law are revoked in their entirety. No Artificial Person operating under the jurisdiction of this state shall possess any power unless specifically granted by this constitution. No provision of this constitution grants or recognizes any power of an Artificial Person to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity, except as provided in (5)(c).
(b) Transitional Safe Harbor. Nothing in (4)(a) shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or modify any existing contract, debt instrument, security, or other legal obligation validly entered into before the effective date of [this act]; provided, however, that nothing herein authorizes any Election Activity or Ballot Issue Activity after the effective date.



(5) Selective Re-Grant of Artificial Person Powers.

(a) Each Artificial Person possesses the powers defined in (3)(e), unless its organizational documents limit the exercise of such powers, and no powers beyond those expressly granted. No provision of this constitution grants or recognizes any power of an Artificial Person to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity, except as provided in (5)(c).
(b) Any language in articles of incorporation, organization, association, or other organizational documents purporting to directly or indirectly confer Election-Activity authority or Ballot-Issue-Activity authority to Artificial Persons is void.
(c) Political committees registered under Montana or federal law are entities created for the purpose of engaging in Election Activity and Ballot-Issue Activity. Such committees may be granted the power to engage in those activities provided that they exist solely for that purpose and claim no Charter Privilege other than limited liability. This constitution does not grant any other Artificial Person the power to engage in Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity.
(d) No Charter Privilege shall be construed to authorize Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity. An Artificial Person that exercises Election-Activity authority or Ballot-Issue-Activity authority, unless expressly permitted to do so under (5)(c), initially forfeits all Charter Privileges as a matter of law. The legislature shall, during its first regular session following the effective date of [this act], enact procedures that allow reinstatement upon full disgorgement, certification of compliance, and payment of civil penalties.


(6) Ultra Vires Actions. Any Election Activity or Ballot-Issue Activity conducted by an Artificial Person is ultra vires and void. Such conduct results in the forfeiture of Charter Privileges as provided in (5)(d) and shall also be subject to civil action by a member, shareholder, or the attorney general for injunctive relief, disgorgement, and confirmation or enforcement of the forfeiture. The legislature shall, during its first regular session following the effective date of [this act], enact procedures for such civil actions.
(7) Severability. If any provision of [this act], or its application to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the remaining provisions and applications that are severable shall remain in effect. In such event, no prior grant of corporate powers shall be revived or reinstated, nor shall any court construe [this act] to authorize broader powers than are expressly conferred in [this act].

NEW SECTION. Section 2. Effective date. [This act] is effective January 1, 2027.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dollar-wave.jpg,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

Blatchford (Diné) — a photographer, artist and activist — told Source New Mexico in an interview that the complicated and obscure world of uranium mining can make activism difficult, especially given that the legacy of uranium mining in Indigenous communities here started as a clandestine project. 
“It feels intimidating. And I think that was the intention of the federal government, to make it this censored thing, because it was a secret to begin with,” she said.

The exhibit opening at Center is today from 5 to 7 p.m. The exhibit runs until Aug. 26. 
The counter mapping workshop is Aug. 14 from 5 to 8 p.m.

The Friday opening of the Anti-Uranium Mapping Project at CENTER in Santa Fe seeks to, among other objectives, counteract that censorship and intimidation. And it represents a grand unveiling of years of intense work and lifelong curiosity about Blatchford’s roots to the Navajo Nation and its landscape. 
While she’s given various presentations and held exhibits in other states, the homecoming to CENTER is the first time she’s had full creative control over how the project is displayed. And it’s in Santa Fe, where she has lived more than a decade.
The exhibit opens amid a renewed push for uranium mining in New Mexico and shortly after the Navajo Nation reached an agreement with Energy Fuels, a global mining company, to transport uranium across the nation from a mine near the Grand Canyon to a mill in Utah. 
On the New Mexico side of the Navajo Nation, the federal government has recently prioritized several uranium mine proposals here that have been pending for more than a decade. The projects are near Mount Taylor, a sacred mountain to several pueblos in New Mexico, as well as the Navajo people. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

Blatchford moved to Santa Fe from California more than a decade ago to attend the Santa Fe Institute of Art and Design. After her mother began a genealogical investigation into her birth parents in the early 1990s, Blatchford as a child visited Santa Fe and reconnected with her aunt and uncle on the Navajo Nation. 
Her interest in the hidden world of uranium mining began shortly after she moved here for college. Once settled, she began poring over satellite imagery of the Navajo Nation to find her aunt’s house, where she had idyllic memories of visiting as a kid. 
“I was just trying to get to my aunt’s house from memory without having to call my mom and get directions. And through that, I was on Google Earth, and that’s when I found this, like, weird black smear, and kind of, like, geometric shapes in the landscape beyond the hills where I remember going on that motorcycle ride with my uncle.”
The “smear” was a giant coal mine, she said. The horror of that discovery led her down a rabbit hole that eventually ended at uranium. Since at least 2011, she’s been gathering photos and maps and stories, along with compiling resources, for a website and in-person exhibit.
Navajo advocates say prez’s approval of uranium transport, Trump coal order feels like a betrayal

Part of her goal is to reclaim the maps used as a tool to plunder resources. Maps are central to the public’s understanding of uranium, she said, but they are also “top down” and “clinical,” showing enforced borders and sterile data. 
“But I feel like, once you come down to the 45-degree angle, and you see the landscape, you get this middle ground of information between the two worlds,” she said. “ And I feel like intuitively, you just have more of a connection and empathy is being instilled. As you’re gathering new information, you’re still kind of grounded somehow.”
Visitors can expect that immersive view of the landscape and people, including photos and videos, and educational material as part of the month-long exhibit. It will focus primarily on the Church Rock spill of 1979. 
On Aug. 14, Blatchford will also host a “counter mapping workshop.” As part of that, she asks participants to annotate top-down maps of the Four Corners region, with the boundaries of tribes and pueblo reservations outlined. 
Among the questions she asks: 
“Have you or someone you know been impacted by uranium mining? If so, please mark the location on the map and write what feels comfortable to share,” and;
“How have maps enforced colonial conquest and the imposition of capitalist property relations around the world?”
A participant at a recent workshop at the University of New Mexico responded: “Maps carry the sense of ‘free land’ that must be ‘claimed’ by people of power who don’t care about community and respect, but rather see land and want it for the power and resources.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Church_Rock_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069
,DC,2025-08-01 21:26:09+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,‘A gun to a knife fight’: Democrats' chief pledges a more pugnacious party in more states,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/gun-knife-fight-democrats-chief-pledges-more-pugnacious-party-more-states,,"PORTLAND, Oregon — Democrats must be more aggressive organizers and campaigners to win back the working-class coalition they have increasingly lost to President Donald Trump, according to Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin.Too often in recent decades, the party has ceded ground to Republicans, Martin told States Newsroom in a one-on-one July 31 interview during a stop on a visit to community groups, activists and fundraisers in Oregon.Since 2009, the national party’s infrastructure has deteriorated, allowing the GOP to build organizational advantages across the country, define Democratic candidates before they can define themselves and put too many states out of reach, he said.In sometimes more pugnacious terms than might be expected from someone with Martin’s clean-cut corporate look and Midwestern demeanor, he said his task as party leader is to reverse that trend.“We’re not here to tie one of our hands behind our back,” Martin said. “In the past, I think our party would bring a pencil to a knife fight. We’re going to bring a gun to a knife fight.”The knife-fight analogy was an answer to a question about how Democrats should respond to Texas Republicans redrawing congressional district lines as the GOP struggles to keep its slim U.S. House majority, but it could apply to other aspects of Martin’s vision for the party.Martin, whom Democrats elected in February to lead them for the next four years, said Democrats should never turn off their messaging and campaigning apparatus, and work to build party infrastructure in regions, states and cities where they have not competed in decades.Over 45 minutes, he invoked the late U.S. Sen. Paul Wellstone, a liberal whose populist approach to campaigning and governing practically sanctified him among Democrats in Martin’s native Minnesota, several times and indicated Wellstone would be an effective model for Democrats in 2024 and beyond.“I think what the American people are looking for is people who are going to stand up and fight for what they believe in,” he said. “People didn’t always agree with Paul Wellstone all the time, but they still voted for him. They said … ‘He’s not one of these finger-in-the-wind politicians. He’s standing up for what he believes, and I’m going to give him credit for it even if I don’t agree with him on a particular issue.’ They want authenticity.”Texas redistrictingThe day after Texas Republicans released a map of proposed new congressional districts in a rare mid-decade redistricting effort that could net them five more U.S. House seats, Martin implied he would support blue-state leaders who retaliated with their own maps to give Democrats an advantage — even as he disparaged the move by Republicans.He called the redistricting effort “a craven power grab” by Trump and Republicans, accusing them of “trying to rig the system.”“If they can't win on their own merits, they're going to cheat and steal,” he said. “That's essentially what they're doing right now.”But, even as Martin condemned those moves, he said Democrats should feel empowered to respond in kind. “We can’t be the only party that’s playing by the rules,” he said.Leading Democrats in California, New York and Illinois have openly explored the possibility of emergency redistricting if the proposed Texas map becomes final, even though the issue has raised the ire of some usual allies who support less partisan election infrastructure.The national party would be “very involved” in challenging the Texas map, as well as working with governors seeking to change their own maps, Martin said.Never stop campaigningMartin brought up, unprompted, some of the challenges his party faces.Twice as many voters had an unfavorable view of Democrats as a favorable one in a July Wall Street Journal survey that showed the party with only 33% of support.Voters now see Republicans as the party of working-class voters and Democrats as representatives of the elite, Martin said. In the 2024 election, the party did worse with nearly every slice of the electorate other than college-educated voters and wealthy voters.Martin noted Trump made historic inroads with some traditional Democratic constituencies, earning a higher share of Latino, Black, Asian and Pacific Islander, young and working-class voters in 2024 than any Republican candidate in years.That result was part of an ongoing trend going back 20 years, Martin said, and represents an existential threat to the Democratic party.“We lost ground with every part of our coalition,” he said. “If we continue to lose ground with working people in this country, with all of the other parts of our coalition, we’re toast. We’ve got to reverse course.”Democrats’ slide with those constituencies is in part “a branding issue,” permitted by the party’s willingness to let Trump and other Republicans’ campaigning in off-years go unanswered and a lack of a positive message articulated to voters, said Martin.“We didn’t start our campaign until the spring of 2024 — way too late,” he said. “I would argue that they had already defined us before we ever had a chance to define ourselves. That can never happen again. Never, ever, ever. So that means we have to be campaigning all the time, year-round. Year-round organizing, year-round communications. We never stop talking to voters. We never stop campaigning.”‘We all do better’That campaigning should be focused on a positive view of what Democrats offer voters and include an appeal to “the vast majority of Americans, not just the people at the top.”“We have to fix our brand,” Martin said. “We have to give people a sense that we're fighting for them. We have to stand up and fight with everything we have right now, not just against Donald Trump, but for something. We have to give people a positive vision of what their lives would look like with Democrats in charge.”Democrats’ message should be about a rising tide lifting all boats, Martin said, quoting Wellstone, for whom Martin, 52, interned at the beginning of his career and still considers an inspiration.“Remember Paul’s famous slogan: ‘We all do better when we all do better,’” he said. “That should be the slogan of the Democratic Party.”He praised Zohran Mamdani, the winner of New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary, for running an energetic campaign that was focused on showing how he could improve New Yorkers’ lives.That should include a policy focus on affordability, health care access and a government that works for people beyond the elite.But even as Martin articulated the positive message he said Democrats should focus on, he slipped into slamming Trump and Republicans, saying the tax and spending cuts law Trump signed last month would take health care away from people. The law was among the least popular in decades, he noted.There was room for both a positive campaigning and highlighting Republicans’ unpopularity when appropriate, said Martin.“It’s a both/and,” he said. “Let’s tell folks what is happening and let’s tell folks what Democrats are going to do.”Senate in reach?The unpopularity of Republicans’ law, which is projected to cut more than $1 trillion over 10 years from Medicaid, food stamps and other programs while lowering taxes on high earners, gives Democrats an opening in a difficult cycle for U.S. Senate races, Martin said.Democrats — who control 47 seats, including two independents, compared to 53 for Republicans, who also hold a tie-breaking vote in Vice President JD Vance — need to net four additional seats in next year’s elections to win the majority in the chamber, which Martin said was possible under the right circumstances.That view is out of step with current projections, which show Democratic seats in Georgia and Michigan at least as likely to flip as Republican seats in North Carolina and Maine. Democrats would have to win all four of those most competitive races, plus two that would be further stretches, to gain a majority.Beyond North Carolina and Maine, Martin said the map to Democrats’ regaining the Senate would go through traditionally red states.Iowa, where incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst could be vulnerable, and Alaska, where former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola would be a strong challenger to incumbent Republican Dan Sullivan, could be Democrats’ 50th and 51st Senate seats, he said.Or, if right-wing primary challengers defeat more establishment incumbents in Louisiana and Texas, those states could turn into pickup opportunities, he said — though Trump won both states easily, by more than 20 points in the former.Growing the party, growing the mapTo win next year and beyond, Democrats must unify, he said.Elements of the party that would impose purity tests on others — whether that’s progressives excluding moderates or vice versa — make that harder, he said.“I believe you win elections by addition, not subtraction,” he said. “You win by bringing in people, new voices, and growing your coalition.”Martin also wants to grow the map and compete across the country, using a strategy pioneered by former DNC Chair Howard Dean, who was chair from 2005 to 2009.When President Barack Obama’s political team took control of the party apparatus in 2009, it “completely eviscerated” the state party infrastructure Dean had built, Martin said.Earlier this year, he announced an initiative to provide at least $1 million a month to all state parties. The goal is to expand the number of competitive states and districts, reversing a trend that has seen fewer presidential contests focused on fewer states.“There's no such thing as a perpetual red state or a perpetual blue state,” he said. Turning states from Republican strongholds to competitive, or from competitive to favoring Democrats — or even to maintain Democratic strength — takes investment of money and energy, he said.“It's critical, and it's something I firmly believe in,” he said. I've seen for so many years our national party and other party committees not making the investments to actually call themselves a national party,” he said. “You can't be a national party if you're just competing in seven states.”",,,,2025-08-01 17:57:02.864069

Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of notorious financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein — and his  convicted co-conspirator — has been moved from the federal prison in Florida’s capital city to a minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas.
David Oscar Markus, Maxwell’s Florida lawyer, confirmed in an email that Maxwell had been moved but declined all further comment. Maxwell’s relocation — which happened on Thursday — was first reported by the New York Sun.
It was just last week that Maxwell met with highly placed officials from the U.S. Department of Justice as calls have grown for the release of all files related to Epstein. Epstein died in his New York City jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal charges for sex trafficking minors. He pleaded guilty in 2008 in Florida to procuring and soliciting minors for sex.
Before they entered office, several officials in the administration of President Donald Trump had vowed to open the Epstein files amid speculation about the true nature of his death and his associates. But then, in early July, Attorney General Pam Bondi and others insisted that he had killed himself and that there was no incriminating “client list.”
The uproar over that assertion eventually prompted Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to meet with Maxwell inside the federal courthouse located about four miles from the federal prison where she was incarcerated.
Last week Markus, who is with the firm Markus/Moss PLLC, told reporters that during that meeting that Blanche “asked a lot of questions, and Ms. Maxwell answered every single question. She never invoked a privilege, she never declined to answer.”
Members of Congress had also been pushing to talk to Maxwell but earlier this week it was reported that Maxwell’s attorney told Congress that she needed immunity or a reduction in her 20-year sentence. She also wanted to push her testimony until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules on her pending appeal.
On Friday, POLITICO reported that Rep. James Comer, chair of the U.S. House Oversight Committee, had agreed to indefinitely postpone her testimony but said Congress would not offer her immunity.
Some Trump opponents lashed out at the decision to transfer Maxwell, saying her new home is a “cushy” location and questioned why a “registered sex offender” would be moved unless she has a deal pending with the Trump administration.
“They have put herself somewhere that is very, very comfortable,” said long-time Trump critic Rick Wilson on a video he put out on Friday afternoon. “Ghislaine Maxwell being moved to the cushiest federal prison that there is is not a coincidence. It is not a routine transfer. Something happened here that caused this to occur.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)South Dakota’s secretary of state is taking responsibility for the release of sensitive voter registration data, after her office published a spreadsheet that labeled thousands of residents as having registered to vote at government assistance agencies.
“As Secretary of State, I take full responsibility for the release of this information. My office is committed to both transparency and protecting voter privacy,” Secretary of State Monae Johnson said in a statement. “Upon discovering the issue, we acted immediately to remove the data and prevent further dissemination.”
The data was posted online following the passage of a new law requiring the state’s full voter registration list to be freely available to the public. But among the fields included in the data was “Source of Registration,” which publicly identified people who registered at offices for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, or the Women, Infants and Children program. 
In all, 7,186 people were labeled as having registered to vote while applying for public assistance, according to a Searchlight analysis.

This drew criticism from lawmakers and the public alike.
“This is what happens when you put the wrong people in charge,” said state House Minority Leader Erin Healy, D-Sioux Falls, who voted against the bill. “We talk a lot about freedom and privacy in this state, so it’s a shame that this legislation led to this type of breach.”
The list contains the information of about 668,419 registered voters — their names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, party registrations and other personal information.
The South Dakota Secretary of State’s Office “apologizes for the disclosure of information,” according to the statement, and is committed to “restoring public trust following this error.”
While voter registration at a public assistance agency does not necessarily mean a person receives benefits, Johnson said her office will notify affected individuals by mail. She said county auditors have also been contacted, and individuals who accessed the original data will be asked to delete any copies.
The new law, which passed earlier this year with some bipartisan support and went into effect in July, was sold as increasing transparency in elections by making voter registration information accessible without a $2,500 fee. Activists who favor the hand-counting of ballots, oppose the use of vote-counting machines and deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election were among those who promoted the legislation as an “election integrity” measure.
The Secretary of State’s Office said voters with concerns are encouraged to contact the office directly.

While Stand With Trans’ Ally Parents Hotline is not a crisis line, Roz Gould Keith, the organization’s founder, said the group is looking to offer love at the other end of the line. 
“A lot of times people call and they just need someone to hear them, right? They just need someone to call them by their chosen name. They need someone to call them by the right pronouns and they don’t necessarily need more than that,” Keith said. 
Sometimes a caller might need advice on coming out to their parents or information like where to find a chest binder, Keith said, and the support person on the line can help them find those resources even if they are not immediately available. 
Stand With Trans’ mission is to support and empower trans youth and their loved ones, Keith explained, and one way to do that is to ensure parents are knowledgeable and have access to resources and support.

A post shared by Stand with Trans (@standwithtrans)



The organization’s Ally Parents program was initially put together in response to the death of Leelah Alcorn, a transgender girl who took her life in 2014 citing a lack of acceptance from her parents. Keith said she was in a Facebook group with other parents of transgender kids, when the idea first came together. 
“We started talking and commiserating, and our hearts were just breaking over this unnecessary tragedy, and we said we have to do something,” Keith said. 
Out of those conversations came Ally Moms, with the group publishing the first names of mothers of trans children, the state where they lived and a phone number where they invited young people to text them for support. 
“There was really nothing out there in the way of resources, and so it was really groundbreaking at the time, and we started getting a lot of texts, and then parents started calling and it kind of expanded,” Keith explained. 
The program became Ally Parents, and expanded to a network of 250 parents across the county in almost every state, Keith explained. 
However, the program became unwieldy, as the organization didn’t have a phone system or a way to process calls, Keith said, with Stand With Trans taking a pause in promoting the program. 

“It was still kind of there in the background. People could see the list on our website, but we didn’t promote it because we really wanted to figure out the best way to secure the calls,” Keith said. 
When Stand With Trans received a grant in 2024, that’s when the hotline came into play, Keith said. The group was able to hire two co-coordinators who Keith said found the perfect platform to host the hotline. 
“People can text or call the toll free number, and it’s for youth, it’s for adult caregivers, really anybody that needs to talk to an ally parent. And so this way it just kind of routes through to the next available person. So it just makes a lot more sense. We don’t have to put anyone’s name or phone number out on the internet,” Keith said. “It came at the best time, because now, with the trans hotline being eliminated, defunded, we’re offering this up.”
Tess Sokolis, one of the program’s co-coordinators, told the Michigan Advance in an email that she connected with Ally Moms in 2018 when her son was five years into his transition. 
“To have found those resources and to have had this community available to us when our son was starting his transition would have been an absolute godsend,” Sokolis said. 
Like many other ally parents in the program, Sokolis said her family faced several hurdles: working to find healthcare for her son after their family doctor refused to care for him; becoming estranged from family members; updating his name and gender on documents and accounts and seeking out colleges that not only offered gender affirming care, but also welcomed trans individuals. 
“We did all of this blindly and by the seats of our pants, but we did it,” Sokolis said.

Alongside her co-coordinator, Dani Jackson, Sokolis said she was brought in to revamp the Ally Parents program amid an increasingly anti-trans political climate. 
“Our process so far has been two-fold: one, contacting every Ally Parent in our database to reconfirm their commitment to the program as we worked to move it forward; and two, creating this hotline and learning it ourselves to then train our parents with the new phone system,” Sokolis said. 
The hotline soft launched at the end of June, Sokolis said, giving them the opportunity to work out any hiccups with the program. Now, there are 30 parents on board to help accept calls, with others working administratively and more being brought on board, Sokolis said. 
“We are saddened at the loss of other national LGBTQIA+ hotlines, but we are happy to give these kids and their loved ones a safe place to land as those are phased out,” Sokolis said. 
For many trans youths, having a service like this can be life changing, Keith said, as many trans kids can feel isolated, especially when they don’t know anyone who shares their identity.

While transgender and nonbinary youth are at a significantly higher risk of suicide than their cisgender peers, research published in Transgender Health found that acceptance by at least one adult or peer significantly reduced that risk. 
For parents, they face a very different journey when their child comes out as trans, Keith said. Even if they support their child unconditionally right out of the gate, they do not know how to find resources or what the next steps are, she said. 
“It truly is life changing when we can offer up that kind of support,” Keith said. “I have a trans son who’s now an adult, but when he came out 12 years ago, we really were alone. There were no resources. And so I know what that feels like, and it is just, when you find one person you can talk to, you will remember that forever.” 
In order for someone to volunteer as an ally parent, they must be the parent of a trans person, Keith explained. They must also fill out an application and undergo a background check. 
Assuming everything goes well, those parents are then given access to training as well as monthly meetings, Keith explained. 
“If answering the phone is not your thing – because some people don’t feel comfortable with that, right – then there are other ways that they can get involved,” Keith said.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Employees at one of Washington state’s largest health agencies are bracing for layoffs due to ongoing funding challenges.
Though how many could lose their jobs and when aren’t known, the leader of the Washington Health Care Authority told workers in a Wednesday email that she “didn’t want to wait to let you know that layoffs will be part of our path forward.”
“Despite significant efforts to close our budget gap, we’ve reached a point where workforce reductions will be necessary,” wrote MaryAnne Lindeblad, the agency’s interim director who will hand the baton to a new executive this month. “These decisions are not a reflection of anyone’s performance or value; they’re driven by the size of our shortfall and the structure of our funding.”
With roughly 1,900 employees, the agency is responsible for purchasing and coordinating health care services, including behavioral health treatment, for 2.7 million residents.
It administers the state’s Medicaid program known as Apple Health and health benefits for public and school employees. As of June, more than 1.9 million Washington residents, including over 850,000 children, were enrolled in Apple Health, according to the state Health Care Authority. 
In June, Gov. Bob Ferguson hired Ryan Moran, Maryland’s deputy health secretary, to be the new Health Care Authority director. HIs first day is Aug. 18.
A Health Care Authority spokesperson did not say if Moran had been consulted on the email before Lindeblad sent it out. 
Nor did the spokesperson say if the layoffs are due to the agency receiving fewer dollars in the state budget or to the tangible threat posed by new federal rules for Medicaid funding.
“A reduction in force at HCA is deeply difficult news for employees and the communities we serve,” said Katie Pope, deputy chief communications director, in an email. “We are working to responsibly manage limited resources while continuing to meet our legal and programmatic commitments to Washington residents.”
Mike Yestramski, president of the Washington Federation of State Employees, said the union had not received formal notice of layoffs as required in collective bargaining agreements. The union represents 54,000 state government, higher education and public service workers including ones at the Health Care Authority.
“Folks are definitely concerned. They are definitely worried,” he said. “It is a combination. They wonder how long. ‘I survived this round. Will I be around for the next one?’”
What’s happening at the Health Care Authority isn’t an anomaly. State workers have lost jobs or been pressed into lower-paying positions in recent months as agencies comply with cost-cutting directives from the governor and reduced funding for some programs in the state budget.

One example is the Department of Health where layoffs totaled 44 as of June 30. Less state dollars and the loss of federal pandemic money were the reasons. Further layoffs are anticipated as a result of state and federal budget reductions, a spokesperson said.
According to the Office of Financial Management, 176 people lost their jobs in the fiscal year that ended June 30 with another 96 bumping into a different position. 
The figure could surge in the coming 12 months because lawmakers did not fund 1,385 full-time-equivalent positions in state government in the current fiscal year, according to the governor’s budget office.
“We knew there would be rounds of layoffs,” Yestramski said. 
Agency leaders seem to be trying to minimize the impacts on people, he said. In some places, positions are kept vacant and thus available for someone to bump into without bumping someone else out of their job, he said.
“But you can’t get away without some folks getting harmed,” Yestramski said.
In June, Washington’s Employment Security Department started hosting webinars to teach state workers who were laid off, facing a furlough or expecting a workforce reduction about available unemployment benefits and reemployment services.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) New Mexico United States senators introduced federal legislation Friday to expand tree nursery capacity for forest replanting and habitat restoration programs.
U.S. Sens.Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich, both Democrats, joined John Cornyn (R-Texas) to sponsor the bill. The legislation, if passed, would allow funding allocated by the 2022 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to support bigger facilities for seedling nurseries at state forestry, private organizations, nonprofits and higher education institutes.
The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed more $1.5 billion in state and private forestry, including hundreds of millions for reforestation, but cannot be used for building physical structures to increase the nurseries.
The funding would be available for expanding public forestry development, such as the John T. Harrington Forestry Research Center in Mora County.
“In New Mexico and across the country, our forests play a vital role in every community,” Luján said in a statement. “Tragically, over the last 20 years, our country has lost tree cover at an alarming rate, disrupting our ecosystem and the critical benefits it provides. That’s why I’m leading this bipartisan legislation that addresses this shortage by allowing funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to be used to support the development of seedling nurseries and the rapid expansion of crucial seedlings nationwide.”
390 million seedlings: Mora reforestation center sets sights on restoring NM forests

New Mexico’s state forester estimated the state needs between 150 and 390 million seedlings to restore forests in burned areas. Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire burn scar will require 26 million seedlings, researchers said.
The state previously received federal funding to increase the capacity of the nursery in Mora County to eventually grow 5 million seedlings per year. Currently, the center produces just 300,000 seedlings annually.
The center, jointly operated by University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, New Mexico Highlands University and the state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department would seek funds if the bill passes, officials said.
“This bill will provide New Mexico with much-needed support to develop our state nursery and increase the production of drought-tolerant tree seedlings,” said EMNRD Secretary Melanie Kenderdine in a statement. “This legislation will help us grow and plant trees that will stabilize burned watersheds and reduce damage from post-wildfire flooding.”

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)After Democratic state lawmakers and advocates said they feared Gregory Washington’s job as president of George Mason University was in jeopardy as the school faces multiple federal investigations, the governing board on Friday unanimously approved a state-appropriated 1.5% salary increase for him, signaling the security of his future at the institution.
George Mason professors say governing board failed to defend president, university

Attention on Washington and GMU has grown steadily over the past several weeks, after the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice launched four investigations against the school, two of which are related to alleged racial discrimination in employment practices and another that questions the school’s DEI practices.
State leaders also called for a stop to what they characterize as the politicization of Virginia’s colleges after the University of Virginia’s president resigned weeks before the GMU investigations launched, following downward pressure from federal education officials over the school’s DEI policies. 
The board had scheduled a closed session meeting on Friday to discuss Washington’s performance and goals. He presented his state-of-the-institution report, “Navigating Rough Waters,” during Thursday’s annual President’s Conference and Friday’s business meeting. Washington is the first Black president in the school’s history.
“Regardless of how one views the events unfolding at George Mason University, today’s display of unity by the Mason community is inspiring,” Washington said in a statement. “It is a reminder of how centrally important our university is to Northern Virginia’s families and economy. For now, the community can refocus on what really matters most: in just three weeks we will welcome the incoming class of 2025, which is once again the largest, most diverse and one of the most qualified freshman classes in the history of George Mason. Fellow Patriots, you are simply the best. Let’s get back to work.”
The board, which had recently been criticized by faculty members for failing to defend Washington and George Mason as they weathered the federal scrutiny, met for over three hours in closed session with Washington. 
The 1.5% salary bonus aligns with the action proposed by the General Assembly’s budget that was signed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Washington’s salary will increase to $823,452.43.
Board of Visitors Rector Charles Stimson commented on the impending investigations and public concerns before leaving the business meeting.
“We’re gonna fulfill our fiduciary duty, and at George Mason University that means everybody at the university,” Stimson said, adding that the board will “get through this” and “move onto the next level.”
 Alumni and supporters speak out 

Just ahead of Friday’s meeting, Stand With Mason, a group of alumni and GMU supporters publicly stated their opposition to removing Washington from office. Students, faculty and other supporters also stood in the drizzling rain to protest against removing Washington.
In Stand With Mason’s statement, 75% of respondents said they would be concerned about the institution’s reputation if political interference led to the president’s removal. The group surveyed 411 registered voters from Northern Virginia.
“This data could not be clearer: Northern Virginia voters want their public universities focused on education — not politics,” said Brian Drummond, former George Mason Alumni Association President, in a statement. “The Board of Visitors’ actions are not just unpopular — they are dangerously out of step with public opinion, especially as we approach the November elections.”
Jimmy Hazel, former rector on the board, said before the board’s vote on Washington’s that he wouldn’t be surprised if they voted to pause on the matter, considering the outpouring of support and potential negative impact on George Mason. Hazel was part of the search committee that ultimately found Washington.
“They’re realizing there is more at stake than they thought, than just removing somebody from their job,” Hazel said. “From a realistic point of view, the federal investigations aren’t finished yet to take action against the president while the investigations are still ongoing; that just doesn’t make sense.”

Students and faculty members also feared that Washington’s removal could eliminate more initiatives and programs the president has championed. Washington said the institution has paused or terminated 50 projects due to the federal government’s restructuring. 
Savannah Scott and Annabelle Spencer, PhD students in the history department, stood outside for around two hours before the meeting to bring awareness about what’s at stake.
“These things that we’ve seen either get surrendered to the federal government or given up entirely at other universities (are) highly possible here, and I think that’s really concerning to me and us,” Spencer said.
Scott added that Washington has remained “steadfast” in his support for university policies at the cost of upsetting others at higher levels that wish to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. She voiced her concern that Washington might be succeeded by someone who would excessively accommodate the Trump administration.
DEI has been a lightning rod between political parties dating back to the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, when these types of programs were created to assist formerly enslaved Black Americans and give them a fairer chance at educational, financial and social success in American society. 
Public demand for corporate and institutional commitments to treat all Americans fairly emerged during the pandemic in 2020 when Washington was hired. Beginning in 2020, America faced two high-profile examples of racial injustice and unequal opportunity for people of color — the murder of Black Minnesota man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer, and the Supreme Court’s recission of affirmative action policies on college campuses in 2023.

Republicans argue that DEI initiatives present cultural, ideological and political problems. Chief among the concerns is the threat of placing a person’s identity over achievements when determining their qualifications, and “reverse discrimination,” which they say puts the majority, white Americans, at a disadvantage.
During the board’s hours-long review of Washington’s performance, students and faculty members also raised signs and chanted in support of Washington and in opposition to any overreach by Trump and Youngkin, who is responsible for appointing members to the governing board.
On Tuesday, a circuit court judge temporarily suspended four members from serving on GMU’s board after the Virginia Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections rejected the appointees, signaling that the legislature wasn’t willing to confirm the new additions. An additional four were suspended at the University of Virginia and Virginia Military Institute. The case is expected to continue with appeals from Youngkin’s administration.
Tehama Lopez, a faculty member at George Mason, said on Friday she’s been following the investigations in Virginia including one that led to the departure of former UVA President Jim Ryan. Lopez said it hit home for her as a UVA graduate.
“It’s devastating to see what’s happened,” Lopez said. “I wish that President Ryan had not stepped down. I’m sympathetic to what he did, but I believe we need to stand firm and not acquiesce.”
 How Washington made the case for staying

On Thursday, Washington spoke publicly to the senior leadership at George Mason, presenting the institution’s current state highlighted by the school retiring $100 million in debt and earning the designation “higher access, higher earnings” for its top-rated admissions access for Pell Grant recipients and students from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, and the number of students receiving high earnings eight years after graduation. 
The Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education, which assigns the ratings, manages the measurement tool to recognize and describe institutional diversity.
“We’re fulfilling the mission that I believe the individuals who founded this institution had in mind, to have an institution that was going to produce a workforce that could fund their needs and their growth,” Washington said on Thursday. “That mission is being fulfilled here, and we’re reaching people wherever you are. … We don’t care if you’re Black, white, Asian, or other. We put systems in place to support you no matter where you are, and it gets you to the point where you want to be. That’s why students are flocking here because they actually know it.”
Stimson said Thursday that the institution has worked hard to build its successful reputation, and parents considering universities should choose Mason if they want their children to succeed without significant debt.

“Mason isn’t going anywhere,” Stimson said on Thursday. “We are the best university for the best value, for the best outcomes in Virginia, in the DMV.”
Washington also talked about the school’s challenges including multiple investigations by Trump‘s administration and the federal government’s restructuring, which has cut funds for research and financial aid, economic challenges that are projected to result in job, wage, and output losses and enrollment challenges, with some non-U.S. born students prohibited from receiving visas to attend school.
The U.S. House Committee on Judiciary is also investigating Mason for potentially violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and President Donald Trump’s executive order for institutions to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, according to a July 29 letter.
Despite the challenges, Washington said Mason is one of the most efficient institutions in reducing the cost of attendance and graduating a significant portion of Virginia’s workforce.
Washington also presented details on the institution’s fundraising efforts and programs to support students who had dreamed of working for the federal government, as well as displaced federal workers amid the significant workforce changes.
“Why would we do this? Because we are an integral part of the region,” Washington said. “We want the region to be successful, we care about the region and we need it to be successful if we are going to be successful.”

(Photo by Vanesa Brashier/Bluebonnetnews.com)Hispanic, Asian and multiracial residents drove population growth in the United States last year,  and 16 states would have lost population without gains in those groups, according to a new analysis published this week by the Brookings Institution.
In three states where the number of residents declined — Mississippi, Vermont and West Virginia — growth in those communities prevented even greater population loss, according to the analysis.
Immigration drives nation’s population growth

Nationwide, the 1% population growth for the year was mostly fueled by immigration, representing “a much-needed uptick from the historically low population growth of the COVID-19 period, along with the diminishing growth of recent decades,” the Brookings report said.
Recent Census Bureau data breaking down changes by race and Hispanic status show that Hispanic, Asian and multiracial categories made up 93% of the nation’s population growth. The number of Black and Native people also grew but at a much slower rate, while the white population declined.
Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people made up 86% of the growth in Texas, which had the largest population growth for the year at almost 563,000, and 78% of the growth in Florida, which ranked second for growth at about 467,000. California, which grew by about 233,000, would have lost population without growth in those groups.
In addition to California, 15 other states would have lost population, but grew instead, because of larger numbers of Hispanic, Asian and multiracial people: Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington.

Frank of the National Park Service | Public domain via Flickr). The state of Montana has reached an agreement with an exclusive golf club for water usage, after the club was found to be illegally diverting water for its course and trucking in water from nearby communities.
The Department of Natural Resources and Conservation reached an agreement late last month with how Crazy Mountain Ranch was using water. 
The state filed suit against Crazy Mountain Ranch, a Delaware corporation that owns 18,000 acres near Big Timber, in mid-July over an irrigation system it was using for its golf course. The company is a subsidiary of the Yellowstone Club’s parent organization, CrossHarbor Capital Partners. The resort did not have the proper water rights to divert from Rock Creek for irrigation of its golf course.
The agreement, called a “consent decree,” avoided a court battle.
“(This is)  a litigation tool for judicial enforcement signed by the district court judge and used to remedy the violation and ensure future compliance,” Patricia Spencer, a spokesperson in the DNRC’s water division wrote in an email. “The decree requires CMR to stop illegally using water on its golf course.  If CMR purchases water to irrigate, it is required to report the source of the water purchased to DNRC to ensure it complies with the Water Use Act. CMR must also continue to pursue a new permit or change authorization.”
Crazy Mountain Ranch did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“(The ranch) does not have a valid water right that authorizes beneficial use of water for irrigation on the 112 acres of the proposed golf course,” the suit alleged.
In May, court documents said the company told local water users, “the ranch intended to irrigate the golf course regardless of department authorization.” The DNRC then got 12 complaints between its field offices in Bozeman and Helena.
On June 17, water users on Rock Creek and Hammond Creek submitted a “Petition to Enforce Water Court Decree and Appoint Water Commissioner” to the Park County District Court. 
An official with the DNRC was dispatched to investigate the complaints and issued a report in early July. A lawsuit was then filed.
Crazy Mountain Ranch has a permit in process for changes in water usage, court documents stated.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The overdue assessment of the operations and finances of the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is complete and confirms what advocates and agency administrators have been saying for months: There’s no way to save costs without cutting service.
The 119-page report released Friday morning deems RIPTA “an essential service for the region” with a fixed-route service that performs well, especially within urban corridors.
But what can RIPTA do about its $10 million budget shortfall?
“Given the size of the projected operating deficit for FY 2026, RIPTA will likely need to make reductions to fixed-route service,” the report states. 
A sweeping number of cuts are proposed — with plans to eliminate or reduce 58 of RIPTA’s 67 routes — the largest service reduction in the agency’s 59-year history. The agency’s board of directors is scheduled to vote on the cuts on Thursday, Aug. 7, after the last two of 12 public hearings wrap up in Barrington on Wednesday, Aug. 6.
Should the agency’s board of directors move forward with the recommendations, cuts would take effect Sept. 13.
 
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority‘s public hearings on proposed service reductions and a possible bus fare increase in 2027 continue Monday, Aug. 4, with two sessions at the Providence Foundation, from noon to 1:30 p.m and from 5-6:30 p.m.
The final two hearings will be held Wednesday, Aug. 6, at the Barrington Public Library from noon to 1:30 p.m and from 5-6:30 p.m. 
You can submit comments through Aug. 6 by emailing marketing@ripta.com or (401) 784-9500 x1101.


The efficiency study was requested to be completed by March 1 by Gov. Dan McKee and the General Assembly as a condition in last year’s state budget as a condition to plug a $15 million deficit. But the agency’s board of directors was focused on finding a permanent CEO and didn’t commission Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP to conduct the study until March 27.
WSP was paid $412,346 to complete the report.
RIPTA released three draft sections in the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session in order to inform the state’s final budget, which ultimately left RIPTA with a $17.6 million gap to fill.
The deficit was originally $32.6 million when McKee unveiled his recommended fiscal 2026 budget in January, but lawmakers eventually propped up RIPTA with nearly $15 million in annual revenue from an additional 2-cent increase on the state’s gas tax and by upping the agency’s share of the state’s Highway Maintenance Account. 
RIPTA administrators managed to reduce the shortfall to $10 million, thanks to what RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand called a “favorable price lock” in diesel fuel, along with a positive market performance for the agency’s pension plan. 
WSP’s report does provide a few recommendations: try to secure more ads, upping third party service contracts, and in one case, the sale of station naming rights. But those ideas are meant to be implemented over the course of several years.
With the multimillion dollar gap left by state leaders, the study’s primary suggestion is to slash service — primarily to low-scoring routes.
Those routes in the report include the 88 bus, which travels in the morning and afternoon from Simmons Village in Cranston to the Walmart off Plainfield Pike; Route 69, which connects the University of Rhode Island to the Port of Galilee; and the 59X express route in North Smithfield and Lincoln.
All of them are slated for elimination under RIPTA’s proposed service changes.
But even the report stated that low-scoring routes may still serve important functions by connecting specific transit-oriented populations to essential goods and services 
“In such cases, maintaining the current service may be warranted despite lower performance metrics,” the report states.
Instead, WSP suggests folding the lower-performing routes with the more popular ones or converting them into “microtransit zones” that feed into the larger fixed-route system.

Bus fare has remained $2 for 15 years
The report also floats the idea of bumping up RIPTA’s $2 single ride fare, which has been in place since 2010. WSP suggests increasing trip costs could generate around $1 million to $2 million annually. 
But the report states a price hike could discourage some riders from continuing to use transit, “such that it diminishes the total revenue increase that would have occurred if all riders continued using transit.” 
“Some estimates suggest travel demand reduces by roughly half the fare increase, such that a 10% fare increase would result in [a] 5% decrease in travel demand,” according to the report. It cited a 2021 study that found riders in Stockholm County in Sweden who took longer trips or had higher incomes were more likely to stop riding after fares increased in 2017, while metro users were  least affected.
Agency leaders have previously said they want to conduct an analysis of the impacts of a potential fare increase on “ridership, revenue, and equity.” Fare increases may be considered for 2027, according to the presentation RIPTA is giving at its public hearings on proposed service changes.
RIPTA and its board of directors are in the process of reviewing the suggestions and incorporating them into the agency’s daily operations, agency spokesperson Cristy Raposo Perry said in a statement.
The Save RIPTA campaign, an offshoot of the Providence Streets Coalition, saw no surprises in the report in a statement Friday afternoon.
“The study told us exactly what we’ve known all along: that RIPTA runs efficiently compared to similar sized agencies, and that there is no way to prevent catastrophic cuts to service,” the coalition wrote. “There is no hidden money in any couch cushions, that will prevent tens of thousands of Rhode Islanders from losing access to employment, education, economic mobility, medical services, and more,” the campaign wrote in a statement.
The Providence Streets Coalition launched the Save RIPTA campaign in 2023 to lobby state leaders to fully fund the agency in the face of looming budget deficits caused by federal pandemic aid drying up.
And with proposed cuts now up for consideration, the campaign is looking to get riders to push McKee and other state leaders to shift any funding that can keep the agency’s existing service afloat.
“$10 million out of a $14 billion budget is so minimal compared to the harm and economic consequences of these cuts,” the campaign wrote.
But McKee has stood firm against flexing any state funds, pointing to the efficiency study as a way to find savings. Spokesperson Olivia DaRocha said Friday the full study “identifies both efficiencies and revenue enhancements to close RIPTA’s remaining deficit responsibly.”
“Combined, these strategies provide RIPTA with viable options to balance the budget without making service reductions to higher-performing routes,” DaRocha said in an emailed statement.










Given the size of the projected operating deficit for FY 2026, RIPTA will likely need to make reductions to fixed-route service.


– Rhode Island Public Transit Authority Operational Efficiency Study Final Report July 31st, 2025


In a joint statement, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said they were in the midst of reviewing the final efficiency study.
“Our state needs a strong and sustainable public transit system, because it is so important for the health of our economy and for the quality of life of thousands of Rhode Islanders,” they said. “We will continue working with RIPTA’s leadership, and all our partners, to help RIPTA meet the needs of Rhode Islanders.”
Political leaders are already putting pressure on the state to halt RIPTA’s proposed cuts.
Less service will mean more cars on the road and fewer available parking spaces, Democratic Rep. Teresa Tanzi said Wednesday at a public hearing in South Kingstown where she lives.
“The efficiency that we’re going to lose if these cuts do in fact go through is exponential,” she said. “We won’t be able to recover from this overnight.”
In a joint statement Thursday, Pawtucket Mayor Donald Grebien and the city’s General Assembly delegation said the proposed cuts “will have devastating consequences for our most vulnerable citizens.”
“It is unfair for the working class to shoulder the burden of budget shortfalls,” Pawtucket leaders said. “Our community members deserve the same inalienable rights provided to all members of society, regardless of class, to provide for themselves and their families, and for many, public transit is their only option.”

A real estate developer is suing the City of Bondurant, alleging changes in plans for streets could cost the company millions of dollars.
Hubbell Realty Company Bondurant, also known as HRC, is suing the city in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
HRC claims that in 2021, it purchased land in the city near Highway 65 for $2.3 million. Its city-approved plans for the land allegedly preserved for future development two multifamily lots on which HRC planned to build apartments. The preliminary plat specified the location of roadways and was allegedly approved by the Bondurant City Council.

In August 2022, HRC began construction on the development, including the construction of roadways as previously approved by the city. At some point later that summer, the lawsuit claims, city officials decided the planned 16th Street NE should be relocated in such a way as to run through the center of the land where the HRC planned to build the Featherstone Apartments.
As a result, the lawsuit alleges, “HRC will be forced to redesign the subdivision, and HRC will lose millions of dollars. Put another way, had HRC been made aware of the modified roadway in 2021, then it would have structured the entire development in a different way.”
The company claims the modification to the roadway plans also creates a safety risk.
“Imagine a residential thoroughfare running directly through an apartment complex to separate its playground, pool, or other amenities from the residences,” the lawsuit states, adding that new design moves the intersection of 16th Street NE and Highway 65 “dangerously close” to the intersection of 14th Street NE and Highway 65.
“There has been no safety review by the Department of Transportation or anyone else to compare the safety of the proposed intersections contained in the preliminary plat versus the safety of the new concept approved in July 2024,” the lawsuit claims. It alleges city officials say the reason for the change is to assist with a new commercial development that is planned for the other side of Highway 65 in 2028.
HRC argues that the total loss of acreage from the planned changes, and the resulting increase in costs, is the “equivalent to a loss of nearly $2 million to HRC.” The company is seeking a court judgment finding that the Bondurant City Council’s actions constitute violations of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The Republican National Committee and the Montana Republican Party last week filed a motion to intervene in a lawsuit challenging two “commonsense” election laws passed during the 2025 Legislature.
The Montana Federation of Public Employees filed a suit in May before Lewis and Clark County District Court, challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 490, which changed voter registration opportunities, and Senate Bill 276, which strengthened voter ID laws.
The Republican groups’ brief in support of the motion to intervene said the lawsuit would “impact the Republican Party’s distinct interests in an efficient and reliable 2026 election that voters trust.”
“Voter ID and accurate voter registration are essential to secure elections,” RNC Chairman Michael Whatley said in a statement. “Democrat extremists are attacking Montana’s voter ID requirements and registration safeguards. The RNC and MTGOP are stepping in to protect the integrity of Montana’s elections and ensure only eligible Montana voters can cast a ballot.”
Both bills were sponsored by state Sen. Mike Cuffe, R-Eureka.
SB 490 tightened the deadline for voters to register to vote to noon on Election Day and eliminates registration on the Monday before an election, but opens it on the prior Saturday, which previously was not a day voters could register.
Under previous Montana law, anyone in line at the ballot box by 8 p.m. on Election Day could register to vote, which has occasionally led to long lines at voting locations.
Last November, some voters waited in line at the Gallatin County Courthouse until the early hours of the morning in order to register and cast their ballot.
Cuffe, in an opinion piece published by Lee Newspapers, cited that example — when votes were cast as late as 4 a.m. — as a reason for passing his bill.
“The intent is to smooth out the process and avoid votes being cast many hours beyond the intended closing of the polls at 8 p.m.,” Cuffe wrote.
SB 276 enacted photo identification voting in Montana, and expands the variety of ID options allowed to include tribal photo ID cards, military IDs, U.S. Passports, driver’s licenses and student ID cards.
But a 2024 decision from the Montana Supreme Court struck down a 2021 law seeking to eliminate Election Day voter registration, and another that and another that sought to narrow the list of acceptable photo IDs allowed
The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Blackfeet Nation, the Fort Belknap Indian Community, and the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, as well as tribal advocacy nonprofit Western Native Voice, filed to join the lawsuit as intervenors last month, saying the Legislature was insisting on “making it more difficult for Native Americans in Montana to vote,” by restricting registration opportunities.
In the Republican groups’ brief, they cited several reasons for inclusion in the lawsuit, including that declaring the laws unconstitutional would “undermine Republican voter confidence in the electoral system and create administrative problems that could undermine Republican turnout.”
It would also force the state and federal political party to “divert resources from other mission-critical activities toward get-out-the-vote activities to reinspire Republican voter trust in Montana’s electoral system, to independently verify the accuracy of Montana’s voter registration rolls, and to educate voters and candidates concerning Montana’s changed registration requirements.”
The lawsuit is just one challenging a number of laws passed by the Montana Legislature earlier this year. Another, brought by the Montana Public Interest Research Group, challenged a law that would require Montana residents to vote in the county reside in full time, which excludes locations where they attend college.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/montana-election-day-2024-19-1024x668.jpg,,,2025-08-01 16:56:28.844556

Article Summary

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul and other Democratic attorneys general are suing the Trump administration over policies to limit gender-affirming care for youths.
The lawsuit argues the policies violate states’ 10th Amendment right to regulate health care.
Many Illinois health care providers have stopped providing gender-affirming care to comply with federal orders.
Raoul declined to say whether health care providers should continue providing gender-affirming care while a federal judge considers the lawsuit.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul is joining a multi-state lawsuit seeking to block the Trump administration from limiting gender-affirming care.
The lawsuit, filed in Massachusetts district court by 17 states, argues an executive order signed in January by President Donald Trump that directs federal agencies to take “appropriate steps to ensure that institutions receiving federal research and education grants end the chemical and surgical mutilation of children” violates states’ 10th Amendment right to regulate medical care.
The order defines “children” as people under age 19, which the attorneys general say conflicts with many states such as Illinois, where people are generally considered adults when they turn 18. A separate executive order by the president established that the federal government only recognizes two genders.
It also seeks to block two Department of Justice orders that direct the DOJ to investigate and enforce legal action against doctors, hospitals and other medical professionals that provide gender-affirming care to youths.
The orders use “cruel, demeaning language” to “undermine the legitimacy” of medical care, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a news conference Friday.
“This administration is driving a wedge between patients and health care providers from providing patients the health care that they need,” Raoul said.
Also troubling to the attorneys general is the prospect of criminal prosecution against doctors who provide care.
“The Department of Justice is diverting valuable law enforcement resources away from catching criminals and predators who are actually harming children,” Raoul said. “How does any of this keep our children or our communities safer?”
Guidance to Illinois doctors
The orders have also caused Illinois health care providers to stop providing types of gender-affirming care, including University of Chicago Medical Center, UI Health, Rush, Northwestern Medicine and Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago.
Though Raoul said he opposes the Trump administration’s policies and believes they are illegal, he declined to give legal advice about whether Illinois health care providers should continue following the federal directives while the lawsuit proceeds.
“I am not a health care administrator; I am not the head of a hospital that’s being threatened with potential criminal investigation or prosecution or removal of funding that goes toward saving the lives of various patients,” Raoul said. “And so I am not in the position of either advising what administrative decisions should be made at hospitals.”
Raoul said his role is to “remove” legal threats against the state and its residents.
Medical providers that decide to stop providing gender-affirming care are likely not guilty of discrimination under Illinois law, Raoul said, “particularly if the federal government is threatening you with criminal prosecution.” He added Illinois laws don’t require doctors to provide a full range of gender-affirming care.
Illinois has numerous laws on the books establishing legal gender-affirming care, including protections for Illinois health care providers from prosecution and other disciplinary action in other states for giving legal health care to patients in Illinois that might be considered illegal in another state.

(Photo: NPS / Jacob W. Frank)In a 1968 speech made while signing a series of conservation bills, President Lyndon B. Johnson expounded on the wonders of a free-flowing river. 
“An unspoiled river is a very rare thing in this nation today,” he said. “Their flow and vitality have been harnessed by dams and too often they have been turned into open sewers by communities and by industries. It makes us all very fearful that all rivers will go this way unless somebody acts now to try to balance our river development.”
Johnson signed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to protect free-flowing waterways with “extraordinary natural, cultural and recreational qualities.”
The original National Wild and Scenic Rivers system comprised eight rivers and included more than two dozen more to study for future protections, including Montana’s Flathead River.
Just eight years later, Congress amended the act to include the three forks of the Flathead River, and a stretch of the Missouri River. 
Today, more than 13,467 miles of 228 rivers are protected by the national system, but according to the Department of the Interior, this represents less than one half of one percent of the nation’s rivers.
Montana’s western Rep. Ryan Zinke hopes to bolster Montana’s wild and scenic river mileage by roughly 25%.
At a press conference in Bozeman on Tuesday, Zinke announced new legislation to designate an additional nearly 100 miles of river in Madison and Gallatin counties as part of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
“Striking the right balance between conservation and multiple use of our resources is the Montana way. These rivers support everything from family farms to fly shops, ranchers to rafters, and literally power our community,” Zinke, a former Interior Secretary during President Trump’s first term, said in a press statement. “Madison and Gallatin Counties both rely on these waters for irrigation and energy, but also for the outdoor recreation economy that fuels small businesses and draws visitors from around the world. This bill strikes the right balance between preserving what we treasure, maintaining access for recreation, and ensuring continued operation of the existing dams on the river.”
The Greater Yellowstone Recreation Enhancement and Tourism Act would add protections to 98 miles of the Madison River and Gallatin River. 
The designations include:

42 miles of the Madison River, from the Cabin Creek confluence to Cherry Gulch 
39.6 miles of the Gallatin River, from the Yellowstone National Park boundary to Spanish Creek 
4.6 miles of Hyalite Creek, from its headwaters to Grotto Falls Trailhead 
7.3 miles of Cabin Creek, beginning at its headwaters 
5.1 miles of the Middle Fork Cabin Creek, from its headwaters to its confluence with Cabin Creek

Support for protecting these stretches of river comes from multiple conservation groups and both the Madison and Gallatin county commissions. Both commissions submitted letters of support to Congress.  
“This effort enjoys broad, bipartisan support across Montana—from farmers and ranchers to business owners, conservationists, sportsmen, and local governments—reflecting a shared understanding that safeguarding our rivers is not a partisan issue, but a Montana value,” said Gallatin County commissioners Scott MacFarlane, Zach Brown, and Jennifer Boyer.

Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, rivers are classified in three types: wild, scenic and recreational. A single river, or river segment, may be given multiple classifications depending on the level of development along the river at the time of designation. 
For federally administered rivers, the designated corridor generally averages a quarter mile on either side for waterways in the contiguous U.S., in order to protect river-related values. 
The last, and only, additional Montana river to receive such protections was East Rosebud Creek in 2018. The legislation for East Rosebud Creek was sponsored by Sen. Steve Daines and then Sen. Jon Tester, as well as the state’s only representative at the time, then-Rep. Greg Gianforte.
Tester had also sought to pass the Montana Headwaters Legacy Act which would have added 19 rivers and 327 river miles in the Missouri and Yellowstone River systems to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. That bill was put on the legislative calendar in November 2024, but never received a formal vote or was included in a larger legislative package. 
In a committee markup, Sen. Daines voted against the Headwaters Act, which included the sections of the Madison and Gallatin rivers in Zinke’s new legislation.
While the Greater Yellowstone bill contains a more targeted section of Montana waterways to pass, many conservation groups that pushed for added protections over the years cheered the announcement as a step forward. 
“From fishing for world-class trout and rafting through rapids to hunting river bottom whitetails and migrating ducks and geese, the Madison and Gallatin Rivers are a hunter’s and angler’s dream,” Ryan Chapin, Montana field manager for the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership said in a statement, “These waters breathe lifeblood into southwest Montana, and this proposed legislation will benefit more than sportsmen. Ranchers, farmers, and local businesses depend on the health of these watersheds to thrive.”
Charles Drimal, director of conservation at the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, wrote in a blog post that the legislation builds on “years of community conversations, scientific study, and broad coalition input led by GYC and our partners.”
“Protecting these rivers means sustaining outdoor recreation economies built on tourism, fishing, and floating; securing clean, reliable water for communities, agriculture, and ecosystems; protecting wildlife habitat and biodiversity along rivers; and preserving the character of Montana’s communities and landscapes,” Drimal wrote.
Zinke’s bill also drew statements of support from the American Rivers Action Fund, the Gallatin River Task Force and American Whitewater.

President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans have criticized NPR and PBS of left-leaning bias, an accusation the public media organizations have rejected.“Despite the extraordinary efforts of millions of Americans who called, wrote, and petitioned Congress to preserve federal funding for CPB, we now face the difficult reality of closing our operations,” Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of CPB, said in a statement Friday.“CPB remains committed to fulfilling its fiduciary responsibilities and supporting our partners through this transition with transparency and care,” Harrison said.She added that “public media has been one of the most trusted institutions in American life, providing educational opportunity, emergency alerts, civil discourse, and cultural connection to every corner of the country.”CPB said employees were notified Friday that the majority of staff positions “will conclude with the close of the fiscal year on September 30, 2025,” and a small transition team will stay through January 2026.The Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education spending bill for fiscal year 2026, which did not include any CPB funding.Sen. Patty Murray of Washington state, the top Democrat on the panel, expressed her disappointment over the lack of a CPB allocation in the bill during a committee markup. “It is a shameful reality and now communities across the country will suffer the consequences as over 1,500 stations lose critical funding,” Murray said.In a win for the Trump administration, Congress passed a rescissions package in July that clawed back $9 billion in previously approved spending for public broadcasting and foreign aid, including $1.1 billion for CPB.Trump signed the measure into law just days later.",,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

The federal government has determined the potential multibillion-dollar investment to construct the proposed Baltimore-Washington Superconducting Magnetic Levitation (SCMAGLEV), known as maglev, “is no longer feasible,” according to the Federal Railroad Administration.
An upcoming notice in the Federal Register, scheduled to be published Monday, highlights a few of the federal properties along the route between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore that would be affected, such as Fort George G. Meade in Anne Arundel County.
“Following extensive consultation with these agencies, the railroad administration determined the direct effects would have substantial negative effects to agency operations or to important resources managed by federal agencies,” according to the notice. “In addition, indirect effects would also significantly impair critical infrastructure and operations and ongoing agency missions.”
However, the decision does not preclude future deployment of the SCMAGLEV technology in the U.S., according to the notice.
The U.S. Department of Transportation has estimated the capital cost to build the project at nearly $20 billion.
“We want big, beautiful projects worthy of taxpayer dollars — including high-speed rail,” U.S. DOT Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a statement Friday. “This project lacked everything needed to be a success from planning to execution. This project did not have the means to go the distance, and I can’t in good conscience keep taxpayers on the hook for it.”
Some Prince George’s County residents such as Susan McCutchen were ecstatic with the decision.
“It’s a huge deal and it feels a bit overwhelming, almost to the point that you can’t quite believe it,” she said Friday. “We’re optimistic, but we’re keeping an eye out still.”
That cautious optimism surfaced late Thursday night after a letter was circulated from Drew Feeley, acting administrator for the Federal Railroad Administration.
Feeley’s letter sent to Maryland Department of Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld, who’s scheduled to leave the position Friday, summarizes that the administration will rescind a notice of intent to not prepare an environmental impact statement.
“Since the award was obligated in 2016, the environmental review process has been paused twice on the Federal Permitting Dashboard. It remains on pause today, where it has been since August 24, 2021,” Feeley wrote Thursday. “Given the substantial delay and cost overruns associated with the Project, FRA does not see a viable path to continue investment in the Project.”
Wiedefeld responded in a letter Thursday that the state will comply with the administration’s request to submit final reports to terminate and close out a cooperative agreement on the project. The railroad administration first awarded the state Department of Transportation $27 million in 2016 for preliminary engineering and environmental review.
“MDOT understands that FRA’s decision reflects the significant challenges posed by the project, including substantial impacts to federal agencies and federal properties,” he wrote. “MDOT appreciates FRA’s partnership in advancing rail infrastructure and safety improvements in the State of Maryland.”
One major supporter of the project was Gov. Wes Moore (D), who watched a high-speed maglev train in April during a trade mission to Japan.
Moore spokesperson Carter Elliott said in a statement: “In order for this to be Maryland’s decade we must continue to investigate innovative technologies that better connect people from where they live to where they work. Although this project had challenges that were insurmountable, we look forward to working with FRA to advance transportation solutions that improve the safety, reliability, and efficacy of our transportation system.”
Baltimore Washington Rapid Rail is the company that was slated to develop the project labeled Northeast Maglev. The train was proposed to connect between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore in 15 minutes at a speed of 311 mile per hour; and a trip between Washington and New York in an hour.
The company said in a statement Friday afternoon the administration’s decision represents a “missed opportunity.”
“The SCMAGLEV would have resulted in over $6 billion in private investment, created more than 160,000 jobs, and replaced 16 million car trips,” the company said. “With cars being the largest source of pollution in Maryland, significant air quality benefits would have been realized. Instead, the Washington, DC metro area will remain number one in the country for the worst traffic, delays, and congestion.”
Besides the company highlighting private investments of nearly $158 million, Northeast Maglev received representation from two of the state’s biggest lobbying firms: Evans and Associates and Manis Canning and Associates, both based in Annapolis.
However, several state lawmakers have expressed displeasure with the project.
In 2023, Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s) and state Sens. Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) and Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) and former state Sen. Paul Pinsky (D-Prince George’s) sponsored legislation that would prohibit state funds from being used toward the maglev project. The legislation didn’t advance out of the respective committees.
Before Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s) was elected to the House of Delegates, he opposed the project back in 2017.
“This result is a culmination of years of advocacy,” Martinez said Friday. “To be here in 2025 and finally have a decision that speaks to what we’ve said the from start, and that this particular project for this particular community doesn’t work from the environmental impacts to the lack of economic development to the impacts of people’s homes. I’m just really appreciative that we can now put this train to bed.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/day1_067-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)State and labor officials unveiled diverging proposals to cut costs for New Jersey’s distressed state worker health plan by $200 million each calendar year.
Proposals from Gov. Phil Murphy’s administration focus mainly on reducing health plans’ share of medical costs, while union proposals lean mostly on controlling the cost of medical services, whether through caps that would tie rates to Medicare and Medicaid or expanded billing reviews.
Language in this year’s state budget requires both sides to identify potential savings for the State Health Benefits Program, and allows the state’s plan design committee — which sets plan coverage rules — to select which savings options to pursue. The state’s actuaries must agree that the changes will reduce costs by at least $100 million in the first six months of 2026.
But apart from proposals that would tie prescriptions of certain weight-loss drugs to participation in lifestyle management or anti-obesity counseling programs and allow more procedures at center of excellence facilities — a pilot program caps prices there — the two sides’ plans have little in common.
Billy Gallagher, assistant to the vice president of Communications Workers of America District 1, called the state’s proposals “outrageous and unacceptable.” The CWA is the largest union of state workers.
“For years, this administration, like the administration before it, has made cuts on our members’ backs and asked the very workers who keep this state open and running to sacrifice, to cut back more and more,” Gallagher said.
State officials, meanwhile, say their proposals could achieve “significantly” more savings than the $100 million target for the first half of next year.
“These plan design proposals will maintain the SHBP members’ access to high-quality, affordable health care, while incentivizing more cost-effective health care decisions by members and bolstering the sustainability of the SHBP now and for years to come,” state officials said in a letter attached to their plan.

New Jersey’s public worker health plans are in trouble after years of escalating premiums driven by broad use of expensive weight-loss drugs, growing utilization of high-cost services, and inflation.
The two sides’ proposals seek cost savings within state workers’ part of the plan, which is insulated from some of the dynamics that Treasury officials say have put local government workers’ public plan into an actuarial death spiral. Escalating costs on the local plan have pushed out more and more towns to private options, driving premiums yet higher.
The state’s proposals include multiple options that would eliminate existing plans within the State Health Benefit Program and replace them with ones that make workers responsible for a greater share of their health care expenses.
State plans under the program carry actuarial values — the share of medical spending paid for by the health plan instead of workers — of between 93% and 98%, according to a Treasury report released in May. The state’s proposals include plans with actuarial values between 88% and 94.5% (a 2023 comparison of plan designs conducted by the state’s actuaries found comparable large public employee health plans in the mid-Atlantic region had actuarial values between 93.6% and 96.9%).
The state’s proposed plans typically feature higher deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums compared to existing plans. In many cases, these plans also include higher copays across a range of services, though some are at or below levels offered under some existing plans. 
Some of the state’s options recommend sunsetting certain high-cost plans to drive workers to extant plans with lower costs for the state.
Other proposals include keeping existing plans and raising all deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums by $1,000, limiting or ending coverage for weight-loss drugs in most circumstances, capping annual chiropractic and physical therapy visits, and imposing a $50 monthly surcharge on subscribers whose spouses could get health care through their employer.
There’s little indication that union officials will support those proposals.

The unions’ cost savings proposals mostly aim at reducing medical expenses. They urge officials to review at least 50% of state claims each year to spot payment errors that can be clawed back by the state.
They said the state should bar medical providers from billing workers for costs not reimbursed by their health plan and cap reimbursements to 200% of the rates set by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a practice called reference-based pricing.
It’s not clear whether the state’s actuaries will accept that recommendation. Administration members on New Jersey’s plan design committees who have previously voted down reference-based pricing proposals have said the bodies lack the authority to enact the practice. 
Labor proposals include a recommendation that New Jersey negotiate its own drug prices rather than contracting out to a third party and audit prices for the 100 most-billed drugs, arguing prescription drug discounts have been too slow to reach the state.
They also said the state should offer incentives for workers to voluntarily join plans with higher deductibles.
“There are solutions here, but our elected leaders must be willing to act. There are over 400,000 voters covered by the State Health Benefits Plan and health care is going to be a major concern as they submit their ballots or head to the ballot box this fall. We cannot afford continued stalling and delaying here,” Gallagher said.
Murphy, who is in the closing months of his second term, cannot seek a third term in November. Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, are vying to succeed him.
The differences between proposals — and the plan design committee’s even split between administration and labor members — could create a deadlocked panel. If they’re still deadlocked by Sept. 30, budget language requires them to enter mediation under a super conciliator to bridge the impasse.
If the conciliator does not push the board to a resolution by Oct. 31, budget language requires the Legislature to pass a bill to secure the savings by Dec. 1. If no bill is passed, negotiations would relaunch between single representatives of the two sides. The nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services would appoint a tiebreaker if no agreement is reached by Dec. 15.

Kevin Stitt speaks at his weekly media availability on May 28, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s governor this week directed all state agencies to cease providing public funding to individuals or organizations “affiliated with abortion providers.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt said he ordered the Oklahoma Health Care Authority to terminate and refuse to renew any Medicaid contracts to doctors or entities that “performs, refers for, or is affiliated with the performance of abortions not permitted under state law.” He said the agency must also implement enforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance and require Medicaid providers to sign a document attesting to whether they’re connected to anyone providing “abortion-related activities.” 
He said only providers who are “fully aligned with Oklahoma’s public policy objectives, including the protection of unborn life” will be eligible to participate in Medicaid, which is funded jointly by state and federal money.
“We won’t allow tax dollars to indirectly subsidize and flow into the abortion industry under the guise of women’s health,” he said in a statement. “My order makes sure every public dollar aligns with our values and supports providers who respect life at every stage.”
Stitt said his executive order follows a June U.S. Supreme Court decision affirming that states can determine who takes part in their Medicaid programs. That includes the right to ban any affiliated individuals or organizations with ties to abortion providers, he said. 
Oklahoma currently has no licensed abortion providers. State law bars all abortions except to save the life of the mother.
An Oklahoma Health Care Authority spokesperson did not know Friday how many providers were expected to be impacted by the order. She wrote in an email that the agency was still analyzing the impact on provider counts and the order “to determine next steps as we ensure compliance and maintain services for our members.”
Nearly 1 in 4 Oklahomans are enrolled in Medicaid, also known as SoonerCare.
Under Stitt’s order, the Health Care Authority must implement the revised standards within 120 days and report back to Stitt’s office on the number of impacted providers.

(Photo by Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Thousands of Rhode Island seniors and disabled residents no longer covered for non-emergency visits at four local hospitals can switch insurance plans ahead of the fall open enrollment period. 
Gov. Dan McKee and the Rhode Island Office of Healthy Aging announced a two-month special enrollment period for UnitedHealthcare Medicare Advantage patients on Thursday — exactly one month after the health insurer’s existing contract with Brown University Health ended. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) determined the insurance change period was needed after reviewing UnitedHealthcare’s notice of the soon-to-cease contract, submitted in May before coverage ended.
The health system and the health insurer failed to negotiate a new agreement due to disputes over reimbursement rates — a point of contention between insurance companies and providers nationwide. This, in turn, meant thousands of Rhode Islanders were suddenly considered “out of network” for most treatments and physician visits at Rhode Island Hospital, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, The Miriam Hospital, and Newport Hospital. 
Medicare contract talks between Brown Health and United are over. Uncertainty is just beginning.

Mailers and online information pages sought to alert affected patients ahead of the July 1 termination date for coverage. But conflicting narratives about when coverage ended left some plan participants surprised to find their surgeries suddenly canceled, according to news reports. Losing insurance coverage could also force affected patients to pay more for the same treatments.
“This is important news for seniors in Rhode Island whose coverage was disrupted earlier this month,” McKee said in a statement Thursday. “Without this special election period, every impacted individual had to submit an individual waiver request to change carriers—with no guarantee that they would be granted. Our team at the Office of Healthy Aging stands ready to assist impacted Rhode Islanders.”
UnitedHealthcare and Brown University Health each did not respond to inquiries for comment Friday.
The special enrollment period was triggered by United’s notice to federal regulators of the end to its contract with Brown University Health. The Rhode Island Office of Healthy Aging and the Rhode Island Office of the Attorney General also submitted letters to CMS asking for a special window for plan participants to change insurance plans or carriers.
“We were primarily concerned about the impact on our senior population,” Steven Boudreau, a spokesperson for the Office of Healthy Aging, said in an interview Friday.










We were primarily concerned about the impact on our senior population.


– Steven Boudreau, a spokesperson for the Office of Healthy Aging


Federally reported data estimates 129,000 Rhode Islanders are enrolled in Medicare Advantage health insurance plans available for people 65 and older, or with disabilities or chronic conditions like end-stage kidney failure or ALS (also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.) The commercial alternative to government-run traditional Medicare has grown in popularity nationwide and in Rhode Island with the promise of additional benefits and cost savings to participants. Participation in United’s Medicare Advantage program in Rhode Island grew 10.1%, to 37,000 plan participants, in 2023, according to the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner’s (OHIC) 2025 annual report.
However, private providers have faced backlash for inflating testing and diagnostics as a means to increase their bottom lines. 
Complaints are ‘very few’
The Office of Healthy Aging continues to field inquiries — though “very few” complaints — from affected plan participants, Boudreau said.
“We certainly prepared ourselves for a heck of a lot more,” he said.
The most common question Boudreau’s office has gotten: “What are my options?” 
The Attorney General’s office also continues to receive consumer questions, Timothy Rondeau, an office spokesperson, said in a text. The AG has updated its webpage about the insurance coverage change to include information about the new special enrollment period.
Once UnitedHealth mails notices to affected patients, they have 60 days to switch to a different Medicare Advantage plan, or return to government-run Medicare. Other commercial insurers that offer Medicare Advantage in all or parts of Rhode Island include Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island, Aetna, Humana, WellCare, and Cigna.
Terms of the special enrollment period are set by CMS, including a one-month delay between when coverage ended and the new enrollment begins to give affected enrollees enough time to make informed decisions about changing their coverage, Boudreau said.
Eligible individuals can get help deciding which insurance option is right for them by contacting the State Health Insurance Assistance Program hotline at 1-888-884-8721.
The regular open enrollment period for changing health insurance runs from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7.
The end to the contract between Brown University Health and United did not affect dual Medicare and Medicaid recipients, nor did it affect coverage at Brown University Health’s Massachusetts hospitals. There are also assurances for continuity of care in certain cases, including patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed cancer, or those in active cancer treatment. United Medicare Advantage plan participants whose insurance is covered through a former employer under a group plan may also continue to receive care at Brown University Health hospitals.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)While legal battles  over federal funding to Planned Parenthood after Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in early July have paused efforts to defund the organization, three Planned Parenthood clinics in Virginia had already lost Title X family planning funding this past April, forcing thousands to pay more for reproductive health care, or lose access to it altogether. 
“That funding is still frozen sadly,” said Virginia League for Planned Parenthood CEO Paulette McElwain. 
Established in 1970, the federal program helps low and extremely low-income people access family planning care like contraception, sexually transmitted disease screenings and treatment as well as cancer screenings at little or no cost. 
McElwain said this past spring that clinics became aware of a freeze on Title X funding by President Donald Trump’s administration on March 31, which means that about 11,000 Virginian patients have had to pay higher costs for services or forgo them since then. 
Affected health centers are in Richmond, Hampton, and Virginia Beach. 
The initial freeze to the grants stemmed from the Trump administration’s crackdown on organizations that include Diversity, Equity and Inclusion practices in their work or mission statements. The pause affected nine Planned Parenthood grantees and seven nonprofit grantees that included clinics, health departments and federally qualified health centers. 
While Title X grants have been restored to some recipients, like a health nonprofit that disburses the funding to clinics in Missouri, that hasn’t been the case for Virginia’s Planned Parenthood clinics. 
Planned Parenthood clinics provide a variety of reproductive health care, but their name has become synonymous mainly with the abortion procedures it also provides and drawn ire from abortion opponents. 
The freeze wasn’t the first time Trump has used the family planning funding to also crack down on abortion providers. Regulations during his first term disqualified clinics from receiving Title X funds that had co-located abortion services or who provided abortion referrals. President Joe Biden’s subsequent administration reversed those actions. 
Planned Parenthood continues to exist under a microscope of scrutiny by the Trump administration and Republican members of Congress, whose reconciliation bill this summer seeks to defund the organization by restricting Medicaid reimbursements. Though the organization is not specifically named in the bill, its leaders claim it was meant to affect their nearly 600 centers across 48 states. A federal judge recently blocked the effort for the time being.  
Likewise, a lawsuit is in progress concerning the Title X funding freeze that hit some clinics this spring. Filed in the District Court of Columbia, the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association and the American Civil Liberties Union suit argues that about 842,000 people across the affected states faced reduced access to care.

(Photo by Marisa Demarco / KUNM)Operating hours at New Mexico’s busiest courthouse remained limited on Thursday because of what state judicial officials say is a potentially dangerous decision by the local sheriff’s office to limit how many deputies work security there.
The dispute over security staffing at the Bernalillo County Courthouse comes as judges and court administrators are telling lawmakers they feel unsafe doing their jobs across the state.
The interim legislative Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee invited county and state court officials to meet with them July 31, a week after the New Mexico Supreme Court limited how many people can enter three court buildings in downtown Albuquerque. Court officials described the operational change as a precautionary safety measure in response to Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office staffing reductions, a characterization the sheriff’s office disputes.
On Thursday, Second Judicial District Court Chief Judge Marie Ward told the committee the number of Bernalillo County Sheriff’s deputies working security at the courthouse started to decrease in January, and by July 10 stood at roughly half of what it was normally. The sheriff’s office, in a news release, has said it restructured staffing “to identify inefficiencies” and “achieve the same level of security and service with fewer deputies.”
The situation remained unresolved on Thursday, despite ongoing negotiations between Ward, Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen, County Manager Cindy Chavez and county commissioners.
The Administrative Office of the Courts last month pointed to examples of violent threats against judges and court staff across the state as reasons for state lawmakers to consider allocating more funding for court security and creating an internal security force for the courts rather than relying on local police.
NM judiciary suggests lawmakers create state court marshals service

Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Peter Golden told the committee the Legislature could solve court staffing problems by allowing more retired police officers to return to work as court security specialists while keeping their pensions.
New Mexico last year allowed police who retired by the end of 2024 and who haven’t worked for at least three months to return to certain public safety jobs. However, Golden said the new law limits his recruitment pool because it only allows retired cops to receive their pensions for three consecutive years while working, and they must be hired by the end of June 2027.
“I have individuals right now that are willing to rehire as court security specialists, but they will not forgo a continuous full-time position in retirement for one that only has a limit of 36 months,” he said.
The Legislature could consider changing the criteria, but won’t be able to for months, said Committee Vice Chair Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos). Lawmakers’ next regular session is in January; the governor is expected to call a special session later this month or in early September, but agenda items will be limited to the governor’s discretion.
A short-term solution, Golden said, would be for the Legislature to provide $1 million to pay for deputies’ overtime working court security.
Chandler called that idea a “non-starter.”
“That’s something that needs to be brought up to the county commission,” she said.

Andy Beshear speaks with reporters outside an event at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 20, 2024. (Photo by Jacob Fischler/States Newsroom)FRANKFORT, Ky. — Gov. Andy Beshear’s super PAC In This Together reported raising $618,200 during the first half of this year to the Federal Election Commission late Thursday.
The super PAC was founded soon after the governor’s reelection in 2023 and funds his ongoing political activity and aspirations as he explores a possible run for president in 2028.
In This Together is the type of political committee that can accept contributions of unlimited amounts. And it got three big ones earlier this year. The report filed with the FEC discloses:

TDA Properties of Elizabethtown contributed $100,000 on March 25. Kentucky Secretary of State records list Tim Aulbach as president of TDA Properties.
Ullico Management Co. gave $90,000 on June 2. The Washington, D.C.-based  insurance and investment company serves trade union members.
ECL Entertainment of Las Vegas, gave $75,000 on March 21. ECL Entertainment owns Kentucky Downs race track in Franklin and four gambling parlors where players bet on so-called “historic horseracing” machines.

But the report filed with the FEC this week reveals only a part — perhaps only half, or less — of the details of In This Together’s financial condition because the PAC also reports part of its contributions and expenses to the Internal Revenue Service. The report it must file with the IRS is not due until later this month.
While no final conclusions about the super PAC’s fundraising and spending can be drawn until that disclosure with the IRS is posted, nearly all of the spending listed in the report filed Thursday with the FEC went for operating expenses.
The report lists only one disbursement that follows the purported purpose of the super PAC, which is to help political candidates and causes that share Beshear’s political beliefs and goals. That was a $2,200 contribution to the political committee of Michael Mueller, the Franklin County judge executive.
The largest expenses by far were paid to GPS Impact, of Des Moines, Iowa. They totaled $129,000 and paid for list acquisition, digital consulting and digital ads.
Other big expenses were: $43,800 to Outperform Strategies, the Louisville political consulting firm headed by Beshear’s longtime political strategist Eric Hyers; $30,000 to Elias Law of Washington, D.C., for legal services; $25,000 to the fundraising consulting firm headed by Beshear’s longtime fundraiser Lucas Johnson; $18,000 to Public Policy Polling of Raleigh, North Carolina; $17,500 to CFO Compliance of Providence Rhode Island, for compliance consulting; $15,000 to Capital Strategies of Marina Del Rey, California, for strategic consulting; and $12,000 to Lauren Hitt of Washington DC, for communications consulting.
in a response to emailed questions from Kentucky Lantern, Hyers suggested the pending report to be filed with the IRS will list much more direct spending by In This Together to help  Beshear-supported candidates, including a “six figure” expense for targeted mail that helped Susan Crawford win election to the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the spring.
Big donors during the period other than the three listed above include several state contractors, companies closely regulated by state government, lobbyists and appointees of Beshear to important state boards. These other big donors include:

Morgan Collins Yeast and Salyer, of London, $25,000. Lawyers in the firm have been large and consistent donors to Beshear. Beshear appointed partner McKinnley Morgan to chair the Kentucky Personnel Board.
State highway contracting companies headed by the Cleary family of Tompkinsville, $15,000.
LG&E of Louisville, $10,000.
McGhee Engineering of Guthrie, $10,000
Nine engineers with state engineering contractor GRW each gave $1,000 to total $9,000.

Donors listed as giving $5,000 during the period include: Beshear’s father, former Gov. Steve Beshear; Nachiketa Bhatt of Prospect, who heads Freedom Adult Day Healthcare; Joe Ellis, a Benton optometrist appointed to the Board of Optometry by Beshear; David Figg of Beaver Dam, an appointee of Beshear’s to the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees; Hal McCoy of Hopkinsville, husband of Elizabeth McCoy who was appointed to the UK Board by Beshear; Frank Shoop, the Georgetown car dealer who recently stepped down as a UK trustee; Leslie Haney, a Lexington engineer with EA Partners, which has long held state contracts; and lobbyists Sherman Brown and Bob Babbage.

Fire restrictions are now in place across Utah, amid what Gov. Spencer Cox called “terrible conditions” fueling a number of blazes, including the 48,000-acre Monroe Canyon Fire.  
Speaking from Richfield on Friday near the fire, Cox said the entire state is a tinder box. 
“These terrible conditions that are making it impossible for us to get ahead of this fire exist in every corner of the state right now,” Cox said. “It would be very easy to have more fires like this one, so we need people to be incredibly cautious.”

Burning east of Interstate 70 near Richfield, the Monroe Canyon Fire is the largest blaze in Utah this year. It’s grown by more than 10,000 acres in recent days, and is just 7% contained. More than 1,000 firefighters are working around the clock, with a focus on protecting structures. 
“You’re getting 60-mile-per-hour winds and we’ve had a few near misses with firefighters who had to cut their way out of the trees with a chainsaw. Fortunately, we’ve had no real serious accidents and the firefighters can go home to their families,” said state Rep. Carl Albrecht, a Republican from Richfield, speaking to reporters alongside Cox on Friday. 
A number of transmission lines have been burned, causing periodic power outages in the area, and at least seven structures have been destroyed. Residents in Burrville, Monroe Canyon, and parts of Poverty Flat are under evacuation orders. 
“This is a big one. It’s been a long time since we’ve had a big one like this. The odds of us putting it out anytime soon are pretty low, just to be honest. We know that the forecast is not great right now. We’ve seen erratic fire behavior all day long, even at night,” Cox said. “We’ve seen a fire make a five-mile run. You can’t stop a fire when it’s making a run like that.” 
The temperature and precipitation outlook for the rest of the month, according to the National Weather Service, calls for below average rain and above average temperatures. It’s been exceptionally dry around the state, with humidity as low as 4% in the Monroe Canyon area. 
Cox declares state of emergency as intense wildfires burn in Utah

“It’s August and we’re not in good shape right now. And we’re not seeing any moisture in sight,” said Jamie Barnes, director of the Utah Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands.  
To that end, state officials imposed stage two fire restrictions on Thursday. That means the following is prohibited: 

Fires and campfires, even in developed camping or picnic areas.  
Smoking, except in an enclosed vehicle or building, at a developed recreation site, or on a paved area. 
Fireworks, tracer ammunition, exploding targets or other pyrotechnic devices. 
Cutting, welding or grinding metal near vegetation. 
Operating a motorcycle, chainsaw, ATV or other small internal combustion engine without a working spark arrestor. 

These restrictions apply to all state and private, unincorporated land, including state trust land, state parks and wildlife management areas. They also apply to the following federal lands: 

The Color Country, Canyon Country, Green River, Paria River and West Desert districts, managed by the Bureau of Land Management. 
Dixie, Fishlake and Manti-La Sal national forests, managed by the U.S. Forest Service. 

Violating the restrictions is a class B misdemeanor, punishable by six months in jail and a fine up to $1,000. 
There are a number of other fires burning throughout Utah:

The Forsyth Fire, discovered on June 19, has burned almost 16,000 acres, destroyed more than a dozen homes and is now 99% contained. It’s located near the Pine Valley community, about 15 miles north of St. George. 
The Deer Creek Fire is burning along the Colorado-Utah border near the La Sal Mountains, outside of Moab. It is 17,700 acres and, as of Friday morning, 88% contained. 
Discovered Thursday, the Little Pole Fire in northern Box Elder County near the Idaho border is now 487 acres and 0% contained. 

Cox declared a 30-day state of emergency on Thursday related to wildfires. The order allows the government to use all available state resources “to protect lives, homes, livestock and drinking-water supplies threatened by this year’s severe fire season,” according to the governor’s office. It also allows for the deployment of the Utah National Guard if needed.

The department has sent letters to Pennsylvania and at least eight other states in recent months asking for information related to voter list maintenance in the states under the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act.
Several letters also request state voter registration lists, prompting concern among some Democrats and voting rights activists about how the department, under the control of President Donald Trump, plans to use the data.
The National Association of Secretaries of State, known as NASS, said that after states began receiving letters, its staff reached out to the department for additional information and context.
“DOJ staff told NASS staff that all states would be contacted eventually on NVRA and HAVA matters. We passed along this information to members,” assocation spokesperson Maria Benson wrote in a statement to Stateline, using the acronyms for the two voting registration acts.
The Department of Justice has declined to answer questions from Stateline about its plans for the voter registration data.

Some states have declined to hand over their full voter registration records, which can contain sensitive personal information, including partial Social Security numbers.
Minnesota, New Hampshire and Wisconsin have all declined to release full lists. In Maine, Democratic Secretary of State Shenna Bellows plans to deny a similar request, telling the Maine Morning Star that the DOJ can “go jump in the Gulf of Maine.”
The department’s focus on elections comes after Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.

(Photo courtesy of the Woodbury County Sheriff's Office)A building contractor is suing the Woodbury County Law Enforcement Center Authority, alleging it publicly disclosed false and defamatory information about the company.
Hausmann Construction Inc. of Lincoln, Nebraska, is suing the authority, Woodbury County, the architectural firms Introba Inc. and Goldberg Group Architects (GGA), and construction manager The Baker Group in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit stems from a long-running dispute over the design and construction of the $70 million Woodbury County Law Enforcement Center on 28th Street in Sioux City. The authority was created to facilitate the completion of the design and construction of the center, and Hausmann served as the prime or general contractor for the project.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lawsuit alleges the $43 million center that was initially contemplated by the parties in June 2021 is not the $70 million center that was constructed and exists today. “Throughout the life of the project, a multitude of issues have plagued the construction and completion of the Law Enforcement Center, stemming from certain design errors and omissions as put forth by GGA as the lead architect for the project,” the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims the alleged design errors brought the project “to a screeching halt in June 2023, which in turn has delayed almost every subsequent aspect of the project, increasing the ultimate cost of the project, and thereby bringing about” the current lawsuit.
According to the lawsuit, Hausmann unfairly “bears the brunt of many of the accusations for the overall delay in completion.” As recently as July 2, 2025, the lawsuit alleges, the authority acknowledged that the delay in completion of the project stemmed from the design errors. Despite that, the lawsuit claims, the authority has continued to “craft its own narrative of the issues plaguing the project to save GGA, Introba, and Baker Group from incurring additional expenses.”
On July 3, 2025, the authority, along with Woodbury County, allegedly sent a “confidential” 22-page demand letter to Hausmann, GGA, and Introba to facilitate settlement discussions. Despite knowing that the confidential letter was subject to disclosure under Iowa’s Open Records Law, the authority and county crafted the letter to include “various false and defamatory statements against Hausmann regarding Hausmann’s performance on the project,” the lawsuit claims.
Hausmann’s other projects and future projects have allegedly “been impacted by the authority’s release” of the letter, as “numerous news outlets have created damaging articles about Hausmann based on untrue and unsubstantiated allegations” within the letter, the lawsuit states.
“It is apparent that the authority, GGA, Introba, and Baker Group have very close outside relationships with each other, demonstrating a clear conflict of interest,” the lawsuit alleges, asserting that Baker Group hired the son of one authority member to oversee and manage the construction of the project.
“Given the cozy relationship between the authority, GGA, Introba, and Baker Group, it has been easiest for the authority to blame Hausmann for delays and refuse to pay Hausmann for its completion of the project,” the lawsuit claims.
In June 2023, for example, it was discovered that that design plans had failed to include fire and smoke dampers in the building’s heating, cooling and ventilation systems.  “The omission of the dampers was a clear design error and a life-safety threat where occupants could not be evacuated in the event of a fire at the authority’s facility,” the lawsuit alleges.
Construction of the building was completed last year and it is now occupied and operational. But as a result of the various delays, the authority has allegedly refused to pay Hausmann for $5.7 million that the company says it is owed for its work.
The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and unjust enrichment by the authority, professional negligence by Introba and GGA, and tortious interference with business relationships by each of the defendants.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Woodbury County attorney could not be reached for comment Friday.

(Getty Images)Two new Louisiana abortion restriction laws took effect Friday, including one that allows Louisianians to sue out-of-state providers of abortion-inducing medications. 
House Bill 575 by Rep. Lauren Ventrella, R-Greenwell Springs, was dubbed the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act.” It extends the window for abortion lawsuits to be filed from three to five years after the abortion occurs and allows out-of-state doctors and activists to be sued.
The legislation is part of an effort from anti-abortion advocates to crack down on doctors who ship abortion-inducing medication to states where the procedure is illegal. In nearly all instances, abortion has been illegal in Louisiana since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
Also taking effect is House Bill 425 by Rep. Josh Carlson, R-Lafayette, which expands the definition of coerced abortion. It is now defined in state law as the “use or threatened use of force, control, or intimidation” against a pregnant woman to compel her to undergo an abortion against her will, regardless of whether the procedure has been attempted or completed.
Carlson’s legislation originally sought to expand the definition of coerced abortion to include the pregnant person’s actions. It was substantially trimmed back in committee to add battery, assault, simple kidnapping, false imprisonment and extortion involving another person. 
The two bills easily passed the Republican-supermajority legislature earlier this year, although both were whittled down from their original, far-sweeping versions. 
Ventrella’s law has the support of Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is currently prosecuting a New York doctor accused of providing abortion-inducing medication to the mother of a pregnant minor in West Baton Rouge Parish. Gov. Kathy Hochul has refused to extradite the doctor to Louisiana to face the charges, citing New York’s shield laws. 
The doctor and the minor’s mother were both indicted. Murrill has alleged the minor was coerced to take the medication, though her mother was not charged with that crime.
Murrill and other attorneys general called on Congress this week to prevent states where abortion is legal from shielding doctors who prescribe abortion-inducing medication for people in states where the procedure is banned.

,DC,2025-08-01 19:14:11+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump levies a host of new tariffs on U.S. trading partners,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-levies-host-new-tariffs-us-trading-partners,,"WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump pushed ahead with his promise to raise tariffs on foreign goods by Aug. 1, signing an order late Thursday increasing import taxes on products from nearly every U.S. trading partner.Trump’s directive, and new data on weaker job growth, sent markets tumbling Friday.The president imposed a 15% base tariff on products imported from nearly three dozen nations across five continents, plus the 27 trading nations that comprise the European Union. Trump slapped higher rates on select other countries, ranging from 18% on goods from Nicaragua to 30% on South Africa and 50% on Brazil.The White House hailed the “reciprocal” tariffs as “a necessary and powerful tool to put America First after many years of unsustainable trade deficits that threaten our economy and national security,” according to a press release accompanying the executive order.Trump describes the tariffs as “reciprocal” because they are his response to countries that have trade deficits with the U.S. — meaning that country sells more products to the U.S. than it buys.U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer called the new rates “historic.”“Over the past few months, the President’s tariff program and the ensuing 'Trump Round' of trade negotiations have accomplished what the World Trade Organization and multilateral negotiations have not been able to achieve at scale: expansive new market access for U.S. exporters, increased tariffs to defend critical American industries, and trillions of new manufacturing investments and purchases of goods that will create great American jobs and help reassert American leadership in key strategic sectors,” Greer said in a statement Wednesday.The tariff announcement, combined with a weaker-than-expected jobs report Friday from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, caused sell-offs Friday from the three major U.S. stock indexes, according to financial media reports.Trump fumed Friday afternoon about report adjustments that significantly decreased jobs numbers for May and June, even calling for the commissioner for labor statistics to be fired.Tariffs and lawsuitsTrump made history earlier this year when he became the first president to trigger tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act.The move sparked legal challenges from small businesses and Democratic-led states, and the plaintiffs faced the Trump administration Thursday in federal appeals court.Tariffs are taxes on imported products that U.S. companies and other buyers pay to the U.S. government.Trump announced staggering tariffs under an emergency declaration on April 2, what he referred to as “Liberation Day,” but delayed the new import taxes after global markets plummeted in response to the shock announcement.Trump also separately announced Thursday a 35% levy on imported products from Canada that fall outside the bounds of an already established trade agreement between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Trump continued a 25% tariff on certain Mexican goods, but paused any rate increases to allow for 90 days of negotiations, according to media reports. The U.S. is continuing negotiations with China, whose products face a base import tax rate of 30%.Marc Noland, executive vice president and director of studies for the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said Trump’s latest tariff rates are “unfortunate.”“It will contribute to higher prices and slower growth here in the United States,” Noland said, adding there’s “a question about how sustainable they are legally here in the U.S.”“And it's particularly unfortunate, because I'm looking at the entire list of countries and see that the countries with the highest rates are the countries that are in the worst shape — Laos gets 40%, Syria got 41%,  Myanmar gets 40%. It's the poorest, most desperate countries that are getting hit with the highest tariffs. So it's bad for us and it's bad for the world,” Noland told States Newsroom in an interview Friday.The 15% rate on imports from dozens of countries mirrors the deals Trump announced in recent weeks with Japan, South Korea and European Union — though many details remain unknown.“There are real questions about what exactly did anybody agree to,” Noland said. “And you know this, these don't have the force of law that a treaty negotiated and passed by our Congress and somebody else's national legislature have like, say, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, which, as we see, was unilaterally abrogated.”‘Predictable’ trade agenda urgedTrade and industry advocates have also reacted to the new tariffs.Gary Shapiro, CEO and vice chair of the Consumer Technology Association, issued a statement Thursday saying Trump’s new rates “highlight the uncertainty American innovators face in today’s trade environment.”“CTA continues to urge the Administration and Congress to pursue a predictable, forward-looking trade agenda rooted in fairness and collaboration with trusted partners,” said Shapiro, whose organization hosts the annual CES trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. “American innovation thrives when markets are open, trade rules are clear, and businesses are free to focus on creating jobs and bringing groundbreaking technologies to market.”The National Foreign Trade Council warned that “Whatever progress that’s ultimately achieved as part of these new trade deals will come at the steep price of significant U.S. tariff increases and the erosion of trust with America’s key partners.”The statement Thursday from the industry group’s president, Jake Colvin, continued: “Institutionalizing the highest U.S. duties since the Great Depression, coupled with ongoing uncertainty, will ultimately make American businesses less competitive globally and consumers worse off while harming relationships with close geopolitical allies and trading partners.”",,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

On June 30, the Trump administration informed states it would put $6.8 billion in federal K-12 school funding on hold. This funding, for migrant education and English Language Learning (ELL) programs, as well as before- and after-school services, had already received approval from Congress. But the administration said it paused disbursement of the money, which typically occurred July 1, while it conducted a review of the programs receiving funding.
The administration announced plans to release these funds to states July 25, after having completed the review. Though the funding is set to be available as schools start the academic year, some programs throughout the country have said the pause meant they had to stop programs during the summer and may face issues returning.

In Iowa, there have not been reports of any programs stopping service because of the federal funding freeze. With funding restored, programs at many school districts are proceeding as planned — but the federal government’s decision to conduct this review in July put some schools in a precarious position heading into the 2025-2026 school year.
Stacey Cole, superintendent of Storm Lake Community School District, said the district is “cautiously entering the school year with status quo” on funding these programs — but that the funding freeze will impact budget discussions in future years.
“I am concerned about this happening again,” Cole said.
The Storm Lake school district has a large ELL and immigrant student population. The funding would have impacted both after-school and English learning programming, she said. Other services the school district offers also would have been affected, such as those that help immigrant families navigate the U.S. school system with assistance filing needed paperwork, getting insurance and other ways to adjust to their new community.
The funding for these programs had been approved earlier in 2025, largely going toward staff, Cole said, before the freeze was even announced. But the federal government action means the district will likely have to view the future of these programs differently moving forward, she said.
“When we enter this school year, we still have those people in place, the programs will be in place, all the things. But as we navigate the waters this year, anytime there’s an opportunity to think, ‘well, is that something that we could live without?’ We’re going to be thinking about that. Because I’m not confident that we won’t have a similar message next July, and I’m going to have to be prepared for that.”
Theron Schutte, superintendent of the Marshalltown Community School District, said his district had faced a nearly $600,000 shortfall because of the funding pause. These federal dollars went toward historically underserved communities, he said, like low-income, English Second Language (ESL) and migrant students and their families, he said, as well as some students with special education needs, through programs like after-school tutoring for migrant students, swim lessons and summer school lessons.
As more than one-third of the Marshalltown school district’s student population are English language learners, the funding freeze was a major concern as the district looked at how it could continue to provide support for the families that rely on these programs, he said.
“It would have a huge impact, because we have a very large immigrant population in Marshalltown,” Schutte said. “Some of those services that would have been significantly reduced and jobs lost would have been in our Welcome Center, where we have staff that are devoted to helping orientate and register new families into the district, and to be able to accommodate families that speak different languages.”
The Marshalltown school district did not have to stop any programs from the funding pause this year. But during the pause, the school district was considering having to close or reduce services in the following year, Schutte said.
Even though the funding was restored, there are still questions about whether federal education funding pauses or cuts are on the horizon, he said. Combined with lower K-12 education funding from the Iowa state government in the past decade, he said, school districts are left in an unstable position when these funds are not provided.
Cole said the federal freeze for ELL and migrant programs will have an impact on how school districts will evaluate other programs and areas that receive funding from the U.S. government.
“This felt like it came out of nowhere, and so it was something that we were extremely unprepared for,” Cole said. “I was not thinking in March that there would be an announcement that a significant portion of our federal dollars would not be coming. And so, as we think about that, I’m also cautious with funding streams that weren’t talked about, right? And so it’s really difficult for us to plan.”
Other Trump administration directives target education funding for migrant students
Though the funding for migrant and English Second Language K-12 students was restored, the Trump administration has also pursued other efforts focused on education funding that goes toward migrant families. In July, the U.S. Department of Education released a memo saying adult students without legal status must be banned from federally-funded classes, including English language, technical education and high school equivalency courses.
People taking these courses will be citizenship and immigration verification requirements, according to the guidance. But many impacted institutions, including some K-12 schools that offer career education courses, said they are unsure about the implementation of verification steps, as students are not required to provide citizenship paperwork or other documents.
Many immigrant students legally in the country also do not have access to documents needed to verify their status, advocates say.
Des Moines Area Community College will receive necessary funding for its adult education programming as a result of federal funding being released, with a new caveat that officials say could make administrative burdens even heavier and result in a chilling effect among potential participants.
Erica Spiller, DMACC vice president for student affairs, said the community college received a memo saying it will see the same amount of funding as in past years for these programs, coming in at $741,600. Just under $3.5 million in adult basic education funding will be awarded to community colleges across Iowa.
However, these dollars come with the new requirement that the colleges verify citizenship of those who take advantage of the programming, Spiller said. As an open access institution, Spiller said DMACC doesn’t have the systems in place to easily take on this task, so departments across the college would feel hit hard by the extent of the new work.
When DMACC opens registration for its noncredit English Language Learner classes and high school equivalency tests, both of which Spiller said receive federal dollars, lines long enough to wrap around the building form, filled with people hoping to get a seat. If the citizenship of each of these people will need to be checked before they sign up for a class, the college will have to figure out how the process is going to work and how complicated it will be.
“It’s going to take more staff, it’s going to take more time,” Spiller said.
Based on feedback Spiller has heard from the communities that utilize these services, she said the new rules will have a chilling effect on attendance. Programs focused on adult education are an important workforce driver, she said, and both Iowans and those who move here in the future need to be able to access them in order to gain skills that will make them more employable in the state.
“I’m concerned that if it does have a chilling effect, if people can’t access this, or don’t access this, it’s going to have an impact on our economy,” Spiller said.
A similar directive requiring citizenship verification has been issued for participation in Head Start, the federally funded preschool program, as well as for other Title X programs related to family planning.
Cole said it is unclear how these directives will impact the Storm Lake school district, or whether there will be new requirements on checking students’ or families’ documents for participation in other programs.
When thinking about these federal funding streams, she said, people may not realize the impact these services and programs have on their lives and their community, even if they do not directly interact with these programs. For example, Cole said, a child may not be in a program working with migrant students — but without that program, they may get less attention in class, as a teacher will have to focus more on catching other students up on certain material, or have to spend more time on classroom management.
“It’s easy to look at these funding streams and to push them off and make them someone else’s issue,” she said. “But the reality is, is that the loss of these funds are going to impact all kids. And I just want to make sure that people are thinking about that, and that the unintended consequences might be very detrimental to kids in our own lives that we really love and care about.”

In stereotypically bureaucratic fashion, the Corps’ July draft study for a flood control project on the Pearl River is the latest in a process that’s now lasted roughly 40 years.
At least one resident decided that, whichever proposal the agency moves forward with, if any, they’ve had enough. 
“I’m interested in a buyout, I want out,” said Thia Walker, a resident of the Canton Club neighborhood in northeast Jackson, adding her street had flooded that very afternoon. “It’s taken a long time for all these plans and alternatives and it seems like there’s never going to be plan that’s suitable for the masses.
“This will go on and on forever and I’m ready to get out.”

The Corps, in its July publication, narrowed its project selection to two options: “Alternative D1” and “Alternative E1.”
D1 is a scaled back version of the controversial “One Lake” plan that the project’s local sponsor — the Rankin-Hinds Flood Control District, or the levee board — had pushed for years before the Corps decided against the idea. The proposal would dam the Pearl River and lower its banks, allowing water to pool between a stretch starting just north of Lakeland Drive to just below Interstate 20. The project would also include four sets of levees, including one for the Canton Club neighborhood.
Several residents and public officials, including recently elected Mayor John Horhn, gave their support to D1, praising its potential to deliver economic and recreational opportunities to a poor city facing a declining population. 
“This flood control project can be the spark that ignites that rebirth in our city,” Horhn said during the afternoon session at St. Philip’s Episcopal Church.

The proposal E1 copies D1 except for including a dam, meaning it wouldn’t include the colloquial “lake” people associate with D1. Not having a dam also makes E1 the cheaper option. The Corps estimates D1 could cost as much as $960 million, versus $788 million for E1. 
Some, though, criticized the Corps for already ruling out a third option, “Alternative A1,” which the agency says would only cost up to $22 million. A1, which is the only one of the three that wouldn’t alter the river or its banks, would include elevating and floodproofing structures as well as offering buyouts. But compared to the other two plans, the agency limits the scope of A1, including just one levee and only offering elevation and buyouts for certain structures. 
“Once more, we urge the Corps to expand A1 because it doesn’t go far enough,” said Jill Mastrototaro of Audubon Delta. 
The benefits in that option, the Corps says, is limited by how many property owners choose to participate. But Mastrototaro and others argued that A1 could produce more benefits if the agency simply expands its scope. The agency’s study shows that of the three proposals, A1 is the only one with positive net benefits.

Tributaries and drainage in Jackson
While Thursday’s conversation focused on the river itself, several residents brought up more immediate causes of flooding, such as clogged creeks and storm water drains. 
“I live in (the Mcleod neighborhood), and I know personally that our storm drains are failing,” said Greta Mack Harris. “I’m nervous to go home after I leave here. Our clogged and collapsing culverts cause flooding and damage our foundation, walls and plumbing.”
Others pointed to tributary flooding as more regular issue than Pearl River flooding. While the Corps’ study doesn’t address the river’s tributaries in Jackson, it does mention other ongoing efforts.
The Mississippi Soil and Water Conservation Commission has three projects in the design phase, using U.S. Department of Agriculture funding, to reduce flooding along Hanging Moss Creek, Lynch Creek and Lake Ridgelea in Byram. The construction for those, however, isn’t set to begin until December 2028. The city of Jackson is also in the design phase of a flood reduction project along Eubanks Creek.
Downstream impacts
While the Corps maintains that neither D1 nor E1 would affect the river’s flow once it reaches Monticello, residents in Louisiana, where the Pearl River reaches downstream, are unconvinced. Brandon Davis, environmental planning chief for the agency’s Vicksburg district, admitted at a meeting in Slidell, Louisiana, on Wednesday that the Corps didn’t have the authority nor funding to fully study what would happen to the river south of Jackson, NOLA.com reported.

Davis clarified to Mississippi Today that other rivers impact the Pearl River once it reaches those places. 
“Those areas down in Monticello, Slidell have their own issues with bank caving and erosion,” he said. “But it’s not necessarily tied to what’s going on up here. You have the Strong River, Copiah Creek, other tributaries that are causing most of the issues you’re seeing there.”
The study notes that D1 and E1 would “likely adversely affect” several endangered or threatened species along the Pearl River, including three different types of turtles. D1, the Corps wrote, would impact a wider range of species, including the Gulf sturgeon, than E1. 
When asked what that impact could look like, Davis said those habitats included anywhere the project may “temporarily” affect. But as far as how affected the habitats would be, he said only that they wouldn’t be “completely eradicated.”
Comment period and next steps
The public comment period is still ongoing and ends on Aug. 18. The Corps encourages the public to visit its project website to see how to submit feedback.
Vicksburg District commander Col. Jeremiah Gipson said the process is on schedule to send a final study and recommendation to the assistant secretary of the Army for Civil Works by the end of 2025. Some residents asked the Corps to extend the ongoing comment period, which Gipson said would be his decision.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31182154/Pearl-River-flooding-public-meeting-4.jpg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Photo by Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician doctors after the state’s near-total abortion ban took effect, a new study published in a peer-reviewed academic journal confirms.
The study — published Thursday in the JAMA Network Open, a division of the Journal of the American Medical Association — found that Idaho lost 35% of its doctors who practiced in obstetrics. In total, Idaho lost 94 of those doctors out of 268 between August 2022 and December 2024, the study found.
Idaho’s abortion ban took effect in 2022, after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned national abortion protections. Some OB-GYNs, including maternal-fetal medicine specialists, said publicly that they were leaving because of the ban.
“These results provide a stark picture of a rapidly declining maternal health workforce in our state,” the study’s lead author, Dr. Edward McEachern, said in a statement.
The study appears to confirm findings from a report in February 2024 by the Idaho Physician Well-Being Action Collaborative that found Idaho lost 22% of its practicing obstetricians since the state’s abortion bans took effect.
Despite calls for change in the three years Idaho’s ban has been in place, including by the state’s top medical association, Idaho lawmakers have largely refused to modify Idaho’s strict abortion laws. Organizers are collecting signatures to qualify a ballot initiative in November 2026 that could end Idaho’s strict abortion bans and establish reproductive freedom rights.
“Since Idaho’s abortion ban went into effect, (the Idaho Medical Association) has raised the alarm about the unintended consequences of criminalizing medically necessary care for pregnant women,” Idaho Medical Association CEO Susie Keller said in a statement. “This study clearly shows how our legal environment is causing physicians to leave the state and making it more difficult to recruit new ones to take their place. Idaho is digging a physician workforce hole that will take years, if not decades, to fill.”
Over 40% of the obstetrics doctors Idaho lost since its abortion bans took effect moved out of state, the study found. More than a fifth retired, but some narrowed their medical practice focus to gynecology or stopped practicing in rural areas, the study found.
The study pulled information from publicly available professional credentialing sources, physician websites, national registries and confirmation from the doctors.
The vast majority of Idaho’s remaining OB/GYN doctors are practicing in the state’s seven most populated counties, the study found. Just 23 OB/GYN doctors practice in Idaho’s other 37 counties that are home to nearly a quarter of the state’s population, compared to 151 in Idaho’s seven most populated counties, according to the study.

(Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)With most jobs, you have to give your boss an idea of where you are and what you are doing during the workday. Gov. Bob Ferguson, who works for the people of Washington state, has not been doing this consistently during his first seven months in office.
Ferguson has mostly abandoned the practice of sending out advisories, letting the press know where he will be and when. The rare calendar updates that do go out are typically incomplete and sometimes arrive after the fact.
Take, for example, the advisory his office sent for “the week of July 14-20.” It landed in our inboxes around 1 p.m. on Monday, July 14, and contained information about the governor’s schedule for one day: Monday, July 14, “Orcas Island Day.” 
The governor was scheduled to attend four meetings and events on the island between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. By the time we received the advisory, start times for three of the four had passed.
Most weeks this summer, the press has received no calendar updates at all.
This was the case last week, when Ferguson attended the Washington State Labor Council convention in Vancouver. His office did not send notice that he’d be there. We learned from the Labor Council that he’d be making remarks on the main stage.
A schedule for the governor we later obtained through a public records request showed he also met with union officials representing machinists, Teamsters and electrical workers.
That schedule also included meetings last week with the Quileute and Quinault tribal councils. He posted on social media about attending the opening of a new Quinault Indian Nation building that received funding from the state’s Climate Commitment Act.
Why does this matter? Washingtonians pay Ferguson’s $218,744 a year salary. It’s not unreasonable to think they should have some window into what he’s doing during the week — the events he’s turning out for, who he’s meeting with. It’s a reflection of his priorities.
The handful of public appearances Ferguson has given notice about since the legislative session, and its subsequent flurry of bill signings, wrapped up have often focused on criticizing the president or congressional Republicans.
We’ve covered these events. But the governor’s responsibilities extend beyond reacting to federal policy.
Even the basics of his whereabouts are often a mystery. Is he working at his office at the Capitol in Olympia, or spending most of his time in Seattle? Has he traveled out of state, leaving the lieutenant governor in charge for a day or two? Much of the time, it’s difficult to know.
This is why, going forward, we’ll include a new section in our Saturday newsletter, called “Where’s the governor?” Our goal is to recap some of what we do know each week about what Ferguson has been up to. (You can subscribe to our newsletter here.)
If Ferguson resumes sending out weekly calendars and more frequent advisories about where he will be and when, we’ll distill highlights. If his lack of transparency continues, we’ll keep doing our best to piece together how he’s spending his time.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 18:57:14+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge sends English Station cleanup dispute back to DEEP,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/english-station-power-plant-united-illuminating-new-haven/,The ruling came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated power plant.,"A Connecticut judge on Thursday ordered state officials to go back to their deliberations in a long-running dispute with United Illuminating over the cleanup of one of the utility’s former power plants, English Station.
The ruling — which is almost certain to add further delays to the remediation effort — came just days after officials in New Haven announced ambitious plans to tear down the dilapidated plant and develop the site into a waterfront park complete with walking trails and a public pool.
“While this is not the only dispute that has interfered with the remediation of the English Station site, originally contemplated to have been completed years ago, the parties’ dispute over the applicable cleanup standard inside the buildings is a significant impediment to completing that project,” Superior Court Judge John B. Farley wrote in his decision.
United Illuminating operated the plant for more than a half century, burning coal and later oil to produce electricity for its customers, before the plant was finally powered down in 1992.  During its run, the site became heavily contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, resulting in a complex and costly remediation effort. 
Over the years, the plant fell into disrepair and was subject to vandalism and thefts of leftover metal. As part of a deal with regulators to approve UI’s merger with Spanish utility giant Iberdrola in 2015, the company agreed to spend $30 million to clean up the site.
That agreement, however, quickly became subject to a dispute over the standard to which the property should be cleared of contaminants and made ready for development.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, led by Commissioner Katie Dykes, argued that the consent decree signed by both parties required UI to remediate PCB levels in the plant building to below 1 part per million, which would allow for a wider range of future uses, such as housing, businesses or recreation. Utility officials balked, arguing that doing so would require the complete demolition of the building — something they had not agreed to do during negotiations over the agreement.
Last year, Dykes issued a ruling requiring UI to abide by the higher remediation standard. UI promptly sued, arguing that Dykes had overstepped her authority and misconstrued the language in the consent decree to suit the state’s desire for a more robust cleanup.
In his decision on Thursday, however, Judge Farley opted not to side with either party’s interpretation of the consent decree, which he said was ambiguous as to the required level of cleanup.
Instead, Farley remanded the case back to DEEP for further proceedings. At the same time, he found that Dykes had not abused her authority by issuing a declaratory ruling, thus allowing her to make further decisions regarding the consent decree.
In a statement Friday, United Illuminating spokesperson Sarah Wall Fliotsos said the company appreciated the decision to sustain their appeal and send the case back to DEEP. 
“In this case, DEEP wrongfully changed the standard for clean-up that was agreed upon nearly a decade ago,” Fliotsos said. “It is clear DEEP was wrong to try to enforce a standard that was not part of the original agreement, and they are wrong to continue to blame UI for delays.”
“Ultimately, clean-up of this site cannot be achieved without clarity on the standard we are working towards,” she added. “As this issue is remanded for further proceedings, we hope to be able to work in good faith with state officials to chart a clear path forward for UI’s role in the future of English Station.”

DEEP officials referred comment to Attorney General William Tong’s office, which represented the agency in the lawsuit. Tong told the CT Mirror on Friday that his office is still reviewing the judge’s decision and its impact on the cleanup process.
“We’re gonna keep fighting,” Tong said. “UI owes whatever it takes to remediate English Station, and I’m never going to come off that position.”
A spokesman for New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said Thursday that the ruling would not impact the city’s plans to move ahead with the proposed redevelopment of English Station.
“As the City advances its proposal for Mill River Park, it’s critical that UI stop dragging its feet and complete the remediation of English Station so that this land can finally be put to good public use, and we’re confident the Attorney General and CT DEEP will continue to hold UI accountable for its longstanding failure to clean up this site,” the spokesman, Lenny Speiller, said in a statement.
“We hope the City’s proposal and intended use of the site brings a new focus and urgency on what needs to be done to help make this vision a reality,” he added.
The city’s proposal is part of a larger plan to redevelop former industrial areas along the Mill River, which surrounds the small island on which the power plant sits. 
In order to make the land safe for walking, playing and swimming, the site would have to be cleaned to the 1 ppm level being sought by DEEP, Speiller said. Even then, the city has estimated it will cost at least another $25 million to develop its park proposal.
“After bearing the costs of industrial pollution and blight from the English Station power plant for decades, our community deserves a true treasure in its place,” Elicker said in his announcement of the city’s plans on Monday. “By replacing it with a new waterfront public park and recreation area, we will transform this site into an amazing public asset that will benefit our residents, improve our environment and strengthen our community for generations to come.”
Beyond the initial cleanup, however, other hurdles exist that could complicate the city’s plans. 
New Haven still has to acquire the English Station property, which has changed hands several times over the last two decades. On Monday, city officials sent letters to the current owners of the island expressing their desire to “negotiate a fair purchase price” for the property. If the owners do not respond, Speiller said, the city will consider using eminent domain to acquire the property.
The owners are a pair of limited liability corporations tied to three people — George Goldstein, Esther Schiller and David Tropper — with business addresses listed in Brooklyn, Queens and Israel.
When reached for comment earlier this week, Goldstein at first denied being one of the owners of English Station before saying he had received the city’s letter and was reviewing it. “I have to get back to you on that,” Goldstein said when asked if he was interested in selling the property.
Schiller and Tropper could not be reached for comment. Goldstein hung up after being reached for comment a second time on Friday.
Local advocates have also questioned the need to tear down the hulking, brick-clad structure of English Station, which many argue carries historic and aesthetic significance to the city.
Anstress Farwell, the president of the New Haven Urban Design League, said this week that she supported the city’s efforts to take control of the power plant property, though she called its plans to raze the remaining buildings “premature” until further studies can be done to determine whether they are salvageable.
“In all of my talks with the city, it’s been about ‘the building is an asset,'” Farwell said. “It’s 110,000 square feet that city officials have said that they could never rebuild on the site but could use if it could be renovated.”
Nor did Thursday’s ruling put an end to the state’s ongoing legal battle against UI over English Station.
Tong filed a separate lawsuit last year, accusing the utility of failing to uphold its agreement to spend $30 million on the remediation effort. In response, UI officials have argued that the company has already spent millions toward the remediation of the site, including removal of asbestos, but that its efforts have been hampered by the ongoing dispute with DEEP.
That case is also assigned to Judge Farley, who issued a separate ruling on Thursday dismissing four out of the five defenses that the utility had raised. That case is currently set for trial in October 2026.
Lastly, there is the case involving the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority’s decision in 2023 to begin fining United Illuminating $2 million a year over what regulators called a failure to abide by the utility’s agreement to remediate English Station. Earlier this year, a judge upheld the legality of that penalty — a decision that the utility is appealing.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ENGLISH-STATION-01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-01 15:57:12.442223

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana state Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, created and leads a new task force that will study name, image and likeness issues for college and high school athletes. 
You can also listen to a version of this interview on the latest episode of our podcast, “The Light Switch.”

Piper Hutchinson: NIL is such a fun topic, but I think some people don’t know what it is. Can you kind of explain what NIL is? 
Rep. Rashid Young:  NIL is an acronym for name, image and likeness, and it’s something that came about around 2020, 2021. It’s where athletes, college and or high school athletes are able to be paid off of their name, image and likeness. It’s very similar to the endorsement deals that professional athletes have been able to get for a while, and it started as players being able to use their name, image and likeness to get endorsement deals, and it has since morphed into something much more. 
Now we’re having conversations about revenue sharing. We’re having conversations about student athletes potentially becoming employees, but at its core, it is about the name, image and likeness of student athletes. 
  Rep. Rashid Young (Louisiana Legislature)
Hutchinson: You’re interested in this because you yourself were a student athlete. Is that right?
Young: Yeah, I was a student athlete for a while, and always loved sports from the time I was a little kid. Played it, I enjoyed it. And then after undergrad, I started doing some coaching and teaching as well. So I was really able to get into the development of other young players and then, you know, I later started practicing law. 
So now my passions are sort of intertwined between sports and law and legislating, and so this NIL space just seems to fit really well with my skill set and my passions.
Hutchinson: And you played football at Grambling back before NIL times? 
Young: I did. I played ball, that was before NIL was even thought of, and it’s funny because we would see our name on, like, the NCAA sports games, and we would be so excited, “Oh, look, I’m on the roster. I’m in the game.” But had we been able to capitalize and be paid off of it, that would have been great.
Hutchinson: It has been kind of a game changer. So you’ve got this task force. You just had your first meeting last week, but this started with some legislation. Tell me about the legislation and why it didn’t move forward.
Young:  Last session, I brought a piece of legislation that would have exempted the first $12,500 from being taxed by Louisiana for all NIL deals. And there was another colleague that brought legislation where he tried to exempt the entirety of NIL payments to students, both in the same spirit. Neither piece of legislation moved forward. 
My piece of legislation, it was my choice to not move it forward. I decided not to bring it for a committee vote after speaking with several members in the body, and I think the general consensus was that our body needed to be more informed on what NIL is, how that particular legislation could benefit the state and benefit the universities. 
So this task force is sort of one of those fact-seeking, information-finding initiatives where we’ll be able to go back to the legislature and say, “Hey, this is what our higher ed athletic directors and coaches are saying. This is how we can be competitive as a state and hopefully to be able to move some legislation like that forward in 2026.”
Hutchinson: What topics do you think the task force is going to cover and make recommendations on?
Young: We are looking at evaluating the effectiveness of the current NIL frameworks and university compliance. We’re looking at protecting student athletes from exploitation or inequitable agreements. Then we’re looking at recommending best practices that support the financial stability and competitive integrity of higher education athletic departments. 
I think that’s a huge undertaking. I think to be able to get some meaningful recommendations after five or six meetings is going to be really tough, but I think we have a good working group. I’m hopeful that we’ll walk away from the task force with some meaningful recommendations. 
Hutchinson: One of the big topics at the first meeting was the issue of international athletes and NIL. Why is that so tricky?
Young: I don’t claim to be the expert in international law. But from my understanding, there are work restrictions that the international students have. Their visas have certain work restrictions. I’m understanding that it’s going to come down to how we define income for international athletes. So are we defining it as passive income, which wouldn’t be violating the work requirements? Or are we define it as active income, which could potentially violate the terms of their visas? 
It’s a huge issue. We heard from quite a few athletic directors from across the state that are saying that a large portion of their athletic base is, in fact, international students, and so that’s something that we’re going to be looking to address. 
And look, it is a complex issue because you’re dealing with visas, you’re dealing with tax code definitions. All of that is something that I’m confident that this legislature can start to address and if we need to partner with folks on a federal level, I think we can do that.
Hutchinson: One of the things that surprised me from that first meeting was that there’s nothing in Louisiana law about NIL for high school athletes. We’ve got these kids running around making these NIL deals. Do you think regulating that is going to come up in the legislation?
Young: I think we are certainly going to propose something. I think we heard from a couple of representatives from the high school level, and one in particular, our legendary coach, JT Curtis. He was very passionate about what he’s seeing. He talked about predatory agents and marketing representation environment for high schools. 
I think it’s incumbent upon us as a state to step in and say, “Hey, how can we support our high school athletes?” So that’s certainly something that we’re looking at, and hopefully something we can move forward in 2026. 
Hutchinson: At the end of the day, we’re talking about young kids and pretty big sums of money. So there’s a need to protect them, right? 
Young: Absolutely, yeah, we’re talking about young kids, pretty big sums of money. We’re talking about their parents. We’re talking about their parents being able to understand what their kids are signing? And look, I’m a lawyer in my time when I’m not here in the legislature, and we know that you have to be 18 to be able to legally contract. There are some exceptions to the law, but we want to make sure that the parents and the kids understand from the beginning that if you’re not legally able to contract, then you shouldn’t be subjected to certain predatory suggestions from agents or people that claim to be agents. So that’s one of the areas that we want to look at. 
But at the end of day, it’s about protecting our babies. It’s about protecting our kids. And one of the things that the coach said that I thought was great, he talked about their mental health. That’s really important because we don’t want our most vulnerable in our population, our youth, to take hits to their mental health because we fail to regulate a particular area of law, so we want to step in and see how we can help.

Article Summary



The Chicago Cubs will host the 2027 MLB All-Star Game, the team’s fourth time hosting the event.
The announcement comes amid state- and city-backed security upgrades surrounding Wrigley Field being approved.
The 2027 season could be impacted by labor disputes between MLB players and owners.



This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

CHICAGO — The Chicago Cubs will host their fourth Major League Baseball All-Star Game in 2027.
The announcement, made Friday by MLB and Cubs officials, was attended by a cadre of elected officials, including Chicago’s mayor and several Chicago alderpeople, Gov. JB Pritzker, several state lawmakers and MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.
The 2027 game would give Wrigley Field the record for most games hosted by an active ballpark. Wrigley Field previously hosted the All-Star Game in 1947, 1962 and 1990.
Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, a “congenital Sox fan who grew up watching the Cubs on television,” said the news is “terrific.”
“I think any opportunity we have to showcase the city of Chicago and the state of Illinois to a national or international audience — whether its NASCAR or the President’s Cup or the 2027 All-Star Game — is good for all of us,” Harmon, of Oak Park, said.
Wrigley Field, which opened in 1914, underwent a $1 billion renovation project throughout the 2010’s in connection to its efforts to someday host another All-Star Game, according to Cubs executive Crane Kenney.

Further upgrades to the security infrastructure around Wrigley are likely coming, with the current plan including $12 million from the state and up to $10 million from the city to install new bollards designed to stop vehicles and move some of the infrastructure in front of Wrigley Field.
“I’m very proud to have worked with the General Assembly to provide security enhancements to bolster public safety around the park,” Pritzker said. “I’m also a proud Cubs fan, so that made it especially easy.”
Cubs chairman and part-owner Tom Ricketts said the state and city have been involved in renovations for longer. Wrigley, nicknamed the Friendly Confines, is located on the city’s North Side, bounded by Clark and Addison streets and Waveland and Sheffield avenues.
“People don’t know this, but Addison is actually a state road,” Ricketts said. “We needed cooperation from the city to move some sidewalks and to help with security efforts. I just really appreciate the governor and the mayor stepping up to make this happen.”
Ricketts emphasized the All-Star Game and other associated events will bring people to the city.
“We’ll have events at Navy Pier, we’ll do the Home Run Derby on the night before, we’ll have other games, and they also bring the Major League Baseball draft,” Ricketts said. “So it’ll be an incredible week for Chicago.”

That’s if the game happens at all. There is increasing tension between MLB players and owners as they approach the end of the current collective bargaining agreement in December 2026.
Once that contract ends, it could result in a lockout and potentially the first canceled regular-season games since a player strike in the mid-90s, not counting games that were canceled during the pandemic. If the season is impacted severely enough, the All-Star Game may be canceled altogether.
The game is scheduled for July 13, 2027.

(Provided by US Army Corps of Engineers)A food or beverage company is eyeing Orangeburg County for a possible new packaging and distribution facility.
Little else is known about the company, referred to by the code name, “Project Panther,” as economic development officials negotiate a deal to bring the facility to the county in the center of the state.
The county and state economic development agency have filed for a permit with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers seeking to fill in more than seven acres of wetlands on the 918-acre site south of the town of Orangeburg.
Those plans do not include any information on how much the company may invest or how many people it may hire. County economic development officials did not immediately respond to messages left by the SC Daily Gazette.
The application says the company has a need for access to rail and the interstate. Plans show an initial phase on the south end of the site with future phases expanding to the north and east.
The massive site is near Orangeburg’s municipal airport as well as existing industry, including a Hill’s pet food plant, cable maker The Okonite Company, Indevco plastics, metal powder supplier Ecka Granules and paving materials company Walker Emulsions.
The public has until Aug. 14 to comment on the application.
Electric vehicle battery-related company plans to build $1B plant in Orangeburg

The permit application follows another code-named deal, “Project Rhino,” under consideration by the county since March. That project, The Times and Democrat reported, could bring more than 600 new jobs to the area.
Last year, Orangeburg County netted its largest economic deal ever: a $1 billion dollar battery materials manufacturer.
Birla Carbon announced in October 2024 it planned to hire 124 people at its 435,000-square-foot facility, to be located at the 380-acre Tri-County Industrial Site near Interstate 26.
Operations are expected to begin in 2026, making synthetic graphite and battery materials for the electric vehicle, battery and defense industries.

Janet Mills gives her state of the budget address in January 2025. (Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Amid uncertainty over federal funding and the impact of steeper tariffs announced by the Trump administration Friday, Maine ended the fiscal year with a $152.2 million general fund surplus, nearly $60 million more than in 2024. 
The Maine Department of Administrative and Financial Services reported this figure on Friday, following the end of the fiscal year on June 30. The state’s Budget Stabilization Fund, also known as the rainy day fund, has also reached a record $1.03 billion, the maximum prescribed in statute.
Also this week, Fitch Ratings, a top international credit rating agency, upgraded its bond credit for Maine, Gov. Janet Mills and State Treasurer Joe Perry announced Friday. The agency increased Maine’s rating from “AA” to “AA+” — its second highest rating — noting the state’s “proven ability to maintain significantly improved dedicated operating reserves through a challenging budget cycle.” 
“Governor Mills’ and the Legislature’s fiscal policies have allowed us to build significant cash reserves, creating flexibility and security for the state,” said Perry, who was a former Democratic state representative. “This ratings upgrade from Fitch affirms that we are on a good path.”
The news comes after Mills and the state financial office have repeatedly warned about a projected overall revenue shortfall in the coming years, arguing that the state needs to tighten its belt and avoid new major spending commitments.
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, Sharon Huntley, director of communications for DAFS, explained that the surplus comes from the current fiscal year and is not related to the biennial budget that was set in June. 
Gov. Mills vows lean budget in light of projected revenue shortfall

Maine was facing a projected $450 million deficit, as well as an immediate funding gap to cover the cost of MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, when crafting that budget this year. 
The Maine Legislature failed to pass emergency spending to address the short-term deficit after Senate Republicans held out support, leading to delayed payments to providers. 
The Democratic majority of the Legislature then pushed through a two-year budget in March without Republican support that continued funding for state services at the same level while also providing some one-time funding for urgent needs, such as Medicaid, and in June passed a budget addition. That addition did not make as many program cuts or tax hikes as Mills requested.
One of the ways lawmakers managed to reject some of those cost-saving measures was by making use of unanticipated agency surpluses. For example, the budget paid for Medicaid in part by adding surplus cash at the end of the 2025 fiscal year into what’s called the “cascade,” a legislative authorization transferring available surplus funds at the close of the fiscal year after all statutory and financial commitments are met.  
After transfers to Medicaid and other statutory priorities, Maine law requires the remaining surplus to be divided, with 80% going to the budget stabilization fund and 20% to the highway and bridge capital fund. This year’s cascade resulted in $79.4 million added to the budget stabilization fund and $33.8 million to the highway fund.
“The nearly $34 million will be used to ensure this year’s construction as defined in our three-year work plan is adequately funded,” said Bruce Van Note, commissioner of the Maine Department of Transportation, who is retiring this month. “The plan includes projects that will improve roads and bridges, enhance safety, and increase economic opportunity through upgraded transportation infrastructure across the state.”
While celebrating the savings and upgraded credit rating, Mills highlighted in a statement that uncertainty with federal funding remains.
“Over the past six years, my administration has worked hard to invest in Maine people, improve our economy, and produce responsible, balanced state budgets,” Mills said. “I look forward to maintaining this progress for Maine people, despite the needless economic challenges and uncertainty coming from Washington.”
Maine has faced funding cuts under President Donald Trump’s administration, as have other states, in addition to what’s widely been considered retribution from the Trump administration over the state’s protections for transgender people. 
The administration also went ahead with implementing its sweeping tariffs that had been postponed until Friday. Now amounting to import taxes at levels not seen since the 1930s, these tariffs are expected to hurt Maine’s economy, notably due to Canada as the state’s largest trading partner and major source of tourism.
Because of uncertainty with federal funding and the economy, specifically impacts from tariffs, Maine’s Revenue Forecasting Committee discussed this spring possibly revising projections ahead of its next scheduled update on Nov. 1 but has so far made no such plans. 
As the end of the federal fiscal year approaches on September 30, U.S. Congress is also facing a possible government shutdown if it fails to pass appropriations bills by then, indicating the likelihood of another stop gap funding bill to avoid that.

(Photo courtesy pf DMACC)A former Des Moines Area Community College administrator, fired after making a comment about having “pulled a knife” on someone, is now suing the school, alleging age and racial discrimination.
Kim Jackson of Des Moines, who ran DMACC’s Upward Bound program for 20 years, is suing the school in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
Jackson alleges she was employed by DMACC for a total of 26 years until she was abruptly and wrongfully terminated on July 2, 2024. She alleges she filed a complaint with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and that the EEOC subsequently issued her a formal notice of her right to sue, clearing the way for her lawsuit.

Jackson alleges the school fired her for the pretextual reasons of gross misconduct and conduct unbecoming a supervisor.
The lawsuit notes that in November 2024, an administrative law judge with the Iowa Unemployment Insurance Appeals Bureau conducted a hearing on Jackson’s unemployment benefits claim and later ruled that, contrary to what DMACC had claimed, Jackson had not engaged in workplace misconduct.
According to the findings of the judge in that case, Jackson had raised her voice during a discussion with other Upward Bound employees in June 2024. Jackson had “a family connection” to two students who were being discussed and the other Upward Bound employees felt Jackson had been favoring the two and treating them differently than the other students in the program.
After being told the two students were rude and behaving in an “entitled” manner, Jackson allegedly responded that if one of the two had made the comments attributed to him it was not appropriate, stating loudly, “If he spoke to you like that, he needs to be corrected. He did not come from a family where that is okay.”
The judge found that Jackson “did not yell at the other employees, use profanity, threaten anyone, or disagree with the premise of the conversation.”
The judge noted that two days later, Jackson apologized to her colleagues for having raised her voice. While explaining that she tried to control her anger, Jackson referenced an incident from her youth when she pulled a knife on someone when she was angry — a comment some of her DMACC colleagues allegedly took as a threat, the judge found.
She was later fired for her conduct.
As a result of the unemployment hearing, Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson awarded Jackson jobless benefits, finding there was no workplace misconduct that would disqualify her.
“I do not believe Ms. Jackson referencing ‘pulling a knife’ on someone in her youth was a threat, but an explanation of why she no longer acts on her anger today,” Johnson ruled. “I do not think anyone in that meeting reasonably believed it was a threat, given that they all remained in the meeting and did not flee or call 911 or Campus Security.”
The lawsuit alleges the school’s stated reasons for firing Jackson were pretextual and that that DMACC’s Human Resources Department had been trying to get her to take early retirement since 2020, when she was roughly 60 years old.
“When Jackson was terminated, she was the only Black DMACC employee at a director-level position,” the lawsuit alleges. “Jackson’s responsibilities and roles were replaced by two white females who were more than 10 years younger than Jackson.”
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, including back pay and punitive damages, for discrimination and retaliation.
DMACC has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The school’s spokesperson could not be reached for comment late Thursday.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner)Workers at the state Treasurer’s Department who used ChatGPT to do research, write, and edit found using generative AI saved time, but reported it was essential to review and refine its results. 
State Treasurer Brad Briners’s office released a report Friday on the artificial intelligence pilot project  in the Unclaimed Property and State and Local Government Finance Divisions that he announced in March. The trial ends Monday. Briner said the office will try other tools to see how they compare. 
“This technology saves a material amount of time,” he said at a Friday news conference.  
“We estimate that it improved the productivity of our employees by about 10 percent in the early phases of the trial, and it kept improving,” he said. 
“We were able to orient our people toward more complex and human-centered interactions, which are inherently more productive and more satisfying.”
Briner said he did not consider artificial intelligence to be a replacement for people but to be used as a tool to help with their work. 
Workers comfortable with technology used it most, according to a report from the Institute for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Research at NC Central University. A few rarely used it. 
Workers felt best about using ChatGPT to write emails and letters, summarize meeting transcripts, find hidden or outdated information, and help with legal or compliance phrasing and documentation, according to the report. 
The report described 37% of the workers who participated in the pilot project as “super users” who used ChatGPT several times a day. Forty-eight percent were called “sporadic, general users” who deployed ChatGPT as needed for specific challenges. 
Seventy-one percent of ChatGPT users were positive about it, said Siobahn Day Grady, director of NCCU’s AI institute.
ChatGTP users found it did sometimes “hallucinate” or produce inaccurate information. It didn’t do well with coding, math-heavy, or legal work, the report said. 
“The technology is not perfect,” but neither are people, Grady said.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis is questioning the federal government’s recruitment of Florida’s local and state police who are focused on enforcing immigration laws.
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has been recruiting officers with specialized training to work for the federal agency, ABC news reported Thursday.
“I know that there’s some sheriffs that have some strong feelings about it,” DeSantis said Friday during a news conference in Orlando, flanked by Florida Highway Patrol troopers and the members of the Florida Cabinet. 
ICE is “dangling like a lot of bonus money and all this other stuff,” as the governor put it, to local and state officers who’ve received partial or full training in enforcing immigration laws and participating in 287(g) agreements. 
“Why not recruit additional people to be supplementing that instead of just kind of displacing?” DeSantis said. 
He bragged that Florida has made a stronger effort than any other state in deputizing state and local law enforcement officers to act on behalf of ICE. According to data released this week from that agency, approximately 320 of the nearly 900 agencies in the United States that have signed agreements with ICE are in Florida. 
“That’s been a huge help to ICE right? Let’s just be clear, that’s been a huge benefit to those federal agencies. And so now, if you’re in a situation where those folks are being poached off of that mission, well it’s like, wait a minute, how is that? Why don’t you bring in new people to supplement a mission going forward?” DeSantis said. 
The agency has offered willing officers up to a $50,000 bonus, paid over five years, ABC reported. 
“I think we want to continue doing what we’re doing. But sheriffs losing deputies who are in this fight to just go wear a different jersey, basically, but still be in the fight, that doesn’t necessarily add to what we’re doing. It’s just moving someone over. And so I think there is frustration from that, and so, we’ll see,” DeSantis said. 
Also in the ABC report, Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri called ICE’s outreach “wrong.”
“We have partnered with ICE like no other state to help ICE do its job of illegal immigration enforcement,” Gualtieri told the news organization. “ICE actively trying to use our partnership to recruit our personnel is wrong and we have expressed our concern to ICE leadership.”
DeSantis said he told sheriffs it’s up to them to “fight for what you think is right” and that he’s “heard a lot of static coming out of our sheriff’s departments” about the recruitment letters.

Everglades detention center
The news conference, nearly an hour and a half in length, featured the governor reciting the state’s record on immigration enforcement, including talking extensively about the Everglades deportation center that’s garnered national attention. 
The governor referenced news reports about the conditions inside the temporary facility. NBC reported “torturous conditions in cage-like units full of mosquitoes, where fluorescent lights shine bright on them at all times.”
“Phony narratives,” DeSantis called them but suggested: “Maybe they will have the intent, the effect, of deterring people from going there and choosing this option.”
State Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando, responded to the governor’s news conference in a written statement.
“Ron DeSantis and his hand-picked Cabinet didn’t come to Orlando to solve problems — they came to peddle a half-billion-dollar anti-immigrant grift. While everyday Floridians are struggling with the cost of living, DeSantis is using taxpayer dollars to fund a secretive detention camp, rip families apart, and divert our public safety officials away from real community needs,” she said in a written statement.
“They talk about enforcing the law while breaking it — hiding contracts, denying people due process, and using an appointed Attorney General who was just found in contempt of court. They intimidate local elected officials and ignore home rule, not based on laws but on political agendas. This isn’t leadership. It’s lawlessness.
“Floridians deserve better than political theater. Shut down the Everglades camp, restore transparency, and start putting people before politics.”
In addition to the Attorney General James Uthmeir, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Commissioner of Agriculture Wilton Simpson, DeSantis was joined by Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Director Dave Kerner, FHP Director Gary Howze II, and State Board of Immigration Enforcement Director Larry Keefe. 
Republican leaders will gather in Orlando this weekend for the Florida Freedom Forum, a fundraiser for the Republican Party of Florida.

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/08/gender-affirming-care-lawsuit/,California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed suit seeking to overturn an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for people under 19.,"In summary
California Attorney General Rob Bonta has filed suit seeking to overturn an executive order targeting gender-affirming care for people under 19. 


Trump administration restrictions on gender-affirming care for transgender and nonbinary youth violate the Constitution and undermine state laws that require equal access to medical treatment, according to a lawsuit filed today by Attorney General Rob Bonta and 14 other states and the District of Columbia. 
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, targets a January executive order that makes it U.S. policy not to “fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support” gender transition for people under 19. The order threatens to pull federal funding from medical institutions that provide this type of care. 
“The result is an atmosphere of fear and intimidation experienced by transgender individuals, their families and caregivers, and the medical professionals who seek only to provide necessary, lawful care to their patients,” the attorneys general wrote in the suit.
This marks the 37th lawsuit California has filed against the Trump administration.
Gender-affirming care is legal and protected for people 18 years old and older in California. Certain treatments are also available to younger people with parental consent. The lawsuit comes as some of the largest medical providers in the state halt gender-affirming services.
The Trump administration has “trampled over state rights, overstepped their constitutional authority and endangered vulnerable minors and 18-year-olds,” Bonta said in a Friday press conference announcing the lawsuit alongside the attorneys general of Illinois and Connecticut. 
U.S. Department of Justice officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit.
Providers scale back care
Following Trump’s executive order, the Justice Department directed employees to investigate doctors, hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that provided gender-affirming care. In July, U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi announced in a statement that her department had issued more than 20 subpoenas to medical providers as it investigates “healthcare fraud, false statements and more.”
Fearing prosecution, providers have scaled back on providing this type of care, which has left many patients without critical medical care, Bonta said. The care includes hormone therapy, puberty blockers and surgical procedures. Research shows that gender-affirming care can positively impact the mental health of transgender youth. Forcing young people to wait until they are 19 or older to start care allows symptoms of gender dysphoria to worsen, Bonta said.
The state attorneys general argue that acceding to Trump’s orders puts providers at odds with states’ anti-discrimination and age-of-majority laws. In California, it is illegal to deny care on the basis of gender identity and gender expression. At the same time, many medical providers rely heavily on federal funding in the form of research and education grants, as well as reimbursements from public payer programs like Medi-Cal.
The directives from the Trump administration have already forced several providers to suspend services. Last month, Children’s Hospital Los Angeles closed its gender-affirming care center, forcing about 3,000 patients under 21 to look elsewhere for care. 
“The shutdown came despite efforts my office took over recent months to assure (Children’s Hospital Los Angeles) that they were protected and required to provide gender-affirming care,” Bonta said.
Stanford Medicine has also paused surgical procedures for people under 19. And this week, Kaiser Permanente announced that it too would pause gender-affirming surgeries starting Aug. 29, noting that hormone therapies would still be available. 
The executive order being challenged is just one of several that Trump has issued targeting transgender people. Others include one that recognizes only two biological sexes, a second that prevents transgender girls and women from participating in women’s sports, and a third that threatens federal funds for schools that support transgender youth.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021325_CHLA-Gender-Affirming-Care-Demo_JWH_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

(Provided/Discover South Carolina)Faster internet could be coming to some South Carolina state parks.
Officials with the state parks department are evaluating parks with existing internet connections to determine which locations might benefit from higher-speed fiber optic cable, said spokeswoman Jayne Baker.
“This initiative aims to improve internet connectivity, support digital services and provide better experiences for visitors,” Baker said.
Visitors can access free Wi-Fi at 15 of the state’s 48 parks.
First on the docket for upgrades is Lake Greenwood State Park in Greenwood County. The parks department plans to pay internet company Upcountry Fiber nearly $100,000 to install high-speed internet at the park, according to a recent public notice.
Free Wi-Fi is already available at the 914-acre park’s office area and Drummond Center event space, according to its website.
A list of other parks that might get faster Wi-Fi was not available. Neither was a timeline for installation, Baker said.
Department staff are still evaluating which parks may or may not need upgrades, she said.
The need for faster internet has grown with increases in park attendance in recent years, department officials wrote in a request for state funding.
Wi-Fi at state parks helps staff stay connected, including during natural disasters and other emergencies, and also allows visitors to “have quick access to the information they need to make travel plans and decisions,” according to the agency budget request.
The Legislature set aside $200,000 to help improve information technology systems at park department-owned properties in the 2024-2025 budget, but no money was specifically designated for technology upgrades in the current fiscal year budget.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 18:06:40+00:00,CT Mirror,CT among states suing Trump over gender-affirming care,Associated Press and Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-among-states-suing-trump-over-gender-affirming-care/,The lawsuit comes after at least eight hospital systems — including two in CT — said they were stopping or restricting gender-affirming care.,"Seventeen Democratic officials accused President Donald Trump’s administration of unlawfully intimidating health care providers into stopping gender-affirming care for transgender youth in a lawsuit filed Friday.
The complaint comes after a month in which at least eight major hospitals and hospital systems — all in states, including Connecticut, where the care is allowed under state law — announced they were stopping or restricting the care. The latest announcement came Thursday from UI Health in Chicago.
Trump’s administration announced in July that it was sending subpoenas to providers and focusing on investigating them for fraud. It later boasted in a news release that hospitals are halting treatments.
The Democratic officials say Trump’s policies are an attempt to impose a nationwide ban on the treatment for people under 19 — and that’s unlawful because there’s no federal statute that bans providing the care to minors. The suit was filed by attorneys general from 15 states, including Connecticut, and the District of Columbia, plus the governor of Pennsylvania, in U.S. District Court in Boston.
“The federal government is running a cruel and targeted harassment campaign against providers who offer lawful, lifesaving care to children,” New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.
Trump and others who oppose the care say that it makes permanent changes that people who receive it could come to regret — and maintain that it’s being driven by questionable science.
Since 2021, 28 states with Republican-controlled legislatures have adopted policies to ban or restrict gender-affirming care for minors. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have a right to enforce those laws.
For families with transgender children, the state laws and medical center policy changes have sparked urgent scrambles for treatment.
Medical centers are responding to political and legal pressure
At a press conference in Hartford on Friday afternoon, Connecticut Attorney General William Tong criticized Yale New Haven Health and Connecticut Children’s Medical Center for recent announcements that they would stop providing medication treatment as part of their youth gender-affirming care services.
“I have expressed to them not just my disappointment, but the state’s profound disappointment, in their actions. And the state’s position is that the actions they have taken are wrong,” Tong said, though he added that the facilities are “between a rock and a hard place.”
Tong said senior leadership of both institutions told him they would provide gender-affirming care to patients under 19 if not for the threats from the federal government. However, he confirmed that, to his knowledge, none of the federal actions currently in effect directly threaten the hospitals’ Medicaid funding for providing such care. But that might not be true for long, he added.
“I’m not aware of a specific action at this moment,” Tong said. “But obviously we’re looking down the barrel at it.”
Heather Page, a parent of a trans child, said Yale New Haven Health’s decision sends the message that trans people do not deserve the same standard of care as everyone else. 
“It sends the message that they don’t matter and that they aren’t worth fighting for. This isn’t just about one program. It’s about the right to exist safely and access the care needed to thrive,” Page said.
Page said she’s made an appointment for her daughter at Boston Children’s Hospital, roughly an hour drive from the family’s home in Bethel.
The Center for Transyouth Health and Development at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, the biggest public provider of gender-affirming care for children in teens in the U.S., closed in July.
At least seven other major hospitals and health systems have made similar announcements, including Children’s National in Washington D.C., UChicago Medicine and Yale New Haven Health.
Kaiser Permanente, which operates in California and several other states, said it would pause gender-affirming surgeries for those under 19 as of the end of August but would continue hormone therapy.
Connecticut Children’s Medical Center cited “an increasingly complex and evolving landscape” for winding down care.
Other hospitals, including Penn State, had already made similar decisions since Trump returned to office in January.
Alex Sheldon, executive director of GLMA, an organization that advocates for health care equity for LGBTQ+ people, said the health systems have pulled back the services for legal reasons, not medical ones.
“Not once has a hospital said they are ending care because it is not medically sound,” Sheldon said.
Trump’s administration has targeted the care in multiple ways
Trump devoted a lot of attention to transgender people in his campaign last year as part of a growing pushback from conservatives as transgender people have gained visibility and acceptance on some fronts. Trump criticized gender-affirming care, transgender women in women’s sports, and transgender women’s use of women’s facilities such as restrooms.
On his inauguration day in January, Trump signed an executive order defining the sexes as only male and female for government purposes, setting the tone for a cascade of actions that affect transgender people. About a week later, Trump called to stop using federal money, including from Medicaid, for gender-affirming care for those under 19.
About half of U.S. adults approve of Trump’s handling of transgender issues, an AP-NORC poll found. But the American Medical Association says that gender is on a spectrum, and the group opposes policies that restrict access to gender-affirming health care.
Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person’s gender identity, including when it’s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It includes counseling and treatment with medications that block puberty, and hormone therapy to produce physical changes, as well as surgery, which is rare for minors.
In March, a judge paused enforcement of the ban on government spending for care.
The court ruling didn’t stop other federal government action
In April, Attorney General Pam Bondi directed government investigators to focus on providers who continue to offer gender-affirming care for transgender youth. “Under my leadership, the Department of Justice will bring these practices to an end,” she wrote.
In May, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a report discouraging medical interventions for transgender youth and instead focusing solely on talk therapy. The report questions adolescents’ capacity to consent to life-changing treatments that could result in future infertility. The administration has not said who wrote the report, which has been deeply criticized by LGBTQ+ advocates.
In June, a Justice Department memo called for prioritizing civil investigations of those who provide the treatment.
In July, Justice Department announced it had sent more than 20 subpoenas to doctors and clinics involved in gender-affirming care for youth, saying they were part of investigations of health care fraud, false statements and other possible wrongdoing.
And in a statement last week, the White House celebrated decisions to end gender-affirming care, which it called a “barbaric, pseudoscientific practice”
Families worry about accessing care
Kristen Salvatore’s 15-year-old child started hormone therapy late last year at Penn State Health. Salvatore said in an interview with The Associated Press before the lawsuit was announced that it was a major factor in reduced signs of anxiety and depression. Last month, the family received official notice from the health system that it would no longer offer the hormones for patients under 19 after July 31, though talk therapy can continue.
Salvatore has been struggling to find a place that’s not hours away from their Mechanicsburg, Pa., home that would provide the hormones and accept Medicaid coverage.
“I’m walking around blind with no guidance, and whatever breadcrumbs I was given are to a dead-end alleyway,” she said.
The family has enough testosterone stockpiled to last until January. But if they can’t find a new provider by then, Salvatore’s child could risk detransitioning, she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/yale-new-haven-hospital-3-e1608677205753.jpg,,,2025-08-01 14:56:52.139248

Mike Braun, flanked by Indiana State Police personnel, holds a news conference in his Statehouse office on Wednesday, July 16, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A trio of Indiana agencies have signed up for federal immigration enforcement powers, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun announced Friday.
“Indiana is not a safe haven for illegal immigration,” Braun said in a news release. “Indiana will fully partner with federal immigration authorities as they enforce the most fundamental laws of our country.”
If U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement approves the agreements, the Indiana State Police, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Correction would join four local Hoosier agencies — and nearly 900 others from across the nation — that have inked similar deals.
The formal partnerships are authorized in Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act and let ICE delegate certain immigration enforcement powers to state or local officers.
There are three active program models: task force, warrant service officer and jail enforcement.
The Indiana State Police has submitted a memorandum of agreement for the task force model, according to an ICE list of pending deals that was updated Friday morning. So did the Department of Homeland Security.
Indiana immigration arrests surge despite stalled ICE partnerships

The Department of Correction asked for a warrant service officer deal. The agency is “working with ICE to make available up to 1,000 beds at Miami Correctional Facility,” the news release said.
The announcement follows an executive order Braun issued in January directing Hoosier law enforcement agencies to “fully cooperate with ICE, and, to the maximum extent permitted, enter into (287(g)) agreements.”
If ICE approves the deals, the agencies will be moved to a separate list of enacted deals. But that doesn’t mean they’re active.
The agencies will nominate specific personnel to take on federal powers. However, the officer nominees must undergo ICE training and pass examinations to be deputized.
Nominees from at least two of the four local Indiana agencies that have finalized 287(g) agreements with ICE still have not been trained — and therefore, haven’t been tapped in the national deportation effort, the Capital Chronicle found.
Braun is “also anticipating further partnership” between the Indiana National Guard and federal immigration authorities, it continued. That will not be a 287(g) agreement, according to the Braun administration.
Camp Atterbury — a federally owned military installation that is licensed to and operated by the guard — will be used to hold immigrant detainees.
It will be “available for temporary use by the (U.S.) Department of Homeland Security to house illegal aliens subject to deportation, with safety in mind for staff, detainees, and surrounding communities,” the news release said.
The plan was revealed last month in a letter from U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to congressional members.

(Photo by Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico’s nuclear victims waited 80 years for recognition and the right for compensation under the federal Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act.
It took less than a month for scams to develop targeting those victims.
RECA — created in 1990 to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders.
But President Donald Trump signed a two-year expansion and extension into law earlier this month as part of Republicans so-called “Big Beautiful Bill.”
‘The beginning of justice’

On Tuesday, both the New Mexico Department of Justice and the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium issued a warning that RECA scams have already developed. According to an NMDOJ news release, “organizations and attorneys are soliciting people to file claims with them for a fee, despite the fact that New Mexico will have a legitimate claim submission process and guidance forthcoming.”
The U.S. Department of Justice has not yet announced an official claims process for qualifying New Mexicans. Both U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week recently sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging them to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short two-year timeline for compensation.
“We are grateful to our Congressional Delegation who tirelessly advocated for the expansion of these critical compensation efforts,” New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez said in a statement. “New Mexicans who have been affected by these exposures deserve compensation — and they deserve to get that compensation free from bad actors attempting to take advantage of them. We encourage New Mexicans to file claims through legitimate entities to ensure they receive the maximum compensation they are entitled to through RECA, and also to file any reports of suspected fraudulent activity with our office.”
The news release notes that any entity that files a RECA claim on behalf of residents will charge a fee, which is capped at 2% by law, but can increase to 10% if that claim is rejected. Moreover, the state will have official RECA clinics to assist people.
The Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium said it will have official updates online.
“The people of New Mexico have waited 80 years for acknowledgement of the harm they suffered as a result of being overexposed to radiation from the Trinity bomb,” TBDC co-founder Tina Cordova said in a statement. “We hope everyone will be patient a little longer as details of the claim process are developed. Please don’t allow someone to take part of your claim out of fear or some sense of urgency. We will do all we can to assist with the claims process once the guidelines are released.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 17:22:43+00:00,CT Mirror,CT agrees to borrow $155 million to offset cost of electric bills,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-public-benefits-charge-electric-billslls/,The CT Bond Commission voted to borrow $155M to help offset the cost of electric bills by paying off a portion of the public benefits charge.,"The State Bond Commission on Friday agreed to borrow $155 million to help offset the cost of residents’ electric bills, at least partially delivering on a promise of savings made by lawmakers during the most recent legislative session.
The bonds were issued to pay off a portion of the public benefits charge, which is used to fund state-mandated programs that have become subject to intense scrutiny in the larger debate over Connecticut’s high cost of electricity. 
By borrowing money to pay for some of those programs, officials estimated customers could see an average of between $5 and $10 savings on their monthly electric bills starting in September, depending on usage and which utility customers get their electricity from.
The commission, which is led by Gov. Ned Lamont, voted unanimously to approve the borrowing at its Friday meeting. 
“I know how upset everybody is with electric rates,” Lamont told reporters afterward. “We didn’t make a big difference, but we made a difference… at least by reduced rates. I can’t promise you what your bill is going to do, it depends what you do with the air conditioner.”
The authorization to borrow money to provide direct relief to ratepayers came from Senate Bill 4, the omnibus energy savings legislation that lawmakers spent months crafting earlier this year. Lamont signed the bill after it passed both chambers with bipartisan support in early June.
The initial estimates from proponents of that bill were that it would save customers in Connecticut between $325 million and $350 million annually off of their electric bills — or about $100 a year for the typical customer.
The bulk of that savings, at least initially, is expected to come from the state bonds. 
The initial tranche of borrowing approved by the Bond Commission on Friday included $125 million to pay off unpaid bills that accumulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with $30 million to cover the costs associated with the state’s electric vehicle charging program. Both costs were previously included as part of the public benefits charge.
An additional round of borrowing is expected next year, according to Lamont’s office. If approved, the associated savings will last through early 2027.
During the negotiations over S.B. 4, Republicans pushed for an even bigger package of savings by removing the public benefits charge altogether from customers’ bills, and instead paying for those programs through the state budget.
While that could have resulted in savings of up to 20% off customers’ bill, the cost — estimated at around $1 billion annually — proved to be unpalatable for Democrats, including Gov. Lamont, who argued they would have had to cut spending in other areas.
 Still, some Republicans on Friday bemoaned the level of savings even as they joined with Democrats to approve the bonds. 
“It doesn’t go far enough,” said Rep. Joe Polletta, R-Watertown, who is a member of the Bond Commission. “It’s a good first start, I think I credit both sides of the aisle for negotiating the bill, but Republicans have been calling for reducing that public benefits charge even further and getting a lot of those items into the general fund, where we can debate them, have a public hearing and we can vote on them.”
The savings attached to the bonds come on top of earlier rate relief that most customers already experienced in July as a result of a drop in standard supply rates at both of the state’s largest utilities, Eversource and United Illuminating. In May, the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority also approved rate adjustments lowering the public benefits charge portion of customers’ bills. 
“There’s stuff that’s happening organically anyways, and then there’s stuff happening as a result of our bill getting passed,” said Sen. Norm Needleman, D-Essex, who was one of the principal authors of S.B. 4.
“Hopefully, this piece hits in September and brings the bill down more,” he added.  
In addition to public borrowing, S.B. 4 also authorized utilities to securitize their storm costs and the rollout of advanced metering technology. Those bonds, which were not a part of the Bond Commission’s agenda on Friday, will be paid back by utility customers through the public benefits charge, but over a longer period of time and at lower interest rates than under the current law.
In its other business Friday, the bond commission approved:

Nearly $1.6 billion in transportation bonding to finance a wide array of upgrades to Connecticut’s aging network of highways, bridges and rail lines. Two of the largest initiatives involve $157.5 million to replace the Norwalk River Rail Bridge, a four-track span that serves the Metro-North commuter line and Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor lines, and $50 million for continued rehabilitation of the Gold Star Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 95 across the Thames River between New London and Groton.
$40 million to cover the first half of the $80 million Town Aid Road grant due to Connecticut municipalities this fiscal year. Communities use those funds to cover repaving, drainage work and other routine road maintenance and to purchase sand, salt and other materials to support winter snow removal. The state is expected to deliver the remaining $40 million due cities and towns after Jan. 1.

July 31, 2025 | Photo courtesy of Michigan Families for Fair CareMichigan residents living in the 7th and 10th Congressional Districts had choice words for Republican U.S. Reps. Tom Barrett and John James during two townhalls held this week focused on the impact of federal Medicaid cuts – but neither of the congressmen were there to hear them.
Michigan Families for Fair Care, a left-of-center nonprofit dedicated to highlighting the voting records of the representatives, hosted the rallies in Lansing and Warren on Wednesday and Thursday evening. Each event targeted Barrett’s and James’ districts with attendance from Democratic Party activists, community members and those running for office against them on the Democratic sides of the races.
The future of health care and food assistance following federal cuts in the Republican “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” were among the primary concerns at both town halls. The cuts are expected to impact hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, including $6 billion to hospitals in Michigan’s Medicaid program and the 1.5 million people who are likely to be affected by cuts to Michigan’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
More than 2.6 million Michiganders rely on Medicaid access for affordable health care.
In Warren on Thursday, the panel included Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, state Rep. Mai Xiong of Warren and state Rep. Donavan McKinney of Detroit. Gilchrist is seeking the Michigan Democratic Party nomination for governor in 2026, while McKinney is seeking to primary U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar of Detroit, a Democrat who currently represents the 13th Congressional District. Macomb County Commissioner Michael Howard, also a Democrat, was on the panel as well.
Gilchrist that it was up to community members to stand up when their elected officials don’t show up for them. To that end, he said that James was absent from the community he served, and was more interested in running “to Washington to vote for this bill that guts Medicaid.”
“Do you know that 182,000 in this district are living with Medicaid? That there are 41,000 veterans in the state of Michigan who are getting services from Medicaid?” Gilchrist asked the crowd, and by proxy an absent James. “These are the people he voted to strip and rip health care from. These are the people who he has voted to kill faster than they otherwise would have passed away. His absent leadership is dangerous.”
McKinney said that the community he serves and is seeking to serve in Congress has a medium income of $13,000 a year. With multiple children, McKinney said he also struggles balancing child care and other vital expenses to keep his family healthy and secure, and that was on a state representative’s salary. He said that someone earning less than $14,000 a year, which equates to about just $1,000 a month in take home pay, would face even greater hardships now that programs like Medicaid and SNAP are being slashed at the federal level.
“They do not need elected officials to cut one single resource, but that’s what this man, so-called Congressman John James, just did,” McKinney said, before adding that the congressmen on either side of 8 Mile Road at the border of Wayne and Macomb counties were absent from their districts, referring to James and Thanedar.
For Xiong, everything happening at the federal level is now touching all of her constituents’ lives.
“No matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat or independent,” Xiong said. “What’s happening at the federal level is hurting so many families. It’s devastating. We’re in unprecedented times. In all my 40 years that I’ve been alive, I don’t think that we’ve ever faced as many obstacles as we have this year.”
The trio took questions throughout the night on the state of Medicaid and SNAP in the fallout of the bill, and on the ways Democrats could strategize in order to talk about the cuts with their friends and neighbors, including Republicans who might be feeling buyers remorse.
One question focused on James’ joining the Republican stated goal of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse and using that as a guise to finally cut areas of the federal budget that GOP hawks have salivated over ripping apart for decades.
Gilchrist said what they’re actually going after is people’s ability to live and thrive.
“When they say they want to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, and then the action they take is getting rid of services and health care and food assistance, it means they think that the people are the waste,” Gilchrist said. “So maybe they weren’t lying when they said they want to get rid of waste, because instead, they are harming and killing, in this case, the people in the state of Michigan. … It’s inhumane. It’s cruel.”
He noted that was the major difference between Republicans and Democrats in the modern age. Gilchrist also touched on the billion-dollar Michigan budget hole that will be created in the fallout from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s cuts and provisions.
“That’s something John James did to us on purpose,” Gilchrist said. “It wasn’t an accident. It was intentional. What we have to do [now] is triage. How do we take care of the pregnant women who are more likely to die because their health care just got cut? … We need to be a little more creative.”
With those new holes in the budget and the current stalemate over the process going nowhere between the Republican-controlled Michigan House and the Democratic-led state Senate, McKinney said it could be possible that Michigan’s government shuts down on Oct. 1. He also said he believes that’s what the Republicans in the House want.
“We’re fighting like hell to figure it out, but these Republicans are playing hardball,” McKinney said. “They really don’t care. Whatever Trump is doing, they’re just following the federal protocol in D.C.”
Byrum leads panel in Lansing
The Lansing event featured Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for secretary of state, state Rep. Kara Hope of Holt and Ingham County Commissioner Ryan Sebolt.
Like the panel in Macomb County on Thursday, Byrum on Wednesday said that it was up to constituents to fight for their needs and resources when their elected leaders don’t show up for them, noting that Barrett has avoided town halls just like the ones held this week.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte). Not pictured: Tom Barrett. July 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan Advance
She also counseled those in attendance to reach out to their friends and neighbors to explain how these cuts will affect their lives, but cautioned to do it with empathy, deep listening and to avoid saying, “I told you so.”
“Be reflective,” Byrum said. “I think if we have those conversations, I think that will also help. It’s imperative, and it’s so fitting that we’re sitting in the AFL-CIO building, that we remember that we are stronger together. We need to lean on each other.”
Although no candidate who might face Barrett was on the panel, several of his Democratic challengers were in the audience, including Michigan State University professor Josh Cowen, former NAVY Seal Matt Maasdam and Elyon Badger.

New Hampshire has become the first state to require doctors and medical staff to sterilize patients who request it.
The measure focuses on adults who have medical conditions for which sterilization may be a treatment option. New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed the bipartisan bill into law on July 15.
The law says physicians can’t deny sterilization based on a patient’s age, number of children, marital status, or if the physician has views on fertility that run contrary to the patient’s wishes.

It’s the first law of its kind. And it comes at a time when state legislators across the country have enacted laws restricting women’s reproductive choices.
“A doctor should not withhold your needed treatment because the doctor doesn’t like the idea that you decided not to have kids or don’t want any more kids,” New Hampshire Democratic state Rep. Ellen Read, who sponsored the bill, said earlier this month during a panel at the National Foundation for Women Legislators.
Her cosponsors included two Democrats and two Republicans.

Read said her own medical experience led her to sponsor the bill. She was diagnosed at 26 with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition that can cause painful periods, infertility, ovarian cysts and an increased risk of other diseases, such as diabetes. As Read’s health worsened over the years, she said, her doctors continued pushing her to wait to get a hysterectomy, in case she wanted a child in the future, even though she and her husband — who had already gotten a vasectomy — had decided they didn’t want children.
Sterilization, or permanent contraception, is the most common method of contraception among U.S. women of reproductive age, and it’s one of the most straightforward surgical procedures an OB-GYN can perform, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
In women this is a tubal ligation, where the fallopian tubes are closed off or removed; in men it is a vasectomy, where a portion of the tube that carries sperm is removed. A hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus, also renders a woman sterile.
But in the United States, sterilization has a fraught history. Vulnerable groups have been sterilized without their knowledge or consent, including people with disabilities, Indigenous women and Black women. In the past, many have been sterilized as the result of state laws.
Meanwhile, others who desire sterilization have been unable to access it. One survey of 1,800 obstetrician-gynecologists found that while most OB-GYNs said they would help a patient obtain a tubal ligation, up to 70% would try to dissuade her, depending on characteristics such as how many children she had or whether her husband agreed.
Surgical sterilization rates among women have increased since the 2022 Supreme Court ruling overturned the constitutional right to abortion, according to a study published last September by researchers at Columbia University.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-01 16:43:05+00:00,CT Mirror,CT funds body scanners to replace strip searches in some prisons,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/01/ct-strip-search-body-scanners-prisons/,The State Bond Commission approved funding for body scanners as part of a pilot program that aims to end strip searches in CT prisons.,"As a young man incarcerated in the Department of Correction, Shakur Collins refused visits from his mother for about a year and a half, just to avoid having to be strip-searched.
“ What that does is just feed into the notion of disrupting filial and familiar relationships. And that’s intentional,” he told The Connecticut Mirror. 
Collins likened strip-searching, which he first experienced at age 13, to sexual assault, and said it was traumatizing. Collins, who is now 40, said the aftereffects are something he still deals with through therapy, even after having been released from DOC custody seven months ago. 
On Friday, the State Bond Commission approved funding for four body scanners as part of a pilot program with the aim of ending strip searches in the state’s prison facilities. 
State lawmakers have been discussing the purchase of body scanners for correctional facilities since at least 2023, when they asked Department of Correction Commissioner Angel Quiros to study the cost of implementing the scanners at each of the prisons.
Quiros told lawmakers in a March meeting that the cost of installing 26 body scanners for visiting rooms and intake units would cost about $4 million. An additional 15 for the lobby areas, plus 12 more for the Restrictive Housing Units, or solitary confinement, brings the cost up to $8.1 million. 
Earlier this session, lawmakers brought forward a bill that would have put aside $500,000 to purchase at least two body scanners for York Correctional Institution, which houses the state’s women, and Manson Youth Institution. The bill passed out of the Government Oversight Committee and the Finance Committee with bipartisan support, but never made it to a vote on the floor. 
The funding approved by the bond commission Friday will be used for scanners at the two facilities as part of a larger capital funds package instead. 
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, told CT Mirror that he believed the body scanners provided a more humane alternative to strip searches, which he called “dehumanizing” and “degrading,” particularly for women. He said the idea that the Department of Correction was doing hundreds of thousands of strip searches in a year “seems excessive.” 
“When you have the ability to do something different, which we do, we should avail ourselves of that,” he said. 
Advocates have been decrying the use of strip searches for years. In February, advocates reiterated their call at a press conference memorializing the 2018 death of J’Allen Jones, who died after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as nine correction workers. Jones had refused to submit to a strip search. 
Data showed that the department conducted about 355,000 strip searches on incarcerated people in 2024.
In meetings with the legislature’s budget committee in February and March, Quiros said he believed the body scanners were “100% better” than strip searches at identifying contraband. He said he supported the use of body scanners for department staff as well as the incarcerated population.
But Rudy Demiraj, a corrections officer and representative for the Cheshire Correctional Complex Employees AFSCME Local 387, the local union, said he wasn’t sure that body scanners would be as efficient in picking up contraband coming into the prison as strip searches. 
“ The officers are highly trained on how to conduct these strip searches, what it is they’re actually targeting and looking for,” said Demiraj. “And I don’t know of any technology with scanners that could detect or pick up every type of contraband that could potentially be picked up through a strip search.”
Demiraj said he understood that while some inmates might feel the strip searches were degrading, they were necessary for the security of the facility. 
And Demiraj said that the corrections officers union did not support having staff go through the body scanners. He said the majority of contraband came into the facility during social visits or through the mail, and not from corrections officers. 
Barbara Fair, the executive director of Stop Solitary, told CT Mirror that she doesn’t have a lot of faith that the body scanners will be installed. She also said having the body scanners would not be a big victory unless there was a requirement that staff, and not just incarcerated individuals or visitors, also had to pass through the scanners to enter the facilities. 
“I’m just really discouraged,” she said. 
Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, a top Republican on the state’s Judiciary Committee, called the promise for four scanners “a start, but a weak one.” He told CT Mirror in an email that if the state was really committed to the safety of the incarcerated and the corrections officers, it would invest in scanners in prisons other than the women’s prison and the juvenile prison. 
“We do see possession of contraband in our prisons, whether it be weapons or drugs, and they are getting in there somehow. One way to address this is through the use of these machines — an initiative that is supported by both the incarcerated as well as those in charge of them,” he said. 
Winfield said he knew the state wasn’t going to be able to purchase all the body cameras at once. He said that once the scanners were placed in the prisons, and the benefits became obvious, he didn’t see how the state wouldn’t continue installing scanners in other facilities.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/York-CI-sign02.jpg,,,2025-08-01 12:56:38.344718

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)AGENCY VILLAGE — If a Sisseton police officer gets punched on state land in Sisseton, Roberts County State’s Attorney Dylan Kirchmeier can charge the assailant with a felony for assaulting a police officer.
If that assailant also punches a tribal police officer who’s there to assist, Kirchmeier doesn’t have that option.
South Dakota law doesn’t include tribal police in its definition of a law enforcement officer, Kirchmeier told members of the State-Tribal Relations Committee on Thursday. But in Roberts County, tribal police work alongside sheriff’s deputies and city officers on a regular basis, sometimes as backup, sometimes as first responders when they’re closer to the scene when a call comes in. 
“I feel like that is doing a disservice to the tribal officers, because they’re doing the same job that any state law enforcement officer is,” Kirchmeier said. “It’s a bad loophole.”

Roberts County includes parts of the Lake Traverse Reservation, where the Sisseton-Wahpeton Police Department and tribal courts have jurisdiction. But the checkerboard nature of tribal land – one side of the road can be tribal, the other state – means that policing agencies wind up interwoven, for the safety of their officers and residents alike.
It’s not uncommon for suspects to cross tribal and state lines in the course of committing a crime, Kirchmeier said, particularly in vehicle pursuits.
Gary Gaikowski, the tribal police captain for the past 20 years and a longtime member of South Dakota’s Law Enforcement Standards and Training Commission, said the working relationships benefit both sides and public safety. 
“Everything that affects the state, Roberts County, the city of Sisseton, affects us,” Gaikowski told the committee. “And most of the time, it’s the same individuals that we’re arresting.”
That should move the Legislature to change the law to recognize tribal officers as law enforcement. 
“It does kind of, excuse my language, suck, to not be recognized as law enforcement officers,” he said.
Both men urged the committee to explore changes to the law to protect tribal police who aid their stateside counterparts.
Mutual aid agreements: Thorny territory
Gaikowski said he understands the thorny nature of cooperation between tribes and outside law enforcement. Attempts to push for more formal mutual aid agreements have met political resistance at the tribal council level, he told the committee.
Algin Young, South Dakota’s secretary of tribal affairs, told the committee he faced some of the same resistance during his stint as chief of the Oglala Sioux Tribal Police Department in Pine Ridge. 
Tribal governments don’t want state officials arresting their citizens, Young said, but might nonetheless see value in outside help. Working with the tribe and Pennington County eventually led to a setup in 2022 that opened the door to mutual aid between the county and the tribe, Young said, without giving the county the power to enforce state law on tribal land.
That should be the model for a state agency like the Highway Patrol, Young said.

“We have to be sensitive to what the tribes want,” he said. “We’ll go when they want, and we’ll leave when they ask us to.”
Bob Perry, secretary of the Department of Public Safety, told the lawmakers on the State-Tribal Relations Committee that the state is working with tribes to convince them to allow more agreements like that. He recently traveled to the Yankton Sioux Tribe to meet with leadership on the possibility of agreements with the Highway Patrol. 
The state’s closest formal partnership is with the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, which uses state troopers for law enforcement only during its annual powwow, but Perry said there are other signs of progress on public safety cooperation.
There’s currently a Highway Patrol saturation operation taking place on the Standing Rock Reservation. Highway Patrol captains meet quarterly with officials on that reservation, and on the Cheyenne River Reservation.
“All law enforcement understands this is a good, good thing,” Perry said of mutual aid. “But there’s still some mistrust in the tribal communities that we have to overcome.”
Possible model: Missing people and violent crime
Perry pointed out that the Highway Patrol does accident reconstruction in fatal crashes on tribal land, and it doesn’t hesitate to put helicopters in the air if a child goes missing on tribal lands and tribal officials reach out for help.
Mark Van Norman, a special counsel for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, told the committee that the prevalence of missing and murdered Indigenous people and the widespread hunger to address the issue among tribal governments could serve as a  building block for trust. 
President Donald Trump signed an executive order to address the MMIP issue, Van Norman pointed out, so there’s a willingness at the federal level to improve cooperation. 
“We’ve been thinking that when we have missing people, that we would like to get an immediate response so that we can try and rescue the people within 72 hours,” Van Norman said.

Agreements for mutual aid in missing people cases could naturally extend, Van Norman said, to cooperation on cases involving violent crime. 
Concerns about jurisdictional challenges aren’t especially pronounced for Gaikowski, Kirchmeier and Roberts County Sheriff Tyler Appel, the sheriff said. Appel’s jail holds adult and juvenile inmates for the tribe, he said, and major cases like homicides are all-hands-on-deck situations.
“Perceptions from community members tend to be more of a challenge than us working together,” Appel said. “Captain Gaikowski’s department and I work very well together. Gary and I share phone calls and text messages on a pretty frequent basis.”
Pierre Republican Rep. Will Mortenson, the committee’s chair, said he was encouraged to hear that, and said he hopes the state can make more progress in allowing police to help each other across tribal lines.
“It seems like what we need is for the politicians to have the trust in law enforcement that law enforcement has in each other,” said Mortenson, a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe. “The more I think about this issue, the more I think we’ve got a politician problem, not a law enforcement problem.”
After the meeting, Mortenson said his comments were a reference to politicians “on any side” who might monkeywrench mutual aid. 
The committee’s next meeting will take place in mid-September, he said, and will be hosted jointly by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.

(Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana political candidates and campaigns can post signs at public school athletic fields and gymnasiums starting Friday after being prohibited from doing so.

Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers carved out the school athletic facility exception from a more sweeping ban on political signs on government property in state law. 

Act 89, sponsored by Sen. Eddie Lambert, R-Gonzales, will allow the signage so long as it complies with local school board policies. 
If the school is used as a voting site, rules against political advertising during an election will still apply. Any area within 600 feet of a voting booth area becomes a campaign-free zone.

“In that case, a sign would have to be taken down during a political election,” Lambert said. 
Lambert offered the proposal in response to a letter Attorney General Liz Murrill’s office sent to high schools in his district last year telling them to take down political signs on display. It cost the school’s athletic programs a lot of money in refunds when the signs came down, he said. 

The president of the St. Amant High School athletic boosters, James LeBlanc, said his school lost $20,000. Before the letter from the attorney general, the athletic boosters had been selling advertising space to politicians for 25 years, he said during a hearing on the bill earlier this year.

Lambert said he spends between $3,000 and $5,000 on high school signs every year from his campaign account. 
“It came as a shock to me and the school systems in Ascension Parish” when the political signs were taken down, Lambert said. 

The proposal overwhelmingly passed the Legislature with a 38-0 vote in the Senate and 92-1 in the House of Representatives. State Rep. Beryl Amedee, R-Gray, was the only lawmaker to vote against the bill.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200623_085452-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-01 12:56:38.344718

WILMINGTON— The Wilmington Fire Department graduated its largest-ever recruit class on Friday, with 36 new Firefighter/EMTs officially joining the ranks during a ceremony at the Chase Bank Conference Center.
The graduates of the department’s 44th Recruit Academy were celebrated by family, friends, city officials, and fire department leadership for completing 14 weeks of intensive training. Their addition brings the department’s authorized strength to 186, supporting Wilmington’s recently expanded emergency services that now include primary 911 ambulance response.
“I’m proud to welcome this outstanding class of Wilmington Firefighters to public service,” said Mayor John Carney. 
“This is the largest group ever hired by the Wilmington Fire Department, and their commitment reflects the strength and spirit of our city. These men and women have trained with focus and discipline, and they’re ready to serve with courage, compassion, and professionalism. Our residents will be safer because of the work they’ve put in, and because of the work they will do every day moving forward.”
The 14-week academy began May 2, 2025, and included a six-week National Emergency Medical Technician course and eight weeks of National Firefighter I & II curriculum, combining classroom instruction with hands-on training.
“We are honored to welcome this historic class into the Wilmington Fire Department,” said Fire Chief John Looney. 
“Their dedication and commitment have been evident from day one. These men and women have successfully completed an extremely rigorous training program and are now prepared to protect life and property throughout our city. We look forward to the leadership and service they will bring to every emergency they respond to.”

(Eakin Howard/Getty Images)Nonprofit hospital systems across the country are spending millions to plaster their names on sports stadiums and arenas, even as federal Medicaid cuts and economic uncertainty cloud their financial futures.
Health care systems and hospital groups have bought naming rights at ballparks and arenas in states such as California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee.
The health sector’s interest in inking deals with sports teams has only grown in recent years, said Angeline Close Scheinbaum, a professor of sports marketing at Clemson University.
Scheinbaum and a colleague, Xavier University marketing professor Russell Lacey, are studying sponsorship investments in stadiums.
“One of the prominent themes we’ve been seeing in our research is a creep into the health care space,” Scheinbaum said.
But naming rights deals involving nonprofit hospitals in particular have raised eyebrows among local officials and the public.
Unlike their for-profit counterparts, nonprofit hospital systems don’t have to pay most taxes. In return, they are required to give back to the community by offering free or discounted care and by focusing their resources on underserved areas. Typically, they allocate fewer dollars to advertising and marketing.
Some local officials in states such as Tennessee and California have criticized nonprofit systems’ stadium sponsorships as a poor use of funds, arguing the money would be better spent improving or expanding access to care. Hospitals counter that they must stay competitive in the marketplace, and that sponsorships help them integrate more deeply into their communities.
But some officials remain unconvinced.

In May, the Chattanooga, Tennessee-based Erlanger hospital group announced it had inked a deal with the Chattanooga Lookouts, a minor league baseball team, to name their new stadium Erlanger Park. The Lookouts are the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds.
That move frustrated Weston Wamp, the Republican mayor of Hamilton County, where Chattanooga is the county seat.
“When the County supported Erlanger’s transition to a nonprofit hospital, we didn’t envision multimillion dollar deals for stadium naming rights,” Wamp said in a May statement. Reached by Stateline, he declined further comment and cited his previous statement.
“I am very supportive of Erlanger Hospital and its current leadership, but at a time of severe nursing shortages and quality of care concerns, this decision is hard to explain,” he said.
While Erlanger and the Lookouts didn’t disclose the amount of the sponsorship, Wamp said the safety net hospital would be “footing the bill for the Lookouts’ $1 million annual lease payment.”
Erlanger’s president and CEO, Jim Coleman, told Stateline in a statement that the hospital is not experiencing nursing shortages.
“We are proud of our decision to become the naming rights partner of the Lookouts’ incredible new stadium because it allows our system an unparalleled opportunity to reach our community in new and exciting ways in a competitive marketplace,” he said.
“This partnership makes sense, and we look forward to welcoming our entire region to enjoy Erlanger Park next year.”
Branding a stadium or arena can improve a hospital system’s name recognition and signal its commitment to a town, Scheinbaum said. She compared it with a local physician’s office sponsoring a Little League team’s jerseys.
“It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community,” she told Stateline. “It becomes a permanent fixture in these cities, and part of the local lingo. In that sense, it can be very powerful.”
But as with Erlanger, not all local officials are eager to see their safety net hospitals spending millions on that kind of sponsorship, particularly when the hospitals rely heavily on state or local funding and ask for public donations.










It’s an economic signal of strength but it’s also a way to solidify your roots in a local community.


– Angeline Close Scheinbaum, Clemson University sports marketing professor


After the nonprofit Valley Children’s Healthcare in California finalized a 10-year, $10 million contract with Fresno State for naming rights to its football stadium in 2022, the deal generated a backlash on social media. Some residents said the hospital was wasting funds, particularly after holding public fundraisers to solicit donations.
Hospital leaders defended the move, saying the money comes from its marketing budget, which is funded through hospital revenue, not donations. The hospital said the naming rights deal could improve its name recognition and ability to recruit workers.
“Valley Children’s relationship with Fresno State is a partnership, not a naming rights deal,” Zara Arboleda, Valley Children’s Healthcare spokesperson, told Stateline in a statement.
“While this partnership includes our right to name the stadium, it is primarily focused on improving health care for kids, creating educational opportunities for Valley Children’s staff and Fresno State students and building job training and education — including paid internships — for students.”
But the partnership also came with perks for the CEO and hospital officials, including a skybox suite with catering up to $1,500 for each home game, roundtrip airfare for four on the team charter plane for road games, and hundreds of tickets to home games, according to media reports.
The outcry prompted Fresno City councilmembers to ask California Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta to investigate the hospital’s use of state funding.

In 2023, Ohio-based nonprofit health system, Bon Secours Mercy Health, paid more than $4 million to renew naming rights at a sports arena in Greenville, South Carolina. But the system has come under congressional scrutiny and earned media attention for pulling large reimbursements from a federal program meant to help subsidize care for poor patients. Critics panned the system for the money it spent on stadium naming rights and executive salaries.
In Indiana, the nonprofit Parkview Health has paid for naming rights to the local minor league baseball stadium for years, but has also attracted media attention for its hospitals being some of the most expensive in the country. Its naming rights have garnered criticism from state leaders. The stadium is home to the Fort Wayne TinCaps, the High-A affiliate of the San Diego Padres.
And in Louisiana, the Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center is in talks to pay $50 million over a decade for the naming rights to a proposed new arena at Louisiana State University. The nonprofit Catholic hospital, one of the largest health care systems in the region, hasn’t yet finalized details of the deal with the state’s flagship university.
Stadium naming rights can be a good use of a health system’s marketing budget when done judiciously, Scheinbaum said.
“Sponsorship is more than just slapping your name on something,” Scheinbaum said. “It should be part of a holistic package where you’re giving back to the community.”
For example, it can allow a hospital’s providers to offer more on-site educational events during games. In recent months, Erlanger has hosted events during Lookouts games focused on women’s health and on preventing strokes.
And sports sponsorship more broadly isn’t a new phenomenon in health care. Hospitals and medical groups have long partnered with sports teams at all levels as the “official” health care providers for team athletes.
“There’s a natural organic fit between health and sports,” she said. “People love sports. It’s a cultural talking point.”

The pipeline, called the “Mississippi Crossing Project,” would start in Greenville, cross through Humphreys, Holmes, Attala, Leake, Neshoba, Newton, Lauderdale and Clarke counties and end near Butler, Alabama, stretching a total of nearly 208 miles.
Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, sent an application for the project to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on June 30. The company hopes the pipeline, which would transfer up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, will address a rising energy demand by increasing its transportation capacity.

Kinder Morgan says on its website that, should it receive approval, construction would begin at the end of 2027 and the pipeline would begin service in November, 2028. The company says the project would cost $1.7 billion and create 750 temporary jobs as well as 15 permanent positions.
As shown in the map above, the project would also include new compressor stations in Humphreys, Attala and Lauderdale counties, although exact locations haven’t been set.
Singleton Schreiber, a national law firm that focuses on environmental justice, is looking to spread awareness of the public’s ability to participate in the approval process, whether or not they support the proposal.  
“We’re just trying to raise awareness to make sure that people know this is happening,” said Laura Singleton, an attorney with the firm. “They’re going to have to dig and construct new pipelines, so it’s going to pass through sensitive ecosystems like wetlands, private property, farmland, things like that. So you can have issues that come up like soil degradation, water contamination, and then after the pipeline is built you could potentially have leaks, spills.”
Singleton added while such issues with pipelines are rare, when “things go bad, they go pretty bad.” 
To comment, protest, or file a motion to intervene, the public can go to FERC’s website (new users have to create an account, and then use the docket number “CP25-514-000”). The exact deadline is 4 p.m. on Aug. 5. More instructions can also be found here.
In addition to FERC, the proposal will also face review from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and the state environmental agencies in Mississippi and Alabama. 
Mississippians have seen multiple incidents related to gas leaks in recent years. In March, three workers were injured after accidentally rupturing an Atmos Energy pipeline doing routine maintenance in Lee County, leaving thousands without service. Then last year, the National Transportation Safety Board found that Atmos discovered gas leaks over a month prior to two explosions in Jackson, one of which claimed the life of an 82-year-old woman.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/01090732/MSX-12-19-24.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Missouri utility regulators on Thursday approved Evergy’s request to build three natural gas plants and two solar farms, freeing the company to move forward with infrastructure projects that will cost more than $2.75 billion.
The four-member Missouri Public Service Commission board approved the facilities after hearing presentations about the facilities two weeks ago and despite worries about investing in solar energy.
“Personally, the solar case is concerning,” said MPSC chairwoman Kayla Hahn. “I recognize that we need more generation, and in particular, Evergy West needs more generation. However, intermittent resources such as solar as standalone projects seem to make little sense and may not be the best choice in terms of resource planning and the best use of ratepayer dollars.”
Hahn said her concerns were pertinent in light of federal changes to green energy tax credits, among other issues. The state faces conflicting issues with the need to build replacement and additional generation and the need to keep rates affordable, she said. 
“It’s increasingly important that a critical view is taken of any request for new generation,” Hahn said. “Because we are in a situation where the need for additional generation for Evergy West, who has been and continues to be short on its own generation, is so great, I’m not going to stand in the way of allowing more generation resources to be added.” 
Evergy announced last year its intent to build the gas plants — two in Kansas and one in Missouri — and the solar plants, one in each state. The company sought pre-approval for the projects through Kansas and Missouri regulators. 
They received approval from the Kansas Corporation Commission in early July. 
Evergy Missouri West, the Evergy subsidiary serving Missouri customers, and Evergy Kansas Central, which serves Kansas customers, will own 50% each of the two Kansas gas plants. The two 710-megawatt facilities, located in Sumner and Reno counties, are expected to cost $788.75 million and $800.52 million, respectively. 
Evergy Missouri West will own 100% of a 440-megawatt natural gas facility in Nodaway County, Missouri, with a price tag of $835 million. It will also own Foxtrot Solar Energy, a 107 megawatt solar farm in Jasper County, Missouri, estimated to cost $213.8 million.
Evergy Kansas Central will own 100% of a 75-megawatt solar farm, Sunflower Sky Solar Project, in Wilson County, Kansas, estimated to cost $128.8 million.  
Darrin Ives, Evergy vice president of regulatory affairs, told MPSC commissioners Thursday there had been “a lot of movement” about tax credits and tariffs at the federal level.
“At this stage, we still need some information from the Treasury,” he said. “But by and large, with the budget reconciliation bill, they’ve set up a path and a plan that, while it’s scaled back significantly the IRA (Inflation Reduction Act) subsidies around carbon-free generation, it has left a pathway for these projects.
Ives said there’s also a pathway to complete the project by the end of 2027 and still qualify for tax credits. Ives said the issues were part of settlement discussions, and Evergy will be required to give updates on any changes with tax credit availability, among other reporting requirements.
In a press release after the MPSC decision Thursday, the Sierra Club said it opposed Evergy’s proposal. The nonprofit intervened in the MPSC case. 
“No party, except Evergy, argued that the gas plant proposals are economically feasible, a critical factor in the MIssouri approval process,” the release said.  
““If Evergy’s application is approved as submitted, Missouri ratepayers will be on the hook for gas plants that are likely to be unprofitable, operate less than expected and incur high maintenance costs or even premature failure due to excessive generator starts and cycling,” testified Michael Goggin, a Sierra Club expert witness, before MPSC. 
Billy Davies, Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter organizer based in Kansas City, said in the press release that Evergy shareholders, rather than ratepayers, should shoulder the costs of generation expansion. 
“Sadly, the PSC is enabling utilities and multi-billion dollar tech companies to use average Missouri families as piggy banks to power new data centers,” Davies said. “The last hope for the commission to protect Missouri families from utility bill shock is to have a strong large user fee that ensures multi-billion dollar tech companies pay their fair share of these new power plants being built in the name of their data centers.”
Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig said the company was pleased the MPSC approved the plants. 
“Current construction schedules should allow the solar plants to benefit from federal tax credits, and those benefits will be passed to customers served by the plants,” she said. 
Tariff levels are changing frequently, so it is difficult to quantify their effect on the projects, she said. 
“If they stay in place over a long term, the cost of capital projects like new generation would increase,” Penzig said. “As we negotiate contracts with suppliers, we are always focused on keeping our costs low because that impacts our customers’ rates. Some aspects of the new generation projects are already under contract.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090642-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program has officially ended and is canceling all grants from 2020 to 2023 that have not already been distributed. For Connecticut, only 22% of all BRIC projects have been funded. The rest will remain unfunded.
While some projects did not receive funding for other reasons before the grant program was cancelled, many of the more recent projects from 2023 are affected by the cancellation.
One of the projects confirmed to have been affected by the grant cancellation is the a coastal flood defense project in Bridgeport. This project was a part of the Resilient Bridgeport infrastructure initiative.
The Flood Mitigation Assistance program also has been removed from the 2025 grant cycle, halting new grant applications. As of now, the federal government has not made any announcement regarding funding of current projects.
Connecticut had 35 ongoing projects from 2020 to 2023 that were in various stages of receiving BRIC and FMA funding. Of these, 23 were projects funded under BRIC to address hazards ranging from flooding and severe storm impact to infrastructure failures. As of July 29, only $25.9 million of $120 million that was selected for federal grants had been obligated to the 35 BRIC and FMA projects.
Many federal funds are allocated under FEMA’s hazard mitigation assistance projects where spending and projects tend to peak following a natural disaster. Some BRIC and FMA grants fall under this category. 
While the BRIC grant was cancelled because it was “a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,” according to a since-deleted press release from FEMA, many are concerned about what could happen without the federal funds.
“The FEMA funds, through BRIC and also through the hazard mitigation grant program, have been pretty critical at helping the towns do the legwork and the planning and design work and move these things forward,” said John Truscinski, the director for resilience planning at the Connecticut Institute for Resilience and Climate Adaptation. “And they do take a long time for a variety of reasons, and so cutting back on the commitment of funds after several years of work has gone into those projects, it has a big impact in setting things back for the state.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/of9eE-where-were-the-bric-grants-being-spent--1024x856.png,,,2025-08-01 11:56:51.725879

I write as a two-time graduate of Southeastern Louisiana University (Class of 2001 and 2005) to express my outrage and deep disappointment over the university’s treatment of Dr. Fereshteh Emami, as detailed in the Louisiana Illuminator.
Dr. Emami, who led a major research project on Lake Maurepas, was abruptly removed after exposing dangerous levels of toxic metals, including arsenic and lead. Her research identified serious environmental threats, yet instead of being supported by her institution, she was removed from the project, excluded from a documentary, and reassigned to teaching-only duties without explanation.
This is nothing short of shameful. Southeastern appears more concerned with protecting political and corporate interests than upholding scientific integrity or safeguarding public health. The university’s silence, complicity, or worse, its cooperation with those trying to bury this research, is a betrayal of its mission and of the public trust.
As an alumnus, I am ashamed of my university. The administration’s actions send a chilling message to all researchers: tell the truth, and you’ll be punished. That is not education. That is cowardice.
Southeastern must be held accountable — for Dr. Emami, for the truth, and for the people who deserve to know what’s in their water.

This such blatant corruption – and the fact that these Air Product corporate bullies and Southeastern evidently think we’re to stupid to see the connection of how their money connections to the university clearly strong-armed this decision – is an insult to educated people!
This blatant biased decision also clearly shows the intentions of this Air Products project is obviously not in the best interest of the environment, wildlife or people of Lake Maurepas or the surrounding waters! She needs to be reinstated as a researcher immediately.

The private membership association, called Return to the Land, owns 160 acres in northeast Arkansas, according to its website. Jews and non-whites are explicitly banned from membership.
The group’s leader recently said it is exploring the idea of expanding north and building a new enclave in the Springfield area.
“We have the God-given right to form communities according to whatever values we hold dear,” Eric Orwoll, co-founder of Return to the Land, said in a recent social media post, “and the government does not have the right to tell free American citizens what values they have to live according to in their own private lives.”
The idea of a segregated community coming to southwest Missouri was greeted with scorn by both Democratic and Republican legislative leaders from the area.
“Racism in any form is evil and reprehensible,” said House Majority Leader Alex Riley, a Springfield Republican. “Groups engaging in racist conduct are not welcome in Springfield.”
State Rep. Betsy Fogle, a Springfield Democrat, said history has been “very clear on what happens when you stay silent as groups discriminate based on race and discriminate based on whether or not someone is of the Jewish faith. I cannot believe that in 2025 we are retreading this ground.”
In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey said racial discrimination “has no place in Missouri.”
“Attorney General Bailey is committed to protecting the constitutional rights of all citizens,” the statement said. “The landmark Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer, which originated in St. Louis, made clear that government cannot enforce racially discriminatory housing practices, and Missouri will not tolerate efforts to revive them.”
The Springfield City Council and City Manager David Cameron issued a joint statement this week declaring that “there is no place in Springfield, or anywhere, for such a divisive and discriminatory vision.”
“While it is improbable that such a project could legally or practically occur within city limits, silence is not an option,” the statement said. “As a regional leader, we will not stand idly by in the face of attempts to revive outdated, harmful ideologies.”
On its website, Return to the Land its mission is to “separate ourselves from a failing modern society, and we will make positive cultural changes in ourselves and in our ancestral communities.”
It also includes a disclaimer that the group does not engage in the sale or rental of real estate.
Orwoll responded to criticism from Springfield elected officials in his social media post, denying that excluding people of color and Jews should be considered racist.
“We are not a hate group,” he said. “We have never expressed hate towards any ethnic group, racial group or religious group.”
He took umbrage with Fogle calling the group racist, saying: “She wants to call us racists because we prefer being among our own people.”
“It’s not a supremacist group. It’s not a hate group. It’s not even a white nationalist group,” he said. “We are white identitarians. We value our identity and want to preserve it. That’s not hate. That is love for your own people.”
Fogle, who was among the first public officials to condemn Return to the Land’s possible expansion to Missouri, said she has been inundated with “pretty horrific messages and pretty horrific responses” on social media.
But she said she has no intention of being silent.
“It’s my job to make sure I’m using my platform to communicate that there’s no place in Springfield, no place in Missouri, no place in this country for a group who is intentionally leaving behind people who have a different skin color or intentionally leaving behind people of the Jewish faith,” she said. “And I would expect every elected official at every level to use their platform to see the same things.”
Across the state line, the group also drew the ire of Arkansas Attorney General Tim Griffin.
The Republican announced his office would open an investigation of the group to ensure its activities didn’t violate state or federal law. That probe, Griffin said in an email to The Independent, has not turned up any illegal activity.
“Racism has no place in a free society,” he said, “but from a legal perspective, we have not seen anything that would indicate any state or federal laws have been broken.”
