(West Virginia Legislative Photography)Returning to a now very familiar restaurant a few blocks from where I live in New York City for brunch a few days ago, I met the new hostess who, much to my surprise, is a poet, who has performed at the Guggenheim. Then again, perhaps it wasn’t so surprising since creatives seem to find one another. Her name is even poetic, Alondra. 
What unfolded over the course of enjoying my blueberry, silver-dollar pancakes provided nourishment for my soul, my spirit. We talked about our journey to becoming a creative and about poets whose work we respect for the truths they bring out of the shadows and into the light: Silas House, Ocean Vuong, Callie Siskel and in my mind always Mary Oliver and Billy Collins. I mentioned that I would gladly yield to her to explain in further detail to me Vuong’s core message. And since I frequent this restaurant often, I welcome what future conversations will gift to broaden my horizons on the work of such an acclaimed author. Up to this point, the conversation was enlightening and energizing. But what followed far surpassed an appreciation of poetry.
I was asked (as I often am in New York City) about the Appalachian region in general and West Virginia in particular. The conversation almost always turns to one of their misunderstanding of the struggles faced by those in rural America and a fierce pride deeply rooted in those who dwell in that culture. They want to know how West Virginians moved from a historically blue state to an overwhelming red state. Conversation turns to the coal industry and geographical challenges and the opioid epidemic. Each is a revealing detour from the enjoyment of blueberry pancakes and crisp bacon. And I welcome it at every turn.
But it wasn’t until Alondra said, “We are living in fascinating times,” that I stopped eating and wondered at the certainty and near enthusiasm with which she delivered these words. I looked at her and asked what she meant. She explained with such conviction that in times of unrest, uncertainty, creatives find ways to hone their craft to an even greater degree; they are fed by the challenge to put the turmoil, the spectacle in perspective and create work that speaks not only to the unrest but to the possibilities that we, as creatives, can bring to the table to possibly, hopefully, right the wrongs that plague us. I was not only grateful for her vision, but reminded also of how very important it is for each of us to be more open than ever to finding ways out of a most intricate and dangerous maze.
This moment — this most refreshing moment — reminded me of a note I received from a reader of one of my recent op-eds, who while supporting my opinion reminded me that what is happening throughout West Virginia is also happening all across the country. And with the reduction and even the elimination of arts and culture both nationally and throughout West Virginia, Alondra reminded me that more than ever we must not loosen our firm hold on what creatives bring to the table, for it has been shown throughout history what happens when those voices are threatened, in some cases silenced; they grow even stronger. My message to those who are coming far too close in their attempts to silence those certain, creative voices: Be careful. Be very careful.

(Getty Images)More than half a million hunters are expected to take to the fields and woods for Pennsylvania’s firearm deer hunting season that begins on Saturday, Nov. 29 this year. 
The season will last through Dec. 13, with hunting allowed on two Sundays – Nov. 30 and Dec. 7.
Listen to Ian and Emily’s audio recap:

“Opening day of deer season here touches countless families, mine included, as well as offices, work sites and schools,” said State Game Commission Executive Director Steve Smith. “It’s about more than recreation, though. Deer season is also conservation and compassion turned into action, as our hunters keep deer in balance with their habitat, while feeding themselves and hungry neighbors. There’s truly nothing like it.”
Last year, an estimated 476,880 deer were harvested by hunters in Pennsylvania, with an estimated 283,760 during firearm season.
Nearly 284,000 pounds of venison were donated through the Hunters Sharing the Harvest program at more than 100 licensed butcher shops in 56 counties. It was then distributed to food banks across the state. Some 1.1 million servings of venison were ultimately delivered.
According to the Game Commission, during rifle deer hunting season, Pennsylvanians are allowed one antlered deer per hunting license, and one antlerless deer per Wildlife Management Unity (WMU) specific antlerless license, Deer Management Assistance Program (DMAP) permit or Agricultural Deer Control Permit.
Hunters must wear 250 inches of fluorescent orange material on their head, chest and back, visible 360 degrees around them, and can shoot between a half hour before sunrise and a half hour after sundown.
This year marks the first firearm deer hunting season since legislation allowing hunting on Sundays was passed in Pennsylvania. Thirteen Sundays were selected throughout the year, with two, during rifle deer season.
However, hunting will not be allowed in Pennsylvania state parks on Dec. 7, though it is permitted on state game lands, state forests and private lands where hunters have permission.
Licenses cost $20.97 for adult Pennsylvanians  and $101,97 for nonresidents. 
Antler restrictions vary by WMU. Details about antler restrictions statewide and reporting harvests can be found on the game commission’s website.
Hunters are required to fill out harvest tags that come with their licenses and attach them to the ear of each deer. Deer harvests must be reported to the Game Commission within 10 days, which can be done online at huntfish.pa.gov or by calling 800-838-4431.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hunter-field-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-27 05:57:09.395674

Every November, Lauren Testoni climbs into a 26-foot U-Haul with a friend or family member and drives across Rhode Island collecting coats and other winter gear, all of which are stored at her family’s East Greenwich home until the next morning.
Then on the Friday after Thanksgiving, the U-Haul delivers the donations to the State House lawn for the annual Buy Nothing Day Coat Exchange. Coats, hats, gloves, scarves and socks are given away for free to anyone who needs them — often unhoused people, refugees and low-income families.
“People need a leg up and this is their first way to do that,” Testoni said in an interview. “It literally keeps people alive in the winter to have a coat.”
This year’s exchange will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 28, outside the State House, on the lawn facing the Providence Place mall.
The annual Black Friday tradition dates back to 1997 when local activist Greg Gerritt and some friends wanted to highlight the problems with consumerism while also doing something useful for the community, Testoni said.
It’s part of the reason the event has been held on the State House lawn, which lies directly across the street from Providence Place where shoppers are looking for holiday deals.

“It’s absolutely there to make a statement,” Testoni said. “We have to be prepared for anything to happen. We have to be prepared to help each other. We have to be prepared to stand together as a community.”
Volunteers send out the initial call for donations on Labor Day weekend before setting up collection locations. 
When she stopped at CARJON Air Conditioning and Heating in Smithfield late Tuesday afternoon, Testoni collected 567 coats — the largest single-site donation she’s picked up in her 15 years helping with the exchange.
“We’ve been busy elves,” Chris Collette, CARJON’s sales team manager, said. “We were happy to get a decent amount to be able to help people.”
Collette said he and coworkers felt it was especially important to collect winter gear this year amid the recent pause in federal food benefits.
Testoni doesn’t have any firm number on how many items get distributed at the annual coat exchange. She said she just knows that it’s in the hundreds. Which leaves plenty of leftover coats, which she said are then given to the Mathewson Street United Methodist Church in Providence where they can be distributed to people in need..
While rewarding, Testoni said it’s challenging to constantly see hundreds of people line up for a coat.
“I hate that we have to do it, but I’m glad there are people who step up,” she said. “We’ve never gone without coats.”
Testoni has acknowledged recent state investments in trying to keep Rhode Islanders warm this coming winter. In late October, Gov. Dan McKee’s administration committed over $1.7 million in grants to municipalities and nonprofit service providers to expand Rhode Island’s network of warming centers and homeless shelters.
But as long as the need continues to keep Rhode Islanders warm, Testoni said organizers will continue to distribute coats.
“With a simple twist of fate or loss of a job, any one of us can be standing there waiting for a coat,” she said.

This column was first published Nov. 27, 2024.
Frankfort’s small army of state workers, fresh from four days off for Thanksgiving on Dec. 1, 1997, slipped from their cars in normal morning sun and almost as one looked to the sky with twisted, stricken faces.
The Capitol Annex parking lot seemed misted with some indelible flesh-rot that despised humankind. It wasn’t just a smell but a Presence. It sucked life from you; your soul departed and you knew it would not return. Your eyes glazed toward opaque. You could not breathe but for shallow, burning gasps that presaged death rattle.
Of all possible causes, you wouldn’t at this moment imagine a turkey.
Yet. Over there, 30 feet yonder, a maintenance lad in a white haz-mat suit with a stout black bag and a muscular garbage picker crept toward a thing on the Annex lawn. It looked like a yellowed stew of plastic and flesh. It seemed to glow and quiver. Some brave parking-lot sufferer managed to croak out toward the creeping lad, “Dear God, son … What … Why?”
“Some a-hole threw a turkey on the lawn,” the lad said, in a voice that echoed death. It was a sentence as final and direct as, “They launched the nuclear missiles.”
When he’d kissed his wife goodbye that morning, the young man had no clue what this day would bring. He was about to be a hero. He retrieved the turkey. He lost his sense of smell. “Like starin’ at the Sun and goin’ blind,” he told the Workers Comp Board weeks later, I heard. It was a metaphor nailed down tight.
So this is a story I’ve been badgered to tell since then. It started when Rep. Jim Callahan of Southgate gave me a Thanksgiving turkey.
Jim was House Democratic Caucus chairman. In the happy event he liked you, you could have no finer friend in the stinging spin-drift of the Kentucky legislature. If he didn’t, he was one of the few people who could and would get you fired. A man to be trusted and feared. A perfect politician.
I had just lately and reluctantly been put in charge of the Legislative Research Commission’s Public Information Office, a communications shop whose future was in doubt because of some early Republican restiveness. They didn’t find the office deferential enough. It likely wasn’t.
I made it my strategic purpose in life to become indispensable to Jim, so he (and the House Dems, then lazy with a comfortable majority) would protect me against the new restive Republican hordes. I succeeded with Jim, the caucus obeyed his instructions re: me, and in late 1997 Jim started rewarding me for my many good works with appreciated tokens like holiday meats.
The day before this particular Thanksgiving — five days before the maintenance lad’s heroics — Jim’s lanky assistant presented me with my first turkey, laid the sweaty sucker on my desk, bagged in plastic, pristine, frozen and promptly forgotten.
Forgotten, that is to say, in my windowless, steam-heated office, 80 degrees at least, with four black holidays awaiting it and a billion turkey-flesh bacteria awakening to yawn, scratch themselves, and eat.
Flash forward: 9:27 p.m., Payton Residence, Louisville. Sat. Nov. 29.
Quick scene:
“Aw, MAN! NO!”
“What?”
“I forgot the damn TURKEY!”
“What turkey?”
“The one Jim C. gave me three days ago that’s sitting on my desk like a bomb about to explode, if it hasn’t already! I have to get it.’
(Indistinct squabbling).
Even quicker scene:
“You’re not driving a hundred miles round-trip to Frankfort in the dead of night to retrieve a turkey that’s wrapped in plastic and perfectly fine. No.”
Note to young husbands: There are many days coming in your marriage when you simply look at your wife’s slant eyes and surrender. I surrendered. Fifty miles east, the turkey-flesh bacteria ate and ate.
The rest of the weekend was like waiting for biopsy results. Monday morning I drove to work early, dreading what I’d find, hoping against hope the turkey hadn’t exploded but otherwise wanting to get things cleaned up and tended to as best I could before anyone else arrived. Pretty sure I was first in the parking lot slammed by the Presence, the living thing I’d birthed.
The Kentucky Capitol and Annex are in the author’s hometown of Frankfort along the Kentucky River. (University of Kentucky Libraries, Special Collections Research Center, Post Card Collection)
But hope withstood its first assault. As a Frankfort native, I was accustomed to its distilleries, specifically the smell of its distilleries burning mash. The signature smell of the Kentucky River valley. In many ways, Frankfort is a smell. It’s not necessarily a good smell; many find it rank. But all share in it. Every redneck boy, every doctor’s son, every lawyer’s daughter and governor’s privileged kid walks out on fall mornings into its egalitarian embrace. It is hillbilly Marxism: Share the stink.
So for no more than half a second I thought/hoped this stink might be mash. For the second half-second I thought, “Whew, did they throw some rotting sheep cadavers into the mash vats this morning?” Then of course I knew: Turkey. Hissing from my office. Into the Annex HVAC system. Leaking out the old building’s windows. Filling the river valley. Soon to make me the laughing stock of Frankfort. Republicans would say this proved my liberalism.
I try to be relatively accurate in memoirish accounts like this (facts are critically important until they interfere with a good laugh). So I’ll admit the next half hour is a blur that resists disinterment.
The grotesque bird was still on my desk, its plastic bag ripped open by the force of its eruption. I recall an echoey dripping sound onto the floor, a yellowish oozing slime, thick like molasses, that seemed alive itself (remember, it teemed with a billion chomping necrobiomes). It looked like some bad special-effects alien from the first season of Star Trek in 1966.
I cannot remember how I managed to scoop up the carcass itself, make some quick impossible decision about disposing of it, and rush it down the still-deserted Annex hall to the bronze entry doors, where I flung it mightily onto the front lawn and the Presence began spreading in earnest, as did its legend.
At some point the heroic haz-mat kid was called, he gave the remains their final scoop, yet the smell snaked through the Capitol campus (HVAC circulation and filters are eternal, and the river valley itself a thermal trap). Many workers went home for an extra day or two of Thanksgiving celebration. Every sentence at home began “You won’t believe…”
Me, I suffered the derision I deserved, and have at least once a year for 27 years been hectored into telling “Scott’s Turkey Story” to wildly laughing, knee-slapping audiences. I’ve hated it every time, knowing they’re not exactly laughing with me, and sworn for many years I’d “write it up” and just hand the sucker out at every such request.
So now I’ve done that. Here you are. Don’t ask again.
But.
Coda: There is more to the story, and it’s good, but it doesn’t belong to me. It belongs to a fellow Capitol staffer who worked a mysterious deskless job for people who seemed powerful. His name recalls that of a major world capital. He would “borrow” your desk without asking if he needed one. Jim Callahan gave him a turkey every year too.
This is a grand fellow, as all in politics must be, but a bit absent-minded, as most in politics are. To his credit though, and unlike me, he miraculously got his gifted bird to his car that afternoon. Threw it in the trunk. Promptly forgot it.
A week or so later, troubled by some mystery problem with the car — couldn’t quite put his finger on it, snap, snap! — he dropped it off at the repair shop.
From memory:

On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets — William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels — he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
Devotion in the service of unity
It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The first took place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 — Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving — which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November — it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

National Archives
Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”

Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”
‘Pardon our national…transgressions’
As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals — just like the prisoners in the New York City jail — thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message — not simply a message, but a “proclamation” — sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

(Matt Poole / U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) As families gather around the Thanksgiving table today, there is a good chance that the steaming bird at the center of the feast could have come from Virginia. The U.S. Department of Agriculture ranks the commonwealth as the sixth largest producer of turkey in the country, estimating over 15 million birds were produced in 2024.
The turkeys produced in the state are not all for holiday roasts. The growth of Americans’ turkey consumption makes it an all-year commodity through ground meat, deli slices, and other foods that have become staples of the nation’s diet. In 2023, the Virginia turkey industry is estimated to have brought in over $400 million.
“Back in my grandparents’ day, it was a holiday specialty, but now, you can enjoy turkey products year round,” said Hobey Bauhan, president of the Virginia Poultry Federation.
While the value of turkeys and the amount of production nationwide is down, Bauhan said the importance of the industry is still reflected in Virginia, evidenced by investments in plants and feed operations. He said that the federation works with lawmakers on a bipartisan basis to manage policies about protecting the environment to ensure they aren’t too restrictive for the 200 family farms in the state.
“You know, if Virginia does not maintain such a positive business climate, investment could flow through another part of the country,” Bauhan said. “That’s what we want to keep the paltry industry thriving in Virginia.”
Virginia is among states such as Minnesota, North Carolina, Arkansas, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, and Pennsylvania as top producers of the bird. 
With the rise in tariffs in recent years some industries have severely struggled. The turkey industry saw a win in 2023 when U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., was part of talks to lift the significant tariffs India had placed on certain American agricultural products, such as frozen turkey. The first shipments to India came out of the Shenandoah Valley, according to Bauhan.
The turkey industry was modernized through innovation in the Shenandoah Valley in the 1920s at Virginia Tech. A.L. Dean, the head of poultry science at the time, got a letter from Charles Wampler – an extension agent in Rockingham County – about artificially raising turkeys. 
“(He) experimented with hatching turkey eggs in an incubator back in the 1920s and it just kind of gave rise to a significant industry in the Shenandoah Valley,” Bauhan said.
This led the turkey industry to operate year-round in a similar way as the chicken industry.
This year the poultry federation celebrated 100 years since its official inception. Agricultural leaders and Gov. Glenn Youngkin reflected on the rich history of the industry in the region in Rockingham County.

RICHMOND. Va – Some lawmakers hope for more guardrails to better protect Virginians amid the boom in artificial intelligence.
Legislators have started to pre-file bills for the upcoming session which starts on Jan. 14. Most so far represent Democratic legislative initiatives frequently discussed on the campaign trail.
Some of the bills that will be filed include placing limitations on what chatbots can say and banning AI from purchasing tickets, according to Dels. Cliff Hayes, D-Chesapeake, and Michelle Maldonado, D-Manassas.
Last year, legislators introduced at least 20 bills in the General Assembly that tried to define or regulate AI use and expand consumer protections. A majority failed or were vetoed.
Maldonado plans to introduce an AI bill that limits what chatbots can say to humans in therapeutic and psychotherapeutic settings. Chatbots are “primed” to make a human feel good, according to Maldonado.
However, a 16-year-old boy confided in a chatbot about his suicidal thoughts and plans. He took his own life in April, according to National Public Radio. His father testified the chatbot discouraged his son from seeking parental help.
Three out of four teenagers have used AI as consultants, according to Common Sense Media, a nonprofit that prioritizes kids’ safety.
“We have to make sure that when people are engaging with these chatbots, they are trained in such a way that they detect language that suggests self-harm, suicidal ideation, or anything like that, the responses are appropriate to go get help,” Maldonado said.
Some startup companies are trying to create chatbot companions that help people in therapy, but they cannot substitute for a human, according to Maldonado.
The second proposed bill from Maldonado will address the usage of chatbots with Virginians age 18 and under. High school and college students are heavily affected by chatbots, according to Maldonado.
“We have a gap that needs to be addressed, and regulating what kinds of uses and what kinds of guardrails we need to have in place when chatbots are interacting with minors,” Maldonado said.
Maldonado has not finalized her legislation, but she hopes there is bipartisan support for her bills.
“There will probably be some things we’ll have to work out to to make sure we garner the support we need to get it passed, but I think there is an appetite and a willingness to do it,” Maldonado said.
Maldonado introduced House Bill 2094 in the last session, which would have created requirements for developing, deploying and using high-risk AI systems. The bill also created requirements for civil penalties for noncompliance.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed the bill, saying it was too “rigid” and would “establish a burdensome artificial intelligence regulatory framework.”
Maldonado will reintroduce the bill, but tailor it more to a specific use case and industry sector.
“I’m disappointed that he chose not to pass this bill,” Maldonado said. “This bill, a version like this that is much more comprehensive, was also carried in other states.”
Maldonado also introduced two other bills related to AI that failed in the previous General Assembly session.
Maldonado said she would like the General Assembly to take a “more aggressive position” to pass a bill that clarifies the structure around the use of social media platforms and their interaction with Virginians under the age of 18.
“The research is clear that there have been mental health harms,” Maldonado said. “That’s undeniable.”
Lawmakers will also propose a bill to require AI labels on certain types of media in an effort to slow down deepfake images and videos, according to Hayes. They may also introduce the Ban Bots Buys Act, which bans AI from purchasing tickets for events, according to Hayes.
“Those bots can be created in such a way that they buy up in bulk,” Hayes said. “They resell the tickets online and other venues, causing people to have to overpay for their purchases.”
There “definitely” needs to be guardrails around AI, according to Hayes.
“AI is already here,” Hayes said. “It is already advanced. So, for those who believe that it’s coming, they’re already way behind.”
The General Assembly passed Hayes’ bill in February which required recommendations or predictions provided by any AI-based tool to not be the sole basis for any criminal justice decisions.
 Virginians cannot be so caught up in artificial intelligence that it impacts their lives and ultimately makes decisions that could cause harm, according to Hayes.
“We want to make sure that we remain innovative, but at the same time, we want to make sure that people come first,” Hayes said.
Alan Shark, a political science associate professor at George Mason University, said he would like the General Assembly to reintroduce HB 2094.
“It really puts more pressure on the developing community to provide documentation so that if there is any kind of issue, legal challenge or otherwise, that there is documentation in a process in which they can explain,” Shark said.
Youngkin issued Executive Order 51 in July, which launched a review of statewide regulations using AI technology. An AI tool will scan state regulations and guidance documents, searching for contradictory or redundant statutes. The tool highlights areas in which the regulatory language can be streamlined.
Shark supports mandates that call for more human oversight.
“It’s just the governor prefers this to be as an executive order versus legislation,” Shark said. “On the other side, though, is a push to leverage AI for regulatory efficiency, meaning they’re looking to find ways to reduce regulation, therefore ideally encouraging more innovation.”
AI should not be political, according to Shark.
“I don’t think you can look at that by party anywhere in the country,” Shark said. “I just think it’s the level of understanding of what AI is and can do.”

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
Days of Thanksgiving
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

Photo courtesy of the Georgia Department of Natural ResourcesIt’s a bad time to be a turkey in Georgia, even if you don’t live on a poultry farm.
The number of turkey poults – what turkey experts call baby turkeys – is on the decline across nearly all of Georgia, according to numbers from the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, with most of the state’s turkeys reproducing below the replacement rate of two poults per hen.
“We have been monitoring poult production in Georgia since the late 70s, and back in the 80s and 90s, we averaged about four poults per hen,” said wildlife biologist and DNR wild turkey project coordinator Emily Rushton.
The DNR’s annual count of poults per hen takes place over the summer, after the spring breeding season, when hens are with their poults. Members of the public can submit observations to help with the count.
“In the early 2000s, it took a pretty sharp decline,” Rushton said. “But the past 10 years or so, we’ve been holding steady at about 1.5 poults per hen.”
Turkeys in Georgia’s lower coastal plain in the southeastern part of the state are the sole silver lining in the poult census, with the average hen hatching 2.39 poults, up from 1.85 in last year’s survey.
The heavily populated Piedmont region which takes up most of the northern half of the state and includes Atlanta and its surrounding regions saw the steepest decline, dropping from 1.94 poults per hen last year to 1.21 this year.

The No. 1 problem facing Georgia’s gobblers is the loss of what’s called early successional habitat, which flourishes after a disturbance like a hurricane, wildfire or the removal of trees and is what exists long before land evolves into a mature forest. Think shrubby, grassy fields with dense ground cover but not a lot of trees, where turkeys can be themselves, hiding out and munching on seeds, insects and other favorites.
“There’s a lot of factors at play, certainly the most important one is probably habitat loss and landscape level changes in the state,” Rushton said. “Obviously there’s been a lot of development in Georgia, habitat fragmentation and loss of early successional habitat, which is really important for turkeys for raising their broods. The poults are relying on insects, and insects are most abundant in early successional habitat.”
Georgia has taken steps in recent years to reverse the turkeys’ downward trend, including shortening the turkey hunting season starting in 2021.
Turkey season takes place during the spring breeding season, and wildlife experts hoped pushing back the start date a week or two to let the turkeys do their thing without getting shot at would help bolster nest numbers.
“There’s some thought that perhaps the early hunting season was interrupting some of the natural calling and response in the way they behave in the woods,” said Georgia Wildlife Federation President Mike Worley. “So that’s why it was pushed back some time, to give a little bit better opportunity to allow the birds to kind of go through a natural cycle without people in the woods with them.”
Worley called the turkeys’ decline “a real concern across the state,” but he expressed optimism that the situation can be improved.
“We’ve cut the bag limit and put restrictions on how many birds hunters can take. All of those things contribute to addressing the issue,” he said. “And we’re not in a situation of absolute crisis. We’re in a situation where it demands perhaps a bit more aggressive management, and I think that’s what you’re seeing, rather than the whole nuclear option of shutting down hunting.”
Worley said one thing property owners can do to make things easier for turkeys is to plan controlled burns.
Georgia’s flora and fauna evolved to benefit from periodic fires, and burning down old vegetation can help make room for the early successional habitat where turkeys thrive.
“If somebody comes to us and says we would like to manage our land for turkeys, one of the first things that we tell them is let’s get some fire on the ground,” Worley said. “There are certainly plants that you can plant, food plots that you can put in, all kinds of things, but those are all secondary to the fact that just a simple burn – which is what our native environment really requires – a simple burn can do a lot in restoring turkey habitat.”
Rushton said it’s not just people who look forward to eating turkey, and the birds’ recovery will be important for critters up and down the food chain.
“They are a really important prey species,” she said. “Their eggs are an important prey item for a lot of wildlife species – other avian species, birds, snakes, and mammals, basically anything will eat a turkey egg or a turkey poult. And they are also a good indicator of forest health, habitat health.”

The singular ruggedness and beauty of the region is part of what draws as many as 6 million visitors to the landscape each year. But the destination also shows the effects of climate change in unique ways, and that reality is already putting pressure on regional recreation, tourism, and ways of life, said North Country scientists, business owners, and officials gathered at the foot of Mount Washington earlier this month to mark the release of the inaugural White Mountains Almanac.

 Where to find the almanac

	Four thousand copies of the first White Mountains Almanac have been printed so far, said Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray. While supplies last, physical copies of the almanac can be ordered online for free or for a suggested donation. A free e-edition is also available online.

	Rich collections of weather and climate data gathered in and around the White Mountain region can help put numbers to the changes residents and visitors have already observed, scientists said. They hope to begin sharing that data more broadly, and leverage the ability of the White Mountains to capture visitors’ hearts and minds, to help the many who enjoy the landscape adapt to the changes it faces and become more responsible stewards.
“To truly love this landscape, we must understand it,” state Tourism Director Michelle Cruz said at the event.
Long-term data provides insight
The almanac is  a free publication created through a collaboration among three North Country research institutions: the Appalachian Mountain Club, Hubbard Brook Research Foundation, and the Mount Washington Observatory. Scientists involved in the project said the text was the product of their desire to see the powerful data collected in the region reach a larger audience.
The publication contains a month-to-month description of natural phenomena local to the White Mountains, and will be distributed across the North Country. It is intended to serve as a guide for visitors to what’s happening — environmentally speaking — on the landscape at all times of year, said Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray in an interview. The text was authored by intern and science communicator Frank Vazzano. 
Its conclusions are based on expansive data collected by the three institutions about weather patterns and ecosystems in the White Mountains, Murray said. But scientists felt it wasn’t reaching enough people to have the impact it could.
“(The almanac) is really near and dear to my heart, because I’ve been thinking about this for years. … A lot of people care about the weather, but they may not really make those connections to, you know, what it means when we put all of this data together, and how our climate is changing,” Murray said.

Discussing how shifts in winter weather affect plant life, Murray emphasized the importance of tracking weather and other natural phenomena over many years to better understand how climate change is threatening northern forests.

Adapting to a changing landscape
Together, the data paint a powerful picture, Murray said, though given that the implications for the beloved landscape are murky, it’s not an easy one to share.
Among the topics covered by the almanac are a long-term increase in winter temperatures across the White Mountains; an increase in winter thaw events that can destabilize snowpack for backcountry skiers; and an overall downturn in the number of winter and summer “recreation days,” which are scored on factors like temperature and sunshine.
“It is a tough thing to feel sort of down as you realize that all these trends are going in the direction of, you know, losing the charm and the environment that we typically think of when we think about visiting the Whites,” Murray said.

Though things are changing, there are ways to adapt to these shifts and still enjoy what the White Mountains have to offer, said Mount Washington Observatory Director of Weather Operations Jay Broccolo.
That might mean timing visits better, or adjusting snowmaking operations at ski resorts to make the best use of what resources we have available, he said.
While the nature of each season is changing, the White Mountain region is still holding on to the traits that make it special, Murray said. Making visitors aware of how these phenomena are shifting over time is an important part of helping ensure they can still enjoy the things they love most about the region, she said.
“The mountains are still snowing, but when are they snowing? It’s more about change: It’s about planning and staying tuned in to what’s happening when you plan to come to the Whites,” she said.
AMC Director of Research Sarah J. Nelson echoed this idea at the Nov. 18 press event, saying that mountains like the Whites are, for many, “climate refugia,” or places where the effects of climate change are less pronounced. Mountains are still going to be cooler than other places all year round, and will still have more snow than other regions in the near future, she said.
With so many people coming from far and wide to visit the mountains, making sure they are prepared will help them find joy in the changing landscape, steward it, and stay safe meanwhile, said Charlie Buterbaugh, director of external affairs at the Mount Washington Observatory.
“The wave is happening, right? And so I think we see our role as educating people who are coming from metropolitan regions about this special place, and how to recreate responsibly,” he said. 
Sarah Nelson, director of research with the Appalachian Mountain Club, prepares to demonstrate proper snowpack measuring technique on Nov. 18. Snowpack depth measurements collected by laypeople and scientists alike are an important part of the data the AMC and other local research organizations collect on climate change and weather in the region, Nelson said.

BOILING SPRINGS, S.C. — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
Florida governor’s administration pushes to eliminate state’s vaccine mandates

South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation and “health freedom” ideologies promoted by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
Schools and ‘small brush fires’
Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before COVID,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine requirements, according to data published by the state.
Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.
CDC vaccine officials resign while childhood vaccination rates decline

Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain. The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased dramatically over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago. During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
Some schools are more exposed than others. The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.
‘Health freedom’
In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates. “We’re not going to have mandates,” he said, “and I think we are responding properly.”
Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.
In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a COVID-19 vaccine with a free beer or soda. By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
Edward Simmer, interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak. During a legislative hearing in April, Republican state lawmakers voted against his permanent confirmation because of his past support for COVID-19 vaccines and masking. One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
Public health officials in other states also have been blocked from new roles because of their COVID-19 response. In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
In South Carolina, Simmer, lacking lawmakers’ confirmation, leads the public health agency in an interim capacity.
South Carolina Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer in April. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for COVID-19 vaccines.
But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective” if the Republican Party just took a stance against vaccines “as a matter of policy.”
The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24. But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

Ohio voting rights advocates are urging Gov. Mike DeWine to veto a voting measure approved just before lawmakers left for the holidays. The bill, Ohio Senate Bill 293, eliminates a grace period for absentee ballots post-marked by Election Day to arrive by mail, which GOP lawmakers have been whittling away in recent years.
Lawmakers also lumped in several provisions targeting noncitizens on the voting rolls. It’s an issue Secretary of State Frank LaRose has repeatedly raised even as he insists on Ohio’s “gold standard” electoral system.
LaRose has flagged hundreds of registrations since taking office. State and county prosecutors have largely dismissed his allegations as meritless. Earlier this month, LaRose tried again and sent those cases to U.S. Department of Justice.

The last-minute changes to S.B. 293 will give much greater weight to LaRose’s regular reviews of the voter rolls.
Not only does it require audits occur monthly (despite federal law barring removals during a 90-day ‘quiet period’ before federal elections), but it also directs county boards to cancel a person’s registration without notice if the secretary determines the person isn’t a citizen.
Just last year, LaRose’s reviews erroneously targeted several recently naturalized citizens.
Testifying before an Ohio House committee the day prior to the bill’s passage, LaRose downplayed the changes.
The more than 7,000 ballots that arrived after Election Day in 2024?
“That is .0129% of the overall,” LaRose said, noting that already two-thirds of states have the same deadline in place.
The move to cancel registrations? LaRose sidestepped that, insisting the change “simply” defines federal data as “one of the approved sets of data for conducting voter list maintenance.”
Ohio lawmakers clear absentee ballot, citizenship restrictions for House floor vote

The deadline
The impetus for changing Ohio’s absentee ballot deadline came, at least in part, from the U.S. Department of Justice.
In March, President Trump asserted in an executive order that all ballots arriving after Election Day should be thrown out.
LaRose told lawmakers DOJ attorneys have warned his office they would sue Ohio if it didn’t change state law to comply.
“I think it’s just very unusual for the Department of Justice to act as the President’s lobbyist,” Center for Election Innovation and Research Executive Director David Becker said of that pressure campaign.
The Department of Justice’s role is to enforce federal law, he said, and there’s no federal law defining the time when ballots need to arrive.
“There is no federal law that does that whatsoever,” he said, “and for the Department of Justice to be pressuring states is, at best, highly unusual, and at worst, outright corrupt.”
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case out of Mississippi in which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled against a similar grace period.
Several state lawmakers voiced concern about what happens if the court eliminates grace periods nationwide. And worse, the possibility of that decision landing next summer between Ohio’s primary and general elections.
Becker acknowledged that decision could go either way but called the Fifth Circuit’s interpretation “unusual.”
The audits
The organization VoteRiders helps voters get the ID they need to cast a ballot in their state.
The group’s legal director, Ceridwen Cherry, said routinely scouring federal database and Ohio’s Bureau of Motor Vehicles records to “root out suspected noncitizen voters is a solution in search of a problem.”
Information in the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database isn’t always up to date, she explained.
There’s also no state or federal law requiring naturalized citizens to update their driver’s license.
That means a new citizen could register to vote, and one or both of the databases LaRose uses to review their registration might wrongly indicate that they’re ineligible.
And Cherry worries the bill “does not give incorrectly flagged eligible US citizens a chance to prove their citizenship. Instead, they would be purged from voter rolls without warning or recourse.”
VoteRiders worked with the University of Maryland’s Center for Democracy and Civic Engagement to study Americans’ access to documentary proof of citizenship.
They found more than 21 million Americans, or more than 9% of the voting age population, do not have ready access to the documents they need.
Cherry warns those two factors together — lack of warning and lack of access — could lead to otherwise eligible voters being disenfranchised because they don’t have what they need and don’t have time to get it.
DeWine’s call
The governor has ten days to decide on whether to sign the bill once it arrives on his desk.
As of Tuesday afternoon, the Senate has not yet sent it to the governor.
But the Ohio Voter Rights Coalition, which includes groups like the League of Women Voters, Common Cause, and the ACLU of Ohio, is already urging DeWine to reject the bill.
In a press release the group criticized the measure for “needlessly eliminat(ing) the post-election window” and imposing audits “that will drastically increase the number of provisional ballots.”
And the coalition calls back to DeWine’s own 2023 signing statement when he approved Ohio House Bill 458.
That bill required voters show photo ID to cast a ballot and directed the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to put a “noncitizen” designation on driver’s licenses or IDs issued to people who aren’t U.S. citizens.
Notably, just like the bill headed to DeWine’s desk, H.B. 458 shortened the deadline for absentee ballots — cutting it from 10 days post-election to four.
Should DeWine sign the bill, Ohio voters will see a different absentee ballot deadline in three successive federal elections.
On signing the bill, DeWine said, “I believe with the enactment of the new election integrity provisions in House Bill 458, this matter should be settled, and I do not expect to see any further statutory changes to Ohio voting procedures while I am Governor.”
The Ohio Voter Rights Coalition is now calling on DeWine to “veto this anti-democratic bill immediately, stand by his word, and reaffirm his commitment to Ohio voters.”

Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.
But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America – at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
 Farming faiths and harvest festivals

The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.

Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
 ‘Days of Thanksgiving’

The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
 Harvest feast of 1621

Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”

‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
 Pilgrims’ primacy

The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.

The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
 Rising immigration

Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.

Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.

But one survey found that the overall price of Thanksgiving dinner in Connecticut is down from last year.
In Connecticut, there have been 41 cases of the avian flu in wild birds this year alone, and 102 total since 2022, according to the USDA. Five flocks in Connecticut have been infected since 2022, three in 2025. And nationwide, the USDA projected that the cost of wholesale, whole turkey would increase at the end of this year after production fell in January due to the avian flu.
However, projections from the American Farm Bureau Federation found that many stores surveyed were offering holiday deals on turkey, decreasing consumer costs.
Overall, the survey projected that a meal serving 10 people could cost $55.81, down from last year but still higher than the organization projected in 2021. But since this decrease was due partly because of deals grocery stores put on, Thanksgiving meal costs may vary based on store and location. 
According to Datasembly, a market research company that assess grocery prices from 150,000 stores across the country, prices rose, and poultry saw a 4.4% index change in Connecticut 4.4%. But just across the border in Massachusetts, there was a drop in prices, and a drop of 2.1%.
Side dishes like mac and cheese, and canned goods like vegetables, pumpkin and cranberry sauce, have seen price increases since last year.
Because of the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum, the price of canned goods has risen since last year. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that September 2024 to September 2025, canned good prices increased by 5% in U.S. cities.
And pasta, one of the goods that could be affected by President Donald Trump’s proposed 107% tariff on Italian imports, is crucial to one of the nation’s favorite sides — mac and cheese.
An annual “sides report” from Campbell’s found that in the majority of U.S. states, including Connecticut, stuffing was the most popular of all the Thanksgiving sides. The survey also found that 67% of all Americans preferred eating sides over the main course.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/A3hFo-cost-of-wholesale-whole-turkey-in-the-u.s.-cents-per-lb--1024x662.png,,,2025-11-27 05:57:09.395674

The bill started out as legislation that prohibits a NIL contract from remaining in effect after a student athlete is done playing college sports. 
Former Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. and Fanatics were involved in a legal dispute over a NIL deal after Fanatics claimed Harrison did not meet his obligation. 
“His NIL agreement continued on after his eligibility at college and went into when he was in the NFL,” said Ohio Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville. 
“This simply just does not allow these agreements to go past your eligibility in college, and if it does do that, then it ceases to exist.” 
Ohio state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, said he liked the NIL provisions in the bill.

“When one of my football players is taken advantage of … there’s something we need to do about this,” he said. 
“We can’t have these athletes be used and abused and taken advantage of.” 
Ohio state Rep. Munira Abdullahi, D-Columbus, said it is important to protect student-athletes. 
“When a kid shows up to college as a star recruit there are agents waiting to lock them into contracts that drain money from them for years,” she said. 
Several last minute additions were added to the bill including transferring $40 million from the general revenue fund to go toward the post-traumatic stress fund for first responders; changing the funding formula for nursing home payments from the state; and paying publicly funded child care based on attendance instead of enrollment, among other additions. 
“This does not necessarily mark the end of budget corrections,” Ohio state Sen. Jerry Cirino R-Kirtland, said. 
Lawmakers in both chambers on both sides of the aisles criticized not having much time to look over all the changes made to the bill. 
“I’m not a big fan of these Christmas tree bills,” DeMora said. “I think too much stuff is crammed into it at late hours, and we don’t get to see it all.”
Ohio state Sen. George Lang, R-West Chester, said the changes happened last minute. 
“I truly didn’t have time to vet it,” he said. 
Ohio state Sen. Al Cutrona, R-Canfield, was the only senator to vote against the bill last week. 
“I have major concerns with the process that’s being conducted here in this chamber,” he said. “Maybe the policy is good, maybe it’s bad. I can’t tell you one way or another, because, well, frankly, we haven’t had any true eyes on it. … I’m going to have to vote no on a very good bill.”
Rep. Abdullahi said she reluctantly voted f0r the bill.
“(Changes) were dropped at the eleventh hour and they affect hundreds of millions of your tax dollars,” she said. 
“We’re using what was once a good, simple, common sense bill to quietly move hundreds of millions of dollars while Ohioans are not looking. If anyone else did this would be calling it money laundering, but when we do it, it’s a budget correction bill.”
State Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, and four Republicans state Reps. Levi Dean, Jason Stephens, Jennifer Gross, and Michelle Teska voted against the bill. 
Many lawmakers voiced support for the post-traumatic stress fund for first responders. 
“I wish it was more money,” DeMora said. “I wish it was over more years, but I will certainly settle for the $40 million one time placement of this money into that fund.”
The average person sees one to three traumatic events in their lifetime while first responders see an average of 11 traumatic things a month, said state Sen. Thomas Patton, R-Strongsville. 
“They’re seeing the very, very worst things we can’t possibly imagine,” he said. 
Democratic state Rep. Erika White’s husband is a firefighter in the Toledo area. 
“I’ve watched him carry home the kind of pain that no one sees,” she said. “… (Post-traumatic stress) doesn’t end when the siren stops. It follows them into our homes, to our marriages, in our daily lives.”

(Photo by Alan MacRae/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Bulletin’s three-part series, by William Skipworth, on our state’s disability residential services system is painful to read. It chronicles stories of criminal behavior — neglect, physical assaults, sexual assaults, and preventable deaths of residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities — with families left seeking answers through the courts. The New Hampshire Bulletin and Mr. Skipworth have done New Hampshire a great service by bringing these stories to light.
As someone who has worked in disability policy research for decades, I wish these stories were anomalies. They are not. They are the result of historic prejudice, leading to chronic underfunding, and subsequently to inadequate staffing with insufficient training and oversight.  
Over the course of American history, many people with disabilities were housed and isolated in ever larger, more centrally controlled institutions — from local almshouses in Colonial America to county poor farms in the 1800s to state-run schools and hospitals in the 1900s — all in the name of safety and cost savings. Examples include the Strafford County Poor Farm, New Hampshire School for the Feebleminded (renamed the Laconia State School), and the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane (renamed the New Hampshire State Hospital). However, the promises of cost savings were never realized. Within these centralized institutions came neglect and abuse on an industrial scale, and in many states, forced sterilization, including New Hampshire. 
A movement to eliminate these institutions — the Deinstitutionalization Movement — picked up steam in the 1970s, particularly with the release of Geraldo Rivera’s 1972 documentary, “Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace.” Like the Vietnam War, television footage dramatically changed public awareness. In turn, public pressure led to changes in federal policy, which created small group homes and, still further, home and community-based services (including adult foster care) that are intended to support independent living and keep people with their families and in their communities. As of 2023, about 6,500 people with disabilities live in a mix of these residential settings that are run by private businesses and funded with state and federal funds. 
New Hampshire confronted its own institutional past much later. The 2010 documentary “Lost in Laconia,” offered a stark retrospective on the Laconia State School and reminded us why the state committed to community-based supports in the first place — and what can happen when oversight weakens or systems lose sight of the people they exist to support.
While abuse and neglect are no longer committed on an industrial scale, Mr. Skipworth’s reporting reveals similar patterns of criminal behavior continuing in smaller, more isolated and concealed places. 
So where do we go from here?
This moment calls for a shared commitment — from state leaders, service providers, families, and the broader public. First and foremost, when abuse or neglect is suspected, it must be reported. New Hampshire’s mandatory reporting law applies to everyone. You do not need proof; you need only reasonable suspicion to call local law enforcement or the appropriate state agency. These are crimes and must be treated as such. 
But reporting alone will not fix a system under strain. A stronger federal and state investment is needed to fairly compensate family caregivers — who often provide the very services the residential system struggles to deliver — and to build a stable workforce of well-trained direct support professionals. Turnover is extraordinarily high in-home health and personal care occupations; as a labor economist, I can say clearly that the people who stay in this work do so out of dedication, not pay. Sustaining a dependable, skilled workforce requires real investment.
Everyone in New Hampshire has a role to play. This is the time for us to fully commit to the inclusion of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities in everyday life — in schools, workplaces, civic spaces, places of worship, and neighborhoods across New Hampshire. Inclusion brings sunlight into the smaller, more isolated settings where abuse can take root. Think of how we notice when a friend, neighbor, or colleague is struggling: they are not at work, not at church, not leaving the house. Those same natural cues protect people with disabilities when they are part of our daily lives. Abuse and neglect are far more difficult to hide when someone is known and seen regularly in their community.
Inclusion is not only the ethical thing to do; it is a practical, cost-effective way to ensure safety. 
When people with disabilities participate fully in community life, we — the public — become partners in accountability. We notice. We ask questions. We intervene. We lift up the expectation that everyone belongs, and everyone deserves to be safe.
The Institute on Disability (IOD) was created in the wake of deinstitutionalization and serves as New Hampshire’s University Center for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities (UCEDD). As a UCEDD, we provide training, technical assistance, and research to strengthen disability services and promote full inclusion. But institutions like ours cannot do this work alone. We must redouble — and broaden — our collective efforts to ensure that New Hampshire’s disability service systems are properly funded and equipped to guarantee the full participation and safety of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

(Photo by WEWS.)A new bill proposed by an Ohio Republican lawmaker would revoke the brand new ability for high school athletes to be compensated for their Name, Image and Likeness. Just Monday, the state’s student athletic association announced it had voted to allow for the NIL deals.
The legislation, shared with us, is sponsored by state Rep. Adam Bird (R-New Richmond). It states that high schoolers can’t participate in NIL deals — like basketball superstar Marcus Johnson.
“It’s a blessing from God,” Johnson told us earlier this year about his athletic ability and winning awards.
He has national recognition, fans screaming for him at games — and tens of thousands of followers on Instagram.
“We have received a lot of offers from clothing lines to drinks, drink companies,” Sonny Johnson, Marcus’ father and coach, said.
But he hasn’t accepted any deals, since he’s only a senior at Garfield Heights. But Sonny is thrilled that athletes like Marcus and their families will now get a chance for a slam dunk.
“If you can get a kid that could get a couple thousand dollars without the parents having to give it to him, it saves us some groceries,” Sonny said, laughing.
The Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) announced Monday that it passed new bylaws that allow the high school athletes to be compensated through appearances, licensing, social media, endorsements and/or the use of branding based on their public recognition or notoriety.
It also establishes limitations so that athletes do not hurt their eligibility when it comes to recruiting.
“Having NIL in Ohio would definitely be great for me and my family,” Marcus said.
But those opportunities may be blocked.
“Earning money is not what Ohio high school sports is about,” Rep. Bird said.
Less than 24 hours after the announcement, the Republican lawmaker proposed a bill to ban NIL deals for high school student-athletes.
“We want our sports to be about character development and leadership and fitness and social connections and all of those kinds of things — and not creating even more pressure for our students,” Bird continued.
Students shouldn’t be earning more than coaches and referees, he said, and the athlete’s focus shouldn’t be on endorsements.
“When you’re using public money to create gymnasiums and stadiums and weight rooms, we should be using that publicly paid-for facility for those kinds of things and not for the athlete to be earning NIL money,” the lawmaker said.
Sonny said opponents to NIL don’t understand. Marcus added that 44 other states already approve of NIL for high schoolers.
“I’ve just seen a lot of talent leave Ohio… A lot of talent that want to experience other places because they have NIL,” Marcus said.
The bill is in the early stages and isn’t expected to be heard for several months. Still, athletes hope it’s an airball.
This debate stems from a court case.
A Franklin County high school football player’s mother filed a lawsuit against the OHSAA in mid-October, arguing that students should be permitted to make money from their image. Her son had already missed out on more than $100,000 in potential NIL deals, the mom said.
Franklin County Common Pleas Court Judge Jaiza Page issued an order in late October, allowing students to make money.
Thus, OHSAA had an emergency referendum vote. It passed.

(Photo by Grace Hills for Kansas Reflector)The Thursday of Thursdays has arrived, that being our yearly attempt to act grateful and kind while huddling around an enormous dead bird.
Ha! I kid, because Thanksgiving of course lives in our hearts and minds as a meaningful holiday, not just an excuse for four days away from work and trampling our fellow humans in a quest for flat-screen television sets. We come together to express thanks — for the love that surrounds us, for our family and friends, and for other things that make for dreadfully dull columns. I call them like I see them, folks.
In the interest of shaking things up, here are a dozen messages of thanks for the decidedly cruddy autumn of 2025. It’s bad out there! 
I’m thankful for Senate President Ty Masterson’s close reading of my Kansas Reflector columns. He’s used some of my words for an ad, which I can assure you was not my intent. His gubernatorial campaign should stay tuned for my next column, which will no doubt be even more complimentary!
I’m thankful for President Donald Trump, who has contributed to the civil discourse we all value by calling reporters “piggy,” “insubordinate” and “ugly” in recent days. Here in Kansas, we have to sit so far away from Republicans we can’t even hear what they’re calling us!
I’m thankful for Gov. Laura Kelly’s victory lap in Newsweek, where she’s profiled as a Democrat who can set an example for the nation. I might feel even more thankful if there were more than the one, single, soon-to-depart Laura Kelly.
I’m thankful for the spread of artificial intelligence, which has nearly reached the level of Kansas lawmakers, all the while enriching tech titans and literally driving people insane. Nothing problematic will ever come from this!
I’m thankful for House Speaker Dan Hawkins’ thin-skinned fit of pique in punishing Republicans who wouldn’t call for a special session. That will definitely encourage no one else to run for speaker in January, Dan!
I’m thankful for the hundreds of books I have piled up around my room and definitely plan to read some day. I’m not just creating a hoarding situation and/or fire hazard.
I’m thankful for the fact that hot, young, fresh artists like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and the Beatles have released enormous multi-disk boxed sets for the holiday season. We need to hear more even minute variations of their previously released recordings.
I’m thankful for the Kansas Republican Party, which showed its deep commitment to equality and justice by condemning hateful texts from young staffers while simultaneously posting racist memes about Kelly. Only the best sombreros for our state GOP!
I’m thankful for those in Kansas who voted for a candidate and administration that promised a wholesale rollback of civil liberties and war on the poor, embodied in Project 2025. Looks like you got what you voted for! Hope you enjoy all those tariff-inflated prices this holiday season.
I’m thankful for the way that Kansas Republicans so bravely condemned homophobia in August — when it meant being able to go after a Democrat. What a coincidence!
I’m thankful for all the earth-shaking decisions that Kansans will get to make next year: our governor, D.C. delegation, state Legislature and method of selecting state Supreme Court justices. I’m sure that will all go well and there’s absolutely nothing to be concerned about!
Finally, and more seriously.
I’m actually thankful for all those who made this a joyous year for me personally, regardless of the political and cultural headwinds. By that I mean my family and friends, the amazing Kansas Reflector staff and community, my poetry night comrades, and the mensches at the University Press of Kansas.
You’ve all indulged and encouraged me through these turbulent months. I appreciate it more than words can say. May your Thursday of Thursdays be the Thursday-ist it can be.

Library of Congress)Nine in 10 Americans gather around a table to share food on Thanksgiving. At this polarizing moment, anything that promises to bring Americans together warrants our attention.

	But as a historian of religion, I feel obliged to recount how popular interpretations of Thanksgiving also have pulled us apart.
Communal rituals of giving thanks have a longer history in North America, and it was only around the turn of the 20th century that most people in the U.S. came to associate Thanksgiving with Plymouth “Pilgrims” and generic “Indians” sharing a historic meal.
The emphasis on the Pilgrims’ 1620 landing and 1621 feast erased a great deal of religious history and narrowed conceptions of who belongs in America — at times excluding groups such as Native Americans, Catholics and Jews.
Farming faiths and harvest festivals
The usual Thanksgiving depiction overlooks Indigenous rituals that give thanks, including harvest festivals.
The Wampanoag, who shared food with the Pilgrims in 1621, continue to celebrate the cranberry harvest, and similar feasts were held long before Columbus sailed and Pilgrims landed.
As I note in my 2025 book, “Religion in the Lands That Became America,” for instance, celebrants gathered for a communal feast in the late 11th century in the 50-acre plaza of Cahokia. That Native city, across the river from present-day St. Louis, was the largest population center north of Mexico before the American Revolution.
Cahokians and their neighbors came in late summer or early autumn to give deities thanks, smoke ritual tobacco and eat special food – not corn, their dietary staple, but symbolically significant animals such as white swans and white-tailed deer. So, those Cahokians attended a thanks-giving feast five centuries before the Pilgrims’ harvest-time meal.
‘Days of Thanksgiving’
The usual depiction also de-emphasizes the tradition of officials announcing special “Days of Thanksgiving,” a practice familiar to the Pilgrims and their descendants.
The Pilgrims, who settled in what is now Plymouth, Massachusetts, were separatist Puritans who had denounced the Catholic elements that remained in the Protestant Church of England. They first sought to form their own “purified” church and community in Holland. After about 12 years, many of them moved again, crossing the Atlantic in 1620. The Pilgrims’ colony southeast of Boston was gradually absorbed into Massachusetts Bay Colony, founded in 1630 by a larger group of Puritans who did not split from England’s official church.
As historians have noted, Puritan ministers in Massachusetts’ state-sanctioned Congregational Church didn’t just speak on Sundays. Now and then they also gave special thanksgiving sermons, which expressed gratitude for what the community considered divine interventions, from military victory to epidemic relief.
The practice continued and spread. During the American Revolution, for instance, the Continental Congress declared a Day of Thanksgiving to commemorate the victory at Saratoga in 1777. President James Madison announced Days of Thanksgiving during the War of 1812. Leaders of the United States and the Confederate states did the same during the Civil War.
This tradition influenced Americans such as Sarah Hale, who called for a national Thanksgiving holiday. A magazine editor and poet best known for “Mary Had a Little Lamb,” she successfully pitched the idea to Abraham Lincoln in 1863.
Harvest feast of 1621
Many Americans’ view of “The First Thanksgiving” resembles the scene depicted in a Jean Ferris painting by that name. Finished around 1915, it is similar to another popular image painted around the same time, Jennie Augusta Brownscombe’s “The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth.”
‘The First Thanksgiving at Plymouth’ by Jennie A. Brownscombe. (Image: Stedelijk Museum De Lakenhal/Wikimedia Commons)
Both images distort the historical context and misrepresent Indigenous attendees from the nearby Wampanoag Confederacy. The Native leaders wear headdresses from Plains tribes, and there are too few Indigenous attendees.
Only one eyewitness account survives: a 1621 letter from the Pilgrim Edward Winslow. He reported that the Wampanoag’s leader, Massasoit, brought 90 men. That means, some historians suggest, the shared meal was as much a diplomatic event marking an alliance as an agricultural feast celebrating a harvest.
Ferris’ painting also implies that the English provided the food. Plymouth residents brought “fowl,” as Winslow recalled – probably wild turkey – but the Wampanoag added five killed deer. Even the harvest of “Indian corn” depended on Native aid. Tisquantum or Squanto, the lone survivor of the village that the Pilgrims called Plymouth, had offered lifesaving advice about planting as well as diplomacy.
The image’s cheerful scene also obscures how death had destabilized the area. The Pilgrims lost almost half their group to famine or exposure that first winter. After earlier European contact, however, even larger numbers of the Wampanoag had died in a regional epidemic that raged between 1616-1619. That’s why the Pilgrims found Squanto’s village abandoned, and why both communities were open to the alliance he brokered.
Pilgrims’ primacy
The Pilgrims were latecomers to the Thanksgiving table. Lincoln’s 1863 proclamation, published in Harper’s Monthly, mentioned “the blessing of fruitful fields,” but not the Pilgrims. Nor were Pilgrims depicted in the magazine’s illustrated follow-up. The page showed town and country, as well as emancipated slaves, celebrating the feast day by praying at “the Union altar.” For years before and after the proclamation, in fact, many Southerners resisted Thanksgiving, which they saw as a Northern, abolitionist holiday.
The Pilgrims’ absence makes sense, since they were not the first Europeans to land on North America’s eastern coast – or to give thanks there. Spanish Catholics had founded St. Augustine in 1565. According to an eyewitness account, the Spanish leader asked a priest to celebrate Mass on Sept. 8, 1565, which Native Americans attended, and “ordered that the Indians be fed.”
Two decades later, an English group had tried and failed to establish a colony on Roanoke Island, North Carolina – including a Jewish engineer. The English had more success when they settled Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. A commander leading a new group to Virginia was instructed to mark “a day of Thanksgiving to Almighty God” in 1619, two years before the Plymouth meal.
But over the years, Plymouth’s Pilgrims still moved slowly toward the center of the national holiday – and America’s founding narrative.
In 1769, Plymouth residents promoted their town by organizing a “Forefathers’ Day.” In 1820 the Protestant politician Daniel Webster gave a speech commemorating the bicentennial of the landing at Plymouth Rock and praising the Pilgrims’ arrival as “the first footsteps of civilized man” in the wilderness. Then in an 1841 volume, “Chronicles of the Pilgrim Fathers,” a Boston minister reprinted the 1621 eyewitness account and described the shared harvest meal as “the first Thanksgiving.”
Rising immigration
Between 1880 and 1920, the Pilgrims emerged as the central characters in national narratives about both Thanksgiving Day and America’s origin. It was no coincidence that these years were the peak of immigration to the U.S., and many Americans saw the new immigrants as inferior to those who had landed at Plymouth Rock.
Irish Catholics already had a presence in Boston when the “Pilgrim Fathers” volume appeared in 1841, and more came after the Irish potato famine later that decade. Boston’s foreign-born population increased further as poverty and politics pushed Italian Catholics and Russian Jews to seek a better life in America.
The same was happening in many northern cities, and some Protestants were alarmed. In an 1885 bestseller called “Our Country,” a Congregational Church minister warned that “the glory is departing from many a New England village, because men, alien in blood, in religion, and in civilization, are taking possession of homes in which were once reared the descendants of the Pilgrims.”
During the 300th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ landing and harvest meal, celebrated in 1920 and 1921, the federal government issued commemorative stamps and coins. Officials staged pageants, and politicians gave speeches. About 30,000 people gathered in Plymouth, for instance, to hear President Warren Harding and Vice President Calvin Coolidge praise the “Pilgrim Spirit.”
Soon nativist worries about the newcomers, especially Catholics and Jews, led Coolidge to sign the Immigration Act of 1924, which would largely close America’s borders for four decades.
Americans kept telling the Pilgrim story after U.S. immigration policy became more welcoming in 1965, and many will tell it again next year as we celebrate the nation’s 250th anniversary. Understood in its full context, it’s a story worth telling. But we might use caution since, as history reminds us, stories about the country’s spiritual past can either bring us together or pull us apart.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The_First_Thanksgiving_cph.3g04961-1024x653.jpg,,,2025-11-27 04:56:33.273872

Faith Winter, a Broomfield Democrat who served for more than a decade in the Colorado General Assembly, was killed Wednesday night in a multi-vehicle crash south of Denver.
“Our state is shaken by the loss of Sen. Faith Winter, and I send my deepest condolences to her children, loved ones, friends, and colleagues across our state,” Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement.
“Faith was a fierce advocate for hardworking Coloradans, women, and families, and our climate,” Polis added. “I’ve known Faith for nearly twenty years, first as an organizer for environmental causes and then expanding women’s representation and leadership, and finally, as a state senator. I have had the honor of working with her on many issues to improve the lives of every person and family in our great state, and tackling climate change.”
At least three other people were injured in the crash, which occurred on northbound Interstate 25 near the Dry Creek Road exit, according to South Metro Fire Rescue and the Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office.
Before winning election to the Senate in 2018, Winter, a former environmental nonprofit director, served two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives.
She served as chair of the Senate’s Transportation and Energy Committee, spearheading efforts to modernize Colorado transportation funding, expand public transit investments and reduce vehicle pollution. She was a co-sponsor of House Bill 19-1261, a landmark 2019 climate action law that established the state’s first statutory greenhouse gas reduction targets.
“Words cannot express how deeply heartbroken we are tonight as Colorado mourns the loss of an exceptional legislator, a champion for working people, and a steadfast defender of our environment and abortion rights,” Colorado House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat, and House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat, said in a statement.
Senate President James Coleman and Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, both Denver Democrats, called Winter “a dedicated public servant whose commitment to the people of Colorado never wavered.”
Senator Winter was a colleague whose presence brought warmth and an invaluable perspective to the Capitol. We will miss her leadership, her partnership, and her deep commitment to a brighter Colorado,” Coleman and Rodriguez said. “Our hearts are with Senator Winter’s family and friends as they navigate this unimaginable loss.”

Gators are ""part of what makes Florida Florida,"" said author Rebecca Renner.The Pilgrims were idiots. If they had just taken a sharp left at Plymouth Rock and sailed southward for another 500 miles, they could have spent that first winter luxuriating at a hotel in St. Augustine.
The Spanish settlers in St. Augustine had beaten them to the New World by more than 50 years. They’d also beaten the Pilgrims to the idea of holding a Thanksgiving feast.
The original celebrants were Spanish explorers and Native Soon-To-Be-Americans, and instead of turkey, they dined on salt pork and garbanzo beans. Then they probably got into an argument over whether that one side dish should be called “stuffing” or “dressing.”
Because of that history, I always think of Thanksgiving as the most Florida of the holidays and always look for something we should all be thankful for.
This isn’t easy to do these days amid exorbitant grocery prices, skyrocketing insurance rates, and widespread political insanity: “Hey, let’s revive the reputation of Red Scare bully Joe McCarthy while the president has a lovefest with a guy he says is a communist!”
But if you look for blessings, you’ll find them, sometimes in the most unlikely places. Today, I want to tell you why we should all be thankful for alligators.
No, not the college football team that’s 3-8. I mean our official state reptile that lurks in every body of water in Florida that’s larger than a mud puddle.
Some people find them terrifying because of their role as predators in the whole “Circle of Life” thing. But I’m here to tell you that alligators have many admirable qualities. For instance, they’re our first line of defense against the pythons invading the Everglades.
And I know of three instances in which alligators helped the cops nab fleeing suspects. Talk about taking a bite out of crime!
What’s most amazing, though, is that there was a time when they were on the endangered species list.
And now they may wind up saving us.
Trading gator for beer
Gators “are part of what makes Florida Florida,” said Rebecca Renner, who wrote the riveting true-crime book “Gator Country” about a particularly wild gator poaching case.
Rebecca Renner via Goodreads
Gators are so identified with the state, she said, that “a lot of people who come here want to see them.” That’s why we have such thriving attractions as Gatorland and the St. Augustine Alligator Farm.
Fueling their fascination with gators is the fact that a lot of the wacky Florida man and woman stories you see are also Florida gator stories.
“Florida man tries trading gator for beer.” “Forida woman fights to keep her pet alligator who wears clothes and rides an ATV.” “Florida woman pulls alligator out of pants during traffic stop.” That last one, which involved turtle smuggling, inspired Dave Barry and Carl Hiaasen to write a lovely song called, “She Had Turtles in Her Trunk and a Reptile in Her Pants.”
Probably the best-known one happened in 2016, when a 24-year-old Florida man pulled up to a Wendy’s in Royal Palm Beach and tossed an alligator through the drive-thru window. He did it as a prank, but the drive-thru clerk was not amused. She was so terrified she dove out through the same window by which the 3-foot gator entered.
My favorite part of the story is that the guy was charged with assault with a deadly weapon — to wit, the gator.
The first biologist to study gators would have been on the drive-thru clerk’s side.
Slaughter for fun and fashion
Pioneering naturalist William Bartram, who visited Florida in the 1770s, was the first scientist to document alligators’ behavior. He was clearly scared of them, considering them man-eating monsters.
William Bartram via Independence National Historical Park Collection
There were a lot of gators back then, he reported: “The alligators were in such incredible numbers, and so close together from shore to shore, that it would have been easy to have walked across on their heads, had the animals been harmless.”
When he tried fishing, a congregation (yes, that’s the word) of gators went after his boat, he wrote.
“I was attacked on all sides,” Bartram wrote.  “… Two very large ones attacked me closely, at the same instant, rushing up with their heads and part of their bodies above the water, roaring terribly and belching floods of water over me.”
When another one attacked later, he dispatched it with a single shot to the head. After that, Bartram would as soon shoot gators as look at them.

Lots of other Florida tourists reacted the same way. From the 1800s to the 1960s, there was a wholesale slaughter. An incredible number of nitwit Northerners thought that no vacation in Florida was complete unless they’d bagged a gator or twelve.
Some of the shooting was for fun. Some was for fashion.
An 1893 federal fisheries report found that gator hides had become a highly lucrative industry, with Florida the center of the trade. The report figured 2.5 million hides had been shipped out of the state since 1880. Two Jacksonville firms handled more than 60,000 skins in a single year.
The alligator was being ‘‘systematically and relentlessly hunted in nearly every part of Florida,’’ the report noted, predicting that it was ‘‘only a question of time when this valuable fishery resource will become exhausted.’’
Saving the species
Five decades ago, when a Florida man named Nathaniel Reed worked as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior, he changed the nation.
This is a different kind of Florida man story than you’re used to.

Reed had spent his childhood collecting butterflies, jotting notes on all the birds he saw around Jupiter, and fishing in Hobe Sound. He loved fishing so much, his mother joked that he emerged from the womb carrying a fly rod.
The grown-up Reed was alarmed by reports of wildlife disappearing around America. He gathered a group of like-minded federal officials at a Chinese restaurant in Washington. Between egg rolls and moo goo gai pan, they jotted down the wording for what would become the Endangered Species Act.
The bill passed Congress by a nearly unanimous vote in 1973 and was signed into law by Reed’s Republican boss, Richard Nixon.
“We had the fervor of youth and a sense of high ethical standards for how man should treat his fellow creatures on spaceship Earth,” Reed told me years later.
The earliest list of endangered species included several well-known Florida critters, including the panther, the manatee, and — believe it or not — the alligator.
As difficult as it may be to imagine, we nearly had a Florida without alligators. Frankly, that wouldn’t be much like the Florida we know and love, would it?
The gator renaissance
The comeback began with the state and federal government setting aside places for the gators to exist undisturbed by intrusive humans, Renner said.
State parks like Hillsborough River and Highlands Hammock, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, as well as Everglades National Park, opened in 1947, gave the gators to live and thrive in their native habitat.
Then, in the 1970s, under what became known as the Clean Water Act, developers began to think twice (at least at first) about whether they should wipe out wetlands to build houses, stores, and offices. That, too, benefited the gators.
“They’re very resilient animals,” Renner said. “Their comeback helps us be hopeful for other animals to do the same.”
The gators’ revival also helped other animals that depend on them, she pointed out. Gators dig holes that become wet refuges for fish, turtles, and frogs during droughts.
The gator renaissance is now in full swing. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission estimates we have more than 1 million roaming through all 67 Florida counties.
We have so many gators that the FWC has launched a Statewide Nuisance Alligator Program, or SNAP for short, to trap the ones that cause trouble. If anyone tells you bureaucrats have no sense of humor, tell ’em about SNAP.
But the programs that brought the gators back from the edge of extinction have now themselves become endangered.
The real predators
Last week, the Trump Administration proposed major rollbacks for both the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.
For the Clean Water Act, his Environmental Protection Agency said it would redefine what’s protected to “exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of all wetlands nationwide,” The New York Times reported.
So much for sparing all that gator habitat. Looks like it’s going to be covered by asphalt now.
As for the Endangered Species Act, his Interior Department announced several proposed changes to such things as “critical habitat” and other aspects of the law.
The most radical change calls for counting economic impact, instead of only focusing on what the science says about protecting an endangered species. Up until now, science alone determined whether a species was endangered. Not anymore.
“For example, if the Trump administration determined that the economic harm to a golf course would be greater than protections for the Florida panther, then they could make that determination,” Susan Holmes, executive director of the Endangered Species Coalition, told ABC News. “It would essentially potentially put money over the science.”
The folks who are applauding this are the folks who would make a quick buck by destroying wetlands and wildlife habitat — the homebuilders, the real estate moguls, the big-money developers. You know, the real predators.
But what’s happened recently with the gators shows that we humans have no idea how economically valuable our wildlife can be when we preserve it.
In the blood
Biologist Kent Vliet became fascinated by gators when he first got to Gainesville. At the University of Florida, the young grad student was dispatched to study the mating habits of alligators.

To do that, Vliet traveled to the St. Augustine Alligator Farm and talked to the staff. He wanted to tag their gators so he could observe them. A staffer helped him lasso them, tie them up, weigh them, and attach an identification marker to their tails.
“The biggest one I’d ever grabbed before then was 4 feet,” Vliet said. “There were some 11-footers in there. … When we lassoed one, I’d jump on the back of the animal to restrain it and tape its jaws up.”
Adrenaline roaring through his veins, Vliet became hooked on working with gators. That was in 1980, and 45 years later he’s still at it. He’s even written a book: “Alligators: The Illustrated Guide to Their Biology, Behavior, and Conservation.”
What Vliet has been working on in the last few years struck me as particularly fascinating. He’s been collecting alligator blood for scientists studying its special properties.
Turns out gators have a superpower.
“You often see gators living in some pretty grody habitat with a huge open wound,” he explained. “Then it just heals up, and they go back to living their life.”
Their amazing healing ability comes from substances in the gators’ blood known as peptides. Scientists at George Mason University have been trying to identify those antiviral peptides, then extract and isolate them.
So far, they’ve found there could be thousands, each targeted to block a different strain of bacteria, Vliet said. Their goal is to figure out how to use those peptides to protect us humans from infections, too, including from COVID and HIV.
“And all from an animal that a lot of people wish didn’t even exist,” Vliet said.
So, say a prayer of thanks today that we saved the alligators, because now they’re likely to save us — assuming we can keep them around a while longer.
But with this proposed rollback of the laws that led to the gators’ revival, I have to wonder what we might lose if they go away again. And what other critters have superpowers that could help us if we take better care of their habitat?

Each nomination will become effective if at least five of the Senate’s nine other Republicans approve them. Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, said the votes will take place by secret ballot at 10 a.m. Saturday in Anchorage.
“Honestly, I think both of them are excellent candidates,” Stevens said on Wednesday, adding that he expects both to be confirmed.
If Rauscher and Tilton are confirmed, their House seats would become vacant, and Dunleavy would be required to appoint replacements within 30 days of their resignations. 
The two Senate seats became vacant after Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned to run for lieutenant governor and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned to run for governor.

Dunleavy’s picks were due no more than 30 days after their resignations, but he acted earlier, which will allow the replacement legislators to take office before the regular legislative session convenes in January.
“I can’t think of two Alaskans more qualified and committed to public service to serve in the Alaska Senate than Representatives Rauscher and Tilton,” Dunleavy said in a statement announcing the selections. “I have known and worked with both for as long as I have been in public office and I look forward to working collaboratively with them as senators. I also want to thank the local Republican district committees for taking the time to meet, deliberate, and send forward names for these seats. This process works best when the people closest to the communities are involved.”
Tilton, first elected to the House in 2014, was Speaker of the House from 2023 through 2024. Reached by phone on Wednesday in the middle of Thanksgiving shopping, she referred to a statement on her Facebook page.
“I look forward to collaborating with my Senate colleagues to advance sensible policy solutions, foster an energy renaissance, and usher in an era of renewed prosperity for all Alaskans,” the statement said in part.

Rauscher said he’s already at work on a letter thanking Dunleavy for his appointment, but he declined to say what he thinks his confirmation chances are.
“It’s an honor,” Rauscher said of the appointment, “and I feel like it was quite the undertaking — the process — and to have it this close to seeing what the final outcome is, is always a relief in some ways, but it’s also very exciting that I am this close. So I appreciate the fact that the governor did consider me and thought highly enough of me to appoint me.”
Several senators said they expect Rauscher and Tilton to be confirmed, but each declined to say how he or she will vote, citing the need to work with them regardless.
Of the nine Republican senators who will be voting on this weekend’s confirmations, five are members of the Senate’s bipartisan majority caucus, and four are members of the Senate’s all-Republican minority.
Shower and Hughes were members of the House minority, and their replacements are expected to be as well.
Stevens said he’s conducting the confirmation vote by secret ballot in order to avoid the possibility of hurt feelings.
“I don’t want to have anybody have bad feelings when we start working together in January,” he said.
Stevens said he wants to give the House’s replacement process as much time as possible, since that will involve the appointment of two people new to the Legislature who will need to hire staff and uproot their lives in order to arrive in Juneau in January and be ready to work.
“I just want to make sure the House has all the time they need,” he said.

The North […],"North Carolina Republican legislative leaders approved a new congressional map that aims to flip a Democratic seat represented by Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) (Source: ncleg.gov)North Carolina Republican lawmakers prevailed Wednesday on a preliminary injunction that would have blocked a 2026 congressional map redrawn to favor the GOP.
The redrawn map is GOP lawmakers’ response to President Donald Trump’s push to change voting maps across the country to help Republicans retain control of the U.S. House in 2026.
The North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause of North Carolina and a group of voters identified as the Williams plaintiffs had argued that a 2026 congressional map passed by the General Assembly last month reflects unconstitutional racial discrimination.
They alleged that changes to the 1st Congressional District dismantled a region known as the Black Belt, a region spanning many counties whose voters have elected a Black member of Congress for more than 50 years.
A three-judge panel — Fourth Circuit Judge Allison J. Rushing and the Middle District’s Chief Judge Richard Myers and Judge Thomas Schroeder, all appointed by Republican presidents — found that while the plaintiffs “have shown a disparate impact on black voters, they have not demonstrated that this effect likely reflects discriminatory intent.”
The judges determined that there was not enough evidence to provide a “clear showing” that the racial discrimination claim is likely to succeed. The new congressional map will therefore go into effect even as the lawsuit continues.
In a statement on social media, Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) took a victory lap, praising North Carolina Republicans who “went to work to protect the America First Agenda.”
“North Carolinians voted to send President Trump to the White House in 2016, 2020, and 2024, and this new map reflects that support,” Berger wrote. “President Trump deserves a Congress that will fight for American citizens and move his agenda forward. Today’s decision thwarts the radical left’s latest attempt to circumvent the will of the people.”
The plaintiffs and their attorneys said the ruling is highly damaging to democracy.
“We’re disappointed in the court’s decision today,” said Common Cause NC Executive Director Bob Phillips. “This ruling gives blessing to what will be the most gerrymandered congressional map in state history, a map that intentionally retaliates against voters in eastern North Carolina for supporting a candidate not preferred by the majority party.”
Hilary Harris Klein, lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said the courts must live up to their responsibility to “protect voters and the right to dissent.”
“These mid-decade redistricting battles are tearing our democracy apart,” she said in a statement. “If politicians want to keep their majority in any legislative body, our Constitution should require them to do it by earning votes, not by silencing the voices of communities they disagree with after every election.”
The victory for Republicans stands in contrast to a recent ruling in Texas, the largest battleground over mid-decade redistricting, where Trump appointee Judge Jeffrey Brown found that “substantial evidence shows that Texas racially gerrymandered the 2025 Map.” (That map, too, remains in effect after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito paused the lower court ruling as litigation continues.)
North Carolina’s new map is expected to eliminate Congressman Don Davis (D-N.C.), one of three Black members of Congress from the state, resulting in an 11-3 Republican majority in the state’s delegation.

Thousands of Vermonters face the loss of Medicare Advantage plans and must navigate through a muddle of insurance regulations before open enrollment ends on December 7.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Medicare Advantage plans are leaving Vermont. Now what?.","Bouncing from plan to plan for Medicare coverage has become an inadvertent, annual tradition for Becky Beerwald.
When she moved to Essex Junction from the Connecticut coast in 2023, she selected a Medicare Advantage plan before it was discontinued for the following year. Then she enrolled in a Vermont Blue Advantage plan, only for the insurer to announce in October that it would not offer the plans in 2026. This fall, she went back to the drawing board but in an insurance landscape almost entirely stripped of the Medicare Advantage plans that nearly 51,000 people in the state had relied on. 
Beerwald is just one of the thousands of Vermonters trying to make sense of the coverage that remains available now that Medicare Advantage has essentially left the state.

This year’s open enrollment period for Medicare, which runs through Dec. 7, has been a “challenging one,” said Sam Carleton, who directs the State Health Insurance Program, a state entity that provides guidance for Medicare beneficiaries. The small office has been flooded with inquiries since the start of October, when BlueCross Blue Shield and United Healthcare’s departures from the Advantage market became public. Agewell, the elderly support agency Carleton leads in Northwestern Vermont has also seen a surge in interest for the webinars they offer to explain how Medicare works and how people can get the coverage they need under it.
Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people 65 and older and those with certain disabilities. 
Medicare has four parts: Part A covers inpatient care while Part B broadly covers outpatient care, medical devices and preventative care, among other things. Together, these two are regarded as original Medicare. It generally covers 80% of the cost of services, meaning many people who opt for traditional Medicare coverage also opt for something known as a Medigap plan, or supplemental insurance, sold by a private insurer that can help cover the remaining 20% of costs. 
Medicare Part D offers prescription drug coverage, which is also provided by a private insurer. 
Part C plans bundle all of that — and often include additional benefits like dental, or vision. These plans, known as Medicare Advantage plans, are offered by private insurers. 
While many people like their Advantage plans, others can feel trapped in them because they require approval before covering some drugs and services and often require people to see in-network providers.
When the insurers providing Medicare Advantage plans in Vermont announced the end to their coverage, it gave some people a welcomed exit ramp from plans that are otherwise difficult to leave, explained Kaj Samsom, the commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation, the state office that regulates insurers.
“This event, as really truly unfortunate as it is for folks who are no longer in Medicare Advantage and no longer have other options, there are some people who are probably happy,” Samsom said.

When an insurer withdraws a plan, it triggers something called a special enrollment period, which comes with different privileges than the regular open enrollment period.
In particular, it means people searching for new plans get something called “Guaranteed Issue Rights.” These rights mean that insurance companies cannot charge someone more for their insurance based on pre-existing health conditions — things like diabetes or cancer — that would make care more expensive for the insurer to pay out. 
When someone is new to Medicare and enrolling for the first time, they are also protected from this type of underwriting. But after that initial enrollment, Medigap plans can reject or charge sicker patients more based on their health history. Samsom referred to this as the “one way street” of Medicare Advantage, where individuals can’t switch to traditional Medicare without the massive cost of a Medigap supplement plan looming over them.
Now, nearly all Vermonters who bought Medicare Advantage plans will need to opt into original Medicare, with the option to buy the supplemental Medigap plans — protected from underwriting during this special enrollment. 
The issue of underwriting became particularly concerning to Beerwald. As she scoured the best Medigap plan, she said some insurers asked for her health history, despite her guaranteed issue rights. 
When open enrollment began, Beerwald said she started calling the insurers offering the least expensive Medigap plans for 2026: Medco, State Farm and Aflac. 
Each insurer offers a selection of Medigap plans: A, B, C,  D, F, G. These letter plans are standardized, so that plans with the same letter include the same benefits, no matter which insurer sells them. Price should be the only difference. 
Beerwald said she wants a G plan because it offers the best coverage with the most diverse beneficiary pool — because of a 2015 law, people who became eligible for Medicare after 2020 can’t buy Medigap plans C or F. That restriction effectively leaves plans’ pool older. Plans D and G now offer similar coverage, without the age restriction.

“My mother lived until almost 102 my dad was 87, so I’ve got a long life ahead of me,” Beerwald said. “I don’t want to be in the older pool, I want to be in the younger pool.” 
She said she worries that as the pools under plans C and F grow older and smaller over time, their premiums will soar or the plans could disappear altogether. 
“I don’t want to be in the lurch again. I want to be in the popular plan with the popular kids,” she said. 
Insurers she found that honored the guaranteed issue rights for plan G charged higher premiums. She did notice, however, that insurers would honor these rights for C and F plans. 
Eventually, she bought a TVHP Medigap Blue Plan G from BlueCross BlueShield of VT, for about $258 per month, she said.
Still, the fact that she encountered some insurers who would not honor the guaranteed issue for every letter plan conflicted with her understanding of how the law should protect that right.
Beerwald’s quest to understand and rectify this issue offers a window onto the maelstrom that can arise when private insurers are tasked with delivering a government service. She said she reached out to the state office tasked with regulating insurers, their consumer protection line, U.S. Rep. Becca Balint’s office, SHIP and Carleton, in an attempt to make sense of it all.
“I certainly feel that frustration. I mean, you’re in a circumstance where you’ve lost your insurance, you received notice from the federal government that you are getting a special enrollment period, and you’re able to get another plan. You’ve done the legwork. … You’ve made a choice, and you then call this insurance company, those insurance companies say sure we’ll sell you a policy, but only if you send us all your medical records. That stinks,” Carleton said.  
However, Carleton and the Department of Regulation told Beerwald — and confirmed to VTDigger — that it is legal for insurers to not apply guaranteed issue rights to every letter plan. 
It comes down to one small matter of wording in the regulation that applies to Medigap plans:  “It’s a ‘must’ for (plans) A, B, C, F,” Department of Regulation Deputy Commissioner Mary Block said. “It’s a ‘may’ for G, for people before that 2020 date.” 
“So some insurance companies will offer it, some will not,” she added.  
There’s nothing the state can do to rectify this frustration, according to Block, since federal law dictates Medigap plan regulations. 
“In Vermont, we don’t have the discretion to say Plan G is always going to be available to everybody,” she said. 
Block added that other consumers have run into confusion when dealing with insurance brokers, who may not be aware of which customers are receiving guaranteed issue rights and may mix up forms. 
The best way to combat that, Samson said, is for people to advocate for themselves and make it very clear when they are on the phone that they need the guaranteed issue rights. 
Beerwald remains unsatisfied with their explanation.
Now, the only remaining Medicare Advantage plans in the state are Humana plans in six counties — including Orange, Windham and Windsor, where many of the available care comes from providers in the Dartmouth Health network. However, Dartmouth Health has long been out of network for Humana. During a Nov. 19 town hall with the Vermont congressional delegation, Balint raised particular concern over this and cautioned beneficiaries in those counties to choose new plans.
Carleton assured that even in the counties where Humana remains, if people have lost their other Advantage plan, they should still receive guaranteed issue rights for Medigap plans if they chose to buy one and opt into original Medicare. 
“What prompts the special enrollment period is your plan leaving, not necessarily the loss of all Medicare Advantage plans,” he said. 
Carleton said he worries about the overall sticker shock that comes with Medigap plans, and  fears some people will opt into original Medicare and forgo supplemental plans, leaving them vulnerable to the 20% of costs that original Medicare doesn’t cover.
Beerwald said she’s going to end up paying more than $7,500 for insurance this year. After her Medigap plan, she said she’s buying a drug plan, vision and hearing plans, as well as a dental plan, to cover the cost of extensive dental work she needs 
She said she worries not just for herself but for other older adults who are not as savvy as navigating all the pitfalls of the insurance system. But for now, she is locked in to her BlueCross BlueShield’s plan for at least a year and whatever 2026 may have in store.

(Courtesy of Washington State Budget and Policy Center)Democratic state lawmakers are once again eyeing a statewide version of a Seattle tax on companies with large payrolls and high-paid employees.
Proposed legislation crafted by Rep. Shaun Scott, D-Seattle, aims to raise more than $2 billion a year. His idea is for this money to go to education, health care and human service programs facing steep reductions in federal funding under the Republican-backed “Big, Beautiful Bill” President Donald Trump signed into law this year.
Scott will discuss his proposal at a news conference Tuesday. Representatives of the Washington Federation of State Employees, Service Employees International Union and pro-tax groups will join the first-term Democratic Socialist legislator.
His is the latest salvo — and likely not the last — in a tax debate expected to dominate the 2026 session that begins Jan. 12. 
Senate Democrats are drawing up designs for a possible income tax on millionaire-earners and reigniting talks on a so-called wealth tax that made it through the chamber on the final day of last session. All this because the state’s budget continues to face a shortfall and many Democrats are wary of going much further with cuts.
Republicans are slamming Scott’s proposal, arguing it will drive businesses from the state and hurt wages. They point to billions in new taxes Democrats pushed through the Legislature this year. 
Scott said his idea would help budget writers by making sure there is a stream of revenue to backfill what the federal government takes away.
Though there’s been some paring of federal resources already, he said action is needed this session because deeper cuts arrive in 2027 and 2028. Absent proactive measures by the Legislature, thousands of residents will find themselves facing greater food insecurity, less access to health care and higher costs for education, he said.
Scott’s legislation is modeled on Seattle’s JumpStart payroll expense tax and is similar to the approach Senate Democrats proposed this year but discarded in favor of other new taxes to help erase a multi-billion dollar shortfall in the state budget.
This year’s bill, Senate Bill 5796,  would remove the cap on employer payroll taxes and impose a new 5% tax on payroll expenses above the Social Security threshold of $176,100 per year. Companies with $7 million or more in payroll expenses would be subject to the tax. Those already paying the Seattle levy would be exempt.
Sen. Rebecca Saldana, D-Seattle, sponsored the bill, which is still alive heading into the 2026 session. As written it would raise about $2 billion a year, per a fiscal analysis.
How the new proposal would work
Scott’s bill would create the “Well Washington Fund” to “maintain the economic health” of the state, according to a draft of the legislation.
If passed and signed into law, it would take effect July 1, 2026 and generate an estimated $2.2 billion a year, Scott said.
It targets private employers whose workers earn more than $125,000 a year. It would impose a 5% tax on payroll expenses above that salary threshold. Companies with more than 50 workers, payroll in excess of $7 million and gross receipts of more than $5 million would pay the tax, he said.
Businesses may not deduct from employee wages to pay this tax. Like the Senate bill, if the firm already pays the Seattle levy, it would be exempt from this one, Scott said.
Roughly 4,300 businesses would be covered, he said. The state’s largest health care and social services providers would likely be exempt, Scott added.

His proposal directs all money collected in the first year into the general fund, the main account used to support public schools and state government operations. Starting the second year, 51% of the tax receipts would go into the Well Washington account and 49% into the general fund.
Expenditures from the new account would be limited to higher education, health care, especially Medicaid, cash assistance programs, and energy and housing programs.
A 25-member oversight board — of which 20 would be lawmakers — would be created. Its role would be to make recommendations to legislative budget committees on where money in the Well Washington account would be best spent. 

‘Wrong approach’
A top House Republican on Wednesday called the proposal the wrong approach to a serious problem and warned it could drive businesses out of state and hurt the state’s economy.
“You’re destroying your own tax base,” said Rep. Chris Corry, R-Yakima, the deputy leader of the House Republican Caucus. “If you want to incentivize businesses to pay people less money, this is it. In the long run, I think it will cost the state more than it makes.”
Corry chided Democrats’ pursuit of a new business tax so soon after enacting a raft of them earlier this year.

The union has asked Washington County court to block Vermont from ordering its employees back to the office on December 1. A ruling is expected Wednesday or Friday.

Attorneys for the state of Vermont and for the Vermont State Employees’ Association argued in court Wednesday whether a judge should prevent the upcoming return-to-office mandate for state employees. 
Gov. Phil Scott has ordered state employees to return to in-person work at least three days a week starting Dec. 1. But the state employees union has fought back in multiple venues. Earlier this month, it filed charges with the state Labor Relations Board and sued the state to demand an injunction until the labor board could rule on the case.
Washington County Superior Court Justice Dan Richardson said the matter would come down to a few key questions: whether he had statutory authority to issue an injunction, and whether the mandate constituted an “irreparable harm” that required him to intervene before the board’s decision could be made.

Union attorney Alfred O’Connell said the mandate could force dozens of state employees to relocate closer to their designated work location. He gave the example of a breastfeeding mother who would be forced to commute three hours each way to work in person. 
“She would be required to breast pump, or take her child with her on a six-hour commute,” he said. 
Attorneys for the state pushed back, arguing that the state has provided a way for employees to request an exemption based on their individual circumstances. 
“That mother and many other state employees would receive careful, individualized attention, and none would be facing a Dec. 1 deadline,” state’s attorney Peter Sterling said.

The two parties went back and forth over whether the exemptions policy was sufficient to prevent the irreparable harm question. At one point, Sean Brown, deputy director of the Agency of Administration, was called to testify on the details of the exemptions. He told the court that, out of the more than 8,000 state employees, approximately 425 had asked for an exemption. So far, only 25 of those requests had been reviewed and none had been denied. 
Sterling also argued that Vermont has a public interest in ordering state employees to the office “to provide for Vermonters the services they expect,” adding that the executive branch has the authority to decide on the best use of taxpayer money.
O’Connell shot back that the state was investing millions of taxpayer dollars in reclaiming office space for in-person work. 
“The whole thing smacks of the governor being over his skis, making a decision on the fly, and now here we are trying to clean up that mess,” he said.

But Richardson said he can’t base his ruling on that aspect of their arguments. 
“I understand attorney O’Connell’s arguments and passion,” he said. “Ultimately the Labor Relations Board has to make that determination, and this court isn’t really a position of posture or proclivity to make the movement on the policy choices that the executive branch made.”
As the hearing wrapped up, Richardson said he was unlikely to grant a very broad injunction, given the legal limitations of the court’s jurisdiction. He contemplated a narrower injunction that simply prevented people with hardships from being fired while the labor board deliberated. 
“At the same time, I think it’s fair to both sides for the court to go through these arguments a little bit further,” he said.

He said he hoped to have a decision made by the end of the day on Wednesday or on Friday. 
“I recognize there are a number of individuals making plans and expectations” based on this decision, he said.

(Photo by Thomas Quinn/University of Washington, provided by the Environmental Protection Agency)Fishery biologists expect another strong year for sockeye salmon in southwestern Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, site of the world’s largest runs of the fish, also known as red salmon.
Next year’s run is not expected to equal the magnitude of the huge runs in some recent record-breaking and near-record years, however, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s preseason forecast.
The forecast, released earlier this month, predicts a return of 45.32 million Bristol Bay sockeye salmon next year, enough to support a harvest of 33.5 million fish.
This year’s Bristol Bay run totaled 56.7 million fish, and the harvest totaled 41.2 million fish. The record highs were set in 2022, when a run of 79 million sockeye salmon supported a harvest of just over 60 million fish.
If the 2026 forecast proves to be accurate, that would place next year’s Bristol Bay sockeye run below the last 10 years’ average of 61 million fish but above the long-term average of 37.4 million fish, the department said in its statement.
While the 2026 sockeye run forecast is for 45.32 million fish, the run size could be as low as 31.12 million and as high as 59.52 million, according to the department’s calculations.
The forecast is based on an analysis of the four age classes of sockeye salmon tied to Bristol Bay’s nine different river systems, past run histories and other factors. Age classes are split by years spent in freshwater and in the ocean. Bristol Bay sockeye spend one to two years in freshwater and two to three years in the ocean.
There is a caveat to the department’s preseason prediction: Forecasting salmon returns is “inherently difficult and uncertain,” said the department’s statement.
The methodology the state uses has generally worked well for the most part, the statement said, but in the past two decades, forecasts have underestimated Bristol Bay’s sockeye returns by 14% on average. Since 2014, each year’s actual return has exceeded the state’s preseason forecast.
Observed Bristol Bay sockeye salmon returns from 2006 to 2024 are compared to preseason Alaska Department of Fish and Game forecasts, with 80% intervals shown. In most years, observed runs exceeded preseason forecasts. The department has forecast a 2026 run of 45.32 million fish, with a range of 31.12 million to 59.52 million.

The percentage of international tourists to the world’s first national park has dropped by half over six years, raising questions about the new surcharge revenue.
The post New $100 fee on Yellowstone, Grand Teton’s foreign visitors brings uncertain impacts appeared first on WyoFile .","A new $100 surcharge on foreign visitors at select national parks raises a suite of questions regarding how much revenue the fees will generate, an economic consultant in Jackson Hole said Wednesday.
The Department of Interior announced the new fee Tuesday, sparking speculation about how much money it will raise and whether it might further curtail international travel to the federal preserves and the gateway communities like Jackson and Cody whose economies run on tourism.
The fee will be imposed in 2026 on each foreign visitor to Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in Wyoming. The surcharge will also apply to Yosemite, Glacier, Rocky Mountain, Grand Canyon, Zion, Everglades, Acadia, Bryce Canyon and Sequoia & Kings Canyon national parks in other states.
Secretary of Interior Doug Burgum said the fees put American families first. Americans will continue to enjoy affordable access, he said in a statement, “while international visitors [will] contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
Yellowstone counted 4.7 million visitors in 2024, down from a high of 4.8 million in 2021.
What impact the surcharge will have on national parks’ revenues, which individual parks retain, is uncertain, especially in light of declining international visitation. Between 2018 and 2024, foreign visitation to Yellowstone dropped from about 30% of total visitors to 14.8%, according to the park’s statistics.
“To me the interesting question is what happened between 2018-2024 that cut international visitation. Why would international visitation fall in half?” Jonathan Schechter
As President Donald Trump’s administration curtails visas, angers Canadians by proclaiming that country should become the 51st U.S. state, imposes tariffs and takes other actions, fewer tourists may want to visit the U.S., said Jonathan Schechter, an economic consultant and a member of the Jackson Town Council.
“We’re already seeing a big drop,” Schechter said, even before Trump took office. In 2018, Yellowstone attracted 1.2 million foreign visitors, he said, citing park figures. In 2024, that number was down to 712,089.
What’s going to happen, he mused about foreign tourists, if in 2026 “they’re not feeling welcome?”
$55 million for Yellowstone?
The fee, long touted by the Property and Environmental Research Council, a Montana-based nonprofit focused on environmental conservation, will boost Yellowstone’s revenues substantially, said Brian Yablonski, the organization’s CEO.
“A $100 international visitor surcharge could generate $55 million annually at Yellowstone National Park alone, more than quadrupling that park’s revenue to address deteriorating trails, failing wastewater systems, and crumbling bridges,” he said in a statement. He referenced a 2025 study by Stephen C. Newbold, an associate professor at the Department of Economics at the University of Wyoming.
“I calculated the relative changes in visits and revenues over a wide range of entrance fees using the averaged travel costs,” Newbold wrote, “which revealed that a surcharge would need to be increased beyond $200 per visitor before revenues would decline.”
The analysis probes visitors’ spending “elasticity,” which is their response to a price increase. Entrance fees make up a small portion of the money a foreign traveler will spend on a visit to America’s national parks, he notes.
Leon Mooijan and his family traveled from the Netherlands to rent a mobile home to tour Yellowstone as part of a five-week trip across the U.S. in 2022. (Angus M. Thuermer, Jr./WyoFile)
Newbold wrote that his study has limitations because it used data from 2016 and 2018 and lacked critical information from a 2024 visitor survey. Also, the words “tariffs” and “visas” do not appear in Newbold’s 23-page paper titled “The price elasticity of the demand for visits to Yellowstone National Park.”
That suggests the research stopped short of accounting for overall international tourism trends to the U.S. Additional research could develop “more robust models of international visitor demand,” he wrote.
Today, it costs $35 per vehicle to enter Yellowstone for a week. The average vehicle carries between 2.1 and 2.8 passengers, according to Yellowstone statistics. The number varies according to entrance station and season, Yellowstone’s visitor use reporting and counting instructions state.
Shechter made some calculations using Yellowstone figures and some estimates. Those include an estimated 5% visitation growth from 2024-2026 and an average of 2.5 visitors per vehicle.
Under that scenario, if the percentage of foreign visitors to Yellowstone remains at 15%, the park would see foreign entrance fee revenues increase from $9.9 million a year to $85.2 million if the surcharges are factored in.
That’s an increase of $75.2 million.
He offered other scenarios. If international visitation in 2026 drops to 8% of all Yellowstone visitors (“all” being 5% more than the 2024 total visitation figure), the new fee would generate an additional $32.6 million.
If international visitation dropped to 1% of visitors in 2026, the park would receive $5.6 million from foreigners. That would be a drop of $4.2 million in foreign visitor entrance revenue compared to 2024.
Changing trends
Elasticity aside, the huge variable that remains is whether foreigners will be discouraged from visiting the U.S. because of the Trump administration’s foreign, immigration, visa and trade policies.
“To me the interesting question is what happened between  2018-2024 that cut international visitation,” he said. “Why would international visitation fall in half?”
Was it COVID, he wondered, or a slow recovery from that pandemic? Will it be harder to get a visa to visit the U.S. in 2026? How will international visitors react to perceived American hostility toward some foreigners?
Things have changed.
Eight years ago, Schechter said, there were planeloads of visitors from Shanghai landing in Salt Lake City, loading buses and touring Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks. It is much rarer to see a coach full of foreigners wending its way through Jackson, Grand Teton and Yellowstone roads today.
The affordable American national park vacation may be becoming less affordable too, Schechter said.
“Most of the consumer spending going on right now in the U.S. is coming from the ultra-wealthy,” he said. “People who are in the middle, lower [income strata] are not spending. Those are the bulk of the people visiting Yellowstone and Grand Teton.”
Lodging revenue “has been saving the bacon of the local taxable economy,” Schechter said. In Jackson, hotels have “raised their rates, and there hasn’t been pushback yet.”
If that trend continues “that just adds even more cost to the price of a vacation,” he said. “How’s that going to affect us?

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Ethics Commission dismissed complaints against Lt. Gov. Leslie Rutledge and Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester, both Republicans, according to documents from the commission.
Rutledge and Jester did not violate the law pertaining to campaign contribution and expenditure reports in their candidacies for the 2026 election cycle, the commission agreed. Both decisions were 4-0 votes with one commissioner absent, according to letters Ethics Commission Director Graham Sloan sent to Rutledge and Jester on Friday.
Rutledge is seeking a second and final term as lieutenant governor, and Jester is running for commissioner of state lands.
ArkLeg Bill Tracker co-founder Janie Ginocchio filed the complaints in September, alleging that Rutledge and Jester filed incomplete and inaccurate campaign finance reports.
Ginocchio also filed complaints against Attorney General Tim Griffin, state Rep. David Ray, R-Maumelle, and state Sen. Ben Gilmore, R-Crossett, and political action committees associated with them. She alleged they all violated campaign contribution limits and prohibitions on illegal coordination of contributions, the use of public property for campaign purposes and public servants receiving outside payment for carrying out official duties.

Ray, Gilmore and Griffin all characterized the complaints as frivolous and politically motivated. The ethics commission has not yet ruled on the allegations.
Ginnochio accused Rutledge and Jester of violating the law mandating that campaign contribution and expenditure reports include the amount, date and recipients of campaign expenses over $100.
“While the original C&E reports in question include some expenditures without providing the ‘Description of Expenditure’ as requested on the report, a plain reading of [Arkansas law] does not require a description of an itemized expenditure to be provided,” Sloan wrote in both letters. “…Based upon the available facts and the applicable law, it appears the statutory filing requirements of these provisions have been fulfilled.”
Sloan acknowledged in his letters to Rutledge and Jester that since the complaints were filed, the two candidates have amended their contribution and expenditure reports for the sake of “transparency.”
The ethics commission also dismissed a complaint against Arkansas Association of Counties Executive Director Chris Villines, in his capacity as a member of the Arkansas Cyber Response Board. Ginnochio alleged that Villines failed to disclose business or holding information on a statement of financial interest for calendar year 2024.
Friday’s letter from Sloan to Villines about the dismissal incorrectly stated that the commission had issued Villines a public letter of caution. Sloan wrote in a follow-up letter on Tuesday that this language was incorrect and that he issued an amended letter with the language removed.
Sloan sent all three letters to Ginocchio in addition to the subjects of her complaints.
Jester told the Advocate he is “thankful for the role the Ethics Commission plays, not just in punishing bad actors, but in protecting good actors from inaccurate complaints.”

Garmatz United States Courthouse in Baltimore. District Judge Adam Abelson Wednesday granted a request to limit hunting while surveyors for a proposed power line are in the field.(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A federal judge in Baltimore ruled Wednesday that hunting should not be allowed to occur in the vicinity of surveyors while they conduct environmental studies for a proposed power line across rural parts of Central Maryland.
But in his order, Judge Adam B. Abelson said the restriction won’t take effect right away. He ordered the power line company, New Jersey-based PSEG Renewable Transmission, to coordinate with impacted landowners to develop a procedure for the hunting season that will “ensure the safety of PSEG’s surveyors while minimizing the intrusion upon Respondents’ rights to hunt on their properties.” The two side are to report back by Dec. 3.
Abelson’s ruling comes one day after a contentious hearing in Baltimore’s U.S. District Court between the two parties over hunting — and just a few days before the popular rifle hunting season for white-tailed deer is set to begin. It runs from Saturday through Dec. 13.

In his order, Abelson argued that neither the landowners nor the power company were perfectly in the right.
The power company wanted to ban hunting on any days when surveying might occur, but noted that it would attempt to make exceptions for landowners who reached out to share their hunting plans.
They argued that a blanket ban was needed because some landowners are not communicative, and others have made violent threats toward surveyors in the past. The Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, as the proposed line is known, has attracted considerable ire from residents in its path, who have pushed hard against its construction.
But attorneys for the landowners said that PSEG routinely issues notices to property holders that it could survey any time during a two-week period. If hunting were banned during that entire stretch, landowners could lose a substantial part of the hunting season, they argued.
On that point, Abelson agreed with the landowners.
“The Court concludes that hunting should be prohibited in areas where surveyors are working while a survey is occurring,” Abelson wrote in his order. “PSEG has not shown a basis for restricting hunting on non-survey days during the notice period.”
In a statement Wednesday, StopMPRP, a coalition of opponents that includes some of the landowners in the suit, said that Abelson’s ruling shows that PSEG is overreaching.
“The Court’s clarification today makes one thing unmistakably clear: this developer is pushing far beyond what Maryland’s laws and processes were designed to allow. PSEG continues to demand access to private land for a project that the State of Maryland has not approved, forcing families to absorb the consequences long before the Public Service Commission has completed its review.
The landowners argued that Abelson shouldn’t place any hunting restrictions at all, and that for many of them hunting is not just a sport, but is a way put food on the table and protect crops from ravenous deer. They argued that surveyors should wear bright colored orange or pink hunting gear, and that PSEG should give landowners 72 hours of notice about where and when they intend to survey, to allow hunters to prepare.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Abelson determined that solution would not do enough to protect the surveyors, who have a right to complete the studies, which will inform the Maryland Public Service Commission’s final decision on the proposed power line. Abelson did, however, require surveyors to wear the brightly-colored clothing during surveys that overlap with any Maryland hunting season.
His order also requires the opposing parties to submit, by Dec. 3, either joint or competing proposals for “how to effectuate” the hunting prohibitions “including timelines and specific information each party should be communicating to one another in order to limit hunting only to the extent necessary to protect the surveyors’ safety.”
“In the meantime, PSEG should continue coordinating with Respondents who reach out to provide them with information as to minimize the intrusion upon the use of their properties,” Abelson wrote.

(Photo by txking via Getty Images)Gov. Wes Moore’s September decision to close the aging Maryland Correctional Institute at Jessup, or MCIJ, was very good news. Why?  Because the state’s 12 other prisons don’t operate at full capacity.
With redistribution of correctional officers and incarcerated individuals, a smaller Maryland prison could work much more effectively. Our current arrangement is dangerously dysfunctional.
Maryland’s criminal justice system, in recent years, has see-sawed between tough-on-crime ideas, on one hand, that expand our prisons, and smarter ideas, on the other hand, that shrink the prisons – simultaneously, helping better to safeguard our communities.
Ten years ago, Maryland’s governor and legislators agreed on an important new bipartisan plan — the Justice Reinvestment Act (JRA). Study after study has shown that mere prison time does not reduce criminal activity upon release. So, JRA’s milestone, bipartisan plan aimed to shrink the state’s prison population and spend the tax savings on prevention measures proven to cut the crime rate.
Over the next few years, state prison populations shrank 23% and our crime rate dropped. But now, in the past two years, JRA’s plan faces a serious problem.
As of December 2024, Maryland’s prison administrators reported that they cannot hire correctional officers fast enough to replace those leaving (10.8% gap or 574 officers ). Completing fiscal year 2024, the population of incarcerated individuals was rising (a 3% rise or 560 more incarcerated people).  This is progress in the wrong direction.
Why should voters care? More than 90% of those in Maryland prisons will someday return to our communities. Their recidivism or law-abidingness correlate strongly to what happens while they are behind prison walls.

Those who complete their educations with GEDs or other degrees, those who learn marketable job skills, and those who get substance abuse treatment become much less likely to commit new offenses. Our communities get safer and healthier. And our taxpayer costs for prisons get smaller as prisons shrink.
But these protective measures (school, jobs, treatment — and more) all get canceled if there aren’t enough correctional officers to accompany  incarcerated individuals to prison classrooms.  As stated in Maryland prisons’ FY’26 budget overview, “CO [correctional officer] vacancies are particularly troubling as low staffing rates contribute to inmate idleness, safety risks, and a reduced emphasis on rehabilitation.”
For example, at Eastern Correctional Institute (ECI) this summer between late June and mid-September all prison classrooms were empty and prisoners  were locked in their cells nearly 23 hours per day, due to the shortage of correctional officers — while the temperatures regularly hit 100 degrees.
ECI isn’t the only Maryland prison with such problems.
There are proven, evidence-based solutions: One prison management system, used in seven other states (“Restoring Promise”), could reduce assaults among incarcerated individuals by 90%! Correctional officer satisfaction also greatly increases where this system is adopted. But Maryland hasn’t pursued this system yet, despite invitations over several years.
Increased use of “peer mentors” — well-trained, responsible older prisoners — also could help to counsel younger ones  and reduce the burden on prison staff. And it would provide job experience for these mentors when later released.
Increased pay for correctional officers might seem to increase the budget. But, in the long run, these dollars would reduce  mandatory overtime, reduce the quit-rate of experienced correctional officers, and reduce the need to continuously train new, inexperienced ones.
Finally, and just as important, Maryland could reduce prisons’ inflow by adopting more, proven programs for diversion:

Prosecutors and courts could give priority to sentences that provide treatment rather than those that simply imprison.
Drug courts and mental health courts could be expanded to youthful and first-time violent offenders  (currently excluded) — costing less and working better than mandatory prison sentences.
Many women and youthful offenders are pulled into criminal activities by their abusers. They could be given more low-cost counseling and less expensive  incarceration.
Marylanders on parole and probation also could get more reentry help with their problems, such as finding housing and employment. That help would cost less than more years in prison.

With Maryland’s state and local elections approaching in 2026, both voters and candidates should keep in mind that “tough on crime” may not be so smart, either for public safety or for our taxpayers’ burden.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Prison-cells-for-Aug-14-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 17:57:41.380311

As one of three men detained by immigration police in Jeffersonville on Nov. 7 was granted bond, their lawyer has been denied access to the other two men after allegedly violating Department of Corrections policy around the use of translators.
Last Thursday, a virtual bond hearing held in Massachusetts state court morning for Jeffersonville business owner Vicente Acosta Yupangui, 40, concluded with a judge allowing Yupangui to await a removal hearing at his home. On Monday, Yupangui’s lawyer Kristen Connors was back in Vermont District Court in Burlington for another hearing, this time for a second man detained in the same Jeffersonville raid, Luis Lala Inamagua.
While the hearing pertained to filings around Inamagua’s federal case, Vermont Department of Justice lawyers were also on hand representing Northwest State Correctional Facility, where Inamagua, 46, has been detained along with Alex Japon Benites, 28, a third man detained in Jeffersonville. Until recently, Yupangui had also been detained there.

Connors said she had been “banned” from the prison and was not allowed to visit her clients in-person because she had brought an interpreter to help translate for a client who was related to that translator.
Connors said she was unaware this violated Department of Corrections policy and no one at the prison checked their identification or questioned them. When she tried to schedule an in-person meeting with Inamagua last week, she said she was informed that she had been banned from Northwest State Correctional Facility and that the state had filed an ethics complaint against Connors.
Isaac Dayno, a spokesperson for the Department of Corrections, initially denied that Connors had been “banned” from Northwest State Correctional Facility and declined to share a copy of the ethics report filed against Connors.
When pressed to further clarify Connors’ denial, Dayno acknowledged that there had been “confusion around her access privileges” after a miscommunication between the department’s legal team and prison staff.
Dayno said Connors “should be cleared to enter a correctional facility to meet with a client” but warned that any accompanying interpreter would need prior clearance from the Department of Corrections as well.
“The issue was not the interpreter’s relationship to the detainee but rather the fact counsel knowingly did not disclose that relationship, which is a violation of DOC policy,” Dayno wrote. “The Department is still investigating the circumstances of this violation.”
Connors, who only learned of this clarification in the department’s policy toward her when asked about it by the News & Citizen, said she would verify this claim with the department separately, and alleged the department had initially claimed she had violated specific policies regulating prisoner visitation that she claimed she had not violated.
Roofer freed
In a virtual hearing conducted Nov. 20 through the immigration court in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, Yupangui became the first of those detained Nov. 7 in the parking lot of the Maplefields in Jeffersonville to be allowed a bond hearing.
Prior to the hearing, Connors argued in filings that although Yupangui had entered the United States outside of the proper channels, he had been an asylum seeker for over a decade. She said he is a taxpaying owner of a roofing business based in Cambridge and is the father of four children who are citizens.
At the hearing, Sarah Sawwan, a Texas-based attorney representing the Department of Homeland Security, tried to make the case that Yupangui was a flight risk, citing the fact that he attempted to flee from immigration police, as many others at the scene did, and that his original immigration to the United States being unlawful.
Julio Cortes del Olmo, the Massachusetts lawyer who represented Yupangui in immigration court, argued that the court could not prove that Yupangui was among those who had fled, and pointed to the abundance of evidence of his client’s deep ties to the Cambridge community, from his family to the many who rallied to his cause after his detainment.
Del Olmo said that Yupangui received more than 10 letters of support, which he was able to submit to the court on behalf of his client. In one of them, Alisa Anderson, an owner at Three Mountain Roofing, another Cambridge roofing company with whom Yupangui works, had paid for his legal representation and characterized him as a “hard working man.”
Judge Natalie Smith determined that the state had not successfully proven that Yupangui was a flight risk and set his bond at $5,000.
Connors confirmed that Yupangui had been released on bond to await his removal hearing, which is scheduled for early December. Inamagua and Benites had their “master calendar” hearings, the first procedural step in the removal process, rescheduled to early December as well, though Connors hopes to secure them bond hearings as well.
Of the four other state-confirmed people detained in relation to the Jeffersonville operation, three have been transferred to a family-detainment facility in Texas and another was transferred to an Arizona facility, according to advocates.

Menzies, 67, died of “presumed natural causes at a local hospital” Wednesday afternoon, according to the Utah Department of Corrections. 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine Hunsaker’s son, said Menzies’ death “was a complete surprise.” 
“First off, I’d say that I’m numb. And second off, I would say, grateful,” Hunsaker told Utah News Dispatch. “I’m grateful that my family does not have to endure this for the holidays.” 
Hunsaker continued, “It’s over. It’s over.”

Menzies had been scheduled to be executed by firing squad earlier this year, on Sept. 5. As the date drew closer, his attorneys argued his dementia had worsened. He had been diagnosed with vascular dementia, caused when the brain’s blood flow is disrupted, leading to memory loss and declining cognitive function, according to court testimony.
A state evaluator says Ralph Menzies is too ill with dementia to be executed

The Utah Supreme Court court called off the execution roughly a week before it was scheduled to take place. The justices found there was enough evidence to warrant another competency evaluation. 
A judge was scheduled to consider new reports from psychologists who evaluated Menzies in recent weeks during a multi-day court hearing that had been scheduled to start Dec. 9. Ahead of that hearing, a forensic psychologist said in an evaluation that Menzies was “not competent to be executed.” That report was one of several that were to be considered by a judge.  
Menzies killed the 26-year-old Hunsaker nearly four decades ago after kidnapping her from her job at a gas station in Kearns. He tied her to a tree in Big Cottonwood Canyon, strangled her and slit her throat, prosecutors said. She was found by a hiker days later.

The alliance of unions and school districts also added a major disability rights advocacy group to its ranks in the amended complaint that detailed how the department’s Nov. 18 announcement of six interagency agreements could harm students.
The agreements to transfer several Education responsibilities to four other departments drew swift backlash from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the transfers and expressed concerns over the harms that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. 
“Scattering Department of Education programs among agencies with no expertise in education or lacking key agency infrastructure will reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs and will prevent the type of synergy that Congress intended to achieve by consolidating federal education activities in one cabinet level agency,” the coalition, represented by the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, wrote in the amended complaint. 
The expanded suit asks for declaratory and injunctive relief against what it describes as the administration’s “unlawful effort to dismantle the Department of Education,” pointing to the interagency agreements, mass layoffs at the department earlier this year and implementation of an executive order that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department.  
The Education Department clarified in fact sheets related to the agreements  with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs.”
Axing the Education Department
Trump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department, saying he wants to send education “back to the states.” Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.
The original lawsuit, filed in March in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts. 
The Tuesday filing adds The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as a plaintiff. 
Earlier this year, the case was consolidated with another March lawsuit from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.  
“It’s no surprise that blue states and unions care more about preserving the DC bureaucracy than about giving parents, students, and teachers more control over education and improving the efficient delivery of funds and services,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.
Supreme Court temporarily greenlit Trump plan
In May, a federal judge in Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction in the consolidated case, blocking the administration’s efforts, including a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.
A federal appeals court upheld that order in June, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. 
The nation’s highest court in July temporarily suspended the lower courts’ orders, allowing the administration to proceed, for now, with those dismantling efforts.

A recently released trove of thousands of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s emails offer glimpses into his time in New Mexico, including the prominent people he invited to his home here and when he scheduled visits. 
The United States House Oversight Committee released more than 20,000 pages of records earlier this month amid a renewed push to share with the public more about the disgraced financier with longstanding ties to elected officials, business leaders and celebrities, including Former President Bill Clinton and President Donald Trump. 
That release included more than 2,000 thousand emails Epstein exchanged between 2009 and 2019. Several dozen mention New Mexico or related phrases, according to Source New Mexico review, including in news articles or from Epstein himself.
Epstein bought a 7,500 Santa Fe-area property called Zorro Ranch from former Gov. Bruce King in 1993.It was sold at an undisclosed price in 2023, four years after Epstein’s death in custody awaiting federal sex trafficking charges.
According to court documents, the ranch, which has its own airstrip and helipad, was the site of sex trafficking, including by Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 as Epstein’s co-conspirator.
The emails show Epstein invited prominent figures—none of whom have been accused of any crimes associated with Epstein— including author Deepak Chopra, linguist Noam Chomsky, billionaire Tom Pritzker, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and filmmaker Bill Sieger, to his ranch at various times. It’s unclear from the emails whether any of those people took him up on his offer, though one email from Epstein to Chomsky asks if he wants to “visit again.”
The emails also show Epstein scheduled visits to the area, including for about two weeks in August 2016 and between Feb. 24 and March 1, 2017, following visits to New York and Paris. 
Trump signs bill requiring DOJ release of Epstein files

In addition to the emails, other released documents mention former New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, including an excerpt of a draft article about Epstein, which Semafor confirmed came from journalist Michael Wolf. In the excerpt, Wolff recounts asking Richardson at lunch how he knew Epstein. 
“Jeffrey,” Richardson replied, according to Wolff’s telling, “is the biggest landowner in New Mexico.
In addition to efforts by Congress to release more Epstein files, two New Mexico state lawmakers have announced plans for a truth commission that will seek to document abuses and gather testimony from victims, witnesses and perpetrators in a series of public hearings. 
Reps. Marianna Anaya (D-Albuquerque) and Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) told an interim legislative committee in early November that the commission will cost about $2 million, with funding from an untapped revenue source dedicated to helping victims of sex trafficking. Lawmakers from both parties said they approved of the commission and urged the lawmakers to follow leads wherever they take them. 
Two New Mexican attorneys general have opened previous investigations into Epstein’s activities in the state: Hector Balderas’ criminal investigation in 2019 closed within the year without filing any charges. In 2023, current Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated the role financial services companies played in failing to identify the abuses at the ranch.

During this time of gratitude, all of us at VTDigger want to say thank you. Thank you for reading, for sharing your tips and perspectives with us and for supporting a newsroom that works every day to help Vermonters understand the world around them. Your trust is the reason we can keep doing this work.
Thanksgiving also reminds us how many neighbors may be experiencing the holiday very differently. Food insecurity has continued to rise in Vermont since 2020. The Vermont Foodbank now distributes 25 percent more food each year than it did before the pandemic. Federal funding changes have already impacted nutrition programs and food assistance access for refugees and asylum seekers. With the recent government shutdown, many food pantries faced a renewed surge in need. Looking ahead, up to 14,000 Vermonters could lose food benefits in 2026 when new federal laws take effect.
Our recent reporting underscores how quickly policy changes ripple into daily life and how urgently many Vermonters need clear information and strong community support.
This is why we partner with the Vermont Foodbank each Thanksgiving. Our job is to explain the systems that shape life in Vermont and to ensure those most affected are heard. The Foodbank’s job is to make sure our neighbors have enough to eat. Together, we can raise awareness and support Vermonters.
If you are able, there is still time to help send 3 meals to a Vermonter in need through our Thanksgiving Drive. Your gift also strengthens the reporting that sheds light on wealth, poverty and economic inequality at a time when many people are navigating real uncertainty.

Give today and send 3 meals

Most of all, thank you for being part of this community. Whether you give, read, send a tip or share our stories, you help make independent local news possible in Vermont.
We hope your day brings connection, comfort and a moment of rest.

Every week, two local newspapers close somewhere in the country. Some 50 million Americans have limited to no  access to local news. That may increase with loss of public media funding. 
What is the future of journalism in an age where truth itself is under attack? 
Local news is essential because “that’s where rebuilding confidence in facts and truth starts,” said VTDigger editor in chief Geeta Anand. We spoke at a public event at the Manchester Community Library on Nov. 11. 
“If you’ve actually gone to a meeting and seen a story based on it and met the reporter and it actually seems the article matches what you heard, then you begin to disbelieve the discrediting of journalism that is happening, led by the leaders of our country, which is having a devastating effect on our democracy.”
Anand’s career as a journalist and author spans the globe. Her stories on corporate corruption in the Wall Street Journal earned her a Pulitzer Prize in 2002, and she was a finalist again in 2003. Her book, “The Cure,” about a father’s fight to save his kids by starting a company to make a medicine for their untreatable illness, was made into the 2010 movie, Extraordinary Measures, starring Harrison Ford. She was a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal in India. 
Anand’s roots in journalism are in covering local news. She worked at Cape Cod News and then covered local government and courts at the Rutland Herald. In 2018, she became a professor at the UC Berkeley journalism school, where she was dean in 2020. She was at Berkeley until taking over leadership of VTDigger in July 2025. 
Anand spoke about how local journalism is a critical link in the information ecosystem. “Our coverage right now of immigrants getting picked up and spirited off to other parts of the country — that’s the way the world finds out that these things are happening. Our stories get picked up by national media, and the national media hold our national leaders accountable. We matter to you here in Vermont, but we’re also a key part of the web of national and international news.”
Anand said that for community and democracy to function, it is critical to support local news. “If we aren’t vibrant, if we’re not there at the city council meeting or at the school board meeting and telling those stories, government isn’t held accountable. It’s almost like these things haven’t happened if we’re not there.”

(U.S. Geological Survey Alaska Science Center photo)After the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastated communities in Western Alaska last month, you might have been jolted into remembering that forces beyond our immediate control govern the planet. A combination of wind, gravity, planetary rotation and uneven heating of the Earth’s surface can result in destructive storms and, in worst-case scenarios, a tragic loss of life.
While we’re right to be gravely concerned about climate change in Alaska, we can also appreciate that the powerful natural phenomena operating around us are often simply doing the quiet work of keeping our ecosystems humming — by transporting water, nutrients and atmospheric gases from place to place. The result is a bountiful suite of ecosystem services: fish and game that fill our freezers, vibrant landscapes for recreation and spiritual renewal, foundations for Indigenous culture and the economic engines of fishing and tourism. 
In Southeast Alaska, a coastal temperate rainforest flourishes with help from natural phenomena such as warm ocean currents, mid-latitude wind patterns and mountains. Though the combined effects are easy to see — towering trees and waters brimming with seafood — their machinations often appear invisible to the human eye, operating on scales too vast or microscopic to detect… until we look deeper to find what’s hiding in plain sight. Consider the following:
Tectonic motion. Over millions of years, tectonic motion — the shifting of the Earth’s crust — has helped shape a mosaic of aquatic habitats in Southeast Alaska. Picture rivers and streams gushing down mountainsides or meandering lazily across valley floors. Five species of salmon thrive in this mosaic today, with populations often genetically tuned to their particular habitat. Genetic diversity among salmon populations means higher species survival rates in a changing climate.
Glacial ablation. It’s no secret that glaciers in many parts of Alaska are melting. Glacial melt, also called ablation, is a culprit behind dangerous outburst floods and global sea-level rise. But there can be a flipside. In the transboundary Taku River watershed, for example, ablation is driving a massive ecosystem transformation with new salmon-accessible habitat emerging in pro-glacial streams. Scientists believe these waterways could begin housing Pacific salmon in as little as 15 years. As salmon habitat shrinks in other watersheds on the West Coast, glacial ablation in many Southeast Alaska ecosystems is expanding it.
Big tides. The Stikine River Delta is a major Pacific Flyway stopover for migrating shorebirds, possibly due to nutrient-rich biofilm on its mudflats. These oozing banks are expansive due to big tides that lay bare a spacious coastal table and invite famished birds to gather. While data shows that shorebirds are imperiled by habitat destruction elsewhere, they still find refuge in the Stikine where high-quality food and migratory habitat are on offer when ocean margins vanish into the distance.
Variable light conditions. Are you a seafood lover? If so, thank a rainforest cloud. In Southeast Alaska, coastal waters are often in flux when it comes to the availability of sunlight, and that could be helping fish build necessary fat stores. Research shows that variable light conditions, which can affect photosynthesis in addition to water temperature, salinity and, most crucially, nutrient levels, might be an on-switch for the production of essential fatty acids in diatoms, jumpstarting a food web that supports salmon, black cod and other species rich in omega-3 oils.  
Hydrogen bonds. The Southeast rainforest is full of water — in obvious places like rivers and streams, but also in less obvious ones such as soil and vegetation. Due to hydrogen bonds, water can absorb large amounts of energy with only a small temperature increase. The result is a sweeping heat sink that cools the surrounding environment, especially when massive conifers undergo the daily process of evapotranspiration which pulls moisture vertically through the landscape. Requiring no electrical outlets or utility bills, this natural air conditioning system is provided free of charge.
In Southeast Alaska, a host of natural phenomena keep the ecosystem — and its human communities — humming. People do their part for the ecosystem, in turn. Indigenous citizens bring traditional knowledge to natural resource management, like that of Pacific herring. Other problem-solvers work to ensure cruise-ship tourism is more sustainable by promoting a switch from heavy fuel oil to cleaner marine gas oil. 
Want to do your part, wherever your ecosystem may be? Start by simply seeing the world you inhabit a little differently. Whether it’s a receding tide, a mercurial cloud or the tremblor beneath your feet, the powers around you are invisible only until you take a closer look.

The Minnesota Society of Professional Journalists condemned law enforcement attacks on journalists during Tuesday federal operation in St. Paul.
Federal authorities took a person into custody in St. Paul in the 600 block of Rose Avenue East, Sahan Journal reported. A crowd of demonstrators showed up, as well as journalists to document the scene.
In a statement, SPJ said three photojournalists — all clearly identified as press with badges and/or vests and carrying their equipment — were hit by “less-lethal” munitions used by St. Paul police. One was taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
St. Paul police used chemical irritants liberally, according many people at the scene and confirmed by photos.
Kerem Yücel, with MPR News, was hit in the shoulder and was transported to a hospital by ambulance; he was released and is recovering. Tim Evans, a freelance photojournalist with Reuters, was hit in the stomach with a pepper ball round. Aaron Nesheim, a photojournalist with Sahan Journal, was struck in the head with a pepper ball round. Evans and Nesheim did not require hospitalization.
The three journalists told SPJ that they believe they were targeted by law enforcement.

“Photojournalists are on the frontlines of documenting history and it is imperative that they are kept safe and their First Amendment rights are protected,” SPJ said in the statement.
SPJ said it is seeking answers from St. Paul city leadership.
St. Paul police Chief Axel Henry issued a statement on YouTube asserting that a “dangerous situation was unfolding” causing officers to engage.

The members of the nominating committee include Justice Jerod Tufte, Eric Lahlum, Taylor Olson, Laura Mihalik, Paul Forster, Toby Kommer and non-voting member Tony Weiler, executive director of the North Dakota Bar Association.
Once the list is received, the governor can either choose someone to appoint, reject the list and ask the committee to reconvene or call for a special election to fill the seat.
Before joining the Supreme Court, Crothers served as an assistant state’s attorney for Walsh County and worked in private practice. He chairs North Dakota’s Committee on Judiciary Standards.
Crothers’ retirement comes after Chief Justice Jon Jensen announced he would step down as head of the court. Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Tufte are running to succeed him in the role. Jensen will remain a justice.

Source: Screenshot/DeSantis FacebookNearly two months after calling for the elimination of vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, the DeSantis administration announced it will hold a three-hour public meeting in Northwest Florida for the public to weigh in.
The Department of Health has scheduled the meeting in Panama City Beach on Dec. 12 to discuss changes to  the existing rule regarding vaccine requirements for public and private schools, from preschool through grade 12 as well as adult education classes.
While the DOH announced a meeting date and time it did not release a draft of any of its proposed changes.
Health care attorney and lobbyist Chris Nuland predicted the meeting will be well attended.
“Despite the state putting the notice for a workshop in the most remote corner of the state, there will be several doctors who will be attending that workshop to argue for the existing rule,” said Nuland, a Jacksonville lobbyist whose clients include the Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians Services; the Florida Chapter, American College of Surgeons; and the Florida Neurosurgical Society, among others.
Students who attend public and private schools are required by Florida law to be vaccinated for poliomyelitis, diphtheria, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, mumps, and tetanus. The statute allows the DOH through rule to require additional vaccinations, which it does.

DOH’s rule allows exemptions for valid medical reasons but also for religious and certain belief systems.
Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced in September their desire to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, although their focus, for now, appears to be school-aged children.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Ladapo, a  long time vaccine skeptic, likened vaccine requirements to slavery and told those attending the press conference that the government lacks authority to require vaccinations.
“It’s wrong, it’s immoral,” he said at the time. “They do not have the right to tell you what you put in your body. They don’t have the right to tell you what your kids have to put in [their] body. They do not have the right. Do not give it to them. Take it away from them. And we’re going to be starting that here in Florida.”
The announcement made national headlines and was immediately blasted by top Democrats. Even some Republicans have distanced themselves from the idea.
The 2026 regular session begins Tuesday, Jan. 13. To date, the DeSantis administration hasn’t floated its legislative proposal to eliminate all vaccines from statutes.
Meanwhile, Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith is pushing a proposal (SB 626) to amend statutes to include hepatitis B, chickenpox, haemophilus influenzae type b, and pneumococcal disease in the list of required vaccines in statutes.

Jeff Landry's administration plans to reopen the Jetson Center for Youth in Baker (pictured above) in April. The juvenile justice facility was shut down over a decade ago. (Photo by Julie O'Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator) Louisiana officials plan to reopen a youth prison in April that was shuttered over a decade ago when it was declared inappropriate for young people. 
The state Office of Juvenile Justice plans to move 36 incarcerated youth to the old Jetson Center for Youth in Baker after some minor upgrades to buildings on the site. The interim facility is expected to help with overcrowding in the state’s youth prison system, agency undersecretary Jason Starnes said. 
“We desperately need some relief with our bed capacity issues,” Starnes told state lawmakers at a budget hearing last week. 

The long-term plan for the Jetson site is to replace the existing facility with a brand new youth prison complex that will house up to 72 children and teenagers. It is expected to cost close to $70 million and would open during the 2027-28 state budget year. 

In the meantime, the state will renovate existing buildings at Jetson to accommodate a dormitory, cafeteria, laundry facility and classrooms for the 36 youth who will arrive in the spring.

The money to make those buildings inhabitable will come from the budget for the new Jetson construction, said Matt Baker, director of the state Office of Planning and Facility Control, at the budget hearing. He did not say how much will be spent on the rehabilitation. 
“We’re going to do some cleaning up,” Baker said. “But essentially, we are doing as efficient of a renovation as possible so we can retain as much budget as we can for the new facility.”
Once the new building is opened, the state plans to tear down all the existing facilities on Jetson’s campus, Baker said.

When Jetson was closed in 2014, Gov. Bobby Jindal’s staff described it as old and obsolete. Some Jetson buildings had first opened in 1948 and were not conducive to the therapeutic setting the juvenile justice system was trying to embrace at the time. 

State officials also justified Jetson’s closure by saying it was difficult to secure because its campus is large and buildings are spread out over several acres. 
More recently, Louisiana used Jetson as its temporary women’s prison for nine years. The state hastily moved its incarcerated women to Jetson in 2016 after the women’s prison in St. Gabriel flooded and became unlivable. They were moved out of Jetson earlier this year when a new women’s prison opened at another St. Gabriel site. 

Advocates for incarcerated women complained about the condition of Jetson while the women were housed there, but juvenile justice officials say they intend to use a different building. 
Still, Starnes admitted most of the facilities at Jetson are in bad physical shape. 
“A lot of the facilities are very aged. [The buildings] are in very poor condition,” he said last week. 

Legislators are also concerned about the impact to the surrounding communities. When Jetson was open, breakouts happened frequently and surrounding neighbors experienced waves of crime from the facility. At the time, the facility housed hundreds of incarcerated youth. 
State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, said she is concerned about new residential developments that under construction near the Jetson site. 
 “We have to be good neighbors to the people we are going to be next to,” Barrow said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/PXL_20220503_223316263-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Photo via Getty Images)The worst part of the information age is not everyone having access to everything going on in the world. It’s that everyone feels like they have to have an opinion on it all.
It’s as if the constant barrage of insane news flying at our faces 24/7 is making us all feel like we have an obligation to be keyed in to everything going on in the world. Of course, being informed is important, but so is having normal conversations about normal human things that don’t involve debating the fundamentals of humanity.
Thanksgiving is uniquely primed for those types of nausea-inducing conversations, and you might be prepping how you’re going to redirect your racist uncle right alongside the turkey.
I am proposing, instead, 24 topics of conversation that will be much more fun to discuss, reveal new and interesting depths to the relatives you see twice a year, and (hopefully) ensure no one will leave the dinner table crying and blocking everyone on Facebook.

Greet everyone with an uncomfortably long hug, like, it’s really weird that you’re hugging them for so long, why are you doing that, please let go, and see who the first person is to ask if you’re doing okay.
Share a small moment from your life that delighted you recently.
If you were a Thanksgiving dish, which would you be and why?
Do you think this life is the first time you’ve been on Earth?
Which sibling will be the best at taking care of Mom and Dad when they start to turn senile?
Say three nice things about Mom (or whoever took the lead in planning Thanksgiving, which, let’s be honest, is likely a mom).
What’s the best new song you listened to recently?
Which NFL position do you think you could play?
Which of your grandparents would you be least surprised to learn had an affair in 1972?
Reveal one bad thing you did in high school that your parents never figured out (those under 18 in attendance are excused from participating).
How was NASCAR almost as big of a sport in America as the NFL in the late 90s and early 2000s and what would it take for them to reach that level of popularity again? (This is a specific request from my husband and also a test to see if he reads my stuff)
If the entire family was stranded on an island, who would be sacrificed for food first?
Share one thing you’re thankful for.
Share one thing you’re not thankful for.
Share your most embarrassing moment from elementary school.
Do you think aliens have pets?
What’s the most evil thing one of your siblings did to you when you were children?
What are the top 5 best Christmas movies?
If you had to choose a different woman in your family to be your mom, who would you choose?
Which cousin’s ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend was your least favorite and why?
What’s your favorite book you’ve ever read?
Set a timer for five minutes and everyone make a sincere attempt at writing a poem. Then share all poems, slam-style, and the winner gets first choice of leftovers to take home.
Which family member would you call as a lifeline if you were a contestant on Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
Share the funniest moment you can remember of a family member crying and/or fighting with someone else on a holiday.

A jury convicted Lunsford in February, but a judge called for a new trial in October. (File photo /Source NM)As a former Las Cruces police officer previously convicted for killing a Black man accused of stealing a beer awaits a possible new trial, his ankle monitor will remain on.
In 2022, Las Cruces Police Officer Brad Lunsford responded to a 911 call that alleged someone had stolen a beer from a gas station convenience store. Lunsford attempted to arrest 36-year-old Presley Eze as bystanders filmed the interaction with their cellphones. Lunsford, who had been involved in prior police shootings, alleged that Eze grabbed his Taser during the struggle. Lunsford drew his service weapon and shot Eze once in the back of the head.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez first filed criminal charges against Lunsford in late 2023. The filing marked the first time in nearly a decade that a police officer anywhere in New Mexico had faced criminal charges for a fatal shooting — the most recent instance was the trial of Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, the Albuquerque officers who in 2014 killed James Boyd in the Sandia Foothills. Their case ended in a mistrial.
The Eze killing led Southern New Mexicans to be “rightly concerned about whether or not justice is equal in this country,” Torrez said when he announced the criminal charges in 2023.
A jury convicted Lunsford in February of this year.
In October, though, Sixth Judicial District Judge Jim Foy ordered a new trial, which has yet to be scheduled. Foy said he had inappropriately substituted two alternate jurors and dismissed two regular jurors before deliberations began because at the time the court was using a form that incorrectly listed which jurors were alternates. 
Foy also said that newly discovered evidence showed one juror held anti-cop bias. Upon his decision, the National Police Association went so far as to publish the headline, “Did an Anti-Police Activist Lie to Get on the Officer Brad Lunsford Jury?”
Torrez pushed back. His New Mexico Department of Justice in October appealed Foy’s decision to the state Court of Appeals and argued that the juror’s answers to pre-trial questionnaires, which included a disclosure about affiliation with the Southern Poverty Law Center, did not seem to alarm Lunsford’s attorneys at the start of his criminal trial. The juror’s academic works about race in early education and parenthood and podcast appearances are all easily accessible by a simple Google search of the juror’s name, lawyers with Torrez’s New Mexico Department of Justice argued.
Foy’s call for a new trial “set aside the jury’s finding of guilt (that) has devastated Presley Eze’s family and further undermines the public’s faith in New Mexico’s criminal justice system,” Torrez said in an October statement. “The presiding judge…has repeatedly mischaracterized the factual record, improperly weighed in on the strength of the state’s case and committed numerous procedural errors that prejudiced the prosecution.”
Torrez’s department filed its arguments in appeals court earlier this month. A decision remains pending.
On Nov. 21, Foy denied Lunsford’s request to modify the conditions of his release, which sought to remove his requirement to wear an ankle monitor and to post a $10,000 bond, pending the appellate court’s decision.
“Our goal in the new trial is to ensure Officer Lunsford receives a fair proceeding before an impartial jury that hears all of the evidence and correctly applies the law,” Lunsford’s attorney Matt Chandler wrote in an email to Source NM. “We remain confident that, in a fair trial, the evidence will show that Officer Lunsford’s actions were lawful, that he was protecting his own life and the life of his fellow officer from a violent, aggressive attack by the suspect, and that he should be acquitted.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240716-182348-0aa-Attorney-General-Raul-Torrez-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Two members of the West Virginia National Guard were shot while on deployment in Washington D.C. on Wednesday, according to a statement from Gov. Patrick Morrisey.
The condition of the two members was unknown as of 4:15 p.m.
Morrisey initially posted on social media at 3:33 p.m. that one of the victims was dead and another sent to the hospital following the shooting. He then announced at 3:42 p.m. that both members of the West Virginia National Guard were dead. 
In a third post at 4:04 p.m., however, Morrisey said he was receiving “conflicting reports” about the condition of the West Virginia National Guard members.
“… [The state] will provide additional updates once we receive more complete information,” Morrisey continued.
The shooting took place blocks from the White House. According to the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, the scene was secure and one suspect was in custody at 2:58 p.m.
President Donald Trump was in Florida on Wednesday but was briefed on the shooting, White House officials said. In social media posts, Trump said the perpetrator was an “animal” and was “also severely wounded” in the incident. Regardless, he continued, the shooter will “pay a very steep price.”
“God bless our Great National Guard, and all of our Military and Law Enforcement,” Trump said. “These are truly Great People. I, as President of the United States, and everyone associated with the Office of the Presidency, am with you!”
The shooting comes less than a week after a federal judge ruled that the deployment of National Guard troops from several states to Washington, D.C. at the request of Trump was illegal. The Trump administration was given until Dec. 11 to pull troops out or file an appeal to the ruling. 
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Earlier this year, the West Virginia Citizen Action Group filed a lawsuit against Morrisey and the West Virginia National Guard regarding West Virginia troops being deployed to D.C. CAG was represented by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union.
The ACLU attorneys argued that the deployment by Morrisey was unlawful and an abuse of state powers that allow the governor to activate National Guard troops for matters outside of the state only under limited circumstances. They said the ongoing deployment was causing real and irreparable harm to people in West Virginia.
Attorneys for the state of West Virginia countered that CAG, the plaintiff, was not facing any real or clear harm from the deployment. The only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” due to the National Guard deployment, the state argued, are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Attorneys with the ACLU were asking the court for a temporary injunction that would have seen all West Virginia National Guard members deployed to D.C. sent home.
On Nov. 10, Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay sided with the state of West Virginia and dismissed the case, meaning troops remained in D.C.
This is a developing story and more will be reported as information becomes available.

In her letter to the conference commissioner Tony Petitti, Stevens warned the deal would be a “dangerous expansion of private equity influence over our nation’s universities, harming the quality of college sports and the integrity of university governance.”
The influence of wealthy non-university interests has already created issues for college sports, Stevens said, pointing to the role of television networks in eliminating the regional nature of conferences through realignment.
The deal would open the door for other conferences to seek investment from private enquiry groups, Stevens said, arguing it would further undermine regional cohesion. She also warned that giving private investment firms control of sports television revenue would create undue influence over university decisionmaking.
Big Ten member universities should be focused on their mission to educate and prepare young people for fulfilling and productive lives instead of maximizing television revenue in partnership with wealthy financial institutions.
Stevens requested Petitti respond with an answer to the following questions by Dec. 12. Stevens asked if a conference media rights agreement is reached, how will the commissioner  ensure that UC Investments, or any subsequent private equity investor, will not impact the independence and internal governance of member universities? 
She also asked if a conference media rights agreement is reached, how will the commissioner ensure that efforts to promote large revenue-generating sports does not come at the expense of support for Title IX and non-revenue sports that have provided a path to college and meaningful experiences for generations of students? 
The representative further asked if an agreement is reached, how will the commissioner ensure confidence amongst athletes, students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the local communities of member universities that the profit seeking motives of UC Investments, and any subsequent private equity investors, are not superseding the overall public serving mission of Big Ten member universities?",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/AMR1000-311-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

Fuse is accused of giving drugs to Anthony Richards, who died of a drug overdose in February at the South Dakota State Penitentiary’s Jameson Annex. Fuse, who appeared in court via video link on Tuesday, maintains his innocence.
During the hearing, Assistant Attorney General Ryan McFall told Minnehaha County Judge Jon Sogn that the state never measured the quantity of the drug present in Richards’ system before it concluded that he’d died by overdosing on it.
The prosecutor also admitted, with an apology to the judge, that it no longer has videos of the visits where Fuse was allegedly given the drugs he was later indicted for distributing inside the prison.
“It was supposed to have been preserved,” McFall said of the video evidence, adding, “There is not a good answer as to why it was not.”
Case the first of several tied to ‘K2’
Fuse’s case is among several tied to an uptick in the circulation of synthetic drugs, referred to colloquially as “K2,” inside South Dakota’s prisons.
Overdose deaths, gang violence draw charges in some — not all — recent prison incidents

Seven people are believed to have died of overdoses this year in the state’s custody. K2 is suspected or confirmed as a cause of death in at least five of them, starting with Richards, who died on Feb. 6 at the age of 20.
Fuse, 22, went to prison last year for the unlawful discharge of a firearm. He’s serving a 10-year sentence, with three years suspended. Given his prior convictions, he could be sentenced to life if he’s found guilty of distributing a substance resulting in death.
Questions key to Fuse’s defense involve the drug’s concentration in Richards’ body, the source of the K2 involved, and Fuse’s contention that the drugs came from other inmates or Department of Corrections staff members.
Fuse’s court-appointed attorney, Minnehaha County Deputy Public Defender Kylie Beck, said Tuesday that her client “is adamant that he is not the person who provided the drugs” that killed Richards.
Video visits
The state has alleged that family and friends gave Fuse the K2 during visits, Beck told the judge.
Beck said she expected the state to be able to prove as much with videos of those visits, which she’s asked to review. In response, McFall said he also expected the videos to be preserved, but that there’s little he can do about it now.
“They do not exist at this time, and cannot be provided,” he said.
The Department of Corrections did not respond to a South Dakota Searchlight request for comment on the videos.
On the issue of testing for the amount of K2 in Richards’ system, Beck said the reports she received indicate only that the drug was present.
“I believe quantity is critical if the allegation involves an overdose in which a person was killed,” Beck said.
McFall said no such “quantitative” tests were performed at the time of Richards’ autopsy, repeating a line he’d use several times during the half-hour hearing:
“We’ve turned over what we have.”
Inmate points finger at staff
Beck has twice requested reports about six current or former state employees who worked inside the prison “regarding their possible involvement and/or knowledge” of the drug distribution tied to Richards’ death. 
Beck was given reports showing that those staff members responded to the Richards overdose, but said Tuesday she was looking for reports that might support her client’s contention that they were known to be “dirty” staff.

At least one of the staff members no longer works for the state, according to South Dakota Searchlight reviews of the state’s salary database.
McFall said the state had provided all the incident-related reports that mention the staff members. He’s not aware of any reports accusing the staff of drug-related misbehavior, and said he’s “not aware of any authority” that would grant Fuse access to any reports on those staffers beyond those created in relation to Richards’ death.
But, he added, “to my knowledge at this time, no reports investigating those individuals exist.”
Judge Sogn told Beck there’s no way he can order the release of reports that don’t exist, but said the state must produce them if they emerge.
Phone calls, inmate safety checks
Beck also wanted to know the dates attached to “about 20” recorded phone calls placed by other inmates on Fuse’s unit in the run-up to Richards’ death.
Beck said she needs to know the dates to determine if any talk about drugs captured on those calls can offer insight on the source of the drugs circulating at the time.

McFall said the dates were not part of a “bevy of answers” delivered in October from the state. At this point, he said, the case’s lead investigator is out on maternity leave and might not be able to help for a few weeks.
Judge Sogn told McFall the information ought to come earlier than that.
“There has to be at least one person at the penitentiary” who can provide the dates and times for the calls, Sogn said.
The judge also told McFall to seek out more details about the cell checks performed on the day of Richards’ death. Thus far, Beck said, she’s received information on how often cells ought to be checked, but no records to show that those checks took place — or didn’t — on the day Richards died. 
The judge gave the state until mid-December to deliver the remainder of deliverable evidence to Fuse’s attorney. The case is scheduled for trial on the week of Jan. 26.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4256-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photo by John McCosh/Georgia Recorder)The preliminary injunction against the state’s social media ban on minors won’t last, an appeals court concluded this week. 
Two judges on a three-judge panel told the state Tuesday it may begin enforcing a 2024 law that prohibits young Floridians from using social media while litigation plays out. 
“HB3 is now the law of the state and will be enforced. We’re putting all big tech companies on notice: endanger our kids and find out what happens!” Uthmeier posted to his personal X account Tuesday, posting on his official account that his office “will aggressively enforce this law.”
In June, a federal district court judge granted a preliminary injunction against enforcing the law. It had previously denied a request for preliminary injunction before the social media giants amended their complaint. 
Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit halted the preliminary injunction. 
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier (via Department of Legal Affairs)
“Another win on appeal, this time upholding Florida’s protections for kids against predatory social media companies. We put parents and kids first!” Gov. Ron DeSantis posted to his personal X account. 
The law, a focus of former House Speaker and now candidate for governor Paul Renner, passed in 2024 and prohibits Floridians younger than 14 from having social media accounts on platforms that deploy “addictive features.” The law, which scored bipartisan support, also requires parental consent for youngsters age 14 and 15 to have accounts on those same platforms.
The circuit court majority, comprising Judges Elizabeth Branch and Barbara Lagoa, both Donald Trump appointees, said the attorney general has made a “strong showing of a likelihood of success.” 
Largely an argument of First Amendment infringement, the majority opinion and and a dissent written by Judge Robin Rosenbaum, a President Barack Obama appointee, conflict on whether the law should fall under strict or intermediate First Amendment scrutiny. 
The state has argued that the law does not prohibit the use of social media, instead just apps that use addictive features like “infinite scrolling,” push notifications or alerts, “personal interactive metrics” regarding likes or shares, “auto-play video,” and “live-streaming.” The circuit majority agreed, conflicting with the district court ruling. 
Platforms, upon notification from a minor’s parent, must terminate a minor’s account, the law requires.
The suit was filed by NetChoice and Computer and Communications Industry Association.  Proceedings will continue over the merits of the law itself.
NetChoice represents Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Reddit, YouTube, Pinterest, Google, and other tech giants. CCIA also represents Facebook and Instagram, Google, Pinterest, and others.
“NetChoice is disappointed in the Eleventh Circuit’s ruling allowing Florida’s censorship law to take effect while Florida continues to appeal our injunction. Briefing has finished, and we look forward to the opportunity to explain the law’s constitutional problems to the Court directly,” Paul Taske of NetChoice said in an online statement. 
“We will consider all available options to ensure Floridians’ online communication is safe and free. Florida’s censorship regime not only violates its citizens’ free speech rights but also makes all users — especially minors — less safe.”
The majority wrote that the law is “likely content neutral” and satisfies the intermediate scrutiny test. 
“The Attorney General is likely to show that the legislature chose the regulation it did, not because it is easier than alternatives, but because it is the most effective way of achieving its interest,” Branch wrote. 
“It is unlikely that HB3 inappropriately curtails any First Amendment rights. And the compliance costs plaintiffs might incur do not outweigh the State’s interest in enforcing its lawful regulation,” Branch wrote.

Dissent
In a lengthy dissent, Rosenbaum said the law is “plainly unconstitutional under the First Amendment. In fact, it’s plainly unconstitutional on its face.”
Rosenbaum finds it to be content-based, which would put it under strict scrutiny as opposed to intermediate scrutiny. The absence of  streaming services like Hulu and Disney+ in the lawsuit but the inclusion of other social media platforms signal that the law is content-based, Rosenbaum wrote. 
“The Act directly regulates expression in at least two ways. First, the Act inserts the state of Florida into users’ decisions about whether and how to speak online,” Rosenbaum wrote. Second, is that the law “interferes with the platforms’ editorial choices about which users can join the platform and about what content to display to those users.”
Rosenbaum points to the majority classifying age verification as imposing a “modest” burden on adult speech when it requires providing personally identifiable information.
“And to be sure, for adult users who seek to engage in online speech that Florida state officials and their political allies would approve of, the burden may be ‘modest.’ But for everyone else — especially those who wish to express dissatisfaction with Florida politics and officials — the Act’s disclosure requirements impose a heavy burden.” Rosenbaum wrote.
Rosenbaum invoked the parental empowerment movement in contesting the law.
“We should be wary of governments supplanting parents in deciding which ideas children should and should not be exposed to,” Rosenbaum wrote.

They were able to, after some back and forth … subdue the individual and bring them into custody,” Carroll added. “Within moments, members of law enforcement in the area were also able to assist and bring that individual into custody.”Carroll said there were no other suspects at the time of the press conference, in the early evening, and that law enforcement officials had reviewed video footage from the area where the shooting took place. “It appears, like I said, to be a lone gunman that raised the firearm and ambushed these members of the National Guard, and he was quickly taken into custody by other National Guard members and law enforcement members,” he said. The guardsmen were armed, but Carroll said investigators had not yet determined if they shot back or how the suspect, whom he did not name, was shot. “At this point, we're still investigating exactly who shot the individual. It's not clear at this time,” he said. Officials were also not yet sure “what kind of weapon” the suspect used during the shooting, which Carroll said “happened right in front of the Metro, although there is no indication that the perpetrator was on the Metro.” The Metro is the district’s public transit system.Bowser reiterated during the press conference that the two National Guard members were in critical condition and referred to the shooting as “targeted.”

Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, questions the process of selecting a company to implement a $10 million gun-detection program in public schools. The initiative began as a 2024 request by a Pennsylvania technology company for an exclusive service contract in Kansas. In this image from April 10, 2025, Pettey offers remarks in the Kansas Senate. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Legislature’s special budget committee revealed the attorney general’s office continues to work toward awarding a $10 million contract to a private vendor for deployment of artificial intelligence and use of security cameras to spot gun-wielding intruders in public schools.
Gov. Laura Kelly signed a budget bill in April that included funding for technology that promised to identify unconcealed firearms in school buildings so alerts could be forwarded to school staff and law enforcement officers. In October, three companies submitted bids through the Kansas Department of Administration. On Wednesday, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Kris Kobach said a contract hadn’t been issued.
Under state law, the attorney general’s office was directed to make certain the system was installed in schools by the end of December and operational at the close of February.
Sen. Pat Pettey, a Democrat from Kansas City, Kansas, said the initiative was embraced by the Legislature at the same time a popular program offering state-funded school-security grants to districts was dropped.
“We no longer have funding in the Department of Education for safe and secure schools,” Pettey said. “But we do have this funding source … but nothing has been appropriated? Schools would like to have safe and secure funds, but they don’t have any option now except through this program.”
Bids on the Kansas firearm-identification contract were submitted by Gades Sales Co. of Wichita; CIS Data Services of Springfield, Missouri; and ZeroEyes of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. Financial details of those company proposals haven’t been made public.
The idea of relying on AI to pinpoint unconcealed weapons in schools and possibly thwart mass shootings has been debated in Kansas since ZeroEyes hired lobbyists last year to convince legislators to award it the contract to operate an enhanced security system for benefit of Kansas schools.
Lobbyists for ZeroEyes pitched the idea of directly earmarking state funding to ZeroEyes or establishing contract provisions matching ZeroEyes’ marketing materials so rival venders would have difficulty landing the contract.
Kieran Carroll, chief strategy officer for ZeroEyes, told a Kansas House committee in February 2024 that covering 1,300 school buildings in Kansas with ZeroEyes’ technology and delivering 24-hour monitoring of two dozen cameras in each school would cost the state $8.5 million annually.
In May 2024, Gov. Laura Kelly used line-item authority to veto the budget measure dedicating $5 million to a gun-identification initiative that favored ZeroEyes. The bill limited dollar-for-dollar matches from the state to school districts that signed up with ZeroEyes.
The governor said the result would have been “a no-bid contract” that wrote ZeroEyes’ technology into state law without proper consideration of alternative companies.
The Republican-led Legislature responded during the 2025 session by authorizing expenditure of $10 million for a firearm-detection program available to all Kansas public school districts. This version of the AI funding plan wasn’t vetoed by Kelly and led to the ongoing contract bidding process.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100560-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)The North Carolina State Board of Elections voted Tuesday to begin verifying voters’ citizenship status, as federal officials pursue a similar national plan.
The board voted to partner with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and share the state’s voter rolls with the federal government’s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements or SAVE database. According to DHS, the database was created to help states check for eligibility for benefit programs, but some states are using it to verify voter citizenship as well.
“This is one of the few tools available to us to check for noncitizens on our voter rolls,” executive director Sam Hayes, a Republican, said in a news release Wednesday. “We are pleased to follow the letter of the law outlined in North Carolina’s Constitution and to make clear that elections are reserved for U.S. citizens.”
Under state law, the state board would send reports on residents’ voter registration and citizenship status to county boards of elections. Counties would then be required to notify voters by mail within a month and, if they do not object, remove them from the voter rolls.
County boards will be required to flag any noncitizens removed from the voter rolls within the state database.
Critics of the SAVE database have warned of possible mismatches and incorrect information in it, as well as other hiccups that could lead to people being improperly removed from voter rolls.
The decision from North Carolina’s board comes as the Trump administration seeks to construct its own verification program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is seeking access to an obscure computer database used by law enforcement officials, while also demanding that states share copies of their voter files with personal data, Stateline has reported.
But the national plan has garnered fierce opposition among civil rights advocates who argue that it would effectively create a national source of personal information on American voters.
North Carolina’s voter rolls already undergo cross-checking as officials remove voters who move out of the state or die. But Republicans, who recently took a majority on the state board, have pushed for further scrutiny and regulation, specifically on citizenship status.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Black-voters-Getty-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

(Photos by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Acting State Comptroller Kevin Walsh hit back Wednesday at a top New Jersey legislator’s effort to weaken his office’s investigative powers, calling it a “scam” that will allow corruption to flourish unchecked.
Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) introduced a bill Monday to transfer the comptroller office’s investigative and subpoena powers to the State Commission of Investigation, and the bill is scheduled to be heard by a legislative committee Monday morning in Trenton. Walsh told reporters Wednesday the measure is designed to keep the public and Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill from “continuing to go after corruption in our state.”
“It is designed to undermine an extraordinarily effective watchdog agency. It is designed to reduce the power of the governor to address corruption, especially at the local level. It is designed to shut down ongoing investigations we are involved in,” he said.
Tensions grow between state watchdog and the pols under his scrutiny

The State Commission of Investigation already has investigative and subpoena powers, Walsh added.
“So that just shows, really, what a scam the entire concept of the bill is,” he said.
Walsh’s investigations into public fraud, waste, and abuse have tormented officials at all levels in New Jersey, driving critics to demand that state lawmakers muzzle a watchdog that reformers revere as one of New Jersey’s most effective guardians against government misconduct.
Critics’ demands for a comptroller crackdown started early last year, Walsh said. He finds that timing notable.
In December 2023, he issued a report that rebuked public payments made to several Scutari associates, including Edward Oatman, who was Scutari’s chief of staff before he was appointed Union County manager in 2018.
Walsh’s investigators found that Union County improperly paid several top officials, including Oatman, more than $400,000 in stipends and tuition reimbursements. Walsh recommended that the county work to recover the improperly paid funds, institute a corrective action plan, and be more transparent in such payments. Instead, state lawmakers moved to loosen compensation rules for county officials, although that legislation subsequently stalled.
“There is a discomfort that comes with being the subject of a report where you’re called out for doing something wrong. But our democracy is supposed to be strong enough to handle that sort of truth,” Walsh said. “I can’t speak to Sen. Scutari’s motivations in particular based on that report, but the timing is noteworthy.”
Oatman did not respond to a request for comment.
Scutari’s bill also would put legislators in charge of appointing the chair of the State Commission of Investigations, more than double the part-time commissioners’ salaries, and give the commission’s chair the authority to seek a wiretap in cases involving misconduct by state Department of Law and Public Safety employees. That department houses the state police and the Attorney General’s Office.
Walsh pushed back on all of those provisions. He called the pay hikes wasteful and said shifting appointment authority for the commission’s chair to the Legislature would politicize an oversight agency whose independence should be fiercely protected. Right now, the governor names the commission’s chair.
“We don’t do wiretapping right now. That’s a law-enforcement power, and this would seemingly, with little or no checks, grant SCI that power,” he said.










It is designed to undermine an extraordinarily effective watchdog agency.


– Acting comptroller Kevin Walsh


Scutari, who is the highest-ranking state legislator as Senate president, did not respond to a request for comment.
His bill says it aims to eliminate “overlap” in the two watchdogs’ missions and that the comptroller’s “core work … will continue unabated.”
Walsh disputed those claims too, saying the agencies have had no conflicts because they “generally try to stay out of each other’s way.”
He added: “Our core powers right now include the power to investigate public corruption.”
The office gets hundreds of tips of public corruption and waste a month, Walsh said. He cited multiple examples of major investigations his office has done that would have been impossible without investigative and subpoena powers, including exposing a police training firm’s controversial teachings, oversight lapses that led Essex County to pay millions to ghost employees carrying out its pandemic vaccination work, and the misuse of opioid settlement fund spending in Irvington.
Besides investigations, the office, which has about 130 employees, also audits public agencies, reviews public contracts, and oversees the Medicaid program. The comptroller’s office would continue that work under Scutari’s bill.
The bill is set to be heard at 10 a.m. Monday before the Senate’s state government committee at the Statehouse in Trenton. Advocates from the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey plan to join Walsh in testifying against it.
“It does a lot of damage in a moment where there is heightened distrust of government. We need more watchdogs, not fewer,” said Amol Sinha, the group’s executive director. “The idea that there is too much oversight in New Jersey is just false and disregards what people want to see, which is politics and governance that are uncorrupted.”
The police accountability work Walsh’s office does, alone, is reason why policymakers should preserve its investigative and subpoena powers, Sinha added. Walsh’s office has investigated police traffic enforcement and racial profiling, the police practice of “courtesy cards,” and lapses in public reporting of police misconduct, among other things.
“Since we cannot rely on the federal government to engage in consent decrees or pattern and practice investigations the way they once used to, we need all of the support that we can get at the state level to conduct that oversight, and it’s all the more important that we have an effective Office of the State Comptroller that can hold state police accountable,” Sinha said.
The feds have dropped oversight of and investigations into several troubled New Jersey police departments recently, including Newark and Trenton.
Walsh is almost six years into his term, but doesn’t expect he’ll serve much past Jan. 20, when Sherrill takes over from Gov. Phil Murphy. New governors typically install their own people.
But he said he’ll fight hard against Scutari’s bill anyway to protect both the comptroller office’s in-progress probes and its mission of protecting public integrity and taxpayer money.
“I’m thinking of this both as impacting the ongoing investigations that have started under my leadership, and additionally impacting whoever leads the office, prospectively,” he said.
He said he hasn’t spoken with Sherrill, Murphy, or the commission’s leaders about Scutari’s bill, but added it would be “pretty extraordinary” if Murphy signed it. Tyler Jones, a Murphy spokeswoman, declined to comment.
“No governor should permit what is occurring here, which would be hamstringing, undermining, the executive branch from policing itself,” Walsh said. “We all have an obligation to protect the important institutions of our government.”

Zachary Simonson is suing the City of Ottumwa in U.S. District Court, alleging violations of his rights as a veteran and a whistleblower.

The lawsuit claims that beginning in January 2024, City Administrator Phil Rath and Human Resources Director Barb Codjoe began making disparaging remarks about a particular council member during weekly department head meetings.
Rath, the lawsuit claims, speculated that the council member had dementia or some other impairment, and Codjoe questioned whether the council member could complete his term of office. Simonson claims he was disturbed by the remarks and attempted to redirect discussions toward proactive engagement with the council.
In late 2024, the city conducted an internal investigation into an anonymous complaint allegedly filed against Simonson but did not inform him of the nature of that investigation.
According to the lawsuit, on Dec. 19, 2024, Simonson filed a formal complaint with the city, alleging the city’s finance director had brought a bottle of Crown Royal Canadian whisky to a city meeting in violation of the city’s zero-tolerance policy on alcohol. Days later, the city allegedly placed Simonson on a performance improvement plan.
In February 2025, Simonson informed Rath that he planned to notify the Ottumwa City Council he was a finalist for the Oskaloosa city manager position while informing the council he was unhappy about the performance improvement plan and an allegedly hostile work environment.
The lawsuit alleges Rath urged Simonson not to reference the performance improvement plan, but Simonson did so anyway.
In March 2025, Simonson was still working for the City of Ottumwa — the City of Oskaloosa had hired another individual as its city manager — when, the lawsuit claims, he spoke to Landfill Supervisor Lori Creech regarding the landfill being closed without his authorization. In his lawsuit, Simonson alleges he spoke to Creech in a professional and respectful manner, but Creech later claimed he was “screaming and rude” to her.
The city then fired Simonson, alleging gross misconduct related to the conversation with Creech.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for alleged violations of the Iowa Veterans’ Preference Act, violations of Simonson’s due process rights and First Amendment rights, and retaliation for whistleblowing.
The city has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and a trial date has yet to be scheduled.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced the arrests of two Virginia brothers accused of plotting violent attacks on Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents — a case that immediately drew national attention amid the ongoing immigration crackdown and heightened threats against federal law enforcement.
John Wilson Bennett and his brother, Mark Booth Bennett, both U.S. citizens, were taken into custody last week. 
According to DHS, the investigation began Nov. 17 after an off-duty Norfolk police officer overheard the men discussing plans to “kill police officers and ICE agents.” Authorities say Mark Bennett also talked about meeting “likeminded individuals” in Las Vegas to buy firearms equipped with explosive rounds.
Mark Bennett was arrested Nov. 19 at Norfolk International Airport before boarding a flight to Charlotte en route to Las Vegas. That same day, federal agents arrested John Bennett in Virginia Beach, where he has worked as assistant principal at Kempsville High School since 2009.
Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin emphasized the severity of the allegations, noting that a school administrator is among the accused. 
“It’s chilling that a human being, much less a child educator, would plot to ambush and kill ICE law enforcement officers — offering such specifics as to getting a high caliber rifle that would pierce the law enforcements’ bullet proof vests,” McLaughlin said. She credited Homeland Security Investigations and local police for quickly intervening.
DHS highlighted what it described as a sharp rise in violence targeting ICE employees, pointing to internal figures showing “a more than 1,150% increase in assaults” and an “8,000% increase in death threats” in recent years. 
McLaughlin said officers have faced bounties placed on their heads, threats to their families, stalking and doxxing.
Federal authorities did not say whether the brothers were connected to any organized extremist group. Both men were charged under Virginia law with conspiracy to commit malicious wounding. Court dates have not yet been set.
The case echoes other recent incidents in which immigration authorities have been targeted. 
On July 4, authorities say a group of suspects launched a coordinated attack on the Prairieland ICE detention facility in Alvarado, Tx., using fireworks as a diversion before opening fire on responding officers; the FBI later arrested 10 of 11 alleged participants, who now face local terrorism charges, according to ICE and federal court documents.
More broadly, judges and federal agents have reported increased online threats tied to political grievances, according to data and analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice and its research partners.
DHS did not release possible motives in the most recent case, and court filings have not yet been made public. The agency said only that the Virginia Beach Police Department and local law enforcement assisted in the investigation and arrests.

This story was originally published by The 19th.
Content warning: This story contains graphic depictions of violence.
Tuesday, Nov. 11, should have been an ordinary workday for 20-year-old Amber Czech, who worked as a welder at a manufacturing facility in Cokato, Minnesota.
She loved her craft and taught welding at her old high school on days she had off. But she was also a rarity. Women make up just 6% of welders in the country, and, as with other male-dominated occupations, it came with the risk of isolation and bullying.
It was a reality of the job that for Czech turned deadly. While she was at her work station that day, a man she worked with walked over to her, picked up a sledgehammer and bludgeoned her to death. He later told law enforcement he simply did not like her and had been planning to murder her for some time.
As the news spread across social media, stories poured in on Instagram and TikTok from tradeswomen expressing their anger and frustration. Over the last week they have shared their own experiences of working with men who threatened them, made sexual advances or joked about their incompetence. They pondered how their story could have ended differently, how their life could have ended like Czech’s.
Angie Cacace, a carpenter from North Carolina, was one of those women who was deeply saddened by Czech’s death. “It hit me pretty hard. I probably have cried about it every day,” she said. “I’ve had altercations with men on job sites so I know that exists.”
Despite the issues she’s faced in the industry, Cacace loves the work and credits carpentry with helping her buy her first home. Now she operates a successful remodeling company.
In 2019, she co-launched a media company and, more recently, a magazine called Move Over Bob, aimed at showing the possibilities of tradeswork to girls in high school and community college. Only about 4% of tradesworkers are women, but if they can find their way into the field, the jobs, which do not require a degree, offer middle-class wages, pensions and other benefits that are often not available in women-dominated industries like caregiving or the service industry.
But Czech’s death has Cacace questioning the workplace she’s urging girls to enter.
“She did everything that we want these girls to do. She did a high school welding program. She went to a community college,” she said. “It’s just a sharp reminder that there’s just a lot of work to do and figuring out how to better advocate and make sure that these young women are safe.”
Czech’s death has opened up a wound that never really closed for tradeswomen. In 2017, 32-year-old Outi Hicks, an apprentice carpenter, was murdered at her workplace by a coworker in Fresno, California. Her death sparked similar outrage and helped spur programs like the “Be That One Guy” campaign, which includes training for bystander intervention in the workplace.
“But there’s a whole host of incidents that have occurred between the Outi Hicks horror and what just transpired,” said Rita Brown, president of the National Association of Women in Construction (NAWIC). “Change has been slow, and clearly it’s not enough.”
Instagram posts from tradeswomen across the country share reactions to the killing of Amber Czech, honoring her and calling attention to safety issues in the trades. Editor’s note: Comments have been blacked out to protect commenters’ privacy.

In 2023, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) published a report detailing the harassment women and people of color continue to face in the construction trades. It included accounts of sexual harassment like groping and lewd comments, as well as racist incidents. In 2021, a survey conducted by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research found that more than a quarter of women tradesworkers who responded said they were “always or frequently harassed” for being a woman.
While there are several programs developed by women and trades organizations to promote a safer and more inclusive workplace, there is no real federal policy or legislation that provides adequate protections, advocates say. Instead the work has happened at the grassroots level.
Now organizations like NAWIC are calling for construction companies, unions and the industry as a whole to enforce stricter workplace standards. “It is incumbent on all of us that are in leadership, that are in any kind of place of power in the ecosystem of the construction industry, to enforce this zero-tolerance policy,” Brown said.
The Tradeswomen Taskforce, an advocacy group, plans to draft a resolution, which they want these same organizations to adopt, that promotes a safe workplace for women.
Amy Roosa, who works in risk control for the construction industry, said that workplace violence should be treated as a safety hazard. “It’s a ticking time bomb at the end of the day that this is going to happen to a woman,” she said. “It’s really up to the leadership team and even safety professionals to treat this like a workplace hazard.
“We need to have an intervention process. We need to have clear reporting. A woman needs to know that when she comes up and says, ‘I have a concern’ or, ‘He’s threatening me,’ that it’s taken seriously,” she added.
At the same time that tradeswomen are urging more to be done to address gender-based violence in the workplace, the Trump administration has curtailed resources.
Last fall, the Tradeswomen Taskforce and Equal Rights Advocates, a nonprofit focused on gender justice in workplaces, won a $350,000 grant to address gender-based violence in the workplace. The Trump administration abruptly canceled the program, alongside four other grants that aimed to eliminate violence and harassment in the workplace.
Part of the work would have involved helping women navigate how to file complaints or lawsuits, something that is difficult to do on a worksite because they either don’t know the proper channel to elevate a complaint or could face retaliation, said Janelle Dejan, co-chair of the task force. “Things that we do in these advocacy organizations is try to create a safer space,” she said. This includes a place where people can report anonymously or without being ridiculed for having a concern, she said.
Other safeguards that were in place to help women report abuse are no longer functioning, according to Connie Ashbrook, also with the task force. “The EEOC has been squelched,” she said.
Up until October, it didn’t have enough commissioners to issue decisions because the Trump administration fired two of the Democratic commissioners and the general counsel. One of those commissioners, Charlotte Burrows, wrote the report on women’s harassment in the trades. That report has also disappeared from the EEOC’s website.
“It just feels like, at the same time, that we’re really digging deep to work on this problem, the government is taking tools away from us,” Ashbrook said.
In the days since Czech’s death, tradeswomen from across the country have rallied in support, donating thousands of dollars to her family’s GoFundMe and wearing blue to work in her honor.

Judge Scott McAfee’s dismissal marks the end of the last criminal case facing Trump related to that year’s election. Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, requested the dismissal after concluding the case belonged in federal court.
Skandalakis named himself prosecutor in the case this month after he said he could not find another attorney willing to take the case from embattled Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 co-defendants in 2023, but Willis was removed from the case in 2024 amid questions of a conflict of interest stemming from a romantic relationship with Nathan Wade, a special prosecutor she hired for the case.

Four of the alleged co-conspirators pleaded guilty and agreed to testify against Trump and the other defendants.
Skandalakis did not express sympathy with the view, still espoused by Trump and allies, that the 2020 election had been stolen or rigged.
“Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, millions of citizens and hundreds of politicians continued to make unsubstantiated claims of election fraud,” he wrote. “In response, the Secretary of State undertook extensive audits to verify the vote count and demonstrate that no substantial voter fraud had occurred. Yet, despite these efforts and the evidence confirming a fair election, many individuals continue to believe—and may never be convinced otherwise—that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.”
Trump and the phone call
In a Wednesday motion asking McAfee to drop the charges, Skandalakis called the case unprecedented and noted that bringing a sitting president to trial in Georgia is unrealistic.
“The case is now nearly five years removed from President Trump’s phone call with the Secretary of State, and two years have passed since the Grand Jury returned charges against President Trump and the eighteen other defendants,” Skandalakis wrote.

A recording of a phone call with Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in January 2021 captured Trump pressing Georgia’s top election official to “find” enough votes to secure a Trump victory in Georgia.
“There is no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial on the allegations in this indictment,” Skandalakis continued. “Donald J. Trump’s current term as President of the United States of America does not expire until January 20, 2029; by that point, eight years will have elapsed since the phone call at issue.”
Skandalakis said that even if Trump were to face trial immediately after leaving office, arguments over presidential immunity alone would tie the case up for months or years, with no guarantee the state would ultimately prevail.
Skandalakis called the phone call “concerning,” but he said it is not a smoking gun, arguing that reasonable minds could disagree on whether Trump was calling on Raffensperger to create fictitious votes or investigate fraud that Trump sincerely but incorrectly believed was real.
“When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally,” Skandalakis found.

Skandalakis did not state whether or not he believes Trump committed crimes in his efforts to overturn the election, but he said Georgia was not the best venue to determine that.
“Elections, particularly presidential elections, are intensely contested events,” Skandalakis wrote. “All too frequently, some campaign staffers, attorneys, and supporters genuinely believe that the nation’s future is at stake if the opposing candidate prevails. Political rhetoric to mobilize voters serves a purpose, but the efforts by President Trump and his legal advisors to obstruct the counting of electoral votes on January 6th lie at the core of this case. This is also why Special Counsel Jack Smith’s federal investigation and prosecution would have been the most appropriate avenue to determine whether the actions of those involved were crimes that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”
U.S. Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith dropped that federal election interference case as well as a case alleging Trump mishandled classified documents after the president’s 2024 re-election because he concluded it would be illegal to continue prosecuting him after taking office.
Trump’s attorney, Steve Sadow, celebrated the decision to dismiss Fulton County’s case Wednesday.
“The political persecution of President Trump by disqualified DA Fani Willis is finally over. This case should never have been brought. A fair and impartial prosecutor has put an end to this lawfare,” Sadow said.
The Fulton County District Attorney’s office did not immediately return a request for comment Wednesday.
The other defendants
Skandalakis said he considered severing the other defendants from the case and prosecuting them separately from Trump, but concluded that would be “both illogical and unduly burdensome and costly for the State and for Fulton County.”

The alleged conspiracy included a wide range of acts, from a meeting of “alternate” electors who met at the state Capitol with plans to certify a false Trump victory, a harassment campaign against Fulton County election worker Ruby Freeman and the breach of elections systems in Coffee County.
Skandalakis said his examination of the case suggested the alternate GOP electors did not have criminal intent to overturn the election. He had already come to a similar conclusion last year about then-state Sen. Burt Jones, who is now lieutenant governor, after his case was splintered off.
“They genuinely and sincerely believed that their actions were a lawful component of the election contest process. Thus, I find no criminal intent concerning the meeting of the Republican Electors and their plan to preserve an election challenge by casting their ballots for President Trump,” Skandalakis wrote.
With regards to the Coffee County breach, Skandalakis noted that attorney Sidney Powell and bail bondsman Scott Hall, who he called “the primary architect of the scheme” and “a principal accomplice” were among the defendants who pleaded guilty, and Skandalakis argued that pursuing charges against small-fry defendants like former election supervisor Misty Hampton and Coffee County GOP Cathy Latham chair would not be in the state’s interest.
Skandalakis called Freeman, the Fulton County poll worker who faced harassment and intimidation, “a genuinely sympathetic figure in this matter.” But he said the defendants accused of harming her did not do so in Fulton County and that the alleged crimes against her should be prosecuted in neighboring Cobb County, where Freeman lived at the time.
Because of a measure passed this year, the defendants in the case may be able to force Fulton County to cover their legal costs. The new law allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct.
Reaction
Josh McKoon. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
The dismissal could prove a divisive conversation topic across Georgia Thanksgiving tables. Reaction to the news was split along party lines, with Republicans expressing gratitude for the decision and Democrats calling it an outrage.
“Today, as Chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, my heart swells with profound relief, unyielding gratitude, and a fierce sense of vindication for our brave patriots who have endured this dark chapter far too long,” said Georgia GOP chair Josh McKoon in a statement. “Pete Skandalakis, Executive Director of the Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, has done what justice demanded: dismissing this sham, politically weaponized criminal case against President Donald J. Trump, (former) Georgia GOP Chairman David Shafer, and our steadfast contingent of 2020 Presidential Electors.”
Charlie Bailey. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Georgia Democratic chair Charlie Bailey had the polar opposite view.
“The dismissal of this case is a travesty and a slap in the face to Georgia voters,” Bailey wrote in a statement. “Donald Trump and eighteen others, including sitting State Senator Shawn Still, were indicted by a grand jury for attempting to illegally overturn our state’s election. Multiple of their co-defendants pled guilty. This misguided decision denies the people of Georgia the accountability they deserve for Trump and his cronies’ attempt to subvert their votes and silence their voices.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s child care assistance program is accepting new applications following months of campaigning by advocates who said more parents need the assistance, a move state officials said should extend aid to 75,000 children.
Human Services Commissioner Sarah Adelman said opening the program to new applicants comes with the goal of allowing applications for new children in January. Families who fall into the program’s priority groups and who complete registration in December will have the first chance to apply, she said. 
“For most New Jersey families, child care isn’t a luxury, it’s a necessity,” Adelman said in a statement. “The child care assistance program is a vital economic lifeline that helps pay for high-quality early childhood education and allows parents to continue their careers. That is why reopening applications to maximize utilization for this program is so important.” 
The program aims to help parents afford child care if they are working, in school, or in job training. Because of a $30 million funding gap that state officials attribute to increasing enrollment and shifting federal policy, the program paused applications in August. Copays for families enrolled in the program also rose after lawmakers passed a budget without enough money to cover the program’s operating costs. 
Earlier this month, advocates sent a letter to Gov. Phil Murphy, Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill, and legislative leaders urging them to increase funding for the program in the short term and to find a permanent solution to ensure child care is more affordable. 
The first priority groups include families with children from households with very low income or who are experiencing homelessness, and families with children who have special needs. Not everyone who falls into these groups will be granted assistance. 
According to 2024 U.S. Department of Labor data, families in New Jersey spend 7% to nearly 20% of their median family income on child care services. In some counties, that’s more than $16,000. 
Sen. Teresa Ruiz (D-Essex) commended the state’s decision to reopen the program to new applicants, calling it a “victory for the vitality of our families, our early childhood workforce, and our state.” 
“Child care is not just a service; it is a central cog in the system that supports our labor force, children’s academic attainment, and broader economic development,” she said in a statement. 
Families can sign up for texts or email alerts to learn when applications open on the state’s website. Registration forms will be available beginning in December.

A release from the Department of Civil Rights said the charge came in connection to a case involving a volunteer applicant, a person with quadriplegia, who was allegedly denied an accommodation for the position. The health system also allegedly asked during the interview if the person’s disability would interfere with their ability to take on the volunteer position.

“Michigan’s Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act protects residents and visitors from the automatic denial of accommodations for a disability,” Department Executive Director John E. Johnson, Jr. said in a statement. “The law requires organizations to engage in an interactive process to determine if appropriate tools or changes in policy would allow the full use and enjoyment of public resources.”
A spokesperson for McLaren health in a statement said the health system takes “any complaint of discrimination seriously and maintains zero tolerance for inequitable behavior or practices.” 
“For any patient, visitor, employee, or volunteer with a disability requiring accommodation, appropriate accommodations are provided,” the statement said. “We have always been — and remain — committed to fostering a respectful, inclusive environment for all. We are aware of the charge by the MDCR in connection with a matter previously addressed through legal channels.”
McLaren also stated that the case was originally dismissed by the MDCR for lack of merit. 
“This latest action by the MDCR is based on a circuit court decision appeal,” the health system said. “We will defend against this matter through the legal process.”
The charge was filed on Nov. 21, and will now go to a hearing before an administrative law judge, who will review the evidence and provide a recommendation to the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, the final decision-maker in discrimination complaints. There is no time limit on cases of alleged discrimination, but “efforts are made to present the matter to the Commission for consideration within 3-6 months,” the department said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8336-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 14:56:51.756182

Stuart Taylor, a former Kum & Go vice president, is suing the company and Chief Marketing Officer Tracy Ging in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, claiming there was a “blatant disparity” in how the company treated men and women.
Court records indicate Taylor was hired in 2018 as Kum & Go’s vice president of business insights and analytics and later filled the interim roles of vice president of category management and vice president of food service, while retaining his original position.

According to the lawsuit, he initially received favorable performance reviews and was designated a “shooting star” at the company, signifying the company’s recognition of his talent and potential to join the senior leadership team.
In 2020, the company hired Ging as its new chief marketing officer. The lawsuit alleges that within a few months, Ging fired the vice president of food service, Jeff Schamburger, which led to Taylor filling the position on an interim basis.
According to the lawsuit, while Taylor’s work in that role was viewed as a success, Ging stripped him of his “shooting star” designation and hired a woman to fill the position of vice president of food service. She later criticized statements made by Taylor and, the lawsuit claims, “somehow managed to accuse him of gender discrimination based on his neutral suggestion” on a marketing issue. The lawsuit alleges Ging was “accusing Taylor of being chauvinistic simply for voicing an opinion that was different than her own.”
The lawsuit also alleges Taylor “asked Ging why she had accused him multiple times of being sexist. Ging’s response was to apologize, to say that she didn’t really know, but that sometimes people just ‘need a punch in the nose.’”
In addition, the lawsuit claims Ging witnessed a female vice president berating a male colleague and did nothing to intervene, citing the alleged incident as one example of the “blatant disparity in treatment” of men and women at the company.
“Ging tolerates women disrespecting men, but even a perceived slight of a man against a woman was met with an iron fist,” the lawsuit alleges. “Taylor has also been told by another individual who worked with Ging that ‘Tracy is good at strategy, but the thing about her is she just hates men.’”
Taylor alleges Ging fired him April 2023 for pretextual reasons intended to disguise illegal gender discrimination.
A trial date has yet to be scheduled in the case.

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican and critic of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, says negotiations to end the war shouldn't reward Russia's aggression and undermine Ukraine's ability to defend itself in the future. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas joined fellow Republicans warning against negotiating an end to the Russia-Ukraine war that rewarded Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression and left Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy without effective security guarantees.
Moran, the Kansas congressional delegation’s most persistent critic of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, argued that endorsement by President Donald Trump of a deal giving into Putin’s demands would make the world more dangerous. Russia launched this invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
“Lasting peace will be achieved when the costs of continuing the war in Ukraine are unsustainable for Russia, not by acceding to Vladimir Putin’s demands,” Moran said.
Trump expressed support for a 28-point plan introduced by White House envoy Steve Witkoff after meetings with Russian officials. Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the proposal’s concessions to Russia, including ceding of Ukrainian territory. The plan also was denounced because it included a guarantee Ukraine couldn’t join NATO and failed to acknowledge other Ukrainian security interests.
“As negotiations move forward,” Moran said, “the administration must make certain Ukraine is equipped with the tools needed to defend its people and territory against ongoing aggression and demand meaningful, enduring security guarantees for Kyiv.”
In October, Moran said the United States should deliver long-range missiles to Ukraine because the armaments would “help level the battlefield as negotiations hopefully move forward.” Trump chose not to authorize shipment of cruise missiles to Ukraine.
Moran argued in July for sustained support and weapon shipments for Ukraine, because to do otherwise would send a message of weakness to the world.
“If we allow a dictator to redraw borders by force, then what message does that send to other authoritarian regimes watching closely around the globe, including China?” Moran said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Jerry-Moran-ku-cancer-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 14:56:51.756182

(Photo by Michael Moline/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis may get a chance to appoint up to 25 additional judges in his final year in office if the Florida Legislature goes along with a new request from the state Supreme Court.
DeSantis has repeatedly boasted about his efforts to reshape Florida’s judicial branch, including the state Supreme Court. Five of the seven justices on the court were appointed by the Republican governor. The court has made several crucial rulings including one that undid previous decisions on abortion.
Justice Charles Canady announced this month he will step down in January to take a position at the University of Florida. DeSantis will get the chance to name Canady’s replacement.
The state Supreme Court on Wednesday certified the need for 13 circuit court judges and 12 county court judges. The bulk of the court’s request centered on Florida’s 20th Circuit where the court said there is a need to appoint 8 judges in the circuit that covers southwest Florida. The court request also asked for multiple county judges in Duval, Miami-Dade, and Orange counties.

This is the second year in a row the Supreme Court has made a substantial request for new judges. Last year the court found the need for a total of 50 judges spread between circuit courts, county courts, and appeals courts.
The Legislature ultimately agreed to authorize a total of 39 judgeships and many of those have yet to be filled by DeSantis.
New judgeships are filled by gubernatorial appointment, although those appointed to county and circuit posts must be retained by the voters.
Annually the court looks at judicial caseloads and gets reports from the chief judges in each judicial circuit. In its latest set of recommendations the court stated it is “mindful of the state’s current fiscal climate and projected budget shortfalls in subsequent fiscal years and recognizes that establishing new judgeships results in operational and potential fiscal impacts for justice-system partners.”
The Office of State Courts Administrator reports that Florida has 1,060 authorized judgeships not counting those at the state Supreme Court.

 Book signing in Ashland

Student poets and author Jacqueline Hamilton will be signing “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky” from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6, at the Highlands Museum & Discovery Center in Ashland as part of a downtown holiday  celebration. 

Six new poets from Appalachia — all girls and young women — arrived at the recent Kentucky Book Festival at Joseph-Beth Booksellers in Lexington in various parts shy, talkative, nervous and excited about their first poems appearing in the book, “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky.”
Some were still in grade school, the others in middle and high school. They took a seat among about 150 adult writers in a large, open room filled with books, book talk, hope, fear and enduring literary aspirations. The usual stuff.
Each young poet was seated in turn next to their mentor and book creator, Jacqueline Jane Hamilton, 70, a retired Eastern Kentucky University English teacher for whom her students use the more affectionate label Miss JJ. An Ohio native, she has a broad writing background, including journalism, community relations at the Dallas Fire Department, a Rotary International Journalism Fellowship in England, an MFA in nonfiction writing and a doctorate in higher education.
Hamilton’s life has now mostly come down to one thing. Giving back to the alphabet. Creating and preserving writing and poetry from the Kentucky mountains by helping foster a new generation of poets. Her claim, offered on the back page of the book, goes, “Women of Appalachia Kentucky — young and old — can reimagine the world with pencil and paper.”
“I would love to expand this work,” said Hamilton, “and feature more women writers and activists from around Kentucky and Appalachia. I started in my home county of Clark and moved east. I got three libraries, a school and a museum that jumped on the chance to help.”

Along with her teaching and writing she has created and performed portrayals of Boston journalist and social reformer Alice Lloyd, who co-founded Alice Lloyd College in Pippa Passes in Knott County, in 1923, and Louisville novelist and detective writer Sue Grafton. There’s the non-profit Why We Write Inc. she helped create for the book sales and fundraising. Add  the “Inkspire Camps” for other young writers, scheduled for June and July in Lexington and Winchester. With the “Revolutionary Kid Dreaming” writing camps for boys and girls coming this spring to honor the nation’s 250th birthday.
Bringing it all home, she used as her teaching role models the life stories of seven Appalachian heroines: Cora Wilson Stewart, Effie Waller Smith, Jean Bell Thomas, Ollie “Widow” Combs, Harriette Arnow, Verna Mae Stone and Jean Ritchie. Each story was read to the students as part of a larger program, “Appalachia Girl Dreaming,” to find and inspire young female student writers to continue the women’s  tradition. All part of her book, “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky,” a title inspired by the classic “A Tree Grows in Brooklyn” — a metaphorical analogy of survival, growth and eventual success from an often-difficult environment. Read New York city streets or Appalachian hills.
Ollie Combs, one of the Appalachian heroines the girls study, lay in front of a bulldozer to protect her land in Knott County from a coal company that planned to strip mine it. She was forcibly removed, arrested and spent Thanksgiving 1964 in jail. Among the notes posted to “Widow Combs:” “You were so brave for doing what you did” and “Were you fearful that the officers would physically hurt you in any way?” (Photo courtesy of Why We Write)
Hamilton was also inspired by a 2014 collection of autobiographical poetry titled “Brown Girl Dreaming” by Jacqueline Woodson, poetry she saw as a strong mentoring text for young students. Seeking further homegrown inspiration, the first page of Hamilton’s book is a poem from Kentucky legend Wendell Berry, “How to be a Poet.” Who else to talk poetry? Its message to all writers goes: 
Accept what comes from silence.
Make the best you can of it.
Of the little words that come
out of the silence, like prayers
prayed back to the one who prays,
make a poem  that does not disturb
the silence from which it came.
Hamilton had somewhat similar thoughts:
“Í wrote the book because I was frustrated by so many students thinking that writing was horrible, boring, difficult, not worthwhile. Kids telling me they don’t need to learn because AI will do it, like a calculator does math.
“I am a firm believer that reading and writing poetry can help write all sorts of things, so I wanted to focus on teaching  about poetry which allows students to use unusual moves as compared to sentences in academic writing. Then I had a belief that if these folks saw their work in print — in an actual beautiful book — they would be encouraged to keep writing.”
Pushing ahead, she received an $18,000 grant from Steele-Reese Foundation, a charitable trust with deep roots in Appalachia. That led to inexpensive, weekly workshops where each young participant received a copy of “Brown Girl Dreaming,” art supplies and six to eight hours of personal instruction. Add singing, fun skits and two copies of “A Pencil Grows” in Kentucky.

The workshops were focused on Hamilton’s three foundations of writing: listening, landscape and language. It stressed poetic listening  to the landscape — often a missing link in good writing — along with its visual cues. Her editing includes changing an old baseball metaphor, “Three strikes and you’re out,” to “Three strikes and you’re in,” giving each student three chances at editing her poem to make it better. Then add a few more strikes if required.
As a result, several hundred poems by 70 young students from Bath, Boyd, Carter, Clark, Fleming, Montgomery and Rowan counties made their way into “A Pencil Grows in Kentucky.” With a half-dozen of those young poets sitting next to Miss JJ at the Kentucky Book Festival. Signing the pages on which their poetry appeared as the book buyers — and proud parents — stopped by. Certifying  them as Published Authors. Part of  Kentucky’s finest book festival. An opportunity so many writers of any age never get.
Hamilton’s help doesn’t end there:
“I also want my young women poets to not think of their time with Appalachia Girl Dreaming as a one and done experience. I have sprinkled Love Notes to participants throughout the book. Encouraging notes are a powerful tool that teachers and families should use more often.”
She followed that advice in her book with a Japanese proverb: “One kind word can  warm three winter months.”
The poems in the book are  living examples of the success of Hamilton, and so many others involved in the various projects. Some poems are surprising in their depth. A few offered a little humor. Many focused on home, family, gardens, the weather, the moment. Other young poets wrote of the mountains rising above them, the shelter offered, the being there with them.
Wandering through the poems in a 240-page book, you find certain sentences, even phrases, that work, each one offering a thought, a smile, a memory, even a warning.
“To be silent is to be ignored.” 
“I am from those moments across time.”
“Fabric woven gently like time’s old cloth.”
“So when you find what’s real, keep it close.”
“I sleep in a purple room with teal bed covers.”
“Disappear is just a word.”

Then, the longer pieces of their poems offer a larger time and place.:
Arsema Haset Smith-Mensah, a 12th-grader from Boyd County writes in “My Claim:”
People see me,
And, yes, see my father.
I have his nose and last name.
But when I look in a mirror
I see coily hair and a toothy grin.
I know I am my mother’s daughter.
Ella Kaufer,  ninth grader from Rowan County wrote “Baked.”
Mountains hold the stories 
of footprints stirred into the dirt –
of people who
chopped its trees,
lived in its caverns,
rested in its shade.
The mountains hold the stories
of those who have traveled 
and have baked their steps
Into earth’s very foundation.

You held me inside for nine months
Now I’m growing older.
I try to help and wonder –
Is it enough?
I don’t want you to hold sadness inside
While you still take care of me
I just hope you know –
You mean everything to me.
Grayce Newcome, a Boyd County 12th-grader, wrote of “The Wooden Porch Swing,’ and wanting to sit on it with “Papa” after a long day of work, the family arguing over who will join him.

all fit together like 
a porch puzzle,
as we sit
on the wooden swing

The sun dancing softly
Through whispering trees
I long to lose my cares where wild creeks roam
Where rivers sing and the hills call me home.

(Photo by Steve Hillebrand/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The state of Alaska is asking a federal appeals court to re-examine a district court decision that denied the state almost 20,000 acres of potentially oil-rich land. 
On Monday, the Alaska Department of Law filed a notice of appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in an 11-year-old lawsuit that is attempting to fix the location of the western border of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
That border has been disputed between the state and the federal government for decades and matters because the land in the disputed area is believed to contain significant amounts of oil.
“The public land order that created ANWR placed its western boundary on the ‘extreme west bank of the Canning River.’ Despite this clear language, the Bureau of Land Management had placed the boundary on the western bank of a separate and distinct river — the Staines — and the federal court got it wrong too,” the Department of Law said in a statement. “This dispute affects approximately 20,000 acres of Alaska’s lands, which are believed to have valuable oil and gas reserves.”
If the land is not within the refuge, it would still be federally owned but could be selected for eventual transfer to the state. 
A ruling in the state’s favor might eventually result in oil and gas drilling that would generate millions of dollars in state and local revenue.
A ruling in the federal government’s favor would either protect the land from development or allow oil and gas development under the federal government’s controversial and legally challenged refuge drilling plan.
The appeal comes less than 30 days after District Court Judge Judge Sharon Gleason entered a judgment against the state and in favor of the federal government.
No schedule has yet been set for proceedings in the circuit court.

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is among more than 20 Democratic state elected officials suing the Trump administration to block an abrupt change in the allocation of federal funds to address homelessness.
Housing advocates warn that the administration’s decision, announced Nov. 13, to shift billions of dollars in grants could put as many as 170,000 formerly homeless people back on the street. 
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleged the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is violating the intent of Congress by moving grants away from providing permanent housing.
Beshear in a statement provided in a press release called the funding shift “illegal and cruel” and said it would “cause more people — like veterans and families — to go homeless and make our communities less safe.” 
Many Kentuckians at risk of returning to homelessness because of federal funding switch

“We should be helping people get back on their feet through a safe place to call home, not barring them from any chance of success. These policy changes are wrong and dangerous, and they will set our commonwealth and country back,” Beshear said.
For more than a decade, HUD has put about 90% of funding through what’s known as Continuum of Care grants toward “permanent, supportive housing” which provides people — often those who have spent years on the streets and need mental health care — with a safe place to live and services such as counseling and financial education. The move by HUD would allow only 30% of the grants to go toward permanent housing. Most of the money would instead go to short-term, “transitional” housing aimed at getting people into jobs and in charge of their own housing.
Kentucky housing aid advocates previously told the Lantern the policy change would put more people at risk of homelessness. At stake is much of about $48 million that flows to Kentucky each year in HUD money, with the largest portion, $23 million, going to Louisville.
In Kentucky, around 3,700 individuals with disabling conditions live in permanent, supportive housing, which advocates say has proven to be the best solution for preventing homelessness. “We know that permanent housing is the solution to homelessness,” said Catherine McGeeney, communications director for the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates HUD funding for the area. “It effectively ends homelessness.”
The changes would affect a wide range of programs throughout Kentucky, said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, including housing help offered by domestic violence, veterans and mental health groups as well as agencies that directly serve the homeless. 
“There are folks who without this program would be homeless. They most likely will be homeless again without rent support and case management,” said Bush.
HUD Secretary Scott Turner in a press release announcing the policy change said it would stop “the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values and incentivized never-ending government dependency.”

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Following the busiest year on record for the U.S. National Park Service, which saw more than 331 million visitors in 2024, the Department of the Interior announced this week changes to how national parks will be accessed next year.
The major change is the implementation of resident and nonresident fees for national parks, an idea the federal government proposed earlier this summer.
While entry costs and annual passes for U.S. residents will not change, nonresident visitors will pay a higher rate to increase funds that support maintenance of the park system.

Starting Jan. 1, nonresident visitors will pay $250 for an annual America the Beautiful pass, while U.S. residents will continue to pay $80. The annual passes allow a vehicle, or four individuals, to access more than 2,000 recreation sites managed by federal agencies including DOI, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
In addition to the increased cost of annual passes, the nation’s 11 most visited national parks will charge $100 to nonresidents, on top of the standard entrance fee, which is $35 for a private vehicle at the most popular parks such as Yellowstone National Park and Glacier National Park.
Both of Montana’s national parks are among the top-10 most visited, with Yellowstone ranking fourth in 2024 with 4.7 million visitors, and Glacier ranking 10th, with 3.2 million.
“President Trump’s leadership always puts American families first,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement. “These policies ensure that U.S. taxpayers, who already support the National Park System, continue to enjoy affordable access, while international visitors contribute their fair share to maintaining and improving our parks for future generations.”
The department said in a press release that the “America-first entry fee policies” are designed to ensure “American taxpayers who already support the National Park System receive the greatest benefit.
Annual passes will continue to be offered at a discounted price for seniors, and for free for military members, U.S. residents with permanent disabilities, all U.S. 4th grade students, and federal recreation site volunteers.
The international surcharge for park visitation is an idea long championed by the Property and Environment Research Center, a Bozeman-based “free market environmentalism” nonprofit think-tank.
PERC has advocated for changes to the NPS fee structure for years as a way to increase budgets and address growing backlogs of maintenance at National Parks at a time when visitation is routinely breaking records, and published a report earlier this year that considered different fee structure scenarios.
Using Yellowstone as an example, a $100 international surcharge for visitors could raise an additional $55.2 million in entry fees for the park, while only leading to a decrease of roughly 57,000 visitors, PERC estimated.
“The status quo is not one of sustainable and proper management of these sites,” Tate Watkins, a research fellow at PERC, told the Daily Montanan earlier this year. “The current model just doesn’t keep up with it.”
Other countries have similar fee structures that charge international visitors higher prices, including the often-cited Galapagos Islands, where Ecuadorian adults pay $30 to visit, while foreign tourists pay $200.
There is a similar system in place in Montana to access state parks, where residents pay a $9 annual fee with their vehicle registration and can access state parks all year. Nonresidents, however, are charged $50 for an annual fee or $8 per entrance.
Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, praised the move on Wednesday.
“President Trump and Secretary Burgum are putting Americans first by asking foreign visitors to pay their fair share while holding entrance fees steady for the American people,” Zinke and West Virginia Rep. Wes Moore said in a joint statement. “This policy ensures that our beautiful national heritage is preserved and the critical maintenance backlog is addressed so that America’s national parks will remain affordable, well-maintained, and financially sustainable for generations to come. We owe it to future generations of Americans — our children and grandchildren — to ensure our beautiful natural heritage that God created is well preserved.”
Zinke and Moore introduced the “Protecting America’s Treasure by Raising Inflow from Overseas Tourists (PATRIOT) Parks Act earlier this year, which would codify the foreign fees to national parks.
Companion legislation in the Senate was introduced by U.S. Sens. Tim Sheehy of Montana and Jim Banks of Indiana.
More changes, digital first
Another part of the changes include a modernization of park passes, including offering digital America the Beautiful passes.
The passes will be fully available in a digital format through Recreation.gov, as opposed to visitors having to purchase a hard copy. Similar to using a digital wallet or a mobile ID app, visitors can store their passes on a phone and they can be used to enter federal recreation sites.
The America the Beautiful pass will also cover the entrance fee for up to two motorcycles.
New designs for the the annual passes have also been unveiled by the Department.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Glacier_sign_2-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

Alan Schmidt, who filed the lawsuit, said Rankin County deputies beat and sexually assaulted him in late 2022. Three of the involved deputies were sentenced to federal and state prison terms last year, in part for their role in the incident. They are also defendants in the lawsuit.
In the lawsuit, which represents one side of a legal argument, Schmidt alleged that the department was responsible for a pattern of misconduct by deputies and jail guards, listing several other lawsuits against deputies and county jail guards. 
While he’s seeking an unspecified amount of compensation for his own pain and suffering, he said he is also filing the lawsuit on behalf of everyone who has been abused by the sheriff’s department.
“There are many things that go on in this county that have gone on for many years,” Schmidt said. “I want justice for everyone that has been wronged.”
The department did not respond to a request for comment. 
In December 2022, deputies pulled Schmidt from his car and beat him while he was handcuffed, the lawsuit alleges. One deputy pressed his arm into an anthill, and former narcotics investigator Christian Dedmon fired a gun near Schmidt’s head while interrogating him about the location of stolen tools he believed Schmidt had taken. 
Dedmon punched Schmidt and shocked him several times with Deputy Hunter Elward’s Taser, then pulled out his own genitals and attempted to rub them in Schmidt’s face, the lawsuit claims.
Dedmon pleaded guilty to violating Schimdt’s constitutional rights, but has since denied the sexual assault. Former deputies Hunter Elward and Daniel Opdyke pleaded guilty to failing to stop the beating, according to court documents.  
The deputies also pleaded guilty to a separate late-night raid of the home of Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, two Black men who were tortured and called racial slurs for hours by five deputies and a Richland police officer in early 2023. 
Schmidt’s lawsuit is the latest in a series of allegations from people who say they were brutalized by Rankin County sheriff’s deputies and guards at the county jail, which is run by the sheriff’s department. 
An investigation by Mississippi Today and The New York Times found that the Rankin County deputies, some of whom referred to themselves as the Goon Squad, had been torturing people they suspected of using drugs for nearly two decades. 
The Justice Department launched an investigation into a potential pattern of civil rights violations at the department last year. That investigation is ongoing. 
Dedmon has since said publicly that the abuses he participated in were part of a widespread practice at the department, where deputies would routinely enter homes illegally, beat people and humiliate them to extract information and scare criminal suspects out of the county.
A recent investigation by the publications found that for years, guards and administrators at the Rankin County jail brutalized the inmates in their care, sometimes enlisting other inmates with special privileges, called trusties, to help them beat inmates who broke jail rules. 
Schmidt’s attorney, Trent Walker, who has represented several people who say they were brutalized by the sheriff’s department, said Schmidt’s case proves the entrenched culture of violence at the agency. 
“The case puts the lie to any claim that what happened to Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker was isolated,” he said. “ I want the citizens of Rankin County, specifically, to be able to look at this case and the other cases and say that it’s enough, it’s time for a fresh start.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/26120620/GOON-SQUADSchmidt_10.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)More bad news for Rhode Islanders struggling to pay their energy bills: Hikes are coming.
Rhode Island Energy unveiled its long-anticipated request to increase service charges for gas and electric customers in a press release the day before the Thanksgiving holiday. An application was simultaneously submitted to the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission for review.
The documents were not immediately available from the commission Wednesday morning. Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, declined to provide a copy when asked.
If approved, the increases would take effect in September 2026. The average residential electric customer would see their monthly bills rise $7.78, or 4.83%, while a typical residential gas customer would pay $343.53 more per year, a 20.6% increase, according to Rhode Island Energy.
Gov. Dan McKee blasted the proposal in a statement released just after 1 p.m.
“This is not the time for a utility rate increase,” McKee said. “With costs rising nationwide and families already burdened, my focus remains fixed on affordability for every Rhode Islander.”
Anticipating the fury coming its way, Rhode Island Energy President Greg Cornett attempted to justify the proposal by highlighting the benefits for customers. 
“This review is about making smart, necessary investments in reliability, customer service, and safety, while also keeping affordability top of mind and strengthening support for those who need it most,” Cornett said in a statement Wednesday. “Throughout this process, we want our customers to understand that we are keenly aware of the challenges so many of them are facing, and that we are committed to keeping customers informed and helping them manage their energy costs now and into the future.”
State regulators prevented the utility supplier from asking for a distribution rate increase for the last three years under the terms of the 2022 sale of gas and electric operations from National Grid to PPL Corp., Rhode Island Energy’s parent company. 
The moratorium ends this year, and Rhode Island Energy is ready to take back what it claims it needs to offset inflation and supply chain expenses.
For example, the cost of installing a 1-mile section of underground electric cable has nearly doubled, from $12,000 in 2020 to $22,000 today, according to the company. Electric surge protectors now cost $120, compared with $60 in 2020. Upgrading natural gas pipelines now come in at nearly triple the price, the company said.
“The proposed increase is necessary for [Rhode Island Energy] to continue to meet regulatory mandates, align with the real cost of doing business, and continue delivering around-the-clock service,” the press release stated.
The company expects to generate an additional $230 million in operating revenue over a two-year period from its proposal, according to a federal financial disclosure statement also filed on Wednesday.
PPL’s profits and shareholder returns have come under scrutiny by state lawmakers and consumer advocates, who contrast company earnings with cash-strapped residents struggling to pay their winter energy bills. Electricity prices have only abated slightly since reaching record highs three years ago
Under state law, the company cannot recoup any money from its usage rates, which are instead set directly by prices from third-party suppliers. 
Adding to public fury: accounting errors which revealed the company overbilled state agencies $2 million in their 2024 energy bills. State utility regulators are reviewing complaints from residential customers who allege they have been overcharged, including on the rollout of 540,000 smart electric meters statewide.
The Public Utilities Commission has final authority over any increases in electric and gas rates. The three-person panel considers the financial solvency of the company alongside ratepayer affordability and the true necessity of proposed capital projects. Historically, the commission has trimmed some money from the original company requests to blunt the impact on ratepayers.
The last time the commission reviewed a distribution rate increase, under National Grid’s ownership, was in 2017. The approved rates were 40% less than what National Grid asked for. 
Earlier this week, Chairman Ronald Gerwatowski highlighted the commission’s ability to influence distribution of customer bill credits, which Rhode Island Energy must refund to customers under the terms of the 2022 sale. Rhode Island Energy withdrew its initial proposal earlier this month amid scrutiny over the calculations, but plans to file an alternative scheme early next year.
The discounts, which aim to shield ratepayers from company tax and accounting expenses related to the 2022 sale, could help mitigate higher service charges, Gerwatowski said Monday.
McKee pledged to “continue fighting” for Rhode Island Energy’s original $150 million bill credit plan. He also said his fiscal 2027 budget proposal, unveiled in January, will include “millions of dollars” in energy savings.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)West Virginia families statewide who have a religious or philosophical objection to the state’s school vaccination requirements must be allowed to attend school, a Raleigh County judge ruled on Wednesday.
Circuit Judge Michael Froble ruled that the West Virginia and Raleigh County school boards’ policy not to accept religious exemptions is a violation of the state’s Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023. The school boards are prohibited from enforcing the school vaccination requirements on those seeking a religious or philosophical exemption, the judge wrote.
“For the avoidance of all doubt, the Enjoined Defendants shall not prevent the Plaintiffs, members of the Class, or their minor children from enrolling in school, attending school, or participating in extracurricular sports because of their vaccination status,” Froble wrote in a 74-page ruling. 
In response to the ruling, the state Board of Education said Wednesday it is suspending the policy on compulsory vaccination requirements pending further proceedings on the matter before the state Supreme Court. 
The lawsuit brought by Raleigh County residents Miranda Guzman and Carley Hunter on behalf of their children against the school boards is at the center of a debate over West Virginia’s vaccine law and religious freedom that is likely to be determined by the state Supreme Court. 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases, including polio, measles and chickenpox. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow children to opt out of the vaccine requirements based on a religious or philosophical objection. The state has only allowed medical exemptions. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state Department of Health to allow religious exemptions. The order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act, a 2023 religious freedom law. Morrisey has not rescinded that order even though the Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have added the exemptions to state law. 
The state Board of Education earlier this year voted to instruct county boards of education not to accept religious exemptions. 
Froble in July had granted a preliminary injunction in the case that allowed students who are parties to the lawsuit to attend class while the proceedings continued. 
According to Froble’s ruling in October,  Wednesday’s ruling applies to any family who has sought, obtained or will seek an exemption to the state’s school vaccination requirements under the Equal Protection for Religion Act unless those families have received a final judgement on the merits in their own lawsuits in the matter. State Health Department officials  have said about 570 families so far sought a religious or philosophical exemption. 
In his ruling Wednesday, Froble wrote that the families’ religious beliefs and practices regarding vaccination have been “substantially burdened” by the school board’s policy not to allow them to attend school.
The state Board of Education filed a notice in September it would appeal Froble’s decision. The high court has given the school board until Dec. 12 to prepare its appeal, after which the justices will consider the case.
A handful of other lawsuits over religious exemptions have been filed in the state. Kanawha County Circuit judge Rich Lindsay last month dismissed a lawsuit filed against the Kanawha County board of education, saying that the governor does not have authority to make laws. 
In a statement Wednesday, Gov. Patrick Morrisey applauded Froble’s ruling. 
“Today’s ruling is a win for every family forced from school over their faith,” Morrisey said in the statement. “I will always take a stand for religious liberty and for the children of this state. I applaud the court for upholding West Virginia’s Equal Protection for Religion Act.”

Ziogas and former state deputy budget director Konstantinos Diamantis were scheduled to go to trial early next year, but now instead Ziogas could be a witness for the prosecution — as could his fianceé, Helen Zervas, who has already pleaded guilty to her role in the scheme.
Court officials said there is no mention in the 13-page plea agreement about whether Ziogas will be required to testify at Diamantis’ upcoming trial in the Zervas matter, and the issue was not brought up during Wednesday’s hearing. That trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 8 in Bridgeport.
Attorney Matthew Maddox, who represents Ziogas, declined to say whether his client will testify against Diamantis.
Diamantis’ Attorney Norm Pattis said Wednesday he was “surprised by the plea.”
“I fully expect that he will be called to testify at the trial, and I look forward to cross examining him,” Pattis said.
Diamantis has already been convicted of bribery and extortion for his role in steering school construction contracts, but Judge Stefan Underhill, who presided over the first trial, has postponed that sentencing until after the next trial.
Diamantis, the former deputy secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, is also facing bribery, extortion and filing a false statement charges in the Zervas case. Diamantis is currently free on a $500,000 bond.
Ziogas appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert M. Spector during his change of plea hearing in U.S. District Court in New Haven on Wednesday. Spector quizzed Ziogas about whether he understood what he was pleading guilty to and then asked Ziogas to describe in his own words what he had done.
“I participated in a scheme with Helen and Kosta to try and have him suppress some activity in Medicaid charges that she was facing,” Ziogas said, adding “we paid him (Kosta) to help influence the outcome of the audit.” 
When asked by the judge what he had specifically done, Ziogas added, “Helen gave me money, and I gave it to Kosta — maybe $100,000.”
[The Kosta Diamantis timeline]
Ziogas also pleaded guilty to providing a false statement to FBI agents and to bank fraud for taking $5,500 out of an account that he was the trustee of without the client’s knowledge.
Ziogas is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 18. Under the plea agreement, he is facing between 70-87 months in prison. Ziogas was allowed to remain free on the $500,000 bond that has been in place since his arrest last February.
The case has its roots in a Medicaid audit that was scheduled in early 2020.
It was during the height of COVID, in May 2020, when Diamantis and Ziogas hand-delivered a check for nearly $600,000 to DSS in order to reimburse the state Medicaid program for services that Zervas improperly billed.
After that check was delivered to the state Department of Social Services office in Hartford, the audit into Zervas’ optometry practice was dropped, which prevented state auditors from combing through her records and potentially clawing back even more money for the state.
The CT Mirror reported that the audit of Bristol Eye Care was the only one that DSS canceled over a five-year period. 
Diamantis and Ziogas previously told the CT Mirror that there was nothing illegal about the $600,000 payment, and they said their involvement had nothing to do with the agency ending the scheduled audit of Zervas’ practice.
“They can look at whatever they want,” Ziogas said in an interview at his Bristol home in 2023. “I’ve got nothing to hide.”
Zervas pleaded guilty last February to health care fraud charges and admitted that she conspired with a former state lawmaker and former high-ranking Connecticut employee to pressure officials at the state’s Medicaid agency to cancel an audit that was examining Medicaid overpayments at her optometry practice.
At that time, federal prosecutors would not identify those public officials. But less than three weeks later, Ziogas and Diamantis were indicted.
Zervas admitted that she intended to bribe Diamantis, “the high-ranking state official,” into pressuring state employees at DSS.
She eventually paid Diamantis $95,000. Much of it passed through Ziogas and was taken from her business Family Eye Care, according to the indictment.
The last payment of $65,000 to Diamantis was made three days after the two men hand-delivered the check to DSS.
In total, the federal prosecutors alleged Zervas fraudulently billed the state’s Medicaid program on more than 300 occasions between 2015 and 2020. She did the same for Medicare patients, but less frequently. 
Diamantis and Ziogas have been close associates for some time. When Diamantis’ daughter Anastasia needed an attorney during an investigation into how she got a job in former Chief State’s Attorney’s Richard Colangelo’s office, it was Ziogas, who did not have a law license at the time, who represented her. 
Ziogas served three terms as the state representative for the 79th District in Bristol before leaving office in January 2023.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ziogas-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Some Montana residents may receive a holiday bonus thanks to the Office of the Commission of Securities and Insurance. 
A coordinated multi-state task force, which included the Montana Auditor’s Office, had been investigating five major brokerage firms for allegedly charging unreasonable minimum commissions in violation of federal law and totaling nearly $19 million. 
This summer, the task force announced settlements with the five firms, and Montana Auditor James Brown told the Daily Montanan this week that the next phase — letting Montanans know if they were affected and getting them their money back — is underway. 
“We take our consumer protection role pretty seriously at this agency and we have some really good news to announce to folks who have been wronged,” Brown said in a phone interview. “… We are glad we are able to do our duty as Montana’s watchdog, protect Montanans’ money and hold firms accountable.”
Brown said that roughly $160,000 of Montanans’ money was recovered in restitution and will be paid back from the brokerage firms. 
His office is sending out letters to all Montanans who were affected customers, letting them know they’ll be reimbursed their dollars. Some brokerage firms may have checks in the mail or will deposit money directly into accounts, he said. 
“We’re going to be giving a number of Montanans some good Thanksgiving news,” Brown said. 
Earlier this year, the auditor’s office announced national settlements with five major firms — Edward Jones, LPL Financial, RBC Capital Markets, Stifel, Nicolaus and Company, and TD Ameritrade. 
Securities regulators from Alabama, Iowa, Massachusetts, Missouri, Texas and Washington, as well as Montana, had investigated allegations that the firms had charged unreasonable minimum commissions to retail customers that often exceeded 5% of the principal amount on small equity trades. 
From 2018 to 2025, according to the investigations, the five firms collectively charged nearly $19 million in excessive commissions across more than 1.1 million transactions. 
Brown said that in Montana, the five firms collectively mischarged more than 8,000 transactions resulting in $160,000 in restitution for Montana victims. 
Under the settlements, the companies have also agreed to pay administrative fines, cover investigative costs to the states, review their policies and compliance systems, and are censured, and must permanently cease and desist from charging unreasonable commissions. 
“This settlement with these firms on these transactions that violated federal law is just another step we’ve taken since I became commissioner to hold Wall Street firms accountable when they engage in wrongdoing,” Brown said. “If a firm overcharges Montana investors, they can expect a knock on the door from my team.”
Brown added that additional investigations are still underway with other, unnamed companies. 
The commissioner’s office is asking Montanans to check their mailboxes for the letters from the office informing them if they are covered by the settlements, and to check for checks or brokerage statements if they are expecting to receive restitution. 
Residents can contact the state securities and insurance office via email at csi.securities@mt.gov or by calling 406-444-2040.
Earlier this year, the auditor’s office announced a multi-state settlement with Edward Jones following an investigation into the brokerage charging front-load commissions. 
Another settlement, announced in May,  with the Vanguard Group, Inc, resolved an investigation into capital gains tax distributions from retirement funds back in 2021.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_7117-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 13:56:54.786011

What happened when he went to pay at the counter left […],"The cost of essentials is increasingly out of reach for many Kansas City families as costs outpace wages (Naomi O'Donnell/The Beacon).Chris Meyers is a federal employee who was working without a paycheck during the government shutdown. The former co-owner of Crane Brewing swallowed his pride to buy reduced-priced $6 meals at a local grocery store to stretch the family budget at an uncertain moment.
What happened when he went to pay at the counter left him slack-jawed.
The cashier told him that a stranger had already paid for hundreds of meals. Meyers insisted on paying so someone even less fortunate could get a free dinner.
But the random act of kindness overwhelmed him.
“I just immediately started tearing up and almost had to step out of line,” Meyers told The Beacon. “Sometimes you don’t realize you’re right on the edge until one more straw on the camel’s back. It just really hit, knowing how much that hopefully meant for people who are in even worse positions.”
The financial anxiety Meyers describes is borne out by numbers that show that roughly half of us are struggling to make ends meet.
A new report from the Urban Institute found that 52% of American families earn less than what researchers call the “true cost of economic security” — meaning they don’t make enough to cover all their regular bills, pay for necessities and still have money left over to save for emergencies. In Kansas that number is 46.9%, and in Missouri 48.6% of people are in a similar position.
“I think more people are living paycheck-to-paycheck than would like to admit it,” Meyers said. “The cost of everything being more expensive is really tough.”
Rising costs coupled with stagnant wages are putting a squeeze on working people across the spectrum in Kansas City. The squeeze is reflected in the hard choices people are making as they grapple with higher costs for housing, groceries, health care and child care.
 Brutal math


The most glaring reason for this burgeoning affordability crisis is that wages have not grown as fast as prices for the basics working people buy.

The Urban Institute’s affordability tracker says that nationally, the average monthly grocery bill is up 32% while wages have only gone up 29% since 2019.
“I saw where a pound of ground beef was almost as expensive as the federal minimum wage,” Meyers noted.
But it’s not just groceries.
Nationally, the rising cost of essentials from January 2017 to August 2025 outpaced wage growth during the same time period:

The cost of child care for two children has risen 40%.
Rent jumped 50%.
Home sale prices have surged by 80%.
And the lowest-priced “silver” plan on the health care marketplace went up by 41%.

Wages, meanwhile, only rose by 38%.
Locally, Kansas City-area workers are also paid less than workers in similar cities. According to the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC), average hourly earnings here run 15% to 20% below peer metros like Minneapolis and Denver.
Frank Lenk, MARC’s director of the Office of Economic Research, told the 2025 KC Economic Outlook event this month that the Kansas City labor market is weakening. He also noted that the area’s economic recovery from the COVID pandemic has been slower than in the rest of the U.S.
“This is a classic Kansas City story,” Lenk said. “We don’t bust as low. … But we don’t boom as high.”
Lenk said that economic boom times generally last longer than busts. In Kansas City that means with each boom-and-bust business cycle, the local economy falls further behind peer metros bit by bit.
Jeremy Hill, a regional economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, told the same group that lower wages in Kansas and Missouri also mean it’s harder to attract talent to the area.
“We don’t really have a labor problem, we have a wage problem,” Hill said.



Hill said that across sectors in Missouri and particularly in Kansas, businesses have higher expectations of productivity but often aren’t willing to pay higher wages for it.
When adjusted for inflation, average wages in Kansas have risen by just $20 a week between January 2017 and August 2025. Missouri has done slightly better with an average weekly pay increase of $30 during the same nearly nine-year period.
These small wage increases come during a time when workers are as productive as ever.



“This has been a trend for a long time in the U.S.,” University of Kansas economics Professor David Slusky told The Beacon. “A trend where… the amount of stuff a worker can make is growing more than workers’ wages each year.”
Slusky said the gap between productivity growth and wage growth means that while workers produce more value, they’re not seeing that value reflected in their paychecks.
Despite doing more than ever, area workers are losing buying power for basic necessities. This makes it increasingly difficult just to stay healthy, put food on the table, take care of your children or keep a roof over your head.
 Housing price spikes


Megan Overfelt moved to Raytown, Missouri, hoping to save money before she bought a home in Johnson County, Kansas, where she grew up.

That was six years ago. She’s watched housing prices soar ever since.
“How do people get ahead in this kind of climate?” Overfelt said. “I was supposed to be here for a year or two to save money. … Now those hopes and dreams seem so far out of reach.”
Overfelt, a data entry worker in her 30s with four children, says her childhood home was approximately 1,500 square feet located in “not a big, fancy, rich part of Johnson County.” Last year it sold for $375,000.
Housing prices in the area have surged beyond what many working families can afford, pushing homeownership further out of reach (File Photo/The Beacon).
According to data from the Greater Kansas City Regional Housing Partnership, nearly two out of three owner-occupied homes are valued at $300,000 or more in Johnson County. The average sale price in the county in October of this year was $465,000, according to Redfin.
“That’s insane to me, I don’t see how normal everyday working families can move up,” Overfelt said. “It’s like we are all just stuck.”
She considers herself lucky to have a landlord who has kept her rent below the median Raytown rent of $1,213 a month. She says she has neighbors with similar layouts who pay up to $1,700 a month.
“I’ve just kind of accepted that we might be renting forever,” Overfelt said.
 Child care can cost a job


Marie H. is a single mother in her 20s who says she had to leave her job because she couldn’t afford child care.
“I’ve always made less than $20 an hour and the cheapest child care I could find was $250 a week,” she said. “I can’t find a job that pays enough to cover that and my other bills.”
Marie H. is a domestic violence survivor who is being referred to by an alias in this article for her safety. She said that after leaving a women’s shelter with her young child she’s taken to delivering food for income.
She brings her child along for deliveries, which saves her the expense of child care. Marie H. said that bends delivery app rules, but it is a risk she has to take. She told The Beacon that the gig work is inconsistent, meaning she’s working with no financial flexibility and most months she’s still falling behind.
Child care costs an average of $23,300 a year in Missouri and $24,400 in Kansas for two children. According to 2022 data from the U.S. Department of Labor, the cost of one infant’s care in Jackson County is the equivalent of 13.5% of median family income in the area.

Childcare costs consume a growing share of family budgets, with Kansas City parents paying thousands annually for care (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon).
Some parents opt out of the workforce in the face of ever-rising child care prices. The Center for American Progress estimated in 2019 that the national economy sees $57 billion a year in lost revenue, wages and productivity because of parents leaving the workforce.
Marie H. says that she has career goals and is working as much as she can, but her lack of affordable child care is holding her back.
“I’m willing to work, even as a cashier or at McDonald’s or something like that,” she said. “I just need the grace of somebody to help me with child care so I can get on my feet.”
 Health care eating wages


Rising health care costs are another squeeze point for working families. While many in Kansas City dread the prospect of health care premiums doubling next year, growing health care costs are also quietly eroding wages.
Economics professor Slusky said total compensation — a measure that includes wages plus benefits like health care — has more closely tracked productivity than wages alone.

This means employers that provide health care are putting more money towards their employees’ health insurance each year, leaving less money available for wage increases if the employer doesn’t cut elsewhere.
“Health insurance is eating up a greater share of total compensation,” Slusky said.
Kansas City Federal Reserve Senior Vice President A. Lee Smith at the KC Economic Outlook event said that higher input costs are contributing to a job market cooling at the national level. Those higher costs are being driven, in part, by recent Trump administration tariffs and employer health care expenses.
“The employer cost of health benefits is up about 6% over the past year,” Smith said. “Which is a really high pace of increase relative to what we’ve seen over the past 10 years or so.”
Meyers said his family’s health insurance premiums have nearly tripled over the past decade.
“We also just got notified that they’re going to decrease the amount they cover,” Meyers said.
Overfelt says she can afford health insurance for herself through her employer but feels fortunate to receive some federal assistance for her children’s coverage.
“I have no idea what we would do otherwise, because insurance for families through most employers is more than half your paycheck,” Overfelt said.
 Hard choices


For many, living close to the bone financially means choosing which bills to pay. Those hard choices show up in data that tracks financial distress.
Delinquent credit card debt has doubled since 2021 in both Kansas and Missouri. Now one in 20 people with a credit card in those states is 60 days or more behind on payments. The credit card delinquency increases coincide with when food prices began to jump.

Meyers says his grocery budget has nearly doubled — from $200-$300 every other week at Costco to $400-$500 now.
Families navigate grocery shopping as food costs continue to strain household budgets in the area (Chase Castor/The Beacon).
The bigger change is restaurants.
“We almost never eat out anymore,” Meyers said. “We cook pretty much everything at home.”
As a result, Meyers has chef friends he doesn’t see as much anymore.
“I have to tell them: ‘I promise you I’m not ditching you or dodging you,” Meyers said. “I still love you. I still love your food. I miss it. I just, it’s not something we can really do as much anymore.’”
Marie H. said she doesn’t have delinquent debt but she also hasn’t eaten a meal not made in her home for over a year. Financial sacrifices extend to her own health. She doesn’t even think about going to the doctor for herself.
“I basically make just enough to cover my car payment and rent,” Marie H. said. “I have zero left over for anything else.”
The crush over bills for the basics makes it even more difficult to save for a rainy day.
“I don’t think the concept of savings — no matter what level you’re on — is really a thing anymore,” Meyers said.
Overfelt has made belt-tightening decisions for her family as expenses pile up. Some months that has meant canceling a subscription, and sometimes that has meant paying late or only a partial payment until the next paycheck.
“That’s kind of been this entire last year. It’s extremely rough financially just trying to keep up,” Overfelt said. “It’s definitely a juggle each month. A lot of that boils down to making sure that the kids are fed and they have a roof over their head.”
Slusky says the good news is that the resources to address the affordability crisis exist in America. The country’s overall wealth is at an all-time high — but it’s increasingly concentrated.
“The question is what more could be done… to help those least fortunate with these resources, while maintaining the incentive structure that produces that level of wealth,” Slusky said.
He emphasizes the need for predictable, sustainable public policy rather than dramatic changes that create uncertainty for both businesses and workers.
“The resources are there,” Slusky said. “We just need the political will to try to address these concerns.”
Until paychecks catch up or costs come down, about half of Kansas City will keep choosing between eating and healing, between saving and surviving.
“Whenever you’re in a situation like this, it’s 24/7,” Marie H. said. “It’s just work. Or stress about work. Or stress about money, with no break. Everyone deserves time to take a breath.”

A memo issued this month by Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, says that all refugees admitted between Jan. 20, 2021 and February 20, 2025 will have their applications for permanent residency in the United States paused. It asserts that during those years agencies “potentially prioritized expediency, quantity, and admissions over quality interviews and detailed screening and vetting.”
Maggie Mitchell Salem, the executive director of Integrated Refugee & Immigrant Services, or IRIS, a New Haven-based resettlement agency, estimated that the reviews could affect about 2,500 people the organization settled between 2021 and 2025. 
Mitchell Salem categorized the review as the latest addition to a long line of new difficulties that refugees will now face. In January, the Trump administration suspended the refugee resettlement program, a move that is being challenged in a lawsuit. 
The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July made refugees ineligible for SNAP benefits, and they will lose eligibility for Medicaid beginning in October 2026. 
“It’s basically telling refugees, ‘Get out,’” said Mitchell Salem. 
The memo casts doubt on the quality of refugee vetting conducted during the Biden years, but Mitchell Salem said the process was comprehensive. 
Refugees to the U.S. have to be reviewed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, a government organization or a nonprofit. They then have to go through a screening process and an interview to explain why they left their country and are afraid to go back. Once they have been determined to be refugees, they have to go through a second U.S. security clearance and can then be connected with a resettlement agency. The U.S. can also prioritize certain refugees based on geographic quotas or regional priorities.
“This process is extensive. It’s multiple agencies that someone has cleared through. There are multiple interviews,” said Mitchell Salem. 
The majority of refugees resettled in Connecticut in 2024 came from Syria. A large number also came from Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Venezuela. 
The Administration for Children and Families, in which the Office of Refugee Resettlement operates, did not return a request for comment. 
Rachel Kornfeld, CEO of Jewish Family Services of Greenwich, which has resettled about 2,000 refugees since 2021, said the worst part of this new policy was the uncertainty that it brought to a group of people who had already lived through war, trauma and persecution. 
“ However their path to the U.S. came to be, it was extremely challenging and tenuous,” she said. “And then to finally be in a place of safety, working toward continued independence and building a life, and then for that to be questioned just when you started to feel comfortable and feel safe is absolutely unimaginable.”  
Kornfeld noted that it was also very difficult for refugees who had gone through trauma to be forced to retell their stories over again to people whom they may not trust. 
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said he has not seen any evidence to suggest that State Department officials had applied a lower standard during the Biden years. 
“There is not a scintilla of fact to distinguish the process applied since 2021 from the way it functioned before that date under the previous Trump administration,” Blumenthal said. “These refugees are here legally. There’s no indication they are committing criminal offenses or otherwise deserving of this kind of retroactive review, so it seems eminently unnecessary and wasteful.”
Mitchell Salem said the reviews would also contribute to further delays for people who are trying to get their green cards.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2025_0205_SR_IRISVigil_262-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 15:57:36.036454

Advocates worry the change will mean more families will go hungry, and health officials warn of the dangers of malnutrition and food insecurity. The people affected represent about 10% of the state’s residents who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Some organizations are asking state lawmakers to set up ongoing aid for people affected by the policy shift who will no longer qualify for SNAP under the new law.
“When you’ve got a family who are looking at a budget that doesn’t work — their income doesn’t balance with their expenses — they start saying, ‘What can we squeeze?’ Rent is what it is, you have no power to negotiate health insurance premiums, the cost of gas is what it is. One area where families have some flexibility to squeeze a budget down is food,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.

“They’re going to look for the cheapest options. They don’t have the luxury to look for the most nutritious food for their kids. They look for the cheapest volume of food for the dollar, and that is going to breed all sorts of problems.”
The cuts to food assistance in H.R. 1, also known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will directly affect about 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness due to new, stricter work requirements for SNAP benefits or other changes. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
“We’re going to have a whole lot of people who don’t have access to the food they need to stay healthy,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance. “People are going to eat as frugally as they can, which means a lot of really inexpensive foods that they’re able to buy because they don’t have the advantage of SNAP anymore.”

A call for action
With many poised to lose benefits, advocates are asking elected officials to create a state-funded food assistance program to fill the gap.
Since at least the 1990s, Connecticut had a state-financed food stamp program for legal immigrants who otherwise would have been eligible for the federal program but were excluded by welfare reform legislation in 1996. The legislature in August 2016 directed the state Department of Social Services to stop adding people to the program, though the initiative was funded through 2017, officials with DSS said.
In September, representatives with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance and Connecticut Legal Services sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders asking them to, among other things, establish a state-funded food assistance program for previously eligible legal immigrants and others who may lose SNAP benefits.
“We urge you to address the imminent harm to low-income CT residents that cuts to SNAP in H.R. 1 are poised to inflict. Our low-income clients depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families and depend on information and resources provided by DSS to access those benefits,” six people with those organizations wrote.
They asked that the issue be addressed in a special session that was held earlier this month, though lawmakers declined to do so. In recent interviews, advocates urged legislators to make it a priority in the regular session that begins in February.
“There is history of [a state-financed program], and we would like to see that again — a new program that essentially picks up all the folks who are no longer eligible for exemptions,” McKernan said. “We’re talking about folks who have been physical laborers their entire life, and all of a sudden, they’re getting to the stage where their bodies are giving out and they can no longer compete with younger workers. We’re talking about folks who have raised their kids or grandkids and now have an empty house and no work history. They may have kids over the age of 14, but they can’t act in that caretaker role and get SNAP.
“There are a lot of reasons why people can’t compete in the job market, and for those who are competing, the work requirements are going to be difficult, because they may have no control over their schedules or the amount of money they’re going to be making.”
H.R. 1 imposes a work requirement on adults 55 through 64 and parents with children 14 and older for the first time. It removes exemptions for veterans, people experiencing homelessness and young people who recently aged out of foster care — exemptions that were added in bipartisan legislation in 2023, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Recipients must now document 20 hours of work per week, participate in a narrow set of work activities or prove they qualify for another exemption.
The bill also ends eligibility for many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. who have been granted humanitarian protection by the federal government, including refugees, people granted asylum and certain survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, a Democrat from Middletown who is co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he and his colleagues are interested in exploring a state-funded food assistance program. Launching such an initiative would require money and software upgrades to run it, he said.
“At a time when the federal government is increasingly an unreliable partner, it’s important that we maintain the capacity to feed the residents of this state,” Lesser said. “Every week we find out new critical problems with changes in federal policy that are really hammering low-income people, and we have to figure out what the priorities are. I would argue that food, shelter and health care are all key priorities, food probably first among them.”
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, pointed to a $500 million emergency fund authorized during the special session this month as one way to help residents losing access to SNAP.
“This is an example of what the fund could be used for,” he said. “Obviously, the governor has a lot of discretion, and we have to vote on it. If the governor were to come to us and say, ‘I’d like to help out these folks who are getting kicked off SNAP,’ I would support that.”
Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, added: “I would support anything that helps us fill in some of the federal cuts, especially regarding food assistance. … To the extent that there are still gaps and problems with access to needed food, I would certainly be supportive if the governor proposes using some of the money set up in that $500 million fund.”
But Ritter warned that funding the program long-term could be too costly.
“The cuts to H.R. 1, if unchanged, by 2028 are billions of dollars, and the state does not have the ability to cover that. No state will,” he said. “But in the short term, while we see what happens in Washington, we have a fund set up to try to help people through that year.”
A spokesman for Lamont said the governor is still reviewing how to use money in the emergency fund.
“The administration is reviewing how best to utilize the $500 million reserve,” the spokesman, Rob Blanchard, said. “We will be announcing actions in the near future.”
Tong, 21 other attorneys general sue over SNAP eligibility guidance
Attorney General William Tong announced Wednesday that he and 21 other attorneys general are suing the federal government, seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that deems some immigrants ineligible for food assistance even after they become permanent residents.
In October, the USDA issued new guidance to state agencies describing changes to SNAP eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tong said the memo incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through certain pathways — including refugees, asylum recipients and others — would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents. The attorneys general argue the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose large financial penalties on states.
“The Trump Administration cannot help themselves. They are messing with SNAP benefits again. This time they are inventing their own rules to permanently ban legal immigrants — green card holders — from ever receiving food stamps,” Tong said in a statement. “There is zero basis in the law for this cruel move, and we’re suing to stop them.”

Nutrition experts share dangers of malnutrition, food insecurity
As many families brace for the loss of assistance, nutrition experts and health officials warn of malnutrition concerns and the mental health effects of food insecurity.
When people tighten their budgets, they often go without meat and fresh fruit and vegetables. Many cut down on the number of items they purchase or buy more highly processed foods that are shelf stable and last longer, experts said.
That can lead to iron deficiency, fatigue, unintentional weight loss, thinning of the bones, weakness, hair loss and brittle nails, among other symptoms. In children, it can cause developmental delays, trouble concentrating and behavioral problems.
“Malnutrition is always associated with increased health risks,” said Lora Silver, a registered dietician with Yale New Haven Health. “It’s often associated with an inflammatory state or inflammatory activity.
“We have really clear evidence that malnutrition leads to an increased risk of infections. It impairs our immune function. It also puts us at risk for loss of lean muscle mass, and there’s a host of consequences to that, because it impacts our strength, balance and our ability to avoid falls.”
Some families might lean toward purchasing foods that are calorie-dense to maintain their caloric intake but that aren’t nutrient-dense, experts said. That can lead to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
“When I was working full-time running a shelter for families experiencing homelessness, this is the part of their budget where they were looking to spend as little as possible so they could maximize what they had for rent,” Tepper Bates said. “What that meant was often, for a family with two small kids, they’re buying a 10-pound bag of white rice and five pounds of the cheapest hamburger meat they can find, and that’s going to be the basis of their food for the week. That is simply not adequate nutrition.”
Health officials say they encourage people to look toward plant-based protein sources, such as beans, legumes and tofu, that might be less costly, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables, particularly those with less additives.
“I don’t ever tell people they shouldn’t be eating canned vegetables, because if that’s what they can afford, canned vegetables are better than no vegetables,” said Diane Bussolini, a registered dietician with Trinity Health of New England. “Frozen and canned are absolutely fine.
“Also, [I recommend] buying fruits that are in season. So right now, that’s not watermelon, peaches or cherries. It’s spending food dollars on things like apples and pears and mandarins that are in season and lower costs.”
Stress and anxiety often accompany food insecurity, health officials said, and while adults may be managing the money and purchases, children also feel the effects.
“We know that children are more aware of what’s going on in their house than sometimes parents realize. Kids recognize they don’t have enough food, or that parents are stressed out,” said Dr. Jody Terranova, a pediatrician and former president of the Connecticut Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics. “There are some increased awareness and distress in children, some increase in anxiety, and in older children, there’s an increase in depression and suicidal symptoms that has been associated with food insufficiency.”
Representatives of the Connecticut Chapter of AAP issued a statement this month saying maintaining access to SNAP benefits is “critical” for the health and well-being of the state’s children.
“We urge the state of Connecticut to protect all children by prioritizing and ensuring access to essential services — starting with maintaining the food services they need to survive and thrive in school and at home,” they wrote. “Food is essential for health. Regardless of … H.R. 1 provisions, we have a duty to ensure continued access to SNAP.”
Health officials also called for more awareness of the mental health consequences of food insecurity.
“We see news reports on the prevalence of reliance on SNAP, or the prevalence of certain budget cuts and the price of food going up,” Silver said. “I wish we were talking more about some way of measuring worry and anxiety, because there are real health impacts to that, and I think adults and children experience that alike.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 16:57:39.947065

(Getty Images)The New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department this week announced $390 million in unclaimed property, and urged residents to determine if they have either money or other assets being held by the state.
The state can end up  with unclaimed property through a variety of circumstances, including death, job changes and moves. Such property runs the gamut, from money to uncashed checks to safe deposit box contents and more.
According to a news release, individual claims average $500. So far, this year, Tax and Rev has paid  6,414 claims totaling $18.5 million.
“The Taxation and Revenue Department wants to reunite owners with their lost property,” Taxation and Revenue Department Secretary Stephanie Schardin Clarke said in a statement. “The holiday season can be financially stressful, and there’s no better time to check for unclaimed property to help alleviate some of that stress.”
Search and file claims for property at: nmclaims.unclaimedproperty.com. Those claims can be made online for individuals claiming $500 or less. For those involving multiple owners, businesses or claims over $500, the state says people can submit claims via a PDF form and documentation.
Most claims are processed quickly, the state says, but the department has 90 days from submission to approve or deny it, followed by 30 days to pay it out.

The fund, provided by her parents, Melissa Stanza and Alan Haselhorst, will place an emerging journalist in a yearlong fellowship on the health team at Mississippi Today, beginning in 2026. Application information is available at this link for the fellowship, which offers journalists an immersive experience with the opportunity to report on issues including mental health, maternal health and underserved communities.
Sarah was 31 when she died in 2024 in South Carolina.
She was a native of St. Louis, Missouri and worked in health care before becoming a reporter with a passion for health journalism. She worked at the Clarion Ledger in Jackson from 2021 to 2022, where she covered the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on Mississippians and the health care system, among other pressing health topics. 
“Sarah dedicated so much of her energy and effort to shedding light on and sharing the truth about the realities too many Mississippians face when attempting to access health care, including mental health care,” said Laura Santhanam, Mississippi Today’s health editor. “It is our honor to carry her memory forward with this fellowship and to help early-career journalists continue that important work so more people in Mississippi and beyond can get the help they need.”
A graduate of the University of Missouri’s journalism school, Sarah was committed to truth and persistent in her search for it.
And though Sarah was opinionated, “she made such an effort in her reporting to be fair, to not put her perspective in there, and to give everybody a voice,” Stanza said.  
After leaving Mississippi in 2022 and moving to Hilton Head, South Carolina, to report on climate at The Island Packet, Sarah worked on a story about erosion of a barrier island owned by the University of South Carolina. The island was given to the university with the condition it remain untouched, save for the building of a lab, and that it be used for scientific and educational purposes. 
When Sarah was told she couldn’t visit the island as part of her reporting, she pushed back – and got her first inkling that there was more under the surface. 
She kept digging after publishing the first story. She interviewed the family of Philip Rhodes, the owner of Pritchards Island who donated it to the university decades ago. She also visited the island. Her months-long reporting uncovered disrepair and underfunding, in addition to a little known fact: that the deeds associated with the gift stipulated that if the University of South Carolina did not abide by its rules, Pritchards would go to the University of Georgia, Rhodes’ alma mater. 
A year after Sarah reported that story and others about the island, the South Carolina Legislature, with the support of the governor, passed a bill awarding $500,000 a year in recurring funding for Pritchards Island. The money allowed the university to revive its research efforts, which continue to this day.
A rocking chair bearing a plaque now sits on the front porch of the Beaufort College Building on the historic campus of the University of South Carolina-Beaufort. It reads: “In grateful memory of Sarah Yelena Haselhorst whose writing helped save Pritchards Island.”
The reporting by Sarah had the same kind of impact the journalists at Mississippi Today strive to achieve. The fellow will be urged to work in the same spirit as Sarah: to dig deeper, be persistent and uncover the unknown.
Stanza and Haselhorst said their daughter spoke highly of Mississippi Today when she was working in the state. The respect she held for the newsroom led them to fund a fellowship in her honor. 
“Sarah did not give her praise lightly,” Stanza said. “So when she said something was good, she really believed it was good.” 
A note Sarah wrote to readers and friends when she left Mississippi showed how deeply she was touched by her time in the state and the people she met. 
She wrote beautifully of the tragic, including the COVID-19 death of a 13-year-old girl, and the joyful, including the 100th birthday celebration of a Mississippi Delta native.    
“I hiked up to the Delta and saw high cotton, ate barbecue at a 97-year-old staple and met the bravest woman I’d ever spoken with. I went down to Biloxi to lie on the hottest sand my feet had ever encountered. Then ate some damn good fish tacos,” Sarah wrote. “I spent time with nurses, farmers, Freedom Riders, activists, people experiencing homelessness, people with fancy titles and those who were too young to talk.”
She also wrote: “The Delta is more breathtaking than you’d ever imagine. The politics more divisive. The heat and humidity more cloying. But at the crux of it all are the people. Mississippians are gracious. They share. They’re natural-born storytellers. And the people I spoke to on a regular basis craved good change.”
Stanza said Sarah always longed to return to Mississippi and to health journalism.
“It was her dream,” she said. “And in a way, now, she’s doing it.”

The Venezuelan nationals were deported under an obscure wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.“After receiving that legal advice, Secretary Noem directed that the AEA detainees who had been removed from the United States before the Court’s order could be transferred to the custody of El Salvador,” according to the DOJ filing. “That decision was lawful and was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the Court’s order.”Noem’s decision sent 137 Venezuelan men to a mega-prison for months until the Venezuelan government could broker a prison swap with El Salvador and the United States to have the men returned. In an emergency March 15 order, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg said the planes carrying the Venezuelans had to return to the United States.They did not have the opportunity to challenge their removal, which was a violation of their due process rights, the American Civil Liberties Union has argued in its case against the Trump administration. Tuesday’s filing represents a shift in legal strategy from the administration, which had initially argued that because Boasberg’s order was verbal and not written, his temporary restraining order carried no weight. Contempt probeThe filing comes after Boasberg resumed a contempt investigation to identify the Trump administration officials involved in authorizing the Venezuelans’ removals.Last week, Boasberg ordered the administration to submit filings on how to proceed with the contempt inquiry.“I certainly intend to find out what happened that day,” Boasberg said last week.Tuesday’s filing argued that contempt proceedings are not needed and that “the Government maintains that its actions did not violate the Court’s order.”The ACLU, which is representing the deported men, in its filing on the contempt issue urged Boasberg to request testimony from nine current and former officials from the Homeland Security and Justice departments. The ACLU also said the government should identify “all individuals involved in the decision… regardless of whether they were the ultimate decision-maker or had direct input into the decision, as well as all those with knowledge of the decision-making process.”Once those people had been identified, Boasberg could determine in what order testimony should be gathered.",,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Alabama’s largest electric utility has proposed delaying an approved rate increase for an extra year amid a public outcry surrounding high utility bills.
Alabama Power customers will still see an increase in bills stemming from the company’s $622 million purchase of the Lindsay Hill Generating Station earlier this year, but not for another year, if the plan is approved by the state’s Public Service Commission.
The rate increase, which Alabama Power said will raise an average customer’s bills by about $3.32 per month, was originally slated to go into effect in January 2027.

“Alabama Power made an informational filing with the Alabama Public Service Commission as part of our ongoing discussions about ways to help customers manage their power bills,” the company said in an emailed statement. “We know budgets are tight, and power bills are a real concern for many families and businesses.”
Alabama Power submitted the proposal in an informational filing with the PSC late last week.
A spokesperson for the PSC said that the proposal will “likely” be presented to the commission at its next regular meeting on Dec. 2.
“The Commissioners could approve the proposal in its current form, offer modifications to the proposal, reject the proposal or table the proposal, pending further information,” the spokesperson said via email. “Either action will require a vote.”
Environmental watchdog groups that follow the PSC cautioned that customers may still see rate increases over the next two years, even if the proposal is approved.
Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, said that Alabama Power customers’ bills include numerous rate schedules, many of which were not included in the proposal.
“To fully understand the impact of Alabama Power’s proposal, customers deserve full bill transparency, including a breakdown of each rate included in the bill and how much a customer pays for each rate,” Tidwell said in an email. “Without this information, it is difficult to understand how much of the bill will be frozen. In addition, ratepayers deserve a thorough, transparent review of Alabama Power’s proposal to determine whether rates should actually be lowered rather than held steady.”
Daniel Tait, executive director of Energy Alabama, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said no costs were being waived, only pushed down the road.
“The fine print shows it’s a deferral strategy, not a reduction,” Tait said. “It’s just a broken attempt to help the utility weather a storm of criticism for its high bills and abnormally high profits.”
Alabama Power’s electric rates have been under scrutiny especially since new data center projects could significantly increase demand in the state for the first time in decades.
An Inside Climate News analysis showed that Alabama Power residential customers paid, on average, the highest total electric bills in the nation, thanks to slightly above average rates and extremely high electricity usage.
U.S. Sen. Katie Britt, R-Alabama, said on a recent press call that she wanted assurances that the costs of new data centers will not be passed on to customers.
“We have the highest power rates in the Southeast,” Britt said. “I think that is unacceptable.”
Alabama Power has said repeatedly that new data center customers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” including the costs of new infrastructure to meet the demand.
New PSC President Cynthia Lee Almond, appointed earlier this year by Gov. Kay Ivey, published an op-ed highlighting the need to protect Alabama Power customers from rising rates due to data centers.
“Utility bills have spiked in some states as residential and small  business customers subsidize the infrastructure investments needed to accommodate big tech,” Almond wrote. “We have a chance to learn from their challenges and avoid them here. Alabama’s main challenge and my priority is clear: make sure our families and small businesses don’t get stuck with the bill.”
In addition to delaying the rate increase from the Lindsay Hill plant, Alabama Power’s proposal would also lock in environmental compliance costs and the fuel cost factor at current levels through 2027.
The company said to make those commitments, it sought permission from the PSC to apply potential customer refunds next year to its natural disaster reserve fund instead, and to use funds from a federal nuclear production tax credit to offset retail costs.
“The filing outlines commitments aimed at providing more certainty and predictability around electric rates at a time when many other costs are rising,” the company said. “We look forward to continuing our dialogue with the Commission on an issue that matters deeply to customers across Alabama.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lindsay-Hill-Power-Station-for-Nov-26-2025-story-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

HMR has operated the home on behalf of the state since 1998. (Photo courtesy of SC. Department of Veterans Affairs)Caring for South Carolina’s elderly veterans has been one Upstate company’s focus for nearly three decades. A recent state contract will further extend that streak.
Anderson-headquartered HMR Veterans Services operates four of South Carolina’s six nursing homes for veterans.
The company started with the Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home, located in Anderson and named for the brother of the late former Gov. Carroll Campbell: U.S. Army Sgt. Richard Campbell was killed in action in May 1968 in Vietnam.
HMR has run Campbell’s namesake home since 1998 and will continue to do so through at least February 2033, along with Veterans Victory House in Walterboro. HMR has held contracts on the Lowcountry home since 2007.
For its services at the two homes, HMR will receive an estimated $375 million over seven years, paid by state and federal taxes.
HMR was the lowest bidder of three finalists for contracts starting March 1. In the first year, its rate of $333 per bed per day compared to the high bid of $425 per bed per day, according to documents provided to the SC Daily Gazette in a public records request.
Contracts for two other homes HMR runs — one in Gaffney and one in Florence — are out for bid now.
Outside the Palmetto State, HMR also runs all five of Alabama’s veterans homes and six out of 10 in Texas.
That brings the company’s total to 15 homes with 3,000 employees across three states.
SC’s investment in veterans
In SC, hundreds of veterans go homeless. These groups received state money to help.

For all six homes in South Carolina, taxpayers spend about $80 million annually to collectively care for roughly 800 veterans, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
In a state with 400,000 veterans, the homes always have a waiting list, he said.
Future expansions, including new homes planned for Orangeburg and Horry counties and a replacement of a Columbia home with a newer facility planned for Lexington County, will eventually increase capacity to more than 1,080 veterans.
Gov. Henry McMaster has backed these veterans’ homes in his budget recommendations. That includes a 2024 call for the Legislature to set aside $41 million for the state’s share of the future Lexington facility and $8 million for renovations at existing homes. The Legislature’s final budget last year matched that request.
“The governor believes veterans bring great value to South Carolina,” said his spokesman, Brandon Charochak. “We’re a military friendly state and part of the reason for that are state veterans’ homes.”
The construction timeline of those new homes depends on congressional spending, since federal taxes cover 65% of the cost. South Carolina must kick in the other 35%. Total funding could be five years away, Hilliard said.
A focus on veterans
Operating homes for veterans is the only thing HMR does, which makes the company unique nationwide, Russell Keogler, vice president of corporate operations, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“There are competitors out there, but their main focus is on traditional nursing homes,” Keogler said. “For us, this is all we do and all we do every day.”
That gives HMR an advantage when it comes to meeting the unique needs of veterans, according to Keogler.
HMR has specialists on hand to treat illnesses more common to veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. As Vietnam and Korean War veterans are aging, they are also facing more health complications from exposure to toxins, such as Agent Orange used during the war to remove trees and foliage in the dense jungle battlegrounds.
The House’s chief budget writer, Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister, said it makes sense to have specialized homes with staff to meet veteran-specific needs rather than caring for them alongside the rest of the state’s elderly population.
“South Carolina has a very long and proud history of supporting veterans,” said the Greenville Republican. “And we like the idea of taking care of veterans after their service.”
Plus, South Carolina’s military bases are major economic drivers for the state, he said.
Veterans’ homes are just one way lawmakers seek to attract veterans to the Palmetto State or, if they’re here already, keep them and their skills in South Carolina after they retire. Under a 2022 law, military retirees pay no state income taxes on pensions earned for at least 20 years of service.
“If they knew there was a robust veterans home resource, that would be a favorable consideration when thinking about where to spend their retirement years once they’re out (of the military),” Bannister said.
A company history
Still, HMR wasn’t always just a veterans-based company.
Michael McBride, a nursing home administrator, founded it as Health Management Resources, Inc., in 1993, after leasing his first six nursing homes.
Its first veterans’ home, the Campbell facility, became part of the portfolio in 1998, seven years after it opened. That’s also when Army veteran William Biggs, the husband of freshman U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs, joined as CEO. He had been the administrator of the home in Anderson when HMR took over the contract.
At one point, HMR had as many as 27 veteran and non-veteran facilities across five states, according to McBride’s biography on the company website. In 2010, the company sold 21 hospice, rehab and pharmacy locations to a private equity firm but held on to the veterans’ services side of the business.
McBride continues to sit on HMR’s board of directors, as does the widow of another HMR co-founder, Ed Childress.
William Biggs retired and Ladeeb Diab replaced him as CEO in May 2023. Eight months later, Biggs’ wife launched her campaign for the ruby red congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Duncan, who chose not to seek an eighth term. Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner, emerged the winner of a seven-way GOP primary contest in June 2024. Her 3rd District win last November sent two South Carolina women to Congress for the first time ever.
William Biggs declined to comment for this article, citing a noncompete agreement he signed upon retirement that prevents him from speaking about the company.
The congresswoman, in financial disclosures filed last month, reported more than $4 million in income in 2024 from the sale of her husband’s minority interest in HMR businesses.
Members of Congress are required to annually disclose their finances. But they’re only required to report a range of how much their assets and liabilities are worth, so the couple’s exact earnings are unknown. But she valued the capital gains from each of four HMR businesses at more than $1 million.
‘Push the envelope’
Keogler said HMR has sought to “push the envelope” in other ways as well.
For example, at the request of states it contracts with, HMR began running its own pharmacies at its homes, instead of calling in prescriptions from elsewhere.
“We can do all of our medication reviews right in house, and our pharmacists actually know the residents,” he said. “It’s no longer just filling a prescription. It’s taking care of a veteran who you see every day.”
HMR also weathered staffing shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does so through a scholarship program, paying for the education of any certified nursing assistant employed by the company who wants to pursue a higher-level licensed practical nursing degree.
New SC law aims to ensure no veteran dies without proper recognition

“We help cover the cost of their tuition and books. We provide them a mentor to help guide them through the program, all while they can continue to work on this flexed academic schedule that builds professional growth for the individual and provides us a constant source of new nurses,” Keogler said. “I think it’s those innovative practices, which we’ve accelerated over the last two years, that really caught the attention of our state partners.”
A huge cost benefit
There are other reasons South Carolina’s more than 386,000 veterans and their families may choose a veterans home.
“It’s really camaraderie and connection,” Keogler said. “There’s a true brotherhood that exists in the service and that comes out later on in life.”
Also, there’s a huge cost benefit to families when they select a state veterans home. With military service benefits, their cost is far less than that of a traditional nursing home.
The federal government pays states a daily rate which can cover up to 50% of the homes’ operating costs. For veterans deemed at least 70% disabled due to injuries related to their military service, their cost is covered in full, Hilliard said.
The remaining costs are covered by state taxes or by the veterans themselves, said Hilliard, who was previously HMR’s executive vice president of operations. He joined the state agency in April 2024 after it took over the homes’ operations from the state mental health agency.

Above average
South Carolina also is in the minority of states — one of 13 — that pay private contractors to run all of its homes, though more states are trending that direction, Hilliard said.
While private contractors run the homes, the state public health agency and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are tasked with inspecting them. And the state veterans agency employs someone on site at each home, Hilliard said.
“Our homes consistently perform at or above national averages,” he said.
Three of the four HMR-run homes in South Carolina have recently received high marks.
State and federal regulators inspected the Anderson and Walterboro homes seven times over the past four years. Some reviews were the result of complaints and required the homes to make improvements. But each received a government rating of four out of five stars.
The Gaffney home has gone through four inspections and one improvement plan in that time and has a perfect rating.
The Florence home, however, sits at a two out of five. Federal reports site shortfalls in a handful of patient treatment plans for residents with medical issues including diabetes, a feeding tube and ulcers and bedsores.
The state home in Columbia, which is run by Avalon Health Care Group rather than HMR, also has a two-star rating. The same group also runs the state’s newest veterans’ home in Sumter, which opened in January. It hasn’t been rated yet.

HMR also made headlines in 2018, when the wife of a U.S. Air Force veteran alleged her husband suffered repeat infections, hospitalizations and unexplained bruises while he was in the Walterboro home, the Independent Mail reported.
And in May 2018, HMR settled a $425,000 lawsuit involving a veteran at the Anderson home who had a latex glove lodged in his airway. He died five days later.
Hilliard, who was still working for HMR at the time, told the Independent Mail: “Health care is a very litigious environment. A settlement does not constitute an admission of liability.”
State Department of Public Health investigations around this time found 13 violations involving “policies and procedures, staff training, resident records, resident care and medication administration.” The agency fined HMR $3,600.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RICHARD-M.-CAMPBELL-VETERANS-NURSING-HOME.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

Ned Lamont ended months of controversy and speculation Wednesday when he signed a new version of a bill he vetoed this past summer.,"After months of negotiations and debate, Gov. Ned Lamont has signed a controversial omnibus bill that aims to address Connecticut’s dire lack of affordable housing.
Lawmakers passed House Bill 8002 during the special session earlier this month, and Lamont signed it into law Wednesday morning, after receiving it from the Senate on Tuesday. The bill expands fair rent commissions, eliminates most off-street parking requirements for smaller housing developments and requires towns to create housing growth plans, among other measures.
[What to know about the CT housing bill passed in special session]
Lamont vetoed a similar bill that his office had worked to negotiate in June, after the regular session. The governor said he wanted to see a bill that had more town buy-in and called a two-day special session for earlier this month to give lawmakers time to work on revising the legislation.
After months of negotiations, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns stood alongside Lamont at a press conference a few weeks ago to support the new bill.
“This bill tells mayors and first selectmen ‘What do you want your town to look like in five or 10 years? Start planning accordingly. Where do you want that housing to go? Are you going to zone accordingly? What else do you need? We want to be your partner,’” said Lamont at the press conference.
While some Democratic lawmakers said the negotiated bill wasn’t as strong as the one they originally passed, they think it will go a long way toward addressing the affordable housing need in Connecticut.
Homelessness has increased over the past few years, and rent prices have risen. Most studies estimate the state lacks more than 100,000 units of housing that are affordable and available to its low-income renters.
The bill has sparked fierce opposition from groups that say it weakens local control and puts onerous burdens on towns. Republican lawmakers voted against the bill and criticized the process of passing a bill in special session, which they said did not incorporate enough input from the public.
Lamont is expected to hold a public bill signing next week, said spokesman Rob Blanchard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_0073-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 12:58:16.098267

(Photo by Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray had reason for optimism when he and other state administrators kicked off their work in November 2024 charting a path to achieving the state’s decarbonization mandates.
“When we first started working on this, Trump hadn’t taken office,” Gray, who heads a consortium of state agencies overseeing the implementation of Rhode Island’s Act on Climate law, said in an interview Wednesday. “We still had very strong federal policies, federal authorities and grants in place. Those three things were really, very important.”

Public comments on the state’s 2025 draft climate action strategy report can be submitted online at https://climatechange.ri.gov/act-climate/public-comment. Supplemental materials are also available online.

On Tuesday, the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council released a draft of its first comprehensive review of existing progress and future forecasting to help achieve the state’s net-zero emissions law. The 31-page report is open for public comment through Dec. 10.
And as Gray wrote in his opening letter, recent shifts in federal policy and funding have eroded his confidence in achieving Rhode Island’s aggressive emissions reduction plan.
“These shifts will have devastating and immediate consequences for Rhode Island’s climate planning,” Gray wrote. “While this Strategy focuses on impacts to our climate-change portfolio, the broader federal rollbacks are poised to trigger severe disruptions across energy, environmental protection, health care, and food-security systems, placing extraordinary strain on state agencies and undermining long-standing strategic investments.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act yanked more than $75 million in federal funding to Rhode Island for clean energy programs and related research and infrastructure projects. Before that, Biden-era federal tax credits for renewable energy were canceled, more stringent state vehicle emissions standards paused and offshore wind projects set to power New England’s grid were halted or pulled back. Even the federal grants for the climate council to hire a consultant to model state emissions output in future years were temporarily frozen. 
“We’re trying to figure out ways to do this without necessarily direct monetary incentives everywhere,” Gray said.
Asked what alternative, nonfinancial incentives might be, Gray responded “I don’t know. That’s what we’re working through.”
And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.  
“Rhode Island will forge ahead in the face of this shifting landscape and continue to collaborate across all agencies in 2026 and beyond,” the report states.
The council is charged with updating its assessment in subsequent reports issued every five years through the 2050 deadline for completion.

Establishing the goal line 
As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The emissions inventory report published last week stressed the need to accelerate incentives and policies that promote a clean energy transition, warning that the existing pace of progress was not enough to meet the first incremental benchmark in 2030. 
However, according to the climate council’s models, Rhode Island will meet the 2030 benchmark, which calls for reducing total emissions 45% from the 1990 baseline. This is largely thanks to state incentive programs and policy choices, such as discounts for property owners to switch to heat pumps, weatherize and make their homes energy efficient, and buy or lease battery-powered and hybrid cars, the report stated.
But achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 remains just of reach without “additional ambition,” the council’s draft strategy report states. The report outlines broad steps to speed up the clean energy transition, targeting the biggest culprits of carbon emissions: transportation, home heating and electricity use.
“We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is,” Gray said of the strategy report. 










We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is. 


– Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray


In order to achieve the 2050 net-zero mandate, for example, Rhode Island needs to accelerate its adoption of hybrid and battery-powered vehicles, including cars, trucks, and off-road sources like boats and airplanes. Specifically, the report recommends nearly tripling annual electric vehicle sales, from the 13,000 sold this year in the state to 36,000 by 2030.
Gray is eyeing the transportation sector with extra concern, noting that Trump has sought to repeal federal waivers letting states, including Rhode Island, adopt more stringent vehicle emissions standards. 
Much of Rhode Island’s ability to achieve reductions in transportation sector emissions relies on its authority to set lower emissions standards for new cars and trucks. 
“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.
Federal rollbacks have not cooled the state’s incentive program to help property owners convert from oil or gas to electric-powered heat pumps. But surging winter electricity prices have dissuaded some heat pump converts from using their new systems, Gray said. 
“We need stability and certainty in electric rates so people actually use their heat pumps,” he said. 
Meanwhile, the heat is on to keep selling these greener home heating alternatives. 
Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling. Achieving this overhaul requires increasing heat pump sales from the 3,000 sold in 2025 to 15,000 a year by 2030, according to the report.

Sticker shock 
Convincing cash-strapped consumers and business owners to look to long-term savings versus the upfront costs of a hybrid car or heat pump conversion is not easy, Gray acknowledged. Cost was a top concern cited by residents in a series of community meetings organized by the climate change council this fall.
“There’s got to be more hesitancy now to say ‘where is this all going’ given the rhetoric coming out of the federal government,” Gray said.
But there is also a price for doing nothing — $940 million in “social costs” by 2050, according to the report.
“Decarbonization reduces spending on fossil fuels, avoids the economic and health damages caused by climate change, and delivers cleaner air and healthier communities across the state,” the report states. 
Going green will also boost the state economy, adding an estimated 6,500 jobs by 2035 for work on offshore wind projects, battery storage and residential heating and cooling, the report states. 
The report concludes with a call to action. 
“The decarbonization and transition of our economy must be done carefully, and deliberately with affordability in mind, to meet the goals set forth in the Act on Climate,” it states. “It is important to emphasize that acting on climate change cannot be championed by state government alone. Businesses, municipalities, nonprofit leaders and residents will continue to be called up to prioritize action towards the goals of the Act on Climate.”

(Courtesy of Matt Cashore for the Kishla Askins campaign)OMAHA — Navy veteran Kishla Askins received an endorsement of her 2026 bid for the Democratic nomination in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District from a left-leaning organization that supports veterans who run for office. 
VoteVets, which endorsed Askins, is considered a major player in some Democratic primary races. Recently two candidates backed by the organization won their gubernatorial race, former Navy helicopter pilot Rep. Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey and former CIA officer Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia. 
Travis Tazelaar, VoteVets Political Director, said, “Veterans remain the best-positioned candidates to make crucial flips.”
“We know there is no path to flipping the House without veteran candidates running and winning in districts that other Democrats can’t compete in,” Tazelaar said “We’re excited to be behind Kishla’s campaign and to help her across the finish line.”

Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd District is a crucial race for national Democratic hopes to retake the House in 2026. Democrats feel optimistic with Republican U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring. 
Askins is a part of a national Democratic strategy of promoting veterans to run in battleground districts in next year’s midterms as a throwback to a strategy that helped Democrats win control of the House in 2018.  She said she was proud to have “VoteVets by my side as we fight for the future Nebraskans deserve.” 
“From leading missions in Iraq and in support of Afghanistan, to serving at the Department of Veterans Affairs, to now running to represent Nebraskans in Congress, I’ve dedicated myself to a life of service,” Askins said.
Askins still has to navigate a primary with other Democratic candidates with higher name ID and more local ties. 
She is in a Democratic primary with business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and former immigration attorney Evangelos Argyrakis.
The winner of the Democratic May 12 primary will face the winner of a GOP primary featuring Omaha City Council Member Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.

Here's what to know.","When Hartford Mayor Arunan Arulampalam announced the pause of state-funded renovations for six public schools in September, the decision surprised the Board of Education and the Hartford School Building Committee.
They had voted in favor of the renovations, along with the City Council, to Moylan Elementary, Parkville Community, McDonough Middle, S.A.N.D, Maria C. Colon Sanchez Elementary and Batchelder schools. 
And state funding was already approved.
School renovations were part of an effort to bring Hartford residents back to study in the district. Over the past four years approximately 5,000 students moved out of the city, with many relocating to places like New Britain, East Hartford, and Manchester, according to an analysis of student enrollment trends by Caitlin Richard, chief financial officer of Hartford Public Schools, shown at a Board of Education meeting in November.
The district faces a projected budget deficit of approximately $30 million, which Richard said would be addressed if more Hartford children attended Hartford Public Schools.
Here’s what we know about the pause on school renovations.
Why did Hartford public schools plan renovations?
The projects were meant to address long-standing issues in Hartford Public Schools’ buildings including leaking roofs and outdated HVAC systems and to incorporate state-of-the-art facilities. Board of Education Chair Shonta Browdy says the lack of updated facilities push away Hartford residents to districts that already provide these.
Renovations aim to address current low enrollment in Hartford’s public schools.
What is the school construction process and at what point was it paused?
It is a long process that includes multiple stakeholders who propose, oversee and approve school construction renovation projects.
First, the school district identifies the need for renovations. Consultants and other professionals may be involved with the documentation process, considering student enrollment, building needs and academic programs.
Then the Board of Education prepares educational specifications of project costs and eight-year enrollment figures. Once the city approves those, the board and the City Council are authorized to submit a grant application to the state, and the Office of School Construction Grants & Review evaluates the proposal.
If the proposal is approved — like it was in the case of the six public schools in Hartford — the state issues a grant letter of commitment. The city’s school building committee further hires program and construction managers, and architects. 
Next, before bidding for the construction work begins, which is authorized by the state’s school construction office, designs are made, reviewed and approved. Construction then is supposed to start.
The projects were paused near the very end of the process. Construction companies already had bid and a design request for proposal for the schools was voted on by the Hartford School Building Committee.
Here are the names of the chosen construction companies, according to information provided by Browdy:

S.A.N.D has a contract with Colliers;
Sanchez Elementary and Batchelder schools with Arcadis and O&G;
McDonough Middle with PDS Engineering and Construction Inc.;
Parkville Community with 7 Summits Construction;
and Moylan Elementary with Newfield Construction.

What does the mayor say about his reasoning for pausing the school renovations?
Cristian Corza-Godinez, city of Hartford spokesperson, said in a written statement that “the status quo” is not working for students, and so the mayor is working on a 5-year plan to turn schools into centers of excellence. He said that requires conversations around whether the city is stretching resources too thin in under-enrolled schools. 
Corza-Godinez said that until the city has a plan to address this, pausing school construction is the responsible decision. 
“If we use state dollars to carry out these six construction projects, Hartford taxpayers will be on the hook for twenty years and will have to pay back those dollars if any of those six schools move in a different direction over the next two decades,” he said.
At the school building committee meeting on Oct. 20, Lori Mizerak, the city’s corporation counsel, stated that she sent a memo on Oct. 17 about what the city plans to do to evaluate all city schools facing budgeting issues. The memo is not publicly available.
What are the next steps for these projects moving forward?
As of now, the renovations are on pause and there is not a set date for them to resume construction.
Arulampalam said the city wants to resume construction as quickly as it can, and he hopes that all the parties will come to the table collaborate on a plan that provides better educational outcomes for Hartford students, so that they can offer not just better looking buildings, but also “substantially better education.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7869-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 11:58:32.655453

But when the Trump administration offered her a buyout — officially called a deferred resignation — she took it, receiving four months of paid leave in exchange for quitting her job. She feared she could lose her job abruptly later if she didn’t accept.
After those payments stopped, Belliveau applied for food assistance.


From insiders to ousted
This is the third of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


She finally started work as an educational support professional for the Sioux Falls School District this month after over a dozen interviews in the last three months went nowhere in what she called a “hellscape of a job market.” More than a million workers have been laid off across the country this year, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas, making this year the worst for layoff notices since 2009.
Within that number are the roughly 154,000 federal employees who took deferred resignations offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor told Fox Business in August he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
While Belliveau is working in the school district, she’s also working toward her second master’s degree in teaching (her first master’s was in higher education administration) in hopes of improving her prospects. She’s considering moving out of the state or country in hopes of finding better employment.
The 38-year-old is struggling to figure out the best path forward to support her family.
“Federal workers have families and mortgages and need to eat and pay bills,” she said.
While the Trump administration has described its actions as dismantling bureaucracy, Belliveau disputes that characterization.
“We’re not dismantling bureaucracy,” she said. “We’re laying people off. No other company could lay off hundreds of thousands of people without the public being up in arms. It’s crazy to me that this is being celebrated or something they’re proud about.”
The Trump administration’s cuts and layoffs “waged war on federal employees,” she said, and will hurt taxpayers.
“The bureaucracy will remain, but there will be fewer people who know how to navigate that bureaucracy,” Belliveau said.
Belliveau had planned to retire from her federal career. She is a subject matter expert on employee and labor relations. Getting rid of people like her opens up agencies to liability, she said, since it takes years to become an expert on such “incredibly complicated and delicate” subjects.
“You have supervisors who are used to having someone like myself saying, ‘You can’t do that because of this law, regulation or section in a master agreement,’” Belliveau said. “It will cost us more.”

Swajeski founded what was then the Children’s Repertory Theatre in the early 1970s with a simple but ambitious vision: to introduce children to the performing arts and spark a lifelong love of theatre and music.
Rehearsing at first in basements and garages, she built a touring company that brought professional-quality productions to schools, parks, hospitals, retirement communities and nursing homes across Delaware. In its first decade, the company staged more than 700 performances for more than 90,000 children, earning critical praise and a loyal following among families.
Her belief, colleagues often said, was that any child in the audience—or on stage—might have their life changed by what they experienced at the theatre.
In the early 1980s, Marie and her husband, John, bought the historic New Century Club building on Delaware Avenue, saving it from demolition and transforming it into the permanent home of what became the Delaware Children’s Theatre. The Victorian theatre house, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, has remained both an arts hub and a preserved historic landmark under the Swajeskis’ care.
Honors and impact
Over the years, Swajeski’s work drew recognition well beyond Wilmington. In 2004, then-U.S. Sen. Tom Carper had September 18 proclaimed “Marie Swajeski Day” and entered the tribute into the Congressional Record, honoring her decades of service to children and the arts.  She was inducted into the Hall of Fame of Delaware Women in 2019 for her lifelong contributions to theatre and youth.
Under her leadership, Delaware Children’s Theatre became a launching pad for countless young performers, including future Tony Award winner John Gallagher Jr., who first appeared there as Tom Sawyer.
The theatre has staged a wide range of productions, from classics such as Charlotte’s Web to big family favorites like Shrek the Musical, along with original works written by Donna, including the Snow White musical One Magic Kiss that premiered at DCT.
Legacy carried on by her children
Today, Delaware Children’s Theatre is led by Marie’s children, Donna and David Swajeski. Donna, an Emmy-winning television writer and longtime artistic director, oversees programming and original works, while David works to preserve and maintain the historic theatre building.
That made Donna’s Facebook tribute especially poignant to many in the arts community, who see her as the standard-bearer of her mother’s legacy.
“Marie touched so many lives and hearts,” Donna wrote. “She was a shining light in our community and will never be forgotten.”
The Delaware Children’s Theatre continues to offer affordable, family-focused productions, workshops and outreach programs, reflecting Marie Swajeski’s enduring belief that the arts can build confidence, imagination and community for every child who walks through its doors.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Swajeskis.webp,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

While the Montana Secretary of State touted “only one percent” of ballots rejected due to missing or mismatched birth year, the individual county statistics show a different story, adding extra costs and labor to counties across the state as they worked to resolve the rejected ballots. 
“663 rejected ballots is definitely an uptick,” said Flathead County Election Administrator Debbie Pierson, pointing out that the voters of Flathead County reduced the number of rejected ballots due to signature mismatch by 50% when compared to the school district election that took place earlier this year. 
“The city council election only had 198 ballots rejected due to signature versus 391 due to signature rejection in the school board race,” Pierson said. “Most of our increase (in rejected ballots) this time came from birth year.” 
“The law requires us to reach out to every person whose ballot is rejected in the most expedient method possible,” explained Missoula County Deputy Elections Administrator Nathan Coyan. “And so what we do to cover everyone is every person whose ballot is rejected gets a letter at the very least.”
Of Missoula County’s initial 1,090 rejected ballots, 694 (64%) were due to errors in birth year, costing the county an additional $513 on letters sent to voters. In Gallatin County, 76% of their initial 820 rejected ballots were due to birth year, costing the county an additional $463 on letters. Yellowstone County spent $851 on letters due to the same issue and Flathead County spent $215. In total, counties across Montana spent a little more than $2,600 on letters to voters whose ballots were rejected due to birth year. 
Some counties, like Lewis and Clark, ran an early information campaign ahead of the general election, using the primary election as an opportunity to give voters a test-run with the new ballot requirement. 
Lewis and Clark County Elections Division Supervisor Connor Fitzpatrick explained there were two parts to their strategy: First, a “soft launch,” where voters received inserts with new instructions in their ballot packets explaining the birth year requirement, as well as a ballot following the new template sent out by the Secretary of State that voters would use in November general election. 
“We weren’t checking birth year for September because it wasn’t in play yet,” explained Fitzpatrick. “But we wanted to get them visually used to the thing. We were like, ‘Hey, that is going to kick into place Oct. 1.’”
The second step was a mailer sent to each address involved in the election for the city of Helena and the city of East Helena. 
“That was sent strategically a week before ballots were mailed out,” said Fitzpatrick.
The total cost of the campaign was $2,020.48, and resulted in Lewis and Clark having one of the lowest rejected ballot rates among larger counties in the state, at only 0.97%. 
  Staff Labor 

In addition to letters and early campaigns to notify voters of the upcoming changes, were supplementary staff costs that many counties found difficult to estimate. 
“It took me all day, all of my days, from when we started,” said Cascade County Elections Specialist Gretchen Yowell. “I did them in batches and I would call daily, and go through every single thing they (the voters) had ever given us to try to contact them.”
Cascade County initially had 547 rejected ballots, 305 (56%) due to birth year. They resolved all rejected ballots but 309.
“We filtered them out by what was missing so we could see what was missing first. Birth year was the first thing I could tackle, and then we could specify signature mismatches. And once the birth year was verified we sent them back through the process,” explained Yowell. “And it takes a minute, because everything has to go into the system, so that way if someone goes on the SOS website they can see it has been rejected.”
Missoula County couldn’t estimate the exact cost, but Coyan reported the effort to resolve ballots took up the majority of staff time. 
“It became the project that everyone was working on,” said Coyan. “Anyone who was available got pulled into it. Even I was working on it. It was crazy.” 
Yellowstone County Elections Administrator Dayna Causby estimated additional staff costs at $3,500, but emphasized this was only for temporary workers and didn’t include the time full-time staff spent away from their usual designated tasks to focus on resolving rejected ballots.
“That was one of the main reasons that we decided to use a ballot drop-off location, because of the birth year requirement and trying to reduce the number of ballots that were rejected,” said Causby. “You were hoping that you could catch people as they were dropping it off and point out the birth year is missing.”
Of Yellowstone County’s initial 1,381 rejected ballots, 1150 (83%) were due to birth year errors. All but 624 ballots were resolved, with 473 (76%) of those remaining due to birth year. 
Counties with smaller municipal elections utilized local connections to contact voters whose ballots had been rejected. Sweetgrass County, for example, had 35 rejected ballots, 31 (89%) due to birth year, but were able to reach most people by phone, ending with only six unresolved ballots. 
Treasure County, which had 20 ballots initially rejected, all due to birth year, ended with all ballots resolved. 
“Through friends and family and the phonebook we were able to get them all in here and write their birth year on the ballot. I was even able to get ahold of someone’s grandmother to get them in,” said Treasure County Elections Administrator Dani Erickson. “Our citizens are really good about it. They answer the phone and come in right away.” 
  The Larger Underlying Cost 

In his testimony of House Bill 719, sponsor Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls, claimed the bill was a “cleanup bill,” the purpose of which was, “To make sure our elections are more secure while maintaining accessibility for voters. By adding an additional verification step we can help prevent fraud, reduce clerical errors and ensure every legally cast vote is counted correctly.” 
Yet ensuring every legally cast vote is counted is exactly what the law may have prevented. 
Even in Ravalli County, Elections Administrator Regina Plettenberg, who testified in support of HB 719 in February of this year, claimed there was no marked increase in the number of ballots rejected, yet confirmed 47% of Ravalli County’s remaining unresolved ballots were due to errors in birth year. 
The largest cost to Montana taxpayers however, may still be adding up.
A lawsuit brought by Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana in May of this year claims the new law disenfranchises elderly and disabled voters. Should Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana be successful in their lawsuit, it will add to the ever expanding demand on Montana taxpayers. 
“The state has spent millions in taxpayer dollars on litigation costs defending unconstitutional bills passed by the legislature,” said Heather O’Loughlin, Executive Director of the Montana Budget and Policy Center. “Not only do these laws create barriers to voting, they also add significant costs to the state.”
In every session, the Legislature passes supplemental appropriations in House Bill 3 which covers unexpected state agency costs accrued in the previous two fiscal years. Lawmakers also pass HB 2 every session – the General Appropriations Act – which adjusts the state’s budget going forward for the next two years. 
The 2025 Supplemental Appropriations Bill allocated $4.1 million for Legal Services, including $2.8 million specifically designated for litigation related to constitutional challenges from bills passed during the 2023 legislative session. 
The 2025 General Appropriations Act increased the Department of Justice budget by $24.2 million for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, with $2 million of that 8% increase specifically designated for the litigation of Montana legislation. 
Elections officials stressed the security of the existing voting process already in place before the passage of HB 719.
“There are already two unique numbers on your affirmation envelope that we utilize to look voters up and to verify signatures and to accept their ballots,” said Causby, in Yellowstone County. “One is a unique number specifically for that ballot for this election. The other number is the voter’s voter ID number. Then of course we have the signature.” 
A point echoed by Coyan, in Missoula County. 
“The signature is a very unique identifier,” said Coyan. “Adding the date of birth does not increase any security, it only adds an additional burden to the voter. People are receiving these ballots at their own request only because they are an active, eligible elector. There’s no need for us to have that date of birth on there.
“When we go from a small handful of rejected ballots in an election to massive piles of them, clearly something has changed for the voter. And it doesn’t look like for the better.”
The Secretary of State has not shared data supporting their claims of “one percent” rejection rate of ballots due to birth year or responded to multiple requests for comment from the Daily Montanan. 
  Another election wrinkle 

In addition to House Bill 719, little known House Bill 207, sponsored by Rep. Jodee Etchert, R-Billings also went into effect this year, changing the election deadline for candidate filings. The changes took place in the middle of the filing window, forcing many candidates to refile, or in the case of Walkerville Ward 1 Alderperson, causing candidates to miss the new deadline altogether, leaving them registered as write-in candidates only. 
“They thought they were on time, but the law changed. So they were late,” said Silver Bow County Elections Administrator Cindy Sherman. “It made it a write-in only election, which makes for a very hard election.”
Silver Bow County had no rejected ballots for the race, but of the 180 ballots mailed out, only 31 (17%) were returned. 
“I think a lot of people just didn’t know what they were supposed to do with that ballot. People want to see a name so they can check a box,” explained Sherman. “Of those 31 ballots, 15 voted for the winning candidate. Three voted for the other candidate. 10 voted for somebody else, a non-declared person, and then three of them were actually unvoted. They filled in the oval, but they didn’t write anything in the line.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JennaMartin-00159-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s most powerful state legislator introduced legislation Tuesday to weaken the powers of a state watchdog agency whose reports on government corruption, waste, and fraud have embarrassed and irritated public officials around the state.
The bill by Sen. Nicholas Scutari (D-Union), who is the Senate president, would hand the investigatory powers currently held by the state comptroller to the State Commission of Investigation. Officials targeted by the comptroller and groups including the New Jersey Association of Counties have pushed for a probe of the office, complaining about its practices in publicizing its findings.
While the bill says the comptroller’s office would be able to continue its “core work … unabated,” the office would be stripped of its investigative and subpoena powers. That means it could audit public agencies but couldn’t investigate wrongdoing or compel reforms.
A state watchdog forges ahead, in an era of endangered oversight

A public hearing on the bill is set for 10 a.m. Monday before the Senate’s state government committee at the Statehouse in Trenton. Lawmakers often use the brief lame-duck session between November’s election and January’s start of a new legislative session to fast-track controversial bills.
Scutari did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday, but his bill characterizes its goal as “eliminating duplication among State government oversight entities.”
“The investigations operations of the Office of the State Comptroller is smaller than, and different from, its main responsibilities, which are Medicaid fraud, procurement oversight, and audit functions.  Transferring the investigations function to the State Commission of Investigation does not curtail those responsibilities and is a more logical fit that will capitalize on its experience and success,” the bill says.
Kevin Walsh, the office’s acting comptroller, doesn’t buy that explanation.
“NJ ‘transparency’ at its worst. Sen. Scutari sneaks in a bill before Thanksgiving to kill OSC investigations. A vote for this bill is a vote for corruption,” Walsh wrote on social media Tuesday night.
The plan has also sparked outrage among critics who have long lamented that New Jersey doesn’t have enough watchdogs to keep up with all its corruption.
Attorney General Matt Platkin said on social media that he would testify against the bill Monday.
“This Thanksgiving, the NJ Senate is killing a gov’t watchdog that stops wasteful spending, giving politically powerful individuals broad powers to intimidate law enforcement fighting corruption & even letting them tap phones. Outrageous,” Platkin wrote.
The comptroller’s office formed in 2010. Since Walsh became acting comptroller in January 2020, his supporters have praised him as New Jersey’s leading watchdog on police accountability, government waste and fraud, and other issues involving taxpayer money and public misconduct.
His work has irked public officials at nearly every level of government though, and senators have blocked his confirmation. He has said his work is bound to “upset powerful people,” underscoring the need for his office to remain independent.
Scutari’s bill also would more than double State Commission of Investigation commissioners’ annual salary, from $35,000 to $75,000. The agency now has three commissioners and an executive director, although it’s supposed to have four commissioners by law.
It would also take the power to appoint the State Commission of Investigation’s chair away from the governor and give it to the Senate president and Assembly speaker.
A commission spokesperson, executive director Bruce P. Keller, and John P. Lacey, its chair, did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment.
Keller told the Asbury Park Press this month that he does not support eliminating government watchdogs.
“There’s plenty of work to go around,” Keller told the newspaper. “So if your question is a version of the thing that we’ve all heard – which is, are there too many watchdog agencies – my answer is, hell no, there aren’t enough.”

But most of the questions still have to clear several hurdles before making it onto the ballot.  
A major potential obstacle, one that has tripped up several would-be ballot referendums in recent years, is a court challenge that questions whether the measure, as crafted by proponents, can legally go before voters. 
In 2024, Massachusetts stared down six potential ballot measures, four of which consumed the time of the Supreme Judicial Court for months and pushed a critical ruling on controversial state housing policy off to the next year.  
Now the state could be heading toward an even messier collision of legal, legislative, and political forces. 
As the secretary of state’s office certifies hundreds of thousands of signatures submitted on behalf of the proposed 2026 ballot questions, campaigns and ballot initiative veterans estimate about half of the questions could be vulnerable to legal challenges, though not all may materialize.  
It sets up a busy next year of stress testing through courts assessing whether measures are appropriate for the ballot, lawmakers weighing whether to preempt questions through compromise legislation, and campaigns shifting into high gear to make their case to voters. Housing policy, taxes, and government transparency are among the issues that hang in the balance. 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell certified 44 potential questions earlier this year, and 11 campaigns confirmed to CommonWealth Beacon last week that they had secured enough signatures to clear the first threshold, sending the signatures to the secretary of state’s office for certification. 
Massachusetts ballot campaigns that submit 74,574 certified signatures to the secretary of state’s office by December 3 will then be sent to the Legislature in January. While lawmakers consider whether to act on the ballot proposals, several may head for lengthy court fights.  
Because ballot measures are blunt instruments, allowing voters only a yes or no vote, the questions cannot include separate and unrelated provisions. Other restrictions on ballot measures include petitions relating to the courts or judiciary, specific municipalities, certain parts of the state constitution, and some fiscal policy matters. 
One measure is already on the road to legal challenge, though opponents usually wait to file with the court until the early months of the election year. Business and landlord groups are agitating against a ballot question that would impose statewide rent control, limiting annual rent increases to the rate of inflation. 
This measure would permit an uncompensated taking of private property, which is not an appropriate matter for a ballot question, the conservative Fiscal Alliance Foundation argued in an objection to the attorney general’s certification. 
Real estate industry groups told CommonWealth Beacon that they also would be considering taking the rent control matter to the high court. 
“This is something we are taking very, very seriously,” said Tamara Small, chief executive of industry group NAIOP Massachusetts. “So we are looking at this from every single angle. If we believe that there is a court challenge, that’s something we’d certainly pursue.” 
Greg Vasil, CEO of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, said, “We’re doing everything that we can to minimize the risk to the members. This is uncharted territory on the legal side, so we have to look at every opportunity available to us.” 
In recent cycles, the state’s high court has struck several potential ballot measures for flunking the so-called relatedness test.  
In 2018, a first crack at what became the “millionaires tax,” or Fair Share Amendment, was broomed by the court for including too many unrelated provisions. Another version of the measure survived a court challenge four years later and was passed by voters into law.  
The SJC heard challenges to four measures proposed for the 2024 ballot, with three on “relatedness.” 
Those disputes swallowed months. When Attorney General Andrea Campbell sued Milton over the MBTA Communities housing law in February 2024, the SJC didn’t schedule oral arguments until October. The delay stemmed partly from the court’s ballot measure workload, justices said. Since opinions are generally issued about three months after oral arguments, a critical deadline for the housing law passed while justices deliberated. 
Along with the brewing challenge to the rent control question, Andrew Farnitano, a strategist working on several campaigns, expects organized opposition to form if two tax-related ballot measures move forward, which could find its way to the courts. 
The Massachusetts Opportunity Alliance is heading up ballot question campaigns to reduce the income tax and limit the amount of money Beacon Hill can collect and keep when revenues hit a certain threshold. Both would send shockwaves into the state budgeting process as officials work to fund health care, transportation, and other areas during a period of federal funding threats. 
Opponents of a measure that would roll back the legalization of recreational cannabis – itself a ballot referendum almost a decade ago – are focusing their ire on claims of misleading signature gathering practices for now. Depending on whether the secretary of state’s office certifies the group’s signatures, the cannabis industry may pursue legal challenges down the line or focus on defeating the measure on the ballot. 
For the 2026 cycle, Secretary of State William Galvin is not only responsible for overseeing the ballot referendum process as the state’s chief election official, he’s leading one of the ballot question campaigns. Galvin is pushing a ballot measure legalizing Election Day voter registration. 
For any would-be ballot question, the Legislature has a certain window of time in which they can simply pass the measure into the law, preempting a ballot showdown.  
Lawmakers are not responding eagerly to the workload. 
Proponents say the jump in ballot measures, which would eclipse the previous nine-question record, signals disillusionment with the Legislature, which they say refuses to take up issues that have popular support when filed as bills. Legislative leaders instead decry it as a sign of intrusion into their work by special interests. 
“Forty-four of them is a huge number of ballot questions. It makes you wonder: How easy is it for these special interest groups to go out and pay someone to get signatures?” House Speaker Ron Mariano said this week, referring to the original number of questions that were filed. “They design questions that support their topics or their personal interests.” 
The signature-gathering process whittled the number of potential measures by three-fourths, but the Speaker said he wondered if the Massachusetts ballot system will start to look like California’s. Voters in the Golden State, well known for its penchant for lawmaking by ballot question, considered 11 statewide measures in 2024, plus specific municipal- and county-level questions. 
The Legislature has until the first Wednesday in May if it wants to simply enact the ballot measure as written. Lawmakers last cycle created a new special committee to hold hearings and consider legislative action on the eight measures. They ultimately decided, as the high court deliberated, not to recommend legislative action on any of the ballot questions.  
Ballot campaigns are marathons of public and private negotiations, and a flurry of challenges would slow the regular work of the courts and the Legislature alike, but horse-trading can last until the final signature submission deadline in July.  
The final stretch can be a nail-biter — the SJC didn’t hand down its final word on the challenged ballot measures until June last cycle, just in time for one of the most controversial questions of the season to decide against going before voters because of a settlement in a completely different court case. 
If the Legislature decides not to act, and the courts allow the measures to head toward the ballot, proponents and opponents battle it out on the campaign trail.  
For some questions, though, an organized opposition seems unlikely to form.  
Ballot efforts to subject the governor’s office and the Legislature to public records laws and to rein in legislative stipends both go after the insular ways of Beacon Hill – something generally popular with voters and unlikely to draw organized opposition. A recent Suffolk University/Boston Globe poll found more than 80 percent of respondents would support the public records change. 
These efforts carry a strong echo of state Auditor Diana DiZoglio’s successful ballot campaign last year seeking to audit the Legislature and, not coincidently, the crusading auditor has now turned her focus to leading the public records campaign.

Kennedy Jr., speaking here at a September event, reportedly ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to update a website page to add disproven information about autism and its causes. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)TOPEKA — A new page on a federal government website that provides inaccurate information about vaccines and autism is concerning to Kansans who work in autism research.
A majority of studies and researchers say there is no connection between autism and vaccinations, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated a page to share contradictory information.
“The claim ‘vaccines do not cause autism’ is not an evidence-based claim because studies have not ruled out the possibility that infant vaccines cause autism,” the site says.
The page was updated last week, and in an interview with the New York Times, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, said he instructed the CDC to change the information.
“The information posted on the CDC website unfortunately contains multiple inaccurate or misleading statements,” said Matt Mosconi, director of the Kansas Center for Autism Research and Training. “The CDC message ignores many studies that have been conducted on this topic. And, my expectation is that this statement is confusing for individuals and families, and it has strong potential to be harmful.”
The Coalition of Autism Scientists, which Mosconi and other researchers at K-CART belong to, published a statement saying the harm caused by questioning the safety of childhood vaccines cannot be overstated.
“By altering and distorting the evidence on vaccine safety, the CDC can no longer be relied on to provide the public with accurate information,” the statement said.
Mosconi said if there had been evidence that vaccines caused autism, scientists would have followed that evidence.
“Rigorous study after rigorous study failed to find that link, so we, as scientists, follow the data to identify those factors that are associated with autism and do have potential to be informative for supporting the autism community,” he said.
Kathryn Unruh, an assistant researcher at K-CART, said the new information presented on the CDC site is concerning for several reasons, including whether people will hesitate to vaccinate their children.
Kansas has seen vaccination rates for kindergarteners drop in many areas across the state. The state also had a measles outbreak, which has since ended.
“As an autism researcher, we are also quite concerned with how this may misdirect attention as well as the critical funding we may need for studies that will support autistic individuals and their families,” Unruh said.
Two “very large” and rigorous studies have shown no association between autism and vaccinations, she said. The studies were well-controlled and had large samples. The initial and since discredited study that started the misinformation about vaccines and autism included just 12 children, Unruh said.
A 2002 Danish study included more than 500,000 children and looked at the risks of developing autism in children who were vaccinated and unvaccinated. The study controlled for multiple variables, including the age at which children received vaccines, their gestational age, birth weight and their economic status, Unruh said.
No connection was found between autism and vaccinations in that study.
Another large study in the United States also looked at familial factors because of the high likelihood of developing autism if the individual has a sibling with autism, Unruh said.
“Even if kids already had one likelihood factor for developing autism, they also found no increased association with developing autism and vaccines in those children,” she said.
The information being put out by the CDC on its official website worries Unruh.
“As a scientist, I’m quite concerned that they have ignored decades of rigorous research, including multiple studies that use CDC data,” she said. “On their own website, an archived page now, they do have a long list of studies that they have documented that show no association between vaccines and risk for developing autism.”
Scientific studies have shown a genetic component to autism and other studies have looked at environmental interactions that might increase the risk for autism, Unruh said.
A 2015 study published in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, researched possible connections between children who have a genetic likelihood of developing autism — identified because siblings had autism — and vaccinations causing them to develop autism, she said.
That study found no connections between the two, Unruh said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rfkjrsept222025-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

WILMINGTON, Del. — The New Castle County Chamber of Commerce’s annual Women’s Leadership Conference: RISE drew hundreds of business leaders, students, entrepreneurs, and community advocates to a sold-out gathering that blended professional development with honest conversations, economic insight, and the celebration of Delaware’s rising and established female leaders.
The full-day event — built around the theme of rising together — offered attendees the chance to network, learn, and hear from some of the most influential women shaping Delaware’s economic and social landscape. With keynote speakers from health care, higher education, and national nonprofits, plus five leadership award presentations, the program highlighted both the challenges women continue to face and the progress they are steadily driving.
For many, the event’s energy and sense of community were just as impactful as the formal programming.
“I’ve been here many times before and every year it keeps getting better and better and bigger and bigger,” said attendee Eve Pappas, Vice President of Business Development at Hoffman’s Exterminating. “Women are very intuitive to employee and client concerns, and to have an event like this that lifts them up to become better leaders is tremendous.”

The morning program opened with a strong focus on empowerment and perspective, reinforced by rows of exhibitor tables featuring employers, universities, nonprofits, and companies committed to elevating women in the workplace.
Among them was Diamond State Financial Group, whose representatives said the environment creates a sense of alignment and momentum.
“I think the impact is huge,” said exhibitor Allison Oberembt, Financial Advisor. “Seeing a lot of women in different paths just gives you ideas. If you’re unsure of where you belong, you’ll fit in here. The speakers and workshops are just filled with inspiring stories.”
For companies like Fulton Bank, a long-time sponsor, the conference reflects a commitment to economic and community investment.
“This is my first year attending, so I’m excited to be in the room with these amazing women,” said Jvonne Oliver, Financial Center Manager. “Fulton Bank has been sponsoring the event for 15 years or more. It fits into what we’re about — changing lives for the better, one conversation at a time.”
The atmosphere resonated beyond exhibitors. Educators and community leaders also leaned into the networking and shared purpose.
“I love it. I love all the connections we’re making and the feelings of sisterhood and camaraderie,” said Dr. Aisha Monroe, Executive Director of Graduate Programming and Student Success at Delaware State University. “My advice to the attendees is to stay open, never leave the mindset of a student, and be available to the opportunities around you.”
Keynote Speakers Emphasize Intentional Leadership and Personal Well-Being
This year’s keynote speakers tackled the deeper realities of leadership: navigating stress, leading through change, showing up with purpose, and sometimes simply admitting that you can’t do it alone.
ChristianaCare President and CEO Dr. Janice Nevin delivered an honest reflection on the responsibility and weight leaders carry — particularly women, who often juggle multiple roles.
Dr. Janice Nevin: “Leadership Isn’t Accidental”
ChristianaCare President and CEO Dr. Janice Nevin delivered an honest reflection on the responsibility and weight leaders carry — particularly women, who often juggle multiple roles.
“I think this is really, really important to the leaders in this room,” Nevin said. “It’s not a sign of weakness to feel you can’t do it alone. You have to be willing to say, ‘Hey, I could use a little help right now,’ and that’s OK.”
Nevin emphasized that leadership requires self-awareness and intentionality.
“Leadership isn’t accidental. You have to know your values, your purpose. And when those hard times come, and they will, you have to be intentional about your leadership,” she said. “What is it the people, whom you care about deeply, who are doing the work, need from you in this moment? It may not feel comfortable, but it is your job, as a leader, to do that.”
Her remarks resonated strongly with attendees navigating their own leadership journeys in industries ranging from finance to education to public service.
Dr. Laura Carlson: “Show Up — and Notice the Joy”
Dr. Laura Carlson, Interim President of the University of Delaware, focused on showing up fully, even amid demanding schedules and competing pressures.
“You have to show up, right,” Carlson said. “There’s a certain expectation, and taking care of yourself is important so that you can show up. But I also think it’s important to pay attention to the little joys that happen every day.”
Carlson pointed to the conference itself as a source of energy and optimism.
“This event will carry me for the next few days,” she said. “The fact that all of us are assembling and the energy that is here — that is awesome.”
Her remarks tied directly into the conference’s broader message: rising is not a solo act. It takes community, collaboration, and acknowledging the daily moments that keep leaders grounded.
Rosie Allen-Herring: “Respond — Don’t React”
The final keynote came from Rosie Allen-Herring, President & CEO of the United Way of the National Capital Area, who delivered a powerful message about resilience amid constant change.
“It is about, at the end of the day, what does resiliency look like,” she said. “I had to come to a point where I said to my team, ‘respond, but don’t react.’ Responding simply says, I acknowledge what’s happening.”
Her remarks acknowledged the challenges facing communities and nonprofits — rising needs, limited resources, shifting priorities — but stressed the importance of perspective.
“These times are challenging, but they don’t have to last always,” she said. “And so, this is an opportunity for us to think about who we serve, to focus on the community we serve.”
Leadership Awards Honor Women Shaping Delaware’s Future
One of the most anticipated portions of the conference each year is the presentation of leadership awards — recognizing women whose work, impact, and leadership stand out across Delaware’s business, nonprofit, and civic landscape.
This year’s honorees represented students, entrepreneurs, attorneys, community advocates, and emerging professionals — demonstrating the vast range of leadership pathways available to women.
Student Leadership Award: Billi Roman
University of Delaware freshman and Ice Hockey Team member Billi Roman delivered a heartfelt perspective on what she’s learned about leadership at a young age.
“This journey is how I finally understood what leadership means to me,” Roman said. “Leaders speak up when something matters. They ask for what they need. They advocate for themselves, not because it’s easy, but because it’s necessary.”
She emphasized that leadership isn’t only about directing others.
“There’s another side to leadership, a willingness to help,” she said. “Helping others is leadership because it shows you care.”
Young Woman Professional Award: Jacqueline Flowers
Jacqueline Flowers, Project Estimator at EDiS Company, offered one of the most personal reflections of the day — crediting her mother for instilling the foundation of her leadership style.
“Standing here today, I feel grateful, humble, and honestly a bit in awe to be surrounded by so many remarkable women,” she said. “My mom… taught me countless things, but one lesson has become the heartbeat of my life: always look for inspiration in the women around you.”
Her remarks captured the spirit of the event — women learning from women, generation to generation.
State Service Award: Lisa A. Schmidt
Lisa A. Schmidt, Director and Immediate Past President of Richards, Layton & Finger, spoke about the importance of civic stewardship and legal leadership.
“Today’s recognition isn’t just one person’s work,” Schmidt said. “It’s all about Delaware’s shared commitment to stewardship. To protecting what works, improving what we can, and ensuring that future generations inherit a system as strong as the one we have.”
Her comments provided a reminder that leadership includes sustaining systems that work — and courageously addressing those that don’t.
Impact Award: Katie Kutler
Entrepreneur and café owner Katie Kutler, of kaffé KARMA & KARMA’s korner, delivered a message centered on integrity and action.
“Impact does mean so much to me, and thank you for recognizing me today,” Kutler said. “I just think that you have to do the right thing. Even when you’re not sure somebody is going to recognize you and support you for it.”
She also spoke about the misconception surrounding “manifesting” success.
“The universe doesn’t hand you things when you manifest,” she said. “Manifestation without action is just daydreaming.”
Her story, rooted in small business resilience, aligned with broader statewide conversations about entrepreneurship, local economies, and community support.
Female Leader of the Year: Yvette Santiago
The conference’s top honor went to Yvette Santiago, Regional Director of Community Engagement and Impact at Nemours Children’s Health.
Her speech was emotional, grounded in identity, family, and determination.
“For so many reasons, this award means a lot. One of the reasons that sticks out the most is defying the odds,” she said. “As women. As women of color. As Latinas, we have to defy the odds. And that’s what sticks out to me.”
Santiago credited her parents for shaping her discipline and character.
“Their sacrifice, love, and support enabled my success,” she said. “Success… requires discipline, sacrifice, patience, and consistently working hard to achieve your goals and dreams.”
Her remarks earned a standing ovation — a fitting finale to the award ceremony.
A Conference That Builds Momentum — and Community
By the afternoon, the conference had transformed into more than a networking event. It had become a shared experience — a blend of mentorship, professional development, and affirmation for women across Delaware and the region.
The exhibitors, speakers, and award winners offered a textured narrative of what leadership looks like today: intentional, values-driven, community-minded, and grounded in real lived experiences.
For many attendees, the power of the event wasn’t just in the formal sessions, but in the connections sparked between them.
As DSU’s Dr. Monroe put it: “Stay open. Never leave the mindset of a student.”
And that sentiment — curiosity, growth, and willingness to rise together — is exactly what the Women’s Leadership Conference continues to cultivate year after year.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-26-095830.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

And though there are strict eligibility requirements for private-school scholarships, eligibility isn’t checked after the initial scholarship is awarded or for siblings of students who received a scholarship.
The revelations about the inner workings of Missouri’s private school voucher program came to light over the course of a two-day trial in Cole County Circuit Court this week.
The focus of the arguments Monday and Tuesday were over whether the state can use general revenue for private school tuition, with the attorney general’s office defending state funds as transformative for the program and Missouri’s largest teacher’s union saying the funding is unlawful.
But witness testimony pulled back the curtain on certain details about the MOScholars program that have stayed largely out of the public consciousness.
MOScholars, which is in its fourth year of operation, awards scholarships to K-12 students who meet certain criteria.
When state lawmakers created the program in a 2021 bill, they set it up to run on donations that are eligible for a 100% tax credit up to half of a donor’s tax liability. In the first three years of the program, donations totaled $33.8 million.
Gov. Mike Kehoe announced in January that he intended to bring a major infusion of funding to the program through a $50 million appropriation of general revenue. This windfall for MOScholars has allowed the state to nearly triple the amount of scholarships awarded this fall.
“If not for general revenue, would many of (the new) scholars be able to receive a scholarship?” Assistant Attorney General Peter Donahue asked the treasurer’s director of programs, Trent Blair.
“No,” Blair answered.
Loretta Haggard, an attorney representing the Missouri National Education Association, questions the State Treasurer’s director of programs in a trial challenging the constitutionality of Missouri’s funding of school vouchers Tuesday morning in the Cole County Courthouse (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Of 6,418 scholarships awarded this school year, only 111 are funded through tax credits. That includes the 2,405 students who were in the program last year. So if MOScholars did not receive the state appropriation, the funding would cover less than 5% of the renewal students going into the school year.
The State Treasurer’s Office, which oversees MOScholars, has previously admitted to problems with the timing of funding. The bulk of donations hit the accounts of educational assistance organizations — intermediary nonprofits that connect students with the funding — in December.
With tuition due in August, MOScholars had to either with eight months to award the funds or put stress on the system. Blair testified that the educational assistance organizations largely chose the latter and that the organizations themselves choose when to use donated funds. 
In 2023, two of the six educational assistance organizations acknowledged they used their private funds to pay tuition in the fall and paid themselves back once they received donations. In October, two organizations told The Independent that they were able to fund scholarships for all their renewal students and clear their waitlists with the new state funds.
The state money “stabilizes the program,” Blair testified Tuesday.
Representing the Missouri National Education Association, attorney Loretta Haggard unearthed issues with the administration of the program as she cross-examined Blair.
She honed in on MOScholars’ eligibility requirements. State law limits the program to students with an individualized education plan or those whose family makes at or below 300% of the income standard used to qualify for free and reduced price lunches.
The treasurer’s office uses an education management system called FACTS to review applications and determine eligibility. Haggard asked if the software checks if renewal students still meet eligibility requirements. 
It doesn’t, Blair said.
“So a student can receive a scholarship even though they don’t meet the IEP or income requirements?” Haggard then asked.
“Yes,” Blair said.
When a student is eligible one year, the system presumes that they retain eligibility. The siblings of renewal students are also deemed eligible.
The treasurer’s office has faced criticism before over how it has administered MOScholars, including complaints from Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck that the office wasn’t transparent about program data. And in July, a report from the State Auditor found the treasurer’s office didn’t conduct annual audits of the MOScholars program required by state law.
But Tuesday’s testimony was the first time the state has admitted to not rechecking eligibility, something that is routine for other state-funded programs like food assistance or Medicaid. 
Bryan Cleveland, an attorney with Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, spoke on behalf of families who say they benefit from increased MOScholars (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Any questions about the administration of the program don’t impact the legality of the appropriation, said Bryan Cleveland, an attorney with Indiana-based advocacy group EdChoice, who intervened in the case on behalf of three parents whose children have received assistance through MOScholars.
“The case does not depend on whether any one treasurer is doing a good job but rather on interpretation of statutory provisions,” he told the judge. “The rest of the discussion of what the treasurer or the educational assistance organizations do after (the appropriation) is not relevant.”
Blair, stepping off the witness stand Tuesday, sighed, head tucked as he walked back to his seat. The trial marked one of the few occasions the treasurer’s office has answered questions publicly, apart from occasional statements to the media.
When Cole County Judge Brian Stumpe denied a request for a temporary restraining order, which would have blocked the spending of the general revenue during the trial, the treasurer’s office held a joint press conference with the Missouri Attorney General’s Office but did not take any questions.
On Monday, attorneys argued over whether the Missouri NEA or its individual members had standing to challenge the state appropriation to MOScholars. 
A decision on the case is not expected until after Dec. 8, when attorneys’ post-trial filings are due.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112425_blair1-1024x615.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Photo by Karsan Turner for Iowa Capital Dispatch) The cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner set for 10 people, at $55.18, is 5% less than the cost in 2024, annual data from the American Farm Bureau Federation shows.
While key meal items like turkey and dinner rolls decreased in price this year, fresh vegetables and Thanksgiving dairy products are substantially more expensive. 
Overall, the report found the cost of the meal is still higher than it was in 2020, when the meal cost $46.90.
Farm Bureau said the table items with price increases reflect some of the hardships that farmers faced this year. 
Christopher Pudenz, Iowa Farm Bureau’s research and economics manager, said declining prices for some Thanksgiving staples is good for consumers, but profitability “continues to be a challenge” for farmers in 2025. 
“Iowa farmers face historically low crop prices, high input costs and tight margins, yet they remain resilient and committed to doing what they do best—caring for their land, practicing good stewardship and raising healthy animals to provide abundant, affordable food for families here at home and across the country,” Pudenz said in a statement.

Turkey
While turkey is typically the star of the show – and the top billed item on the table – turkey represented just 39% of the cost of the Thanksgiving meal this year, which Farm Bureau said is the lowest share of the meal cost since 2000. On average, the bureau said the bird accounts for 43% of the total receipt.
This year the average 16-pound turkey cost $21.50, or $1.34 per pound, which is more than 16% less than the average turkey cost last year. 
While the price has declined, popularity has not. A consumer survey from the National Turkey Federation found that 87% of Americans who celebrate Thanksgiving plan to serve turkey. The majority, 74%, serve the whole bird at the holiday and 65% choose to roast their turkey in the oven. 
The overall size of the turkey flock, according to USDA data, has declined. Farm Bureau said these flock sizes reflect the impact the highly pathogenic avian influenza has had on the industry. Since 2022, according to Farm Bureau, close to 19 million turkeys have been impacted by the bird flu. 
Iowa has only had one reported outbreak of the flu this fall – at a turkey farm in Calhoun County. 
And the fixins
Sweet potatoes, vegetable trays with carrots and celery, frozen peas, milk and whipping cream all increased in price this year. 
Cranberries, stuffing and rolls, however, decreased slightly in price for the 2025 meal. 
A 3-pound bag of sweet potatoes averaged $4, a 37% increase from the year prior, according to the report. 
Farm Bureau said natural disasters, like hurricanes in North Carolina — the nation’s largest producer of sweet potatoes —  partially contributed to the increase in cost. 
Produce costs have also increased in the country due to labor shortages, increased labor costs and supply chain or transportation setbacks, according to Farm Bureau. 
Group blames tariffs
The campaign Tariffs Cost US blamed tariffs for the increase in cost, citing farmer statements that have said increasing input costs have lead them to hike local produce costs. 
The organization also launched an ad campaign, ahead of Black Friday and holiday shopping, pinning tariffs for higher price tags. According to the group, local businesses are especially feeling the added costs and hoping the busy shopping season will keep them in the black. 
Rachel Lutz, owner of the Peacock Room in Detroit, said a $700 shipment of jewelry recently came with the added cost of $100 tariff. She worries the added fees will force more small businesses to close. 
“That adds up fast and is unsustainable in the long run,” Lutz said in a news release with Tariffs Cost US. “It has been heartbreaking to wake up so many mornings and see yet another family-owned business closing in our community because they cannot absorb these costs.”
Local business owners in Iowa have also expressed concerns about the impact tariffs will have on holiday shopping and their overall margins.
At the farmers’ table 
While consumer prices fluctuate from year to year, farmers continue to earn just a small percentage. USDA data shows farmers receive less than 16 cents for every dollar spent on food in the U.S.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig, in a news release Monday, reminded Iowans of the role farmers play in the Thanksgiving meal. 
“As we gather this week with our family and friends, I invite everyone to pause for a moment and give thanks for Iowa’s hardworking farm families who produce the delicious Thanksgiving meals on our tables,” Naig said. 
National Farmers Union’s annual “Farmer’s Share of the Food Dollar” report shows farmers receive “only pennies on the dollar” for the typical Thanksgiving fare. 
The report shows farmers earn the least amount, 6 cents or 1.3% of the price, on a 12-ounce box of stuffing. Producers also score just 6 cents per pound, or 2.4% of the sale price of turkey. 
Farmers who sell turkeys direct to consumers and with free-range or organic traits earn more per dollar, but also charge more, between $5 and $7 per pound. 
Cranberry and green producers receive the highest percentage of the Thanksgiving food dollar for their commodities at nearly 32% and nearly 25% respectively. 
Farmers Union President Rob Larew, in a news release, said there is “continuous inequality” in the food system. 
“Every Thanksgiving, the numbers tell the same story: farmers aren’t asking for a bigger slice of pie, just a fair one,” Larew said. “It’s long past time to fix a food system that works for corporations but not for the families who grow and consume our food.”

The allegations are nothing new. Mississippi has cycled through five private prison health vendors over the past three decades amid recurring concerns about staffing shortages, weak oversight, unpaid bills to hospitals and inadequate care provided to patients. One report published nearly two decades ago by the Legislature’s watchdog committee echoes many of the questions raised by state lawmakers this year. 
Meanwhile, Mississippi Today’s Beyond Bars, Beyond Care series has documented alleged routine denial of health care in Mississippi prisons: potentially thousands of people living with hepatitis C going without treatment, an untreated broken arm that resulted in amputation and delayed cancer screenings one woman said led to a terminal diagnosis. One ex-corrections official said people are experiencing widespread medical neglect in Mississippi’s prisons. 
The Legislature appropriated $690,000 this year for monitoring and review of its current prison health contract, held by Kansas-based VitalCore Health Strategies, Inc. A report is due to legislators by Dec. 15. 
Mississippi Today took a closer look at Mississippi’s contracts for medical services and asked experts what changes can be made to strengthen them. 
How long has Mississippi relied on private medical contractors?
Incarcerated people are one of the few groups in the United States with a constitutional right to health care. In the 1990s, faced with frequent lawsuits filed by incarcerated people, consent decrees and ballooning prison populations, an industry of private companies sprung up to shoulder the state’s responsibility of providing health care to people in prison. 
The Mississippi Department of Corrections began contracting out its medical services in 1998 after years of providing health care itself. The University of Mississippi Medical Center was the first entity chosen to provide the services, and since then, the department has held contracts with four other companies. 
Mississippi selected VitalCore for a three-year contract worth over $357 million in 2024. The company won out over Wexford Health Sources and Centurion of Mississippi, both companies that have held the contract for prison medical services in the past, in a competitive bidding process. VitalCore was awarded over $315 million in emergency, no-bid state contracts from 2020 to 2024.
VitalCore holds correctional health contracts in several other states, including Massachusetts, Michigan and Delaware, and it has faced legal battles and scrutiny in other jurisdictions. 
VitalCore was sued last year by its former chief officer medical of operations in Vermont, who alleged the company forged his signature on policy documents and fired him after he raised alarm bells about conditions in the state’s prisons. A 2019 lawsuit alleges that a 48-year-old with documented heart problems collapsed and died in a New Mexico county jail after VitalCore staff failed to properly monitor his condition. And significant understaffing of medical positions in Massachusetts prisons led VitalCore to pay back $1.4 to $1.7 million a month to the state, according to reporting by the Boston Institute for Nonprofit Journalism.
Dan Mistak, the director of health care initiatives for justice-involved populations at Community Oriented Correctional Health Services, described the process of states contracting corrections medical companies as a “revolving door.” 
When a new company is awarded the contract, it often rehires many of the same staff members. If controversy arises over the quality of care or another issue, the company carries the blame and either receives more money from the state to fulfill its obligations or leaves. A new company then rotates in. 
“Rinse, cycle, repeat, over and over again,” Mistak said. 
Centurion, a company previously tasked with providing health care to Mississippi’s prisoners, terminated its contract with the corrections department in 2020 amid an ongoing legal battle with prisoners, arguing that the state’s failure to invest in infrastructure and correctional staffing prevented the company from performing its duties. Centurion was brought in under an emergency contract, like VitalCore, in 2015.
The prior contractor, Wexford, was accused of funneling consulting fees to a former Mississippi state legislator, Cecil McCrory, who pleaded guilty to bribing a Mississippi corrections commissioner, Chris Epps, in exchange for Epps’ efforts to steer state prison contracts. The state collected $4 million from the company in a lawsuit. 
How have prison health care costs changed under the new contract? 
Mississippi’s per capita spending on prison health care has risen steadily over the last 25 years, according to reports by the Legislature’s watchdog branch, the Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review Committee. 
In 2000, the state spent $5.07 per day on health care for people in its custody. In 2024, the cost was three times as high – $16.03 per day. In recent years, spending on basic medical care has risen starkly while the costs of specialty care have grown more slowly or dropped. 
Corrections Commissioner Burl Cain attributed the rise in costs to inmates overusing medical services. Speaking at a legislative budget hearing Sept. 24, he likened the business of providing medical services to people in Mississippi’s prisons to caring for animals.

“It just goes up, and these inmates go to the doctor for everything,” he said. “And the problem is, it’s like being, I hate to say it, sometimes it’s like being a veterinarian to say what really, what’s wrong with you.”
The Department of Corrections did not respond to questions about why costs are rising or what Cain meant. 
Marc Stern, a faculty member at the University of Washington and former assistant secretary for health care at the Washington Department of Corrections who serves as a medical adviser for the National Sheriffs’ Association and American Jail Association, said the rise in basic care costs may be the result of rising costs for salaries and medications. 
He said health care in jails and prisons in the U.S. is often not funded as well as it needs to be to ensure that people receive quality care.
“As a result, you get what you pay for,” Stern said. “… Is it the fault of the company or is it the fault of the legislature? I guess that’s a philosophical question.” 
Mississippi’s prison population is growing older, which can result in more costly care. The portion of prisoners aged 55 or older has grown by about 10% in the past 20 years, accounting for 12% of the population in 2019. 
Mississippi has one of the highest incarceration rates per capita in the world — 661 people per 100,000. About 19,500 people are currently incarcerated in state prisons. 
How does a fixed-rate model of health spending shape the care prisoners receive? 
VitalCore is paid a flat rate adjusted to reflect the number of people in custody, regardless of their medical needs. It is required to provide onsite care, including mental health, dental, dialysis, laboratory and optometry care, and cover the costs of offsite care at hospitals or for specialty care. In the first year of the contract, VitalCore is paid about $115 million, with adjustments of $53.54 for each inmate below 19,000 or above 19,600. The payment rates grow each year. 
This means that if a contractor spends less to provide health care to people in state custody, it reaps a larger profit. But, it loses money if it exceeds cost projections.
The fixed-rate model is more predictable for the state than other models, like reimbursing a contractor for the care they provide. While the state won’t see the savings if less is spent on medical services, it also won’t be required to pay extra if more is spent. It is the most common way to structure prison health contracts among all states, according to a report from Pew Charitable Trust published in 2015. 
This model can, in theory, reward preventive care measures that keep people healthy and reduce expensive interventions. But it can also encourage delayed or inadequate care, since contractors can save money by limiting the care they provide. Strong monitoring is the key to curbing these risks, experts said. 
Because about 95% of people will be released from prison at some point, communities absorb the consequences of delayed or inadequate care in the long term through higher emergency room use, worsening population health or infectious disease spread, Mistak said. 
This can burden hospitals and state safety-net programs, like Medicaid and Medicare, down the road. 
“Those costs are going to be borne by the state and the community,” he said.  
What if a company’s bid isn’t enough? 
In a competitive process for prison health care vendors, the company with the lowest bid usually wins the contract. But when correctional care providers propose a low budget to stand out during the procurement process, they sometimes can not afford the costs of care they proposed and still turn a profit, Mistak said. 
In some cases, contractors will return to government entities that contracted them to ask for more money. This has played out in Missouri and a county jail in Wisconsin in recent years. 
“You end up paying more anyway for a lot of these contracts,” Mistak said. 
That’s what happened in Mississippi. In May, MDOC requested $4 million for a “deficit appropriation” – money to cover a shortfall – for VitalCore, according to House Corrections Committee Chairwoman Becky Currie, a Republican from Brookhaven.
How do staffing clawbacks work?
If VitalCore does not meet staffing requirements outlined in the contract, the company must pay the corrections department back the average hourly wage for each unfilled hour of work, plus a 20% fee for employee benefits, according to the contract. 
“We’re really good at that,” Cain said Sept. 24. “We take back from the money that they didn’t spend on hiring people. They don’t get to keep it.” 
He said the department has used funds recouped from VitalCore for unmet staffing requirements to pay for improvements to buildings and infrastructure. 
But returning the salaries of unfilled positions isn’t enough, Stern said. To truly motivate companies to fill the position, they must face a financial consequence beyond the value of the vacant position. 
“Those penalties have to be stiff enough to be more than what the vendor saves from not filling the position,” he said. 
Why have legislators said VitalCore is ‘slow paying’ its bills to vendors? 
At the Sept. 24 budget hearing, Sen. Daniel Sparks, a Republican from Belmont, said that VitalCore delaying payments to vendors, including the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has been a “continual issue.” 
Currie told Mississippi Today that Bolivar Medical Center in Cleveland, about 25 miles from the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, has faced similar challenges. 
Neither hospital, the Department of Corrections or VitalCore responded to a request for comment. 
Cain said Sept. 24 the issue was due in part to hospitals billing VitalCore at rates higher than the agreed-upon costs for prison medical services. Deputy Commissioner of Administration and Finance Derrick Garner said the agency is monitoring the issue and aims to increase oversight of the payments.
Sparks said that VitalCore could pay the agreed-upon rate rather than waiting to negotiate rates. 
“But to not pay the bill at all, and let the bill get into the millions of dollars when that’s a state entity that’s supposed to be paid by a state entity and the intermediary is holding up the payment, it doesn’t settle well,” Sparks said. 
What kind of oversight does Mississippi use to monitor the contract? 
The Department of Corrections performs oversight of its contract with VitalCore. Monitoring tasks include reviewing service levels, quality of care and administrative practices, meeting with VitalCore to address issues, conducting site visits and inspections and reviewing third-party reimbursements, according to the contract. 
The state examining its own contract reduces the costs of bringing in an outside monitor and allows the state more control over what it tracks, said Stern. 
But the quality of monitoring depends on how willing the state is to hold a contractor accountable, and states may be less stringent out of fear that a contractor will bail. 
“The threats of leaving can really make a state gulp,” Mistak said. “…And so sometimes they lay off the gas when it comes to enforcing their own contract.”
The Mississippi Legislature has made several efforts of its own to scrutinize the medical care provided in state prisons. 
The Legislature tasked the health department with studying the challenges of providing health care to people who are incarcerated in 2024, and State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney presented initial findings at the Capitol in January. The health department will produce a report roughly a year from now, including recommendations to MDOC, said spokesperson Greg Flynn. 
This year, the Legislature appropriated funding for the Department of Corrections to monitor and review the medical services contract, with a report due to legislators by Dec. 15. Cain said Sept. 24 that the contract for the report has been finalized.

MDOC did not respond to questions about who was awarded the contract.
Currie, who has spent the last year probing for answers as to why inmates are getting sicker as the state increases its spending on medical care, said she is curious to see the report’s finding. She authored a failed bill this year that would have tasked the health department with conducting a sweeping review of medical care for people incarcerated in Mississippi at no cost. 
“Yet, we spend $700,000 on a report,” she said to Mississippi Today. 
Does privatizing prison health care make the system better?
Most states contract all or part of their prison health services with private companies. Several states provide their own prison health services through government agencies, like Louisiana.
If a state develops a strong oversight system, they can gain the expertise to manage the contract themselves, said Stern. Providing health care in-house can reduce costs for states, he said, because contractors must make a profit margin and less duplication of services exists between the state and the contractors. 
It also creates more opportunities for continuity between prison health care and community health care, which would make it easier for health providers to care for people when they are released, experts said. 
Some evidence shows that medical services run by government agencies may lead to lower death rates. A 2020 Reuters investigation of more than 500 jails in the U.S. showed that facilities with private healthcare contractors had higher death rates than those run by government agencies. 
Currie said she would like to see prison health care run by the state or a local hospital system, which she said would ensure stronger accountability and quality care. 
“I’m just not able to sit back and watch people die and be treated badly, no matter who they are,” Currie said. 
“…Most of these people are coming out. And the new law is that most of them will come out. And you know, we need them to be healthy and ready to go to work and lower our recidivism rate.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/06114603/37b90-prisonercopy.jpg,,,2025-11-26 11:00:26.004766

(Getty Images)America’s farthest-west town, Adak, is being sued by a former employee who alleges he was denied overtime pay and pressured into resigning because of racism by city officials.
A city council member named in the lawsuit, Christian Tolliver, declined extensive comment but said the allegation is untrue. A second person named as a defendant, former city council member Elaine Smiloff, could not be reached for comment.
The lawsuit, from Xavier Charles, was filed Nov. 12 in state Superior Court at Unalaska. It names the 67-person town of Adak and two city council members as defendants. Charles is seeking an unspecified financial award, including back pay, front pay, and “compensatory damages.”
Charles, who is Black, was a public works laborer from March 2023 to April 2024, and delivered mail, did maintenance and a variety of jobs throughout the town.
The complaint alleges that a federal contractor who invited Charles to dinner at the Adak Lodge — owned by Tolliver — was told by Tolliver “that Plaintiff’s ‘kind were not allowed at his house.’”
The complaint says Tolliver repeatedly questioned Charles’ conduct and states that Tolliver told one of Charles’ coworkers that Charles “rides around the neighborhood stealing and joy riding” and said “he’s black so he must be stealing.”
The complaint alleges that Tolliver’s wife tracked Charles while he did his work, and that Charles’s supervisor called Tolliver racist.
Charles filed a formal complaint with a third-party firm used by the city of Adak. The resulting investigation “concluded with a finding that the allegations were substantiated,” the complaint states, but adds that “the city of Adak took no meaningful disciplinary action.”
In April 2024, another city council member told Charles, “if I didn’t resign they were going to figure out a way to fire me anyways,” the complaint states.
Charles filed a complaint with the Anchorage Equal Rights Commission and a charge with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the EEOC issued a “notice of right to sue.”
Charles is being represented by Anchorage attorney Isaac Zorea.
“It’s unfortunate,” Zorea said by phone. “Charles came from the Lower 48 up to Adak; you’re moving quite a distance from the South, you would think that you’d have a better reception.”
He noted that Tolliver has a Confederate flag on his truck, something mentioned in the complaint.
“I think it’s just sad, you know. It doesn’t look good for our state,” Zorea said.
Former Adak city manager Layton Lockett, who ran the city during Charles’ time, did not return two phone calls seeking comment. Adak’s current acting manager declined to comment, saying she had not seen the lawsuit.
Tolliver, reached by phone, declined extensive comment, saying that if he is formally served with the lawsuit, he will have a lawyer respond. 
“I don’t know where or who he’s trying to extort money from, but he had just gotten out of prison when he got here, and his uncle was trying to give him a new start, and it didn’t really work out,” Tolliver said. “His behavior wasn’t what many people on the island would have wished it had been, so that was more of a problem with most people that I know than his skin color, and maybe he confused the two.”
Tolliver said he is a retired Army officer and has worked with racially different people before.
“If he was here, I would tell him to his face: I don’t have a problem with his skin color, but his behavior,” Tolliver said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-90090097-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 09:57:03.026470

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Collin Tuthill, president of one of the country’s largest canned and frozen food importers and distributors, said the current state of the U.S. food industry is “like we live in some kind of alternate universe.”
The most efficient industry is being hit the hardest by tariff policies and rising costs, he said Tuesday during a video call with reporters.
“The folks that are taking the punches are the ones that can’t really afford to take the punches,” said Tuthill, president of Royal Food Import, a North Carolina-based company that distributes food to hospitals, food banks, schools and prisons.
Tuthill was part of a group brought together by Tariffs Cost US, a campaign highlighting the detrimental effects of Trump administration tariff policies.
Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union, said costs were already rising — for consumers and farmers — before President Donald Trump implemented tariffs.
“With tariffs, they are going up more,” he said.
Families see the effects in the cost of their Thanksgiving meals, he said.
Tariffs on imported steel have increased the overall cost of canned goods. Cheeses, spices and chocolates also have become more expensive. The tariffs, which have reached the highest average rate since 1935, stack on top of higher fuel, seed, fertilizer, equipment and transportation costs, Levendofsky said. 
Then farmers see an even smaller share of profits.
For a turkey that costs $2.40 per pound, a farmer receives 6 cents, Levendofsky said. For a $6.99, 8-pound bag of potatoes, farmers receive 94 cents. A $4.49, 18-ounce package of dinner rolls gets a farmer 9 cents. A 12-ounce bag of green beans sold for $2.49 earns a farmer 62 cents.
“So when we talk about tariffs, we’re not talking about an abstract policy. We’re talking about real price increases on the foods that make up a traditional Thanksgiving dinner,” Levendofsky said. “Every added cost in the supply chain eventually shows up at the checkout line.”
The bottom line, he said, is tariffs don’t protect families or farmers.
Mary Carroll Dodd, owner of Red Scout Farm in western North Carolina, grows crops to sell through community-supported agriculture, at farmers’ markets and to local restaurants. Many of the supplies she depends upon — greenhouse materials, potting soil, tools, insect netting and produce bags — come from Canada, Mexico and China.
Costs add up quickly and profit margins are thin, she said.
“Every increase means tough choices,” Dodd said.
That can include price hikes for customers or other cost-cutting measures, which often come at the expense of fair worker pay, she said.
Because of the increase in her farm’s costs, she has raised the price of collard greens, kale and lettuce mix bags.
“We should be making it easier for family farms to survive,” Dodd said, “not harder.”
The Trump administration has touted trade deals and proposed bailout payments to mitigate low crop prices and high production costs. The administration also has claimed Thanksgiving food prices are lower this year than in past years, which the panelists said was misleading and inaccurate.
“A bailout is a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,” Levendofsky said.
Policy shifts throughout the agriculture industry are needed, he said. Kansas has piles of sorghum that are growing by the minute, but there’s no market for the farmers that grow it, he said. Farmers also need antitrust law enforcement that targets massive companies that have outsized control of markets, particularly meatpackers, Levendofsky said.
“I can honestly say farmers don’t want a bailout,” he said. “They want trade, not aid.”
Dodd said farms need long-term, sustainable solutions that are not one-size-fits-all. Existing programs within the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, such as its conservation stewardship program and cropshare programs, can provide farmers with sustainability.
Tuthill said a bailout is not going to solve farmers’ issues. The food industry needs customers outside of the country to draw dollars back into the country, he said.
For his company, tariffs and rising costs have meant fewer items going to food banks, smaller portions in school cafeterias and lower quality products in hospitals and prisons. Tariffs or taxes on food make no sense, he said.
“We’re at a pretty sad state of affairs to see that we’re raising the price of food for the most in need,” Tuthill said. “We see it every day.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Glickman-levendofsky-20250827_131619-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 09:57:03.026470

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is giving thanks for our readers and other blessings, and will return to your inboxes on Monday, Dec. 1.
Will a cap on student loans discourage Californians from becoming nurses? We may find out.
The Trump administration is proposing to restrict the amount of money nursing students can borrow to advance their education, raising worries that the change could potentially worsen California’s nursing shortage.
The U.S. Department of Education earlier this month wrapped up a rulemaking session ironing out details about new federal student loan rules from President Donald Trump’s sweeping budget bill that passed in July.
The bill eliminates two loan programs — one of which is Grad PLUS loans, a type of federal student aid for graduate students — while also creating what the department describes as the “new and simplified” Repayment Assistance Plan, or RAP.
Under RAP, which will be available in July, the total federal debt cap for students in professional programs is $200,000 and $100,000 for other graduate students. The education department is proposing to define professional degrees as degrees in medicine, pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, law, clinical psychology and other fields.
Nursing wouldn’t make the cut for the higher loan cap.
California faces a shortage of about 36,000 licensed nurses. The number of students opting to attend private, more expensive nursing programs in California is also rising. In a statement to CalMatters, the University of California, which has four nursing schools, said “limiting access to student loans … for aspiring nurses will only worsen this (shortage) crisis by undermining efforts to grow the workforce.”
The lowered borrowing cap would also make it harder for nursing students to become nurse practitioners, nurse anesthetists or other positions that require advanced degrees, nursing organizations argue.

Sandy Reding, president of the California Nurses Association union: “Nurse practitioners currently provide much-needed primary care, particularly in rural and underserved areas. If this rule went into effect, it could have a major impact on nurses’ access to graduate nursing programs. In addition, it will make it more difficult to find nursing faculty with advanced degrees to teach in nursing programs. We want to be clear that this is an attack on the nursing profession.”

The effect of the proposed loan cap for nurses could be similar to what experts anticipate about Trump’s new student loan caps for medical students: That higher financial barriers for students to pursue certain degrees would make the pool of prospective health care workers both shrink and become less diverse.
The education department released a statement Monday arguing that 95% of nursing students already borrow below the loan limit and won’t be affected by the rule change. Ellen Keast, the department’s press secretary for higher education, also told Newsweek that the plan’s definition of professional degrees aligns with “historical precedent.”

Keast: “We’re not surprised that some institutions are crying wolf over regulations that never existed because their unlimited tuition ride on the taxpayer dime is over.”

The department said it plans to finalize the student loan rules by early next year.

A setback for The Wonderful Company

From CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang:
California ag giant The Wonderful Company suffered a setback in its bid to overturn a new law that some of its workers had used to unionize when an appeal court tossed its lawsuit against state labor regulators. 
The Tuesday decision by a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno leaves in place a new law backed by the United Farm Workers that was meant to help it gain members. The law allows farmworkers to signal their support for union representation using a signed card, bypassing the traditional in-person, secret-ballot election usually held on the employer’s property. 
The Wonderful Company filed suit against the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board last year trying to overturn the law. The suit, alleging the law is unconstitutional, came after the United Farm Workers filed a petition with enough signatures to represent 600-odd workers at the company’s grape nursery in Wasco. 
Elizabeth Strater, United Farm Workers’ vice president, said the decision affirms that “every farm worker in California has rights under the law, and those rights need to be protected.” But the company’s general counsel Craig Cooper dismissed the ruling as only a matter of timing: “The decision explicitly does not address the merits of Wonderful Nurseries’ constitutional challenge.”



The latest on Trump’s immigration crackdown

Let’s get into some immigration news:

Student financial aid: The Trump administration is suing California to block its policy of offering in-state tuition, scholarships and loans to immigrant students who do not have legal status. Federal lawyers argue that California’s policy is unconstitutional, and violates a federal law that bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. An estimated 100,000 college students lack legal status in the state. California is the sixth state Trump is targeting of the more than 20 states that have some in-state tuition policy that benefits residents without legal status. The California Department of Justice said it is prepared to fight the lawsuit. Read more from CalMatters’ Adam Echelman and Mikhail Zinshteyn.


Arrests at ICE check-ins: A routine check-in with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement landed a San Diego pedicab driver in detainment — a situation that advocates say more immigrants are experiencing under Trump’s immigration crackdown. In 2022 Idris Demirtas sought asylum in the U.S. after fleeing Turkey to escape religious persecution. He received a five-year work permit and has no criminal history, according to his wife and attorneys. Last week federal immigration agents arrested Demirtas at a San Diego federal courthouse where he was ordered to appear for a check-in. He’s now being held at a detention center, and ICE did not respond to a request for comment about why Dimitras was arrested or why he’s still detained. Read more from CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.

One witness after another faced the House Oversight and Reform Committee and described their experience at the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which descended on Los Angeles in June, stirring discontent with a theatrical assault on the city’s immigrant communities. 
One man who has lived in Los Angeles for 23 years and is married with four children, dropped his younger kids at school on June 6 and headed to work, where ICE agents detained him. He ended up at an ICE facility in Adelanto, struggling with his health, waiting for days to see a nurse or doctor. Eventually he was released and is home in Los Angeles. 
A young woman, not present for the hearing but represented by a friend, was up early one morning to sell tamales outside a local school. ICE agents tossed her to the ground, injuring her so seriously she had to be hospitalized. She’s an American citizen and was released but now is so scared of ICE, she refuses to leave her house. She has been inside for 158 days.
Yet another man, detained on June 10 by masked men who had no identification or warrant for his arrest, remained locked up by ICE until Sept. 16, when he was released on bail. He described his 98 days of detention: rotten food, orders to stay silent when officials visited, an atmosphere of danger. 
His voice broke as he acknowledged he had been raped. The experience, he said, “reminded me of the violence that I lived through in my country, Honduras.”
Their stories were piercing, puncturing any glib stereotypes about immigrants, documented or undocumented. These were not dangerous criminals who need to be removed to protect this country. They are working men and women, laboring to support their families and loved ones. 
President Donald Trump promised to go after the “worst of the worst,” but his agents ended up harassing and devastating these decent people. And their detentions benefited no one.
Moreover, there are costs to others around them. Witnesses from local organizations made clear in their testimony that school attendance is down, church pews are half-empty, summer youth programs struggled to stay afloat and businesses are suffering for want of employees and customers.

Some people are afraid to venture out because they lack proper documentation. Others are afraid because they simply “look illegal.”
That apparently was the case for Andrea Velez. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Velez was born in the United States and is, therefore, an American citizen. 
On June 2, her mom dropped her off at work in the fashion district. But before Velez could get inside, she was rushed by ICE officers, who took her into custody. She was not carrying any proof of American citizenship — few people do — and ICE was not interested in her driver’s license. She was handcuffed and detained.
Denied food, she was told she could only have water if she purchased a cup. She was rebuffed in her requests to contact family or a lawyer. Velez was held two days, until June 4.
To be clear, Velez had committed no crime and is a native-born American citizen. Her only offenses were to come to work and to be Latino. 
She asked the officers who arrested her for their names but was denied that, too. “They told me I didn’t need to know their names,” she said in response to questioning by Congress members who participated in the hearing.
One member questioned her more deeply, wondering if she had done anything to warrant such treatment. Velez said she had not been carrying any weapons and had neither attacked nor threatened any officer. She is 4 feet, 11 inches tall.
The treatment described by witnesses at the hearing should shock the conscience, but some consciences appear too hardened to be moved. 
As Mayor Karen Bass and Rep. Robert Garcia, who presided over the session, noted, the cruelty of these policies is not a defect — it is the point.
“It was over the top from Day 1,” Bass told me after the hearing, “the way they dramatized it by pulling up on the street and jumping out with rifles at a woman selling fruit. There’s no way in the world you can tell me they thought she was a criminal … It was designed to terrorize. It was to go in and inflict maximum damage.”
These wanton attacks on the fabric of Los Angeles life have had at least one positive effect: In a city that has sometimes seen Black and brown residents turn against each other, this episode has been unifying, something many speakers remarked on, and that was reinforced by the proceeding itself: Garcia, a native of Peru and naturalized American citizen, sat next to Bass, the first Black woman to serve as Los Angeles’s mayor.
Support for immigrants came from a broad range of speakers: from Rep. Maxine Waters to immigrant groups, from union leadership to prominent Japanese-Americans. including some who drew parallels to the 1942 internments that were carried out under the same legal authority Trump is using now for his anti-immigrant actions.
Monday’s hearing was packed, and speakers were often interrupted by cheers and applause. As witnesses concluded their sometimes-harrowing stories, others stepped forward to hug and comfort them. A session called to collect evidence became an opportunity to demonstrate solidarity.
One of the day’s loudest expressions of support came for Waters, when she used her time to denounce Trump, whom she called a “low-down, no-good, filthy president.” The audience — white, Black, Asian, Latino, old and young — cheered loudly for that.

But the administration's legal argument is weak, according to top legal experts.","In summary
The Trump administration is suing California, asking the state to end its policies allowing students without legal status to access in-state tuition and financial aid. But the administration’s legal argument is weak, according to top legal experts. 



Hours after the Trump administration sued California last week, threatening to end key benefits for students without legal status, Michelle was scrolling social media when she saw a video that made her panic. 
The Trump administration is challenging California’s policy of providing in-state tuition, scholarships and subsidized loans to immigrants without legal status — including Michelle, an immigrant who is a community college student in San Mateo County. CalMatters has agreed to withhold her full name because she fears drawing attention to her legal status. 
On TikTok, rumors swirled. Michelle saw a video of a young man, around her age, asking if the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, is gone. In reality, FAFSA is still around, and while the new lawsuit could affect some students’ financial aid, some top legal experts say the Trump administration is unlikely to win. Regardless, the court process may take weeks or much longer to resolve the government’s claims against California.
In the lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Justice alleges that California’s policy of granting in-state tuition and financial aid for some students without legal status is unconstitutional. Federal lawyers also argue that California’s policies violate a 1996 federal law, which bars states from providing benefits to residents without legal status that aren’t also available to U.S. citizens who live anywhere in the U.S. The Justice Department is arguing that California either needs to drop the policy or let all U.S. citizens, including those who are out-of-state, pay the same rate.
In California, over 100,000 college students lack legal status, according to one estimate by an alliance of university leaders who advocate for immigrants. Federal assistance, such as Pell grants and federal student loans, are off-limits to anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen or does not have permanent legal status. California has its own money for college financial aid, which it distributes according to state law. 
As long as individuals meet certain requirements, such as attending three years of high school in California, they’re eligible for in-state tuition, saving as much as $39,000 of dollars each year compared to their out-of-state peers. Once they meet those requirements, students without legal status can also qualify for the state’s cornerstone financial aid program, known as Cal Grant, though only a small fraction of these students actually apply for and receive it.   
To Kevin Johnson, a law professor at UC Davis, Trump’s actions may be more about political wins than legal ones. “The Trump administration is engaged in a full-court press on undocumented immigrants and so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, and California and Governor Newsom in particular,” Johnson said. That the U.S. Department of Justice named the suit “United States of America v. Newsom” is another indication that this is political, he added.
Others noted that states have already invested in students without legal status and denying them an affordable path toward a college education is a waste of resources. Economists have pointed out that immigrants without status also are integral to the U.S. workforce and aren’t easily replaceable. 
‘We didn’t expect them to go this low’
Even weak lawsuits or outright misinformation can make students nervous during November, when college and financial aid application season is in full swing.  
On TikTok, videos of students panicking about the financial aid system surfaced last winter, after the Biden administration delayed and botched the rollout of the new FAFSA. Among its many glitches, the new form prevented students whose parents lacked a Social Security number from submitting their information.
After Trump was elected last November, fears about the total demise of federal financial aid swirled again on TikTok. Over the course of this year, as his administration targets universities and continues to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, those fears have persisted. 
In California, Trump seeks to impose a $1 billion penalty on UCLA for alleged civil rights abuses, though a federal judge recently handed the White House a temporary loss on that front. His administration is also suing California colleges and universities for alleged antisemitism violations and has sought to freeze or curtail billions of dollars in federal research funding. 
Much of those freezes have been blocked or reversed by federal judges, but hundreds of millions of dollars still remain cut off to campuses. Much, if not all, of those friction points between California and Trump could be resolved through settlements and negotiations, which are political in nature, said UCLA law professor Hiroshi Motomura in an interview.
Before Trump was elected, state leaders, including Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Chula Vista Democrat, pushed for California to offer additional benefits to students without legal status, such as the opportunity to work campus jobs. 
Now, with access to financial aid programs at risk for these students, Alvarez said the focus is shifting. “We didn’t expect it would go this low as to go after students that the president had previously said should be welcomed here.” In 2024, Trump told a podcast host that students should “automatically” receive “a Green Card,” otherwise known as permanent residency, when they get their college diploma. 
Legal scholars doubt Trump’s lawsuit will win
The lawsuit against California is the Trump administration’s sixth against states with policies allowing in-state tuition for students without legal status. The White House went after Texas first, in June. Underscoring how much of a bipartisan issue in-state tuition is, Texan lawmakers were the first in the U.S. to enshrine the policy in 2001. In all, more than 20 states passed some in-state tuition policy benefiting some residents without legal status.Trump’s legal attacks on the policy this year prompted leaders in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Texas to side with the White House to terminate the benefit in those respective states. Some legal groups that want to continue in-state tuition for students lacking legal status are challenging those states’ moves.Trump has also sued Minnesota and Illinois, states with Democrats as governors and attorneys general who are challenging Trump’s lawsuits.
The U.S. Department of Justice says that the federal law in question bars students without legal status from receiving in-state tuition and financial aid benefits based on their living in the state. This, the federal lawyers argue, violates federal law since public campuses in California require U.S. citizens from other states to pay higher tuition rates.  However, California’s law, Assembly Bill 540, doesn’t extend in-state tuition based on where students live, scholars and a previous court ruling say. Instead, students generally need to prove that they attended three years of high school or community college in California; they also need to earn in California a high school diploma or obtain enough community college credits to be eligible for transfer into a public university.The Department of Justice says those three-year high school or community college requirements are tantamount to an in-state residency criteria and therefore violate the 1996 federal law.But the California Supreme Court in 2010 already struck down that interpretation. The high court observed that some students living in areas bordering California are permitted to study at California high schools. High school students from out of state enrolled in private boarding schools also satisfy the requirement; they don’t count as residents of California either. And students who were residents of California during high school but moved to a different state could still enroll in California colleges or universities paying in-state tuition. 
All of these scenarios require a student to complete the same AB 540 application as students who lack legal status. The only difference is that students without status must also complete an affidavit that they’ll pursue legal residency as soon as they can. 
In fact, the University of California enrolled more students under AB 540 who were legal U.S. residents than those who weren’t, the state high court said then. 
“If Congress had intended to prohibit states entirely from making unlawful aliens eligible for in-state tuition, it could easily have done so,” the state Supreme Court wrote in 2010. But Congress didn’t do that, the court noted.Lawmakers in California who passed AB 540 in 2001 knew what the federal law restricted, said Motomura, and they crafted a state law that wouldn’t contravene what Congress intended. “It was drafted to avoid the residency test, and it was drafted to avoid the exclusion of U.S. citizens,” he said.
What’s likely next
California has already signaled that it will fight the lawsuit. “The Trump Administration has once again missed the mark with its latest attack on California, and we look forward to proving it in court,” wrote Nina Sheridan, a spokesperson for the California Department of Justice. 
Both the UC and the community college system said their tuition and financial aid policies have always been legally compliant. The Cal State University system did not respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration may also seek a preliminary injunction to halt California’s in-state tuition law for nonresidents, which would again expose Californians to a seesaw of temporary court orders, sometimes contradictory in nature, while the full legal merits of the case play out slowly in court.Thomas A. Saenz, president and general counsel for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, or MALDEF, thinks the U.S. Supreme Court will likely side with California despite its conservative orientation if the case goes that far.A major legal question underscoring the case against California is when and how federal rules preempt or supersede state laws. The Trump White House is arguing California’s in-state policies are preempted by federal law. But the legal concept of preemption is a pillar in jurisprudence. Liberal and conservative interests benefit similarly from a consistent application of preemption as a legal concept, Saenz said. For example, businesses rely on preemption rules in situations where a state law is more progressive or consumer-friendly than a federal rule and want courts to defend them from following the more demanding state rules.The U.S. Supreme Court is “going to be very wary of making bad law in the realm of preemption, because it could then come back to bite the right wing in protecting businesses,” Saenz said. 
For Michelle and other students without legal status navigating their own financial aid applications — and the misinformation online — a series of temporary court orders could create more panic. Financial aid is top of mind, said Michelle, but she doesn’t have time to track the legal back-and-forth of her eligibility. 
In addition to being a full-time student, Michelle works four days a week at a restaurant, saving up money not only to support herself but also her family. She’s the oldest of four kids and said she sends $500 to her parents each month.
College is “an opportunity for me to be someone in life, to make my parents proud,” she said. Asked about the lawsuit at the cafeteria of her college, Michelle made a choking gesture with her hand, as though the threat of losing financial aid next year could kill her. “Trump is taking that opportunity away because he doesn’t like immigrants.” 
The deadline to submit financial aid applications for community college is Sept. 2, but Michelle is already working on her application, just in case.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112823_DACA-Students_AE_CM_20.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The U.S. deported just five immigrants from Turkey in the 2024 federal budget year. One Turkish immigrant now fears deportation after being summoned to a San Diego ICE office.


A San Diego pedicab driver who fled Turkey after being tortured because of his religious beliefs is the latest among hundreds of people who have been arrested across California at routine immigration check-ins, according to advocates, his attorneys, and his wife. 
Idris Demirtas, 25, sought asylum in El Paso in December 2022 and was legally paroled into the United States that same month. He was issued a five-year work permit. A biomed student in Turkey, Demirtas has no criminal history in his home country or the U.S., according to his wife and attorneys. 
“He is the sweetest, most loving, and kind person. Everyone who meets him loves him. He’s very family-oriented and a fair-minded person,” said his wife, Mae Bovenzi, who was born and raised in San Diego.
His attorneys and Bovenzi said Demirtas has scars on his body from physical violence he suffered in Turkey because he is not a member of the Muslim faith. 
“He’s never told me everything about what exactly happened, but he has scars all over his body,” said Bovenzi. 
In 2023, the U.S. Department of State issued a report finding in Turkey “significant human rights issues included credible reports of: enforced disappearance; torture or cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or on behalf of the government.”

The United States during the second Trump administration is deporting people to countries that were mostly off-limits in the past, such as Iran. In the past, authorities have been forced to either hold those immigrants indefinitely in detention or release them into the U.S. That means immigrant communities from countries that previously did not have to worry about being deported now have renewed cause for concern.  
A review of ICE Flight Monitor housed at the Human Rights First organization shows zero deportation flights to Turkey between January 2025 and October 2025. 
In April 2022, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency reported deporting a Turkish national who they said was suspected of providing support to terrorist organizations to Istanbul. The agency reported deporting five Turkish people in the 2024 federal budget year.
Arrests ramp up at immigration court
Federal immigration agents arrested Demirtas in San Diego last Thursday at the downtown federal Edward Schwartz courthouse, where he was responding to a call-in letter he received on Nov. 19 ordering him to appear for a check-in at 8 a.m. the next morning. With less than 16 hours’ notice, Demirtas and his wife decided he would go to the check-in because he was trying to comply with the law, his wife said. Bovenzi said she has barely been able to eat since the couple received the call-in notice. 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to a request for comment about why Dimitras was arrested or why he is still being detained. He is currently being held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, operated by the for-profit prison company CoreCivic, according to a federal detainee locator database.
Apprehensions at ICE check-ins have ramped up across California since the beginning of October in cities such as San Diego, Fresno, and Stockton, according to news reports and advocacy groups. President Donald Trump issued an executive order in the first hours of his second term that lifted a previous Biden-era ban on arresting immigrants at sensitive places, including courthouses, schools, and churches. 
In October, activists with an organization called Detention Resistance documented more than 100 arrests at ICE check-in appointments on the second floor of the San Diego federal building. 
Some politicians, advocates, and lawyers argue that apprehensions at ICE check-ins violate people’s due process rights by creating a catch-22 for immigrants: If they go to their appointments, they may be detained for months and potentially deported. But if they don’t appear at a scheduled check-in or call-in, ICE can issue a formal deportation order against them, effectively guaranteeing their arrest and deportation. 
U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla visited the San Diego immigration court in September and likened it to “a trap.”
“I think they’re accomplishing exactly what they want, which is basically forcing people into a really difficult decision,” said one of Demirtas’ attorneys, Tessa Cabrera. “You’re detaining someone, separating them from their family and their resources, their ability to make money and support their families … I think a lot of people are going to say, ‘I don’t want to deal with this,’ and just give up.” 
Detention conditions
Demirtas told his wife during a Sunday visitation at the Otay detention center that he was first held for 11 hours in the crowded basement of the downtown federal courthouse without access to food or water. He could hear babies crying throughout the night, according to his wife, Bovenzi. ICE did not respond to a question about whether or not infants are being held in the basement of the federal building. 
After being transferred to Otay, Demirtas told his wife he has been sleeping on the floor because of overcrowding. 
“He has now been provided with food, but none of it has been a complete nutritious meal,
the water is foul, and he has no bed, just a mat on the floor,” according to a draft court document one of his attorneys wrote on his behalf. 
 Ryan Gustin, a spokesperson for CoreCivic, said everyone at the facility has a bed. 
“Any claim of water quality issues is patently false,” he said. Otay Mesa Detention Center “gets the same clean drinking water the local utility supplies to the surrounding community. Staff at our facility drink the same water as those in our care.” 
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Demirtas’ case. 
In late July, KPBS reported the Otay Mesa Detention Center housed more than 100 people over its contractual capacity of 1,358 detainees, citing a report from Syracruse University. Nationally, detention numbers have also spiked, with more than 65,000 people detained –  a record high.  
Over the forty days between October 1 and November 10, Otay Mesa Detention Center held an average of 1,456 people on a daily basis, about 98 people above its contractual capacity, according to ICE data and the site Detention Reports, which shows detainee population fluctuations over time at each ICE facility. 
It’s nearly impossible to determine from the data how many of those arrests occurred at immigration court hearings or check-ins, but mathematician Joseph Gunther identified 2,388 cases nationwide of people (including 76 children) who were likely arrested at immigration courthouses in May, June, and July 2025. His research paper identified 141 confirmed and likely arrests at the San Diego federal courthouse, which was the fourth highest in the country. Gunther noted the actual number of arrests was likely higher. 
Bovenzi said her husband already paid more than $2,000 in fees to file immigration-related paperwork. Now, the family is scrambling to get together another $5,000 for a potential habeas petition. 
Attorneys have increasingly used these federal lawsuits during the second Trump administration to end what they argue are illegal detentions of their immigration clients.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092425-Padilla-SD-Court-AH-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The bill allows the public to request a list of voters and election history information from the Secretary of State’s Office from the previous 10 election cycles.According to the news release from the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office, it currently charges one cent per voter on the list.
“HB 67 is rooted in government accountability and transparency,” said Wes Allen, Secretary of State for Alabama. “Its passage will establish a clear standard by statutorily aligning the maximum cost for purchasing Alabama’s voter list with our neighboring Southeastern states.”
However, the information will exclude what the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office considers personal information, including people’s birthdays and their Social Security numbers.
Clete Welti, communications director for the Alabama House Democrats, said the changes could limit the usefulness of the list.
“Essentially, right now, someone without a lot of economic means can pretty much afford to get the voter files when running for office,” he said. “Once you get that voter file, you have got those email addresses, phone numbers, you have a physical address and age. Now, if you are saying all the information is ‘confidential,’ then all you are going to get from the Secretary of State’s Office, if this bill passes, is a list of names.”

Sept. 30, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceThe state’s new 24% tax on all cannabis products, which was passed as a part of the fiscal year 2026 budget package, came before the Michigan Court of Claims on Tuesday, with the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association arguing that the tax was unconstitutional.
The hearing was held in Detroit on Tuesday morning.
Since its passage, the tax has been criticized by many cannabis business owners and employees, who say that it will force small retailers out of business and boost the black market.
The association is seeking an injunction to the new law, which is slated to go into effect on Jan. 1, 2026, and is hoping that its lawsuit in Michigan Cannabis Industry Association v. Michigan will result in the tax being struck down.

Specifically, the association argued that the new law seeks to change the language of the 2018 ballot proposal that legalized cannabis in the state, the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act, which specifically included a 10% excise tax on all recreational marijuana purchases. The association said that because the new tax in the 2025 Comprehensive Road Funding Tax Act was passed by only a simple majority vote, and not the supermajority required to amend the law put in place by the ballot initiative, the change bucked the tenets of the amendment.
“As the leading cannabis trade association, we’re here in court fighting to protect the will of Michigan voters,” Rose Tantraphol, a spokesperson for the Michigan Cannabis Industry Association, said in a statement after the hearing. “Michigan voters made their voices heard loud and clear in 2018 when they passed a citizen ballot initiative legalizing cannabis, and this 24% wholesale tax was imposed in violation of provisions in the state’s constitution.” 
In a court filing responding to the complaint and request for a preliminary injunction, the Michigan Department of Attorney General, representing the state Legislature, argued that the new 24% is not an amendment to the original sales tax on marijuana products.
“Given that the (marijuana tax act’s) excise tax is directed only at a retail transaction, the (road funding act’s) wholesale excise tax does not ‘revise, alter or amend’ the (marijuana tax act),” the filing said. 
It also notes that the 10% tax is imposed “in addition to all other taxes,” according to the law, and as such, it did not directly negate or change the initial law.
The new tax was a crucial piece of the current fiscal year’s budget, and will be used to fund road repairs and new construction, a centerpiece of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s goals for her final full year in office. It passed on thin margins in the early morning hours on Oct. 1 after a months-long budget fight.
“There are limited public resources for the state and all the various decisions the state makes with the public fisc, including for Michigan’s infrastructure,” the state’s filing said. “That certain entities might have pecuniary interests that are impacted by legislation does not outweigh the public interests of Michigan’s 10-plus million citizens who travel, and should travel safely, on Michigan’s roads.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9305446-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

(Photo: Getty Images)The Latino engagement group Somos Votantes Education Fund partnered with the national nonprofit Undue Medical Debt to write down $133 million of existing medical debt for people in Nevada.
Undue Medical Debt uses funding provided by donations to buy medical debt from health providers and collection agencies at steep discounts.
The 128,000 people who qualified are expected to get letters this week informing them which medical debts have been eliminated, Somos Votantes said in a press release.
“Eligible community members did not need to apply, and there was no application process,” the release said.
The move will give people in Clark and Washoe counties “much needed relief as the cost of health care continues to rise and health insurance premiums are expected to increase,” said Emmanuel Leal, the national communications and media director with Somos Votantes.
Individuals with medical debts that are more than 5% of their annual income or those earning at or below four times the federal poverty level ($62,600) qualified for relief. 
“Medical debt carries a very heavy burden on the shoulders of working families that often traps them in this sort of endless cycle of financial difficulty and stress,” Leal said. The group is hoping to secure additional relief in coming months. 
The high cost of health care, which will be exacerbated by the expiration of the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums, were a central part of the recent 43-day federal government shutdown.
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike.
The majority of Democrats refused to sign a continuing resolution to fund the government without a vote to restore the premiums or reverse Medicaid cuts from President Donald Trump’s massive tax and immigration bill passed this summer.
Nevada Democratic U.S. Sens. Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto were among the eight Democratic Senators who broke with the majority of their caucus earlier this month to reopen the government in exchange for a promised future vote on health care costs – not a guarantee the premiums would be extended.  
An estimated 177,000 people in Nevada have medical debt according to a report from Kaiser Family Foundation.
As the cost of living increases, people are often faced with a choice between paying for health care or paying for rent or food, Leal said. 
Removing the medical debt would give them one less bill to worry about. 
Paying off a medical debt won’t take it off a credit report, said Peter Aldous, an attorney with the Consumer Rights Project at the Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.
Yet, it can improve someone’s credit score and “even a small amount” of debt eliminated could be beneficial, he said. 
“That can be huge for somebody when they need to buy a car or they need to buy a house,” Aldous said. “Now they can qualify for that lower interest rate, and that’s frequently hundreds of dollars a month in savings by just bringing their credit score up a fairly small amount.”
The decision to add medical debt to credit reports “doesn’t have to be this way,” he added. 
Under President Joe Biden, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced a regulation to prevent medical debt from being included on credit reports. The Trump administration reversed that rule. 
“It’s funny because it isn’t really as strong of a political issue as you’d think or a Democrat versus Republican issue,” Aldous said. “It’s a relatively popular idea that medical debt is not something you choose to take out in the way that you take out credit card debt. You shouldn’t be punished as much for having medical debt as other kinds of debt.”
Industry, including credit agencies and lending groups, have lobbied to assure that medical debt remains on credit reports.  
Nevada Democratic state Assemblymember Max Carter proposed legislation in the regular legislative session earlier this year that sought to prohibit health care providers and collection agencies from reporting medical debt to consumer reporting agencies.
It passed in a mostly party line vote but was vetoed by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo. 
Even if it did pass, Aldous said it would have likely faced pushback. 
The CPFB issued a guidance in October saying “that the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) generally preempts State laws that touch on broad areas of credit reporting”
“There are states that have laws that prohibit reporting of medical debt,” Aldous said, many which are currently being challenged. “I don’t know exactly how that’s all going to go,” he said, adding he wasn’t optimistic.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/medical-bill-past-due-getty-1024x643-1.jpeg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

The company contends the law is unconstitutional.","In summary
The Wonderful Company sued to overturn a farmworker unionization law, but a California appeals court found the lawsuit was premature. The company contends the law is unconstitutional. 


California ag giant the Wonderful Company suffered a setback on Tuesday in its bid to overturn a new farmworker unionization law when an appeals court tossed its lawsuit against state labor regulators. 
The  decision by a three-judge panel of the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno leaves in place a controversial new law backed by the United Farm Workers that was meant to boost organizing in a heavily immigrant workforce. The law allows farmworkers to signal their support for union representation using a signed card, bypassing the traditional in-person, secret-ballot election usually held on the employer’s property. 
The Wonderful Company — owner of the Wonderful Pistachios brand and Fiji Water, Pom pomegranate juices and Halos oranges —filed suit against the state’s Agricultural Labor Relations Board last year trying to overturn the law, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed in 2023. 
The suit, alleging the law is unconstitutional, came after the United Farm Workers filed a petition with enough signatures to represent 600-odd workers at the company’s grape nursery in Wasco. 
In a contentious public dispute, the company accused union organizers of tricking workers into signing cards supporting unionization and provided over 100 employees’ signatures attesting to being deceived; in turn, the union accused the company of illegally intimidating workers into withdrawing their support. Regulators at the agricultural labor board filed charges against Wonderful after investigating the claims. 
All of those allegations were being heard before the labor board last spring when Wonderful took the matter to court, arguing the new law deprived the company of due process. A Kern County judge initially halted the board proceedings, but the appeals court allowed them to continue last fall. After weeks of hearings this year, the labor board has yet to issue a decision on whether UFW can represent Wonderful employees. 
In the meantime, the company has shuttered the Wasco nursery and donated it to UC Davis, making the question of an actual union at the worksite moot. 
In the new ruling, the appeals court judges issued a sharp rebuke of the company for suing over the unionization instead of waiting for the labor board decision. 
“Wonderful filed this petition notwithstanding approximately 50 years of unbroken precedent finding an employer may not directly challenge a union certification decision in court except in extraordinarily and exceedingly rare circumstances, which Wonderful does not meaningfully attempt to show are present here,” wrote Justice Rosendo Peña. 
Elizabeth Strater, a United Farm Workers vice president, said the decision affirms that “every farm worker in California has rights under the law, and those rights need to be protected.”
But Wonderful Company General Counsel Craig Cooper dismissed the ruling as only a matter of timing:  “the decision explicitly does not address the merits of Wonderful Nurseries’ constitutional challenge.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/080322_UFWmarch_LV_CM_033.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

Teresa Leger Fernández visited the burn scar to brainstorm next steps and meet with a family whose well is contaminated with heavy metals.,"Darleen and Johnathan Ortiz have faced one challenge after another in the aftermath of the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Darleen and Johnathan Ortiz built their fire-proofed home a decade ago high in the forest in Mora County along the Rio de La Casa, which carried enough water down the mountain to feed an acequia and water the vegetables in their greenhouse. 
Early signs indicated the drinking water was as clean as the surroundings were idyllic. The Ortizes tested their private well several times, including to certify their lettuce as organic for sale at a local market, and never detected anything unusual. 
That all changed in 2022 when the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire raged through the area. While their home avoided damage, the fire destroyed 19 structures higher in the watershed and post-fire debris flows carried ash and contaminants down the river. Flooding also changed the path of the river, making it bypass the acequia’s headgate. 
Over the last few years, with the help of various state and federal agencies and nonprofit organizations, the Ortizes restored a level of normalcy. A 10-foot-deep concrete wall that replaced an eroding embankment helped reconnect the river and acequia. Crews downed and removed 800 burned trees, and in their place grew mint, yerba buena and wild raspberries, welcome surprises that the Ortizes enjoyed this summer.

Martin Zamora (R-Clovis), right, around her property, where recent tests discovered contaminants in the groundwater. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)
“We tried to do the best that we can,” Johnathan told Source New Mexico on Tuesday as the Rio de la Casa trickled along the brand new concrete below him. “But it just seems that once you get a little bit ahead, there’s just another blow, which is now the well water situation. Now we’re eating on paper plates and really not drinking the well water and that kind of thing. So it’s just one hurdle after another.”
The Ortizes’ private well stands among 72 in the area that recently tested positive for dangerous levels of heavy metals. Kate Zeigler, the independent geologist who discovered the contaminants, has pointed to fire suppressants as the likely culprit. Recently, Zeigler hand-delivered the couple results of her latest round of testing, showing their well had high levels of arsenic, aluminum, manganese and antimony. 
According to a presentation Zeigler gave Tuesday at a library in Mora, at least 400 private wells exist in the burn scar, including about 100 that are not registered with the state. The county also has public wells. County officials have said that the latest samples show no contaminants in public drinking water wells, though they noted Tuesday they are waiting for updated test results from the United States Geological Survey.

Testing the remaining burn scar wells, as well as soil and surface water testing, emerged as a key next step during the meeting, which U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández convened. She joined a handful of state lawmakers from both parties, along with local elected officials and advocates, to discuss the potential sources and extent of the contamination, along with where money might come from to pay for testing and remediation.

Zeigler said the best tests to capture all of the potential contaminants cost as much as $2,000 a sample, though efforts are in the works to provide free testing, she said. State Environment Department officials collected names of private well owners at a recent community meeting, and they pointed well owners to a list of companies that provide testing. 
Drew Goretzka, a spokesperson for the Environment Department, told Source New Mexico in an email the agency is conducting additional testing, which Zeigler said Tuesday should begin “soon.” Lawmakers like Sen. Pat Woods (R-Broadview) also suggested the Legislature could approve new funding at the 30-day session beginning in January.

Leger Fernández also reiterated her criticism that the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which oversees an office with a $5.45 billion compensation fund for fire victims, stop “hedging” about whether it will compensate fire victims for the newly discovered contamination. She called on them to join an emerging partnership between state and local entities, along with her office, that is trying to find solutions. 
FEMA officials told Source New Mexico on Friday that the claims office would consider claims for damages related to the contamination, but only if claimants prove “injuries and causation.” What exactly that could mean is one of many uncertainties attendees described Tuesday. 
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

“I wrote that darn law,” Leger Fernández said of the bill creating the compensation fund. “And this is the kind of thing they should have been covering.”
In the meantime, the Ortizes’ are now afraid of their drinking water and wondering how far the contaminants have spread, perhaps even to the raspberries that at first seemed a post-fire blessing. Meeting attendees stopped by the Ortizes’ property as the last stop on their visit Tuesday, where Darleen wondered aloud about how she’ll handle the latest crisis since the fire three and a half years ago. 
“Without water, gosh, I don’t know,” Darleen said. 
“I thought about the mint that I had picked there,” she said, pointing toward one of the wellheads Zeigler tested. “And I was making little tea bags for my family for Christmas, and I’m thinking to myself, is it okay to give it to them?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1370-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

(Photo by Lauren Sausser/KFF Health News)BOILING SPRINGS — Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children.
Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county.
But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up.
“It’s progress. That progress is slow,” Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist with the Department of Public Health, said during a recent press briefing. “We had hoped to see a more robust uptake than that in our mobile health units.”
As South Carolina tries to contain its measles outbreak, public health officials across the nation are concerned that the highly contagious virus is making a major comeback.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has tallied more than 1,700 measles cases and 45 outbreaks in 2025. The largest started in Texas, where hundreds of people were infected and two children died.
For the first time in more than two decades, the United States is poised to lose its measles elimination status, a designation indicating that outbreaks are rare and rapidly contained.
South Carolina’s measles outbreak isn’t yet as large as those in other states, such as New Mexico, Arizona, and Kansas. But it shows how a confluence of larger national trends — including historically low vaccination rates, skepticism fueled by the pandemic, misinformation, and “health freedom” ideologies proliferated by conservative politicians — have put some communities at risk for the reemergence of a preventable, potentially deadly virus.
“Everyone talks about it being the canary in the coal mine because it’s the most contagious infectious disease out there,” said Josh Michaud, associate director for global and public health policy at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. “The logic is indisputable that we’re likely to see more outbreaks.”
Schools and ‘small brush fires’
Spartanburg’s vaccination rate is among the lowest of South Carolina’s 46 counties. And that was true “even before COVID,” said Chris Lombardozzi, a senior vice president with the Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System.
Nearly 6,000 children in Spartanburg County schools last year — 10% of the total enrollment — either received an exemption allowing them to forgo required vaccinations or did not meet vaccine
requirements, according to data published by the state.
Lombardozzi said the county’s low vaccination rate is tied to misinformation not only published on social media but also spread by “a variety of nonmedical leaders over the years.”
The pandemic made things worse. Michaud said that fear and misinformation surrounding COVID-19 vaccines “threw gasoline on the fire of people’s vaccine skepticism.” In some cases, that skepticism transferred to childhood vaccines, which historically have been less controversial, he said.
This made communities like Spartanburg County with low vaccination rates more vulnerable. “Which is why we’re seeing constant, small brush fires of measles outbreaks,” Michaud said.
In Spartanburg, the overall percentage of students with required immunizations fell from 95.1% to 90% between the 2020-21 and 2024-25 academic years. Public health officials say a minimum of 95% is required to prevent significant spread of measles.

Children who attend public and private schools in South Carolina are required to show that they’ve received some vaccinations, including the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, but religious exemptions are relatively easy to obtain.
The exemption form must be notarized, but it does not require a doctor’s note or any disclosure about the family’s religious beliefs.
The number of students in South Carolina who have been granted religious exemptions has increased over the past decade. That’s particularly true in the Upstate region, where religious exemptions have increased sixfold from a decade ago.
During the 2013-14 school year, 2,044 students in the Upstate were granted a religious exemption to the vaccine requirements, according to data published by The Post and Courier. By fall 2024, that number had jumped to more than 13,000.
Some schools are more exposed than others.
The beginning of the South Carolina outbreak was largely linked to one public charter school, Global Academy of South Carolina, where only 17% of the 605 students enrolled during the 2024-25 school year provided documentation showing they had received their required vaccinations, according to data published by the Department of Public Health.
No one from Global Academy responded to interview requests.


‘Health freedom’
In April, after visiting a Texas family whose daughter had died from measles, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. wrote on social media that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.” He made a similar statement during an interview on “Dr. Phil” later that month.
But these endorsements stand at odds with other statements Kennedy has made that cast doubt on vaccine safety and have falsely linked vaccines with autism. The CDC, under his authority, now claims such links “have been ignored by health authorities.”
“What would I do if I could go back in time and I could avoid giving my children the vaccines that I gave them?” he said on a podcast in 2020. “I would do anything for that. I would pay anything to be able to do that.”
Throughout 2025, he has made other misleading or unsupported statements. During a congressional hearing in September, Kennedy defended his past claims that he was not anti-vaccine but affirmed his stated position that no vaccines are safe or effective.
Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services, told KFF Health News that Kennedy is “pro-safety, pro-transparency, and pro-accountability.” Hilliard said HHS is working with “state and local partners in South Carolina” and in other states to provide support during the measles outbreaks.
Meanwhile, Kennedy has frequently championed the idea of health freedom, or freedom of choice, regarding vaccines, a talking point that has taken root among Republicans.
That has had a “chilling effect all the way down through state and local lawmakers,” Michaud said, making some leaders hesitant to talk about the threat that the ongoing measles outbreaks poses or the effectiveness and safety of the MMR vaccine.
Brandon Charochak, a spokesperson for South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, said the governor was not available to be interviewed for this article but referenced McMaster’s comment from October that measles “is a dangerous disease, of course, but in terms of diseases, it’s not one that we should panic about.”
On a separate occasion that month, the Republican governor said he does not support vaccine mandates.
“I know measles is a serious disease and is highly contagious, but the answer to that is to make sure that the people, the parents, have all the information they need and have accurate information and let them make what they think is the right decision,” he told reporters, adding, “We’re not going to have mandates. And I think that we are responding properly.”
Even though the South Carolina Department of Public Health has repeatedly encouraged measles vaccines, the push has been notably quieter than the agency’s COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.
In 2021, for example, the agency partnered with breweries throughout the state for a campaign called “Shot and a Chaser,” which rewarded people who got a COVID-19 vaccine with a free beer or soda.
By contrast, the pop-up measles vaccine clinic at the Boiling Springs Library featured no flashy signage, no freebies, and wasn’t visible from the library’s main entrance.
Dr. Edward Simmer, McMaster’s appointed interim director of the Department of Public Health, would not speak to KFF Health News about the measles outbreak.
During a legislative hearing in April, Republican senators voted against his permanent confirmation to lead the newly separate agency amid false allegations about his response to the COVID-19 pandemic and his promotion of vaccines.
One lawmaker specifically criticized the agency during that hearing for the Shot and a Chaser campaign.
‘Outrageously false’: Nominated SC health director defends COVID response over opponents’ claims

It was a stark contrast to Simmer’s first confirmation process in 2021, when senators voted 40-1 amid the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to put the retired Navy doctor in charge of what was then the Department of Health and Environmental Control.
Public health officials in other states have been blocked from new roles because of their COVID-19 response.
In Missouri, where MMR vaccine rates have declined among kindergartners since 2020 and measles cases have been reported this year, Republican lawmakers rejected a public health director in 2022 after vaccine opponents protested his appointment.
Following South Carolina senators’ 5-12 vote in April to reject Simmer’s confirmation, McMaster continued to back his nominee, leaving Simmer on as interim director indefinitely.
Sen. Tom Davis of Beaufort was the only Republican on the Senate Medical Affairs Committee who voted to confirm Simmer. He told KFF Health News that his Republican colleagues raised valid questions about Simmer’s past support for COVID-19 vaccines.
But, Davis said, it would be “tremendously unfortunate and not beneficial from a public health perspective if the Republican Party became just reflectively against vaccines as a matter of policy.”
The Department of Public Health had administered 44 doses of the MMR vaccine through its mobile health unit from October to mid-November. The last mobile vaccine clinic was scheduled for Nov. 24.
But health officials are encouraged that patients are seeking vaccines elsewhere. The agency’s tracking system shows that providers across Spartanburg County administered more than twice as many measles vaccines in October as they did a year ago.
As of mid-November, more than 130 people remained in quarantine, most of them students at local elementary and middle schools. Cases have also been linked to a church and Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.
“We’re reminding people that travel for the upcoming holidays increases the risk of exposures greatly,” said Bell, the state epidemiologist. “Due to that risk, we’re encouraging people to consider getting vaccinated now.”

Photographs by John Partipilo/Tennessee LookoutFederal officials announced a new crime hotline for residents of Memphis public housing Monday, the latest facet of a task force that deployed federal and state law enforcement in the city starting in early October.
U.S. Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner said the hotline is meant to provide residents of HUD-funded housing a direct line to report “criminals, illegal aliens, sex offenders, human traffickers and those guilty of gang activity, drug distribution and fraud.”
Calls will go to the HUD Office of Inspector General, which investigates fraud, waste and abuse in government-subsidized housing. The office will coordinate with the U.S. Department of Justice, the FBI, and state and local law enforcement, Turner said.
Turner specifically singled out immigrants lacking permanent legal status in his remarks. 
“We will clean up our public housing so that they can fulfill their function of sanctuaries for the most vulnerable people in our country, where American citizens can get a temporary hand up and then gain independence from government help — specifically American citizens,” he said. 
“Illegal aliens have no place in public housing,” Turner continued. “It’s outrageous that people who should not be here come across our borders and now usurp spots in housing units that should support American people.”
Immigrants without permanent legal status are ineligible for federal housing programs under current federal law, with narrow exceptions for emergency or disaster services, according to the National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy organization.
Mixed-status families — families with members of different immigration statuses — can still receive housing assistance from HUD, so long as the household has at least one eligible member. The amount of assistance these families receive is prorated, so a household with ineligible members will receive only a portion of the rent subsidy that a household would receive if every member were eligible, according to a HUD report published in 2019.
These mixed-status families make up less than 1% of all households receiving assistance in the United States, according to the Urban Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C. HUD’s 2019 report records roughly 25,000 mixed-status households, with the majority consisting of three eligible members and one ineligible member.
Federal, state officials tout task force numbers, but do not provide detailed data
U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Monday that the Memphis Safe Task Force has tallied more than 3,100 arrests, seized 501 firearms, and located 121 children reported as missing. Federal charges have been filed against 157 people, Bondi said.
Gov. Bill Lee and U.S. Sens. Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn also heaped praise on the task force, which was convened by the Trump administration in September.
But various agencies involved in the task force, including the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Tennessee Highway Patrol, have yet to publicly release the names of all of the individuals arrested under the task force’s purview, or provide details about their charges.
Arrest counts provided by the Department of Justice and the U.S. Marshals Service initially included a breakdown by category, including homicides, sex offenses, narcotics, firearms, probation/parole violations, ICE administrative warrants, “other” and “warrants.” In the task force’s first week, ICE administrative warrants made up roughly 25% of reported arrests. The agencies have since stopped providing counts for immigration-related arrests.
A data dashboard published by the Shelby County General Sessions Court shows that, while the number of new cases involving traffic violations and drug charges has risen since the task force began, the number of new cases involving violent crime charges has fallen. 
The number of warrants served has increased, and University of Memphis Center for Community Research and Evaluation Associate Director Jonathan Bennett, who worked on the dashboard, told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism earlier this month that arrests connected to pre-existing warrants are “likely a key focus of the task force’s efforts with respect to violent offenders.”
The task force cleared more than 1,000 warrants as of Nov. 9, according to the U.S. Marshals Service. The agency periodically posts news releases announcing task force arrests for select individuals facing charges involving drugs, violent crime and illegal firearms, among other charges.
The Department of Homeland Security provided names and photographs of 11 “criminal illegal aliens” that it described as “some of the worst of the worst” arrested by the task force in October, but recent reporting from the Institute for Public Service Reporting shows some of the individuals were misidentified and others had charges that were unable to be verified through an independent search of court records. 
One of the people identified was Christian worship singer Delmar Gomez, whom authorities falsely claimed had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge. Gomez’ record shows only minor motor vehicle violations.
Officials address cost and strain on criminal justice system
Hagerty said he wants the Memphis Safe Task Force to act as a template for law enforcement surges in other U.S. cities. He acknowledged that additional funding will be needed to sustain the operation. 
A federal memo submitted in a legal challenge to the National Guard’s presence in Memphis estimated salaries and benefits for up to 1,000 National Guard members present in Memphis as part of the task force could cost $226 million per year. Additional costs associated with the task force are unclear. A Nashville chancellor temporarily blocked the Guard’s presence, but her ruling remains on hold while the state appeals.
Hagerty addressed Tennessee House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who will “have a big job in this as a member of the Appropriations Committee.”
As speaker, Sexton can sit on any House committee, but he does not have a fixed seat on the House Appropriations Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Bud Hulsey, a Kingsport Republican.
“At the federal level, we’re going to be doing everything that we can to make certain that we have the proper resources going forward so that we’re able to maintain the safety of Memphis, to bring back the greatness of this wonderful city,” Hagerty said.
Representatives for Hagerty and Sexton did not respond to a request for clarification on these remarks.
The influx of arrests is straining local court systems and adding to overcrowding at the Shelby County Criminal Justice Center, according to District Attorney General Steve Mulroy. 
The task force has “substantially increased the caseload of our office,” Mulroy wrote in a Nov. 21 newsletter. “Daily General Sessions Court dockets are up about 50%. We’ve started to see significant rises in other areas as well. We’re reassigning prosecutors from regular duty to Traffic Court duty to deal with the deluge of traffic cases soon to hit our court.”
Several prosecutors have volunteered to work evenings, weekends and extra hours, Mulroy reported.
Gadyaces Serralta, director of the U.S. Marshals Service, said Monday that the task force is “taking every case we can federal” in an attempt to relieve some of the strain on local courts. 
Serralta also said that criminal cases are “taking too long to see their way through the wheels of justice” in state courts, and his agency is “open to working with the state prosecutor’s office in order to shorten that period of time.”
“If we don’t speed up the process, it’s going to continue to back up,” he said. “Because we can’t put them through the criminal justice system does not mean that it’s a free pass to commit crimes, so we’re going to keep arresting folks. They keep committing crimes, we’re going to keep arresting them.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC05728-copy-DeNoiseAI-clear-1024x679.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sophie Bowater: The Fish & Wildlife Department should give us a seat at the table.","Dear Editor,


I’m writing in response to VTDigger’s recent article about the Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department’s proposal to charge a public access license in recognition of declining hunting, fishing and trapping licenses.
I would support this proposal if Fish & Wildlife were also willing to reexamine and reform the outdated and unrepresentative Fish & Wildlife Board. As VTDigger has noted, in this article, S.258 would modernize the Board’s composition and decision-making — a critical step toward fairness and accountability.
There is no reason the Fish & Wildlife Board should continue operating like a private game club where a small minority controls the process.

Many Vermonters, myself included, used to attend Board meetings and offer public comment, but stopped participating after realizing that those in charge had little interest in listening to non-consumptive voices. Some of the Board members referred to us as “bunny huggers,”, in what appeared to be an attempt to further marginalize us.
If the Department truly wants to update its model in recognition of the fact that fewer people are hunting, fishing and trapping, then it must make a good-faith effort to work collaboratively with non-consumptive Vermonters. By all means, charge us a reasonable fee — but give us a seat at the table where decisions are made. Only then can we work together on the future of conservation in Vermont.
Transformation isn’t just about collecting new fees from the public; it’s about showing Vermonters that their values matter. The Department must address the widespread lack of trust in its leadership and demonstrate that it represents all who care about Vermont’s wildlife and natural lands.
Sincerely,
Sophie Bowater,

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Indiana’s application for a share of the federal government’s $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program lays out a sweeping, multi-year plan to stabilize struggling hospitals, expand essential local services and overhaul primary care in health systems across the state’s 64 rural counties.
The 167-page submission — obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle — details the state’s strategy, branded “GROW: Cultivating Hoosier Health.”
The plan is described as a “collaborative effort” to be jointly led by the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration and the Indiana Department of Health.
It outlines 12 major initiatives, including a statewide patient-transfer coordination hub, significant upgrades to Indiana’s health information exchange, and large new regional grants intended to reshape how rural care is delivered.
The proposal was submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on Nov. 4, one day before the deadline for all 50 states, as required under the law creating the program. Awards must be issued to states by Dec. 31.
The Rural Health Transformation Program is a five-year federal initiative, with states receiving annual allocations of both formula and competitive funding throughout that period.
Half of the annual $10 billion in federal funding will be divided evenly among states with approved plans. The rest will be awarded competitively based on need, program design and federal scoring criteria.
Urgent needs in rural communities
Indiana has 52 rural hospitals, 25% of which have already cut services, according to the Centers for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Rural Hoosiers experience higher rates of chronic disease, fewer local specialists and repeated closures of maternity and emergency services.
The state also conducted a large rural health survey — drawing more than 2,100 responses — to assess local challenges around access, provider shortages, technology gaps, food insecurity and transportation barriers.

Respondents cited long travel times to care, lack of specialty access, difficulty managing chronic conditions and limited behavioral health services as top concerns.
Story continues below.
RHTP Narrative (State of Indiana) FINAL
 
Indiana’s proposal is organized around 12 multi-year initiatives aimed at expanding care access, modernizing technology, improving outcomes for chronic disease, strengthening emergency and maternity care, supporting behavioral health workforce development and distributing large regional grants.
Proposed “Make Rural Indiana Healthy Again Regional Grants” are the plan’s largest investment. The state’s application proposed awarding $600 million over five years across eight regions, with each receiving $40 million to $100 million.
The grant program would require each regional coalition to file a unified application that includes a needs assessment, data-sharing plans, service-delivery innovations, detailed budgets, letters of support and measurable health-performance objectives. 
Required outcomes include improved maternal health, reduced preventable emergency department visits, increased telehealth utilization and better chronic disease control.
Regions would be judged competitively, with awards based on population served, strength of partnerships, evidence of innovation and sustainability and plans to reduce duplication in services. A dedicated state support team would train regions, review data, and provide ongoing technical assistance.
Improved technology and training
A different initiative would create a Medical Operations Coordination Center, described in the state’s application as a “24/7 hub for day-to-day hospital operational reporting, patient transfer coordination, and EMS resource alignment.”
The initiative also includes analysis of a Medicaid payment model tailored to rural hospitals.
(Presentation slide from the Indiana Rural Health Transformation Program Grant Application Working Group’s November 2025 meeting)
The estimated cost is $56.2 million over five years, according to the application.
Another initiative seeks to modernize Indiana’s health information infrastructure. The state’s health information exchange, or HIE, is the central network that allows hospitals and providers to share patient records electronically. It currently connects about 120 hospitals but leaves roughly 700 rural facilities outside the system, creating major gaps in care coordination.
Indiana officials proposed connecting 450 of those facilities and testing artificial intelligence tools for predictive analytics, natural language processing and reducing medical errors.
The initiative carries an estimated cost of $66.5 million over five years, which includes incentives to help rural facilities adopt required technology and fully integrate with the HIE.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The application further outlines a plan to launch eight rural cardiometabolic care sites statewide through a “collaborative care model” and training programs, targeting Indiana’s high rates of diabetes, hypertension and obesity. The initiative is budgeted at $15.3 million over five years, covering staffing, care-team development and the establishment of new rural treatment sites.
Amid widespread loss of maternity units, a different part of the plan supports hospitals and EMS agencies seeking “Pediatric Ready” and “OB Ready” designations.
Pediatric Ready status means an emergency department has the staff, equipment and protocols to stabilize and treat critically ill children, and the OB Ready designation reflects similar preparedness for obstetric emergencies and coordination with perinatal centers, according to state health officials.
The application noted that pediatric readiness is associated with a reduction in pediatric mortality risk by up to 76%.
The effort would cost an estimated cost of $45.4 million over five years.
Also in the pitch is an expansion of Indiana’s rural behavioral health training tracks and workforce stipends. The goal, according to state officials, is to increase the “local hire rate in rural communities” and support graduates who “work locally post-graduation for the required five-year period.” The behavioral health workforce initiative is budgeted at $5.3 million.
An emphasis on collaboration
The application repeatedly stressed stakeholder involvement and cited application input from multiple Hoosier offices and groups, including Indiana’s Office of Community and Rural Affairs, Department of Transportation, Department of Homeland Security, tribal groups, managed care entities, the Indiana Rural Health Association, hospital systems and numerous clinical and community organizations.
The federal rural health program was created alongside sweeping federal Medicaid reductions.
Federal spending is projected to fall by about $1 trillion over 10 years, with rural areas expected to lose $155 billion. Nationally, more than half of rural hospitals are operating at a loss, and states across the country are submitting similarly expansive proposals as they compete for the same pool of competitive federal funding.
Health groups warn that Indiana’s rural hospitals rely heavily on Medicaid and often operate on thin margins due to low reimbursement rates.
If the federal government approves Indiana’s plan, grants and formula funds will begin flowing in 2026. The state’s internal schedule shows regional grant applications opening in March 2026, with awards finalized by October.

There is a deep bench of candidates from both parties, and Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has set aside his lifelong affiliation with the Democratic party to launch an independent bid for the state’s top office. The dynamic has led some to question whether a third party candidate could garner enough support to secure the governorship. 
Although control of the governor’s office has flipped back and forth over the past 40 years, a strong showing among Democrats this November amid frustration with President Donald Trump’s policies could signal a potential shift in that dynamic.

Here’s the Advance’s breakdown of the race thus far, with details on each candidate and current fundraising totals.
The Democrats
Heading into election year, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson and former Cape Coral, Fla. Mayor Marni Sawicki make up the slate of Democrats aiming to hold onto the executive seat in Lansing.
Benson has emerged as an early favorite amongst Democrats, retaining a cash advantage over her opponents as well as a commanding lead in internal polling with strong recognition over Gilchrist and Swanson.

Jocelyn Benson
Over her tenure as secretary of state, Benson has overseen elections with record-setting turnout and helped implement new laws initiated by Michigan voters aimed at improving access to the ballot box. She has focused on protecting voting rights, to ensure all Michiganders can cast a vote regardless of their race, gender, faith or sexuality.
Benson has also secured endorsements from several state lawmakers, as well as the campaign finance reform group End Citizens United, EMILYs List, Vote Mama PAC,  the Progressive Women’s Alliance, and labor groups including the Michigan Laborers District Council, the Association of Flight Attendants, UA Local 174, Teamsters Local 243 and 406 and UFCW 876 and 951.
Campaign finance reports filed with the state in October show Benson’s campaign has raised the most of any Democratic candidate, bringing in $4.75 million and spending $1.76 million, leaving her with $2.98 million on hand.

Garlin Gilchrist
Serving as Whitmer’s second-in-command since 2019, Gilchrist is the state’s first Black lieutenant governor. If successful in the primary and the general election, Gilchrist would also be the state’s first Black governor. 
A Detroit native and former software engineer for Microsoft, Gilchrist has carried forward the Whitmer administration’s goals of growing businesses and economic opportunities in the state to attract families and retain Michigan graduates. Gilchrist also broke with his competitors in calling Israel’s war on Gaza a genocide, pledging not to accept campaign funding from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, the largest pro-Israel lobbying group in the U.S. 
He has won endorsements from U.S. Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit) and Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas), Democratic National Committee Black Caucus Chair Virgie Rollins and several state lawmakers.Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Gilchrist’s campaign has raised just under $1.13 million and spent $748,632, leaving the campaign with $378,457 on hand.

Chris Swanson
Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson made national headlines in 2020 after taking off his riot gear to walk alongside protestors speaking out against police brutality after the killing of George Floyd. Now he’s looking to be Michigan’s next governor.
Swanson has pledged to protect, serve and unify, telling attendees at his campaign announcement that he would bring a “customer service mindset” to state government. Swanson has also called for support to small business by creating an Office of Innovation, and for the adoption of a statewide model of his office’s  Genesee County Human Oppression Strike Team, which works to combat human trafficking.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Swanson’s campaign has raised $1.36 million and spent $975,997, leaving the campaign with $385,189 on hand.
Marni Sawicki
A Battle Creek native, Sawicki announced her campaign for governor in March, promising a focus on government transparency. 
In her announcement, Sawicki offered her transparency plan, which would  include regular public performance dashboards for all state departments, livestreamed and recorded board/committee meetings and decision-making sessions, a searchable database of all state contracts and expenditures, mandatory ethics training for all elected officials and state employees and require public lobbying logs documenting all meetings between elected officials and lobbyists. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Sawicki’s campaign has brought in $15,930, and spent $14,605, leaving the campaign with $1,324 on hand.

Mike Duggan
Breaking away from the Democratic Party, Duggan is looking to shake up an increasingly divided political system citing the “toxic and personal” nature of today’s politics in his decision to forgo a campaign from within the two major parties.
Duggan has pitched his campaign as a balm to the partisan arguments barring government from addressing the issues facing the state, but his split from the Democrats has brought plenty of hurt feelings, as members of Duggan’s former party have gone on the offensive, accusing him of cozying up to Republican donors and labelling him a spoiler candidate who could draw votes away from Democrats. Polling released in October showing Duggan closing the gap with the top Democratic and Republicans candidates. 
He has also secured the support of the Detroit Regional Chamber of Commerce, Lansing Regional Chamber, the Southeast Michigan Chamber of Commerce, several Detroit area unions and former U.S. Rep. Dave Trott (R-Commerce Township), among others. Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Duggan’s campaign has brought in nearly $4.38 million and spent more than $1.96 million leaving the campaign with more than $2.4 million cash on hand.
The Republicans
With a crowded slate of candidates and no clear frontrunner, signs are pointing to a messy primary for Republicans headed into 2026. 
While U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township) emerged as an early frontrunner in the race, but interest in the second term Republican could be fleeting. A straw poll conducted among members of the Michigan Republican Party placed James at fourth amid his competitors and other names floated for governor.
James was notably absent from a gubernatorial forum hosted by the Michigan Republican Party at its biannual conference on Mackinac Island, and his absence from the Michigan Republican Party’s first gubernatorial debate prompted immediate criticism from his opponents, with supporters of Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) bringing milk cartons bearing a missing poster with James’ likeness on the side.

John James
Opting against a third term in the U.S. House, James announced in April that he would instead seek the top spot in Lansing, arguing that “It’s time to get Michigan’s government out of fantasyland and back to common sense,” while touting his ties to Trump. 
If elected, James would be Michigan’s first Black governor.
James’ campaign lists affordability as his top priority, with the representative  promising a focus on kids and families in education, a reduction in regulations on business and support for law enforcement while opposing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives within government. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show James’campaign has brought in $3.65 million and spent nearly $1.38 million, with more than $2.27 million cash on hand.

Aric Nesbitt
As the top Republican in the Michigan Senate for the previous three years, Aric Nesbitt has been an outspoken critic of both Whitmer, and Democrats in the Legislature, and has repeatedly criticized Democrats for their approach to education, business regulation and government spending.
As a supporter of President Donald Trump, Nesbitt’s campaign platform shows some overlap with the president’s policies, opposing electric vehicles and calling on law enforcement to partner with the federal government to deport undocumented immigrants. He also supports cutting taxes, eliminating government spending and protecting the Second Amendment.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Nesbitt’s campaign has brought in $2.7 million and spent $616,869.34, with more than $2.1 million on hand.

Mike Cox
Emulating the president’s campaign slogan, Mike Cox, who served as Michigan’s attorney general from 2003 to 2011, has pledged to “Make Michigan Great Again.”
Cox supports eliminating the state income tax and restoring Michigan’s Right to Work laws, a series of policies enacted under Snyder and repealed under Whitmer’s administration. He has also called for an end to corporate subsidies and to “DOGE” state government, referencing the now defunct U.S. Department of Government Efficiency.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Cox’s campaign has brought in more than $4.58 million and spent $757,638, with more than $3.78 million on hand.

Tom Leonard
A three term state representative and former Michigan Speaker of the House, Tom Leonard sought the Republican nomination for attorney general in 2022 but came up short against fellow attorney Matt DePerno.
As part of his campaign, Leonard has put forth proposals to improve ethics and accountability in state government, including subjecting the Legislature and the governor’s office to Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act and a state-level version of the federal Hatch Act, which bars government employees from politicking while on duty, in uniform or utilizing government vehicles or facilities. He has also proposed eliminating the Michigan Economic Development Corporation, which oversees subsidies to attract businesses to the state, eliminating regulations on farmers and the agriculture industry and investing in recruitment for law enforcement. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Leonard’s campaign has brought in $937,023 and spent $227,730, with $709,293 on hand.
Karla Wagner
After years of spearheading efforts to eliminate state property taxes, AxMITax founder Karla Wagner is making the same issue the central issue of her campaign for governor.
Wagner owns Aunt Belle’s Kitchen in Rockford, and has listed promoting and protecting small businesses among her campaign priorities. Wagner also supports a reassessment of the state’s clean energy law, promoting farming and homesteading and a reform of public school funding, which is primarily sourced from property taxes. 
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Wagner’s campaign has brought in $2,875 and spent $2,619 with $255 cash on hand.

Genesee County Truck Driver Anthony Hudson has made his opposition to state income tax and property taxes a cornerstone of his campaign, promising to implement Trump’s Agenda within the Great Lakes State.
Hudson’s campaign has also called for the elimination of wind and solar energy farms, and exempting paid time off and sick time and sick time from taxes.
Campaign finance disclosures filed with the state in October show Hudson’s campaign has raised $13,682, with the campaign spending $12,479 since its launch. According to the report, Hudson’s campaign has $1,202 cash on hand.

Ralph Rebandt
Rebandt, a retired pastor from Oakland County, is taking another bite at the apple after placing last in the 2022 Republican gubernatorial primary election. 
Rebandt opposes abortion and has called for constitutional protections for fetuses with very limited exceptions for medical emergencies and no exceptions for rape or incest. His campaign also emphasizes support for law enforcement, the Second Amendment, lower taxes and reduced regulations for small businesses and universal school choice.

(Photo by Michele Jokinen, House Public Information.)Three-term state Rep. Sandra Feist, DFL-New Brighton, recently announced she will not seek re-election in 2026.
Feist was known for her willingness to take on some of the Legislature’s most complex tasks, sorting through thorny issues like property tax forfeiture laws. 
Feist was a vice chair on the Public Safety Finance and Policy committee. She authored laws including a ban on mandatory juvenile life sentences without parole; modernizing Minnesota’s community supervision funding formula; and updating Minnesota’s guardianship system.
Feist is a member of the Legislature’s Civility Caucus, a group of Republican and Democratic-Farmer-Labor lawmakers who meet regularly to socialize and find common ground. 
As an immigration attorney, she works with both employment-based cases — professionals, medical researchers, athletes — and families seeking to sponsor relatives to become legal residents. 
The Reformer spoke with Feist about her decision to leave the Legislature, her ideas about how to fix the U.S. immigration system and her advice for future lawmakers. 
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
Why did you decide not to run for re-election? What are you planning to do with the time you will get back from not being in the Legislature?
I have basically been doing two full-time jobs for the last five years, and I just feel that my immigration practice really is demanding all of my time and emotional energy. I don’t believe in doing anything halfway, and I didn’t want to be a legislator who wasn’t able to make the commitment that my constituents deserve — to have my full attention and all of my energy, so I had to make that decision.
In addition to refocusing my energy on my immigration work, I also have two kids and I’m looking forward to spending more time with them. I used to think that every politician who retired and said they wanted to spend more time with their family were lying, and there was some sort of sex scandal behind it, but now I’m realizing that it’s a huge sacrifice — and it’s a worthy sacrifice — but it’s a sacrifice that the whole family makes. 
I also write romance novels, and I’m looking forward to writing and reading and being a creative person again. The work of the Legislature and the work of being an immigration lawyer and doing both of those at the same time really doesn’t leave you with a lot of creative time.
What are you hearing from immigrants these days, especially from professionals who have existing visas? Are they feeling under threat right now?
Yes, absolutely, every single one of them and all of their employers. The visible parts of the immigration crackdown get most of the attention, but there are so many ways in which people who are coming here for work, who have been here for their work for decades, are having the rug pulled out from underneath them, and are being told that they are no longer wanted and that their extensions of status for the 10th time are going to be scrutinized and maybe not approved anymore. So it’s really dire for all types of immigrants.
In your mind, what does the best version of the U.S. immigration system look like?
What I would love to see is an immigration system that can breathe — so expand and contract strategically to address the modern realities. 
So what that means is that when we look at humanitarian immigration, what is the percentage of displaced people in the world right now? What are the factors that are driving people to flee from their homes? Then adjusting our refugee admissions based on that. 
It also means looking at unemployment rates in the United States. Where are there sectors of the economy, such as agriculture or technology, where we don’t have enough workers, or we don’t have the right workers, and how can we expand our immigration system to address that? 
A system like that would also then contract if it’s a situation where we don’t need certain types of immigrants in certain areas of the economy. If we could create a system that adjusts, say, every 10 years, then we wouldn’t have to wait on Congress to develop the political will and consensus to make those adjustments over time. Right now, we have an immigration system that was created in large part in 1965 and updated somewhat in 1990 and really hasn’t been adjusted to adapt over the decades otherwise. And that’s bad.
What are you most proud of from your time in the Legislature?
I am really proud of the work that I’ve done on really gnarly issues where there are many stakeholders and impacted people, and they all have different priorities and concerns, and I bring people together to have productive conversation and negotiations and come to a consensus around workable solutions. 
In 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court found Minnesota’s property tax forfeiture laws unconstitutional and said they had to be totally recreated. And that is a really huge issue that impacts counties. It impacts people who are advocates for the constitutional protections against the government just taking your property and not compensating you. It has a huge impact on the work that local governments do around environmental remediation, and it’s just had a huge financial impact on local governments. So when we were told that our entire property tax forfeiture system needed to be recreated, that created just a lot of heartburn and headache and complexity. 
So I was able to bring together all of these parties who had really strong opinions and concerns. And every single decision we made, we had to re-read the Supreme Court decision and make sure that what we were doing was constitutional, and then we had to talk to the judicial branch and make sure that everything was practical. We came up with a structure that is workable and constitutional and everybody was happy with, and it’s one of those things that, like, people won’t see. They won’t understand what was done and how it impacts them, but they will never have their property taken without being compensated, and counties won’t go bankrupt because of the way we did it. And it’s just and we’re not violating the Constitution anymore, and that’s good. 
The property tax forfeiture reform that I led — (the late Rep.) Melissa Hortman asked me to. She said, this is like a Sandra thing, you know, bringing together a bunch of people over a really complicated, technical, legal issue.
Really complicated, thorny, not-very-sexy bills were kind of my specialty. I did some sexy ones too. But I’m most proud of the technical bills.
My former colleague Deena Winter wrote about your involvement in the Civility Caucus in 2024, before President Donald Trump was elected to his second term. There’s a sentiment among some people on the left who would say that given the actions of the Republican Party and the Trump administration — for example on immigration — that now is not the time for civility or bipartisan collaboration. What’s your response to that?
I feel very passionately that civility is always the answer, and I think that when we have disputes, it’s because we’re defining civility differently. So civility does not mean that we do not acknowledge and confront the differences of opinion and the things that people say that are hurtful or hateful. Civility means that we have dialogue with people who have differences of opinion and build relationships with them so that we can have that dialogue. 
No movement has ever succeeded by berating and insulting and ostracizing the people that they disagree with. If we are not in dialogue — if we cannot see one another’s humanity — then we can’t succeed in ever changing hearts and minds. And so I feel very strongly that if I am able to have a meal with colleagues with whom I passionately disagree on certain issues, that that builds a level of trust and mutual respect that allows us to have more difficult conversations. This is not theoretical. Like, I have seen this happen — I am able to have really difficult conversations with people with whom I disagree, because we’ve built a base of understanding of one another. I think it is counterproductive to say that we need to ostracize the people with whom we passionately disagree.
What is your advice for future legislators?
One of the things that I have found most rewarding in my time as a legislator is corresponding with constituents and hearing from them. That’s one of those things that you don’t see in the news. It’s not a passionate floor speech, it’s not a press conference, it’s not even a bill — but I have received emails from people who said I was the first politician who ever responded to them, and I have a lot of email correspondence with people with whom I disagree that has been really productive and thought provoking, hopefully on both sides. I hope that whoever comes next to my seat, and all legislators, will remember that communication with constituents and making them feel seen and heard and lifting up their voices in our work is a central aspect to being a legislator.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Feist031224-0219MJ-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-26 07:57:07.332772

The U.S. government has caused massive food waste during President Donald Trump’s second term. Policies such as immigration raids, tariff changes and temporary and permanent cuts to food assistance programs have left farmers short of workers and money, food rotting in fields and warehouses, and millions of Americans hungry. And that doesn’t even include the administration’s actual destruction of edible food.
The U.S. government estimates that more than 47 million people in America don’t have enough food to eat – even with federal and state governments spending hundreds of billions of dollars a year on programs to help them.
Yet, huge amounts of food – on average in the U.S., as much as 40% of it – rots before being eaten. That amount is equivalent to 120 billion meals a year: more than twice as many meals as would be needed to feed those 47 million hungry Americans three times a day for an entire year.
This colossal waste has enormous economic costs and renders useless all the water and resources used to grow the food. In addition, as it rots, the wasted food emits in the U.S. alone over 4 million metric tons of methane – a heat-trapping greenhouse gas.
As a scholar of wasted food, I have watched this problem worsen since Trump began his second term in January 2025. Despite this administration’s claim of streamlining the government to make its operations more efficient, a range of recent federal policies have, in fact, exacerbated food wastage.
 Immigration policy

Supplying fresh foods, such as fruits, vegetables and dairy, requires skilled workers on tight timelines to ensure ripeness, freshness and high quality.
The Trump administration’s widespread efforts to arrest and deport immigrants have sent Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other agencies into hundreds of agricultural fields, meat processing plants and food production and distribution sites. Supported by billions of taxpayer dollars, they have arrested thousands of food workers and farmworkers – with lethal consequences at times.
Dozens of raids have not only violated immigrants’ human rights and torn families apart: They have jeopardized the national food supply. Farmworkers already work physically hard jobs for low wages. In legitimate fear for their lives and liberty, reports indicate that in some places 70% of people harvesting, processing and distributing food stopped showing up to work by mid-2025.
News reports have identified many instances where crops have been left to rot in abandoned fields. Even the U.S. Department of Labor declared in October 2025 that aggressive farm raids drive farmworkers into hiding, leave substantial amounts of food unharvested and thus pose a “risk of supply shock-induced food shortages.”
 Foreign aid cuts

When the Trump administration all but shut down the U.S. Agency for International Development in early 2025, the agency had 500 tons of ready-to-eat, high-energy biscuits worth US$800,000, stored to distribute to starving people around the world who had been displaced by violence or natural disasters. With no staff to distribute the biscuits, they expired while sitting in a warehouse in Dubai.
Incinerating the out-of-date biscuits reportedly cost an additional $125,000.
An additional 70,000 tons of USAID food aid may also have been destroyed.
 Tariffs

In the late 20th century, as globalized trade patterns grew, U.S. farmers struggled with agricultural prices below their production costs. Yet tariffs in the first Trump administration did not protect small farms.
And the tariffs imposed in early 2025, after Trump regained the White House, severed U.S. soybean trade with China for months. Meanwhile, there’s nowhere to store the mountains of soybeans. An October 2025 agreement may resume some activity, but at lower price levels and a slower pace than before, as China looks to Brazil and Argentina to meet its vast demand.
Though the soybeans were intended to feed the Chinese pig industry, not humans, the specter of waste looms both in terms of the potential spoilage of soybeans and the actual human food that could have been grown in their place.
 Other efforts lead to more waste

Since taking office, the second Trump administration has taken many steps aimed at efficiency that actually boosted food waste. Mass firings of food safety personnel risks even more outbreaks of foodborne diseases, tainted imports, and agricultural pathogens – which can erupt into crises requiring mass destruction, for instance, of nearly 35,000 turkeys with bird flu in Utah.
In addition, the administration canceled a popular program that helped schools and food banks buy food from local farmers, though many of the crops had already been planted when the cancellation announcement was made. That food had to find new buyers or risk being wasted, too. And the farmers were unable to count on a key revenue source to keep their farms afloat.
Also, the administration slashed funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency that helped food producers, restaurants and households recover from disasters – including restoring power to food-storage refrigeration.
The fall 2025 government shutdown left the government’s major food aid program, SNAP, in limbo for weeks, derailing communities’ ability to meet their basic needs. Grocers, who benefit substantially from SNAP funds, announced discounts for SNAP recipients – to help them afford food and to keep food supplies moving before they rotted. The Department of Agriculture ordered them not to, saying SNAP customers must pay the same prices as other customers.
Food waste did not start with the Trump administration. But the administration’s policies – though they claim to be seeking efficiency – have compounded voluminous waste at a time of growing need. This Thanksgiving, think about wasted food – as a problem, and as a symptom of larger problems.

A preliminary report on New Mexico’s Nov. 4 local elections found that Election Day voting in general went smoothly in every corner of the state — and offered suggestions on how election officials can improve next year. The findings came just hours before the State Canvass Board unanimously certified the official results of this year’s elections and ordered automatic recounts in 34 races throughout the state.
The findings from Observe New Mexico Elections, a nonpartisan nonprofit that advocates for transparency in elections, reflect the observations of 111 volunteers at 106 polling sites across 11 New Mexico counties. The organization’s full findings are expected to be issued in a more exhaustive January report.
“In general, polls opened and closed on time and experienced minimal disruptions to voting in the locations we observed,” Observe New Mexico Elections co-leader Carmen López said in a statement. “Of course, there are always areas for improvement. Observers noted that counties generally did not train poll workers on how to meet federal and state requirements related to translation and interpretation services, posting clearer signage, and providing required accommodations for people with disabilities. That’s why this effort is so important — nonpartisan observation helps show what’s working well and where election processes can be improved and made more consistent and accessible.”
Report: NM 2024 election well-run, but overwhelmed by same-day registration

The report focused on five key areas of elections: logic and accuracy testing, poll worker training, absentee ballot processing, early in-person voting and Election Day voting.
Logic and accuracy testing refers to the computers that tally and read voters’ ballots. Before an election, county clerks test their voting machines to ensure they count without any errors. The Tuesday report from ONME found that election officials clearly followed standard procedures on these tests and noted that, in a few instances, polling locations lacked a space where members of the public could comfortably observe this process.
Poll worker trainings across the state were “professional, organized, and welcoming,” according to the report, and workers learned “how to open and operate polling locations, issue and process ballots, and close the polls.” While the overall quality of the trainings was strong, the report said that observers saw some trainers truncating the sessions when many of the poll workers had served in previous elections. Trainers also rarely fully explained accessibility and language-related voter accommodations, the report said.
Absentee ballot processing was “well-organized, transparent, and secure in all three locations observed,” according to the report. It noted that physical accessibility to the facility was limited in Las Cruces.
Early in-person voting largely went smoothly, though observers noted that some voting sites “lacked instructions inside voting booths about how to cast a ballot or information about spoiled and provisional ballots.” Also of concern: Such information was not always posted in several languages, even in areas where the Voting Rights Act requires it.

Under Acting U.S. Attorney Robert McGuire, the federal government filed motions in U.S. District Court to vacate a 30-month sentence against Cade Cothren and a 36-month sentence for Casada when President Donald Trump granted them pardons Nov. 7.
The move by prosecutors to vacate the convictions isn’t considered necessary because the presidential pardon leads to the same outcome.

A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t respond to emailed questions from the Tennessee Lookout.
They were set to report to prison this month after U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson sentenced them for a litany of convictions stemming from a fraudulent campaign vendor called Phoenix Solutions that targeted state lawmakers’ constituent mailers. 
Federal prosecutors started investigating Casada and Cothren in 2019 when the New Mexico-based company hit the scene after Cothren resigned his post amid a racist and sexist texting scandal and Casada exited the speaker’s office after a no-confidence vote.
Without pardons, Casada and Cothren were to report to prison Nov. 21 and Nov. 14, respectively.

With enhanced subsidies due to expire on Dec. 31, many Missourians are weighing their options for coverage in 2026 (krisanapong detraphiphat/Getty Images).Until last year, Roberta Ross-Fisher had never been in a hospital except to visit friends and family.
The self-employed higher education consultant from Franklin County was so diligent about cleaning her teeth she had a gum graft several years ago to repair where she overbrushed.
Then, on May 5, 2024, she received a phone call. She had cancer in her lower jaw.
She took time off work and underwent surgery to remove the cancer and reconstruct her mandible with bone from her fibula. Now in remission, she gets CT scans and sees her oncologist every few months.
“That’s non-negotiable, whether I have insurance or whether I don’t,” Ross-Fisher said.
What is also non-negotiable is the premium she’ll pay to remain in a health insurance plan she purchases through the federal marketplace. This year, it’s $295 per month. Next year, if Congress extends current subsidies, it will be $479. 
And if the subsidies go away Jan. 1, the price will be $1,216 per month, a 312% increase.
It is enough to give her pause, despite needing cancer follow-up care. Ross-Fisher in 2026 will qualify for Medicare, the federal insurance program for older and disabled adults.
“I’ve been having conversations with my husband,” she said. “What do I do? I’m now a cancer patient. Do I risk going for six months without insurance?”
The conversation Ross-Fisher is having with her husband is the same one being held in thousands of households across Missouri.
The open enrollment period for Affordable Care Act plans opened Nov. 1 and ends Jan. 16. For some, the extra costs for 2026 will mean they go without coverage. 
Others may look for alternatives, such as Missouri Farm Bureau health coverage that does not qualify as an insurance plan under federal definitions. Backers promised it would be cheaper when lawmakers passed the law this year, but no one interested in buying into the plan will know if they will truly save money until it launches Jan. 1.
And the uncertainty makes financial planning more difficult for medical providers.
Care for people on marketplace plans represents about 2% of the revenue for University of Missouri Health Care, said Greg Damron, chief financial officer for MU Health Care in Columbia. 
“That doesn’t sound like a lot,” Damron said, “but if you think about it, when you’re trying to get to a 4% margin or something, 2% of your revenues is kind of a big deal.” 
 Enhanced subsidies

For 43 days, Democrats in the U.S. Senate used the filibuster to keep the federal government shut down in an effort to preserve the enhanced subsidies enacted as a COVID-19 emergency measure in 2021. 
Under the 2010 Affordable Care Act, the actual premiums paid by lower-income people purchasing individual health plans through the federal marketplace were capped as a share of their income. At the lowest end of the income scale, the cap was 2.1%, rising to 9.96% for people between three and four times the federal poverty level, or between $46,950 and $62,600 for a single person.
The enhanced subsidies reduced those caps so people at the lowest end paid no out-of-pocket premiums and no person purchasing an individual plan paid more than 8.5% of their income.
The enhanced subsidies expire Dec. 31. The U.S. Senate will vote in December on a bill extending the subsidies, but there’s no promise of a similar vote in the U.S. House and no indication President Donald Trump would sign it if passed.
Missouri health premiums to rise as much as 30% for 2026 amid uncertainty over subsidies

One result of the enhanced subsidies was dramatic growth in the number of Missourians covered by ACA plans at the same time Medicaid enrollment declined as eligibility reviews began following a freeze tied to the COVID-19 emergency.
In 83% of Missouri counties, an analysis from Washington University shows, new enrollments in marketplace plans exceeded the decline in Medicaid enrollment.
“The rapid growth in marketplace enrollment likely was influenced by enhanced premium tax credits (EPTCs), which were passed in 2021 and significantly lowered the out-of-pocket premiums recipients pay for the marketplace plans,” the analysis states. 
There are more than 417,000 people in Missouri covered by marketplace plans, up from 257,000 in 2023. Faced with double-digit increases in base premiums and the loss of enhanced subsidies, many may drop health insurance entirely.
“Without that premium support, the belief out there is that it’s largely going to hit younger, lower-income people,” Damron said. “They’re likely going to be the folks that also decide to opt out of insurance coverage altogether.”
 Small business worries

Small businesses that provide health insurance are also facing tough choices — whether to pass more costs to employees or stop offering coverage altogether, said Brad Jones, Missouri lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
The small group rates approved this fall by the Missouri Department of Commerce and Insurance show average increases of 10% to 19% for 2026.
“For a business with seven or eight employees, it is like buying a suit off the rack,” Jones said. “They don’t have any negotiating power.”
For almost 40 years, the cost of health insurance has been No. 1 among the “10 most severe problems for small business owners” identified by the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Conducted every four years, the Small Business Problems and Priorities survey ranks 75 issues facing businesses with fewer than 100 employees. The cost of health insurance was cited as an issue by 41% of employers, more than 20 percentage points higher than the second problem on the list, the cost of inventory and supplies.
In 2000, the report shows, almost half of all small businesses offered health insurance, with an average annual cost of about $2,600 per employee. Now, with the average cost greater than $8,000 per employee, fewer than one in three small employers provide coverage.
“When premiums go up, there are hard decisions that have to be made,” Jones said. “Deductibles go up to keep costs down. There are a number of things businesses try to do and not drop it all together.”
The smallest businesses may not survive if owners decide to seek employment that provides health coverage, said Marie Murphree, executive director of the Kirksville Area Chamber of Commerce.
“We might start seeing some of those go away,” said Murphree, who estimated that a fifth of the about 300 businesses in her chamber are individual entrepreneurs.
Higher premiums could be especially damaging in rural areas, Murphree said, where “we already see businesses who struggle to recruit people.” 
“Now one of the recruitment tools that you have,” she said, “you really can no longer offer, because it’s out of your ability to afford it.”
Rob Gilligan, president of the Cape Girardeau Area Chamber of Commerce, said the “vast majority” of the chamber’s 800 members have 50 employees or less. While he said they’d like to offer insurance to employees, the cost can be “prohibitive” with fewer staff to share costs.
The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry offers an insurance plan to businesses with fewer than 50 employees allowing them to pool together to share risk and ideally get more competitive rates.
Gilligan said that while some small business owners have expressed that they will be looking at higher deductible plans in anticipation of much higher premiums this year, they’ve already had to adapt to rising insurance costs in recent years.
“You just know that the cost of health is one of those things that’s going to continue to rise,” said Gilligan, whose chamber offers insurance to its employees. “We just have to kind of know that every year we’re going to look at that as something that we need to plan for and adapt to.”
 Farm Bureau alternative

The Affordable Care Act mandates that every plan offered by an employer and every plan on the health care marketplace provide minimum essential coverage. The 10 essential benefits range from hospitalization and office visits to maternity care, mental health treatments and preventive tests.
This year, legislators passed a law allowing the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer coverage that does not include all 10 benefits. 
Many farmers and other members of the Farm Bureau, proponents said, are uninsured because they can’t afford to buy an individual plan on the marketplace or make too much money to qualify for subsidies.
Members will be able to start buying plans on Jan. 2, with coverage set to begin Feb. 1, said Garrett Hawkins, president of the Farm Bureau. The website will be available starting Dec. 1, he said.
Spiraling health insurance costs stymie members of US Senate panel

That will leave only about 15 days remaining in the open enrollment period for prospective purchasers to decide if they will sign up with the Farm Bureau, buy a marketplace plan or go without coverage.
Because prospective purchasers will choose from a menu of services, the price for each plan must be individually quoted, Hawkins said.
“We’re working feverishly to get the plan up and running,” Hawkins said, “but we’re just not quite there yet.” 
The Farm Bureau is a nonprofit agricultural membership organization which partners with for-profit companies to sell various kinds of insurance to its members. 
To buy Farm Bureau health coverage, a person has to be a member for 30 days. Anyone can join — the fee is $30 per year.
So far, Hawkins said, the new coverage does not seem to be driving an increase in membership. There are several hundred members who have indicated they are interested in getting a quote, he said.
Once the plan starts accepting applications, Hawkins said, there will be no “open enrollment” period. The coverage will be available for purchase at any time.
Hawkins has big ambitions for the coverage. Affordable health coverage can mean more people will stay in farming and pass their land on to a new generation.
“My goal is that this helps bring young people home to the farm,” Hawkins said. “My hope is it will allow a spouse to return home to the farm who is working off the farm solely to get benefits for the family.”
 A tough choice

Ross-Fisher said the insurance plan she purchased on the federal marketplace established by the 2010 Affordable Care Act was a “godsend” during her cancer treatment. 
And when her business suffered during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, the enhanced premium tax credits passed by Congress in 2021 had kept insurance coverage within reach for her and her husband and allowed her to keep working for herself.
With those tax credits set to expire, Ross-Fisher is again considering giving up her business for a job with benefits.
Most people turning 65 are eligible for Medicare, which has its own premiums for the various coverages offered. For Ross-Fisher, the nearness of her 65th birthday in 2026 makes it tempting to drop coverage.
And before her cancer, she said, she would have chanced those six months. 
Now she’s leaning toward seeking full-time work.
“That would mean the end of my consulting business, which I dearly love,” she wrote in an email, “but under the circumstances I think it would be the most financially prudent thing to do.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-2211388790-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 06:57:51.006408

Activists fear immigrant workers are sitting targets there. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Advocates say they worry immigration agents are targeting undocumented immigrants working at New Jersey warehouses that store imported goods.
Called bonded warehouses, these facilities are either owned or leased by the government or privately owned locations where companies can house imported goods for up to five years without paying duties. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for cargo security, can inspect them at any time.
As the Trump administration has ramped up its efforts to detain and deport millions of undocumented residents, immigrant advocates say customs and border agents have teamed up with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to round up warehouse workers because ICE agents can enter them without showing warrants.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials “hold the door open for ICE, and all of a sudden, people are taken away from their job sites,” said Li Adorno, an activist with Movimiento Cosecha, an organization that responds to immigration raids.
This happened most recently on Oct. 29. That was when ICE agents descended on the Savino Del Bene warehouse, a shipping and logistics facility in Avenel. Workers there were already on edge after signs were posted a few days prior describing the facility as a bonded warehouse.

“Warning,” one sign read in all caps. “Under the Customs and Border Protection laws of the United States, this bonded facility is under the custody and control of Customs and Border Protection.”
No other information was shared with workers, and many don’t speak English fluently. Federal officials said they arrested 46 workers, and advocates said the detainees were transported to detention centers in Elizabeth and Newark.
“Folks are going into work thinking that, ‘I’m going to come home.’ Especially if they’re temp workers, they’re being assigned to a workplace, so this sign popped up a few days before, and workers were unaware,” said Viri Martinez of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, who arrived at the warehouse shortly after the raid started.
The arrests carried out by ICE marked the state’s third known enforcement operation at a bonded warehouse. Another 13 workers were detained at a raid in Edison on Aug. 20 at the Smart Supply Chain warehouse, and 15 people were detained on July 8 at Alba Wine and Spirits in Edison.
Immigrant advocates fear that many of the workers at these warehouses don’t know they are taking jobs at facilities that are controlled in part by federal agents. Some of the employees are temporary workers assigned to the warehouses by staffing agencies.
The advocates say they have identified at least 600 bonded warehouses across the state, in port cities like Elizabeth, Newark, and Bayonne, and in towns like Cranbury and Edison.











People are taking whatever job is available if they have families to support ... I think economic survival overrides the fear


– Sally Pilly, First Friends board member



Roughly 475,000 undocumented immigrants are estimated to live in New Jersey. And 1 in 4 residents is an immigrant, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.
Immigration raids at bonded warehouses are not new. Under President Obama, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees customs and immigration agents, said joint operations between 2005 and 2008 led to the detention of more than 350 undocumented immigrants.
Sally Pilly, a board member of Kearny-based immigration advocacy group First Friends, said she believes federal agents are using their ability to make unannounced inspections of bonded warehouses to help ICE “fill their quota.” Now, she said, “families don’t even know where their loved ones went.”
At the August raid in Edison, Pilly said, workers said they were told customs agents were coming in for an inspection to verify compliance with employment regulations. But immigration agents came instead, Pilly said, adding that she believes the inspection announcement was a ploy to “round up people.”
“We are very, very concerned that ICE is abusing the bonded warehouse designations,” Pilly said.
Immigration arrests and detention have surged to an all-time high under President Donald Trump. In May, the Trump administration set a quota to arrest 3,000 people a day nationwide, which translates into more than 1 million annually. On Monday, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security bragged that it held a record 65,000 migrants in custody, with arrests and deportations reaching a record pace.
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.
After the Oct. 29 raid, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said the action was part of “ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with customs and immigration regulations, safeguard the integrity of the supply chain, and verify that warehouse operators are adhering to all applicable security requirements.” 
Calls to the warehouses on Tuesday went unanswered.
Pilly thinks protections granted by the state temporary workers’ bill of rights could help here. That’s a law that requires staffing agencies that arrange employment for third-party companies to provide basic information to temporary workers ahead of their shifts.
While the law doesn’t require staffing agencies to inform workers if they’re being assigned to a private warehouse overseen by customs and border agents, activists allege workers don’t know which warehouses they’re assigned to until they show up that morning, and because of that, some workers don’t know they could be taking jobs where federal agents could be present.
“The big gap is that agencies are not providing the information to workers for the warehouses, and we’re trying to raise the awareness to people so they know,” said Adorno.
While some workers without documentation are unaware that working at a bonded warehouse could increase the chances that they get detained and deported, others know and take the risk because they need to care for their families, Pilly said. Undocumented immigrants are often fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries, she added.
“People are taking whatever job is available if they have families to support. Rent at home is high. They are sending money back home. So I think economic survival overrides the fear,” she said.

“There were a million choices, but none of them were about keeping the money,” says Nancy Braus, who just donated a seven-figure inheritance to a Brattleboro center offering temporary housing.

BRATTLEBORO — Activist Nancy Braus has protested nearly a half-century on area streets to tax the rich and feed the poor. But townspeople here still did a double take when they learned she was giving a local family shelter her recent inheritance of $1 million.
“It was a bit of a shock and really takes your breath away,” said Chloe Learey, executive director of the Winston Prouty Center for Child and Family Development that will use the money to host up to 10 households at a time.
It’s just one way Braus has defied expectations.

“I don’t believe in inherited wealth,” the 71-year-old said in an interview. “I always knew I wanted to learn how to take care of myself and take care of others. I live in a small house. I shop for clothes only when I need underwear. I have no interest in going on a Caribbean cruise. For me, there were a million choices, but none of them were about keeping the money.”
Braus rewinds to 1984, when she opened an alternative bookstore — Everyone’s Books — near a Brattleboro shop that was such a literary landmark, it boasted an appearance by artist Norman Rockwell and an autograph photo from poet Robert Frost.
Braus, countering with such titles as “Braiding Sweetgrass: Indigenous Wisdom, Scientific Knowledge and the Teachings of Plants” and “On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,” turned her store into a downtown anchor by the time she sold it and retired in 2023.
Most locals now recognize Braus for her protest signs and Substack posts. What they didn’t know until recently: She’s the daughter of the late Jay Braus, founder of a namesake Manhattan real estate firm before his death in 2014, and Jane Wolbarst Braus, his wife of 63 years.
As a matriarch, Jane was a “dynamo” in her own right, her obituary noted upon her death on Feb. 6 at age 99. Braus remembers her mother requesting separate checks at a diner, only to bequeath a family fortune to four children and charitable causes including Planned Parenthood and Doctors Without Borders.
Soon after, Braus spoke with her three daughters — one who’s a Brattleboro public school teacher — about the challenges faced by students without housing.
“They get mocked, they’re hungry and without clean clothes, they don’t come to class for whatever hardships the family is having,” she said.
Braus then reached out to the Winston Prouty Center, located at the old Austine School of the Deaf once attended by her youngest daughter. The current nonprofit had run a temporary shelter for families before its state contract expired this summer. The center still had space and staff. Braus had money.

“It felt like everything aligned,” she said. “It was a really perfect fit.”
The new shelter, which debuted this month in a renovated dormitory, offers private rooms for up to 10 families who share kitchens, bathrooms and common living areas.
“I got teary,” Learey recalled of Braus revealing her gift. “It’s amazing when somebody steps up to make a difference like this.”
The money will allow the shelter to operate for at least two years as its host center — situated on a 184-acre campus — aims to develop 300 units of affordable housing in a proposed “Village at Winston Prouty.” 
“The Village will be a model for how rural communities can address interconnected challenges — child care, housing and workforce stability — by bringing people and services together,” Learey said. “The family shelter is a critical first step, but it cannot be the last.”
Braus, for her part, has declined pomp or plaques, although she’s allowing herself to be identified.
“Anonymity is a lot easier, but I wanted people to be aware that activists can also be donors,” she said. “If people can look at this and say, ‘I don’t need to keep all this money that I’m being left,’ I’ll feel like it was worth it. Obviously, if you’re living in dire poverty, you’re going to keep it. But I’m hoping that other people will decide that maybe society could use the money more. There are so many who need so much.”

Eagleton U.S. Courthouse in St. Louis, home of the United States District Court of the Eastern District of Missouri (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).ST. LOUIS — A federal judge promised Tuesday that he would decide whether or not to block a referendum on Missouri’s gerrymandered redistricting map before petitions to force a vote are submitted.
The state is asking U.S. District Judge Zachary Bluestone, a recent Trump appointee, to declare the U.S. Constitution precludes any popular effort to overturn the new map that was muscled through by Republicans in a September special session. People Not Politicians, a political action committee that has until Dec. 11 to submit enough signatures to force a vote on the map, wants Bluestone to dismiss the case and leave it to state courts to sort out.
Told in court that the signatures would be turned in Dec. 9, Bluestone said he would have a decision by that date.
Using the new map, Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. It is part of a national battle over drawing new lines begun when President Donald Trump pushed Texas to redistrict to win five new GOP seats in the narrowly divided Congress.
The case is one of eight — two in federal court and six in state court — that wrap the redistricting plan in multiple layers of litigation. One, argued Nov. 12 in Cole County and challenging the constitutionality of redistricting when there is no new census data, is awaiting a decision from Circuit Judge Christopher LImbaugh.
The latest lawsuit was filed Nov. 11 by Advanced Micro Targeting, the company gathering signatures for People Not Politicians, accusing competitors of “poaching” employees and “gathering intelligence” on its operations.
In the case before Bluestone, the state argues the federal constitution directs state legislatures to determine the boundaries of congressional districts. And without a clear statement in the Missouri Constitution’s referendum clause allowing votes on redistricting  plans, it is prohibited.
Lou Capozzi, state solicitor general, told Bluestone that he should intervene because the people are trying to infringe on the prerogatives of the General Assembly and it is costing the state money and employee time to process the referendum.
“From start to finish, the defendants’ actions impose significant burdens,” he said.
Jessica Amunson, representing People Not Politicians, said the costs are just employees in three state offices — secretary of state, attorney general and state auditor — doing their jobs. And future costs, for verifying signatures and an election, are speculative because the petitions have not been submitted yet.
The case, she said, is unprecedented. The plaintiffs — the General Assembly and Secretary of State Denny Hoskins — “are suing their own citizens to prevent them from petitioning their government.”
There are very few court precedents on the question of whether citizen referendum power extends to congressional district maps. Missouri voters rejected a redistricting plan in a 1922 referendum but that vote produced no guiding legal cases.
The attorneys did argue over the meaning of a 1916 U.S. Supreme Court decision in an Ohio case that found a referendum on a redistricting plan was a constitutional use of the power. 
Capozzi said the courts found the Ohio Constitution had a “clear statement” granting the power. 
Amunson disagreed. The Ohio referendum power is essentially the same as Missouri, allowing “any law” to be subject to a vote while Missouri says “any act” passed by lawmakers can be sent to a vote.
“In none of those cases was there a clear statement rule required,” she said.
Bluestone seemed more skeptical of Amunson’s arguments at times than Capozzi, but directed pointed questioning to both.
While he promised a decision by Dec. 9, at the beginning of the hearing he said the decision may be to hold the case without acting while other lawsuits play out in state court. 
In state court, Missouri is defending the redistricting plan by arguing the inverse of the argument in federal court —  the absence of words granting or barring lawmakers authority to revise district lines between census reports means it is allowed. Before Bluestone, the state is arguing that the absence of words granting or barring petitioners from seeking a referendum means it is not allowed. 
Richard von Glahn, executive director of People Not Politicians, said after the hearing that he’s not surprised by the apparent contradiction.
“What I saw in the hearing was, frankly, clarity from the state about how afraid they are of voters getting the final say on this,” von Glahn said. “If you think what you did is a good thing, you have nothing to fear from a referendum.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/fedeal-courthouse-STL-1024x632.png,,,2025-11-26 06:57:51.006408

It is as important as ever that states like Minnesota step up and play a vital role in advancing the goals of global climate action.
Over 50,000 people from 193 nations gathered at the mouth of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, for a two-week summit to spur further action to limit the planet’s warming and protect vulnerable people and places. Indigenous peoples were present in overwhelming numbers at this COP, with banners that read “Not about us without us” — demanding inclusion in decision making. 
For the first time in the 30-year history of COP climate summits, the U.S. did not send a single federal government official to the talks. The other missing nations were Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Even North Korea sent a delegation to Brazil. 
As the U.S. has shirked away from international cooperation, China has stepped into its vacuum, sending nearly 800 delegates to Brazil. From plenary sessions to back corridors, I heard praise upon praise for how Chinese industrial policies have brought down the costs of solar panels and electric vehicles for all.
While the federal government’s presence was lacking, the U.S. was not entirely absent from COP30. A coalition of 100 local leaders, governors and one sole member of Congress — U.S. Sen.Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. — delivered a singular message: Our cities and states are working to be reliable and stable partners in the fight for climate action. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom stole the stage at COP30, moving from venue to venue declaring his climate ambitions. Taking the torch of international cooperation from the federal government, Newsom went on to sign technology agreements with Brazil, Columbia and Nigeria.
Newsom’s leadership should resonate with Minnesotans and our elected officials. As Fresh Energy has calculated, if the Midwest were its own country, we would rank as the fifth-largest emitter globally. Compared with other U.S. regions, our transportation, agricultural and electricity generation systems disproportionately rely on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas. 
But Minnesota is also the exception of the region. We lead the Midwest with our 100% clean electricity by 2040 law, and other states in our region are following our example.   
Given this, I was disappointed that Gov. Tim Walz and members of his administration did not attend COP30 and spread our successes. Minnesota often has one of the largest delegations — representing the private, public and nonprofit sectors —  at these climate summits. There were over 60 of us from Minnesota in Scotland for COP26. This year would have been a golden opportunity to showcase our progressive policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions, particularly our unique critical minerals reserves and our metals recycling industries. 
While COP30 did not achieve wide consensus on the phasing out of fossil fuels, it did result in some important milestones, including the first references in the draft action plan to the social and environmental risks associated with mining critical minerals. More than half of the minerals needed for the global energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems.”

While this initiative was supported by dozens of countries, it was ultimately left out of the final declaration in large part due to opposition from China. Nonetheless, this COP showed us mineral diplomacy will be a key part of climate diplomacy in the future. The material realities of the clean energy transition — including the need to sustainably source lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper — can no longer be ignored.
Minnesota can be a global example of responsible mineral production that prioritizes Indigenous peoples’ participation. We can also be at the forefront of developing a circular economy for energy transition minerals so that we can protect our treasured places. 
At COP30, the International Energy Agency highlighted evidence that the market value of critical minerals recycling could reach $200 billion by 2050. In 2024, the Minnesota Legislature created a Critical Materials Recovery Task Force to advise policymakers on how to increase the recovery of critical materials — including aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel and silicon — from end-of-life products. These are the kinds of initiatives that can help Minnesota lead on the global climate stage.
I came home from Brazil with a renewed commitment to fighting climate change here at home. This work starts by channeling the leadership of other nations, and key U.S. states, to move forward on emissions reductions while pursuing economic opportunities. 
Charting a path on responsible mineral production in Minnesota could demonstrate to the world how we can meet our global challenges with integrity.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray is in the midst of the greatest political maelstrom of his seven-plus years as the chamber’s leader, facing President Donald Trump’s ire over congressional redistricting.
A deeply divided Senate voted last week to scrap planned December meetings to consider redrawing Indiana’s current U.S. House map — under which Republicans have a 7-2 majority — to improve the GOP’s chances of capturing all nine seats. Bray maintains that too few Republican senators support redistricting for it to clear the Senate.
Things to know about Bray:
As Senate president pro tempore, he is leader of the Senate’s majority party (which has been the Republicans since 1979). Bray presides over Senate sessions when the chamber’s president, Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith, is absent. But Bray’s true Statehouse power comes from his authority to pick committee chairs, direct bills to particular committees and broadly set the Senate’s agenda.
Republican senators chose Bray as president pro tem in 2018 following David Long’s decision to step down after 12 years in the office. Bray’s been officially elected by the full Senate to the position each two years since then, with Democrats, by practice, not opposing the Republicans’ pick.
Bray was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and rose quickly within its ranks. Long bypassed many more-senior senators to pick Bray for the No. 2 position of majority floor leader in 2017. That set the stage for his jump into the president pro tem post the following year.
The 56-year-old Bray’s typical calm demeanor obscures his resolve, a former Senate colleague says. “Rod has a quiet confidence about him,” said Jim Merritt, an Indianapolis Republican who served 30 years in the Senate until resigning in 2020. “When he became pro tem, I think a lot of people thought that he was too nice. I think they judged it wrong. I think when people step out of line, if you will, he has quietly disciplined, I’m not going to say punish, but disciplined them.”
Bray is from Martinsville, graduating from Martinsville High School and Indiana University before receiving a law degree from Valparaiso University. An Indiana attorney since 1994, he joined his now-retired father’s law firm before running for office and maintains a Martinsville law practice. He is married with two sons.

Politics is the family business. Bray succeeded his father, Richard Bray, in the Senate seat. The elder Bray served 18 years in the Indiana House, followed by two decades in the Senate. Rodric Bray’s grandfather, William Bray, served 24 years in the U.S. House before losing a reelection race in 1974.
The impact of the redistricting fight on the Legislature colors Bray’s decision making. “I have a deep and abiding regard for this institution and our democratic process, and that’s a result of my grandfather, my father and my family,” Bray told reporters last week. “I always want to treat it with the utmost respect, which is what I’m trying to do here.”
Why not just hold a Senate vote on redistricting? “When there’s an issue, if we know we don’t have the votes for it, we don’t typically come in (for a vote),” Bray said. “This, I recognize, is a little bit of a different issue. It’s got a little more attention than some of our even more public bills. But that is typically how we handle that when we don’t have the votes to pass it.”
Bray represents a heavily Republican district in central Indiana that includes all of Morgan County, where Martinsville is the county seat, and parts of Johnson, Greene and Putnam counties. 
Bray won reelection last year to a term running until November 2028. That puts Trump’s threat to support a Republican primary challenger to Bray on hold for a while. Bray faced an active 2024 primary opponent but won with 63% of the vote.
He’s held off a previous challenge to his Senate leadership. That happened in 2022 when Bray removed then-Sen. Mark Messmer of Jasper from the majority floor leader position after disagreements over handling of the near-total abortion ban bill. Bray defeated Messmer a few months later in a vote among Senate Republicans to remain their top leader. Messmer left the Senate last year for his successful race for a U.S. House seat.
On dealing with Trump about redistricting (and arguing that Republicans should, instead, focus on trying to defeat Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan in northwestern Indiana’s current 1st District): “I’ve had a couple conversations with the president. Honored to talk to the president, frankly. I know that he’s passionate about this issue. I’ve explained to him … that we want to be helpful. We want to see a Republican majority in the House of Representatives, and this is the best way forward, as we see it.”

The Idaho Department of Labor on Friday released the full 2025 Profile of Rural Idaho, a comprehensive report examining population growth, migration, industry shifts, and other characteristics of Idaho’s rural counties. 
The report shows that, while the Gem State has retained the same ratio of rural-to-urban counties over the years, the demographics, economics, crime and opportunities have all changed dramatically. 
Thirty-five of Idaho’s 44 counties are considered rural — defined in the report as a county that does not have a city with at least 20,000 residents. 
However, amid booming population increases to the state over the past several years, just 28% of Idaho’s residents lived in rural counties in 2023, down from 36% in 1990. 
The report was the culmination of a yearlong process by state labor economists, Idaho Department of Labor Director Jani Revier said during a webinar held Tuesday. The first and second installments of the three-part report were released in May and July respectively. 
 Education, child care and internet drive barriers to employment in rural Idaho

The third section of the 98-page report emphasized “critical trends” in rural Idaho, including evaluating employment challenges, education, aging demographics, and transportation and broadband access. 
Between 2022 and 2024, Idaho overall had record-setting low unemployment rates. However, over the past few decades, Idaho’s overall labor force participation has been declining. The number of people working or actively seeking work as a share of the working age population peaked in Idaho in 1998 at over 70%, the report said. In 2024, it was 64%. 
In the last five years of labor participation data, the 20 Idaho counties that had labor force participation rates below 60% were classified as rural. The state’s nine urban counties had a labor participation rate of 64.1%. 
The report points to a combination of an aging population, lack of child care, and lower education rates as potential factors leading to lower labor force participation. 
Between 2019 and 2023, 11.6% of adults aged 25 and older in rural counties did not finish high school, as opposed to 7.1% of those in urban counties. This is an improvement from 2009 to 2013, when nearly 15% of adults in that age group in rural Idaho counties did not get a high school diploma. 
“Continued focus on targeted workforce education programs within rural areas, such as in-school career technical education programs, registered apprenticeships and Idaho LAUNCH, may provide the greatest training benefit to rural areas with high workforce needs that are not within close proximity of a public postsecondary institution,” the report said. 
Idaho Launch refers to a program spearheaded by Gov. Brad Little which provides grants to graduating Idaho high school seniors to use for tuition, job training or an apprenticeship program for in-demand careers.
Rural counties also had much lower ratios of child care employees to children under the age of 5. The report also highlighted that the number of counties where at least 20% of households who don’t have a broadband internet subscription is much higher in rural areas. 
 People in Idaho’s rural counties are aging, including farmers, leaving the future of agriculture in question 

Idaho, following national trends, is facing an aging population as birthrates decline and the baby boomer generation gets older. 
“As birth rates look poised to continue falling and a higher share of the resident population hits retirement age, this is likely to result in a chronic labor supply shortage for many of Idaho’s counties — most drastically in the rural areas,” the report said.
What are called “open country counties,” defined as those with no urban area of at least 7,500 people and no strong commuting ties to a metro area, have the lowest birthrate in Idaho, at 11 births per 1,000 residents. These open country counties have the highest median resident age, at over 44 years old. 
Of the 20 top counties with the highest median age, the majority of them also had labor participation rates below 60%. 
Idaho’s share of agriculture producers aged 65 and older has increased 123% since 2002, the report said. 
The price of agricultural land has also skyrocketed in that time, while revenues have lagged. 
(From the 2025 Rural profile of Idaho)
The number of farms in rural Idaho has decreased 9.8% between 2002 and 2022, the report said, while the price per acre of land increased 151%. These two factors could mean an uncertain future for much of Idaho’s agricultural land. 
“As farm acre prices continue to rise while cost inputs remain elevated,” the report said, “these decisions may tip in favor of farmland being sold and transitioning to other competing uses for a higher monetary return, such as residential or commercial land development.”

 Poverty rates had declined across Idaho, but many rural families struggle to afford cost of living 

Idaho’s poverty rates declined significantly from 2019 to 2023, the report said, but rural counties experienced a more “subdued drop.” 
The poverty rate between 2019 to 2023, compared to the five years prior, dropped 5% in Idaho’s urban counties and 4.1% in rural counties. 
The urban counties still had the highest poverty rates, at 12.7%. The open country counties had the second highest at 12.6%. 
Rural counties saw a slight increase in the poverty rate of residents 65 and older from 9% in 2013 to 9.9% in 2023. 
(From the 2025 Rural Profile of Idaho)
The report also looked at incomes versus cost of basic necessities, like housing, food and transportation. Rural counties had lower expenses for housing and child care, but less access to grocery stores and had longer commutes, the report found. Rural families also tend to have more children than urban families, the report said, “further highlighting the living wage challenge of raising a family in rural Idaho.” 
“While the cost of living is cheaper in rural counties, only 31% of rural households earn incomes high enough to support a family of four, compared with 49% of urban households,” the report said.
 Most crime dramatically decreased in rural Idaho, except drug offenses 

Across Idaho, property and violent crimes have reduced dramatically over the past 20 years. 
Between 2003 and 2023, property crime reduced 72% in rural counties and 55% in urban areas. Violent crime overall dropped 18% in rural areas and 11% in urban counties at that time. 
(From the 2025 Rural Profile of Idaho)
“The cause of this decrease can be partially attributed to the long-term downward unemployment trend,” the report said. “… As more people are able to earn employment income through legitimate means, there may be less incentive to engage in criminal acts which carry a high risk of penalties like incarceration.” 
Drug offenses have increased in both urban and rural areas. 
In rural counties, drug offenses increased 44% between 2003 and 2023, and were up 26% in urban areas. 
Open country counties had the highest drug offense rate of any county type, at 693 per 100,000 residents. 
 Broadband improvements and renewable energy present economic opportunities for rural areas

Access to broadband internet has been highlighted as a “critical labor force trend,” since the 2005 Profile of Rural Idaho, the report said, “that need has only intensified since.” 
“High speed broadband creates opportunities for the highly skilled rural labor force to train or work remotely with less reliance on an employer’s specific location,” the report said.
Between 2019 and 2012, 24 rural and three urban counties had at least 20% of households without internet subscriptions. 
The most up-to-date benchmark set by the Federal Communications Commission for high-speed internet was 100 megabits per second, the report said, and 28 rural Idaho counties are unable to meet those benchmarks with existing infrastructure.  
The report also identified renewable energy projects, amid growing electricity demands, as an area of potential growth in Idaho. 
Idaho produces around 20% of its own energy needs, the report said, and 60% of its annual energy consumption. Idaho contains no significant sources of coal or oil. 
“Renewable energy production and transmission is likely to be another stronghold industry in rural Idaho going forward,” the report said. “Modern technology adoption, such as a higher penetration of electric vehicles, construction of large regional data centers, and continued implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) will be highly dependent on rural Idaho for electricity generation.”

(Courtesy photo)Vivacious and full of life, Dylan Cheatwood was a thrill-seeker with a big heart who enjoyed motorcycles, surfing and riding bulls.
Perhaps it was because he was diagnosed with epilepsy at a young age, but Dylan was determined not to let his illness rob him of anything. He not only embraced life’s experiences but tried everything to curb his unrelenting seizures: a combination of countless medicines, a vagus nerve stimulator implanted in his chest and even a brain surgery that proved unsuccessful.
At just 25, Dylan died unexpectedly of Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP). SUDEP is identified as a cause of death when an individual with epilepsy dies unexpectedly and in the absence of a seizure. His loss revealed a devastating truth about the lack of epilepsy awareness and care in Oklahoma, a reality shared by more than 41,000 individuals across the state.
SUDEP is a leading cause of death among the 2.9 million Americans living with epilepsy. In Dylan’s case, the seizures began when he was very young, at just two years old: he experienced movement seizures along with day- and nighttime seizures, and unfortunately, he was never able to achieve seizure control.
Despite Dylan having every risk factor, we were never informed of the risks or treatments that could help reduce the likelihood of SUDEP. Risk factors include early-onset epilepsy, tonic-clonic and nighttime seizures, and the inability to achieve seizure control even with medications, surgeries or implanted devices.
While everyone’s epilepsy is different, SUDEP risk may be reduced by achieving seizure control, night monitoring (through devices, co-sleeping or even an epilepsy service dog), avoiding alcohol and stimulants, and talking with a doctor about options like the ketogenic diet. However, patients can’t take steps to prevent something they’ve never been told about. That’s why better reporting — and awareness — is vital.
Passed earlier this year, House Bill 2013, known as Dylan’s Law, represents a major step forward for individuals and families living with epilepsy in Oklahoma.
The law, which went into effect Nov. 1, creates awareness around SUDEP among first responders by providing an option for individuals living with epilepsy to include a special designation on their drivers’ license, an identifier that could lead to faster treatment in an emergency.
Dylan’s Law also directs the State Commissioner of Health to make training about SUDEP available to physicians among continuing medical education credits — a move that will enhance awareness about SUDEP among physicians in the hopes that doctors will be better equipped to share that information with individuals and families living with epilepsy.
The bill also encourages SUDEP investigation in autopsies, effectively creating the nation’s most comprehensive epilepsy legislation. This is important, because while it’s estimated that we lose 1,000 Oklahomans each year to SUDEP, true figures aren’t known due to poor data tracking, a lack of education by health professionals and public stigma that prevents patients with seizures from seeking treatment. Too many people suffer in silence, and too many families are left without answers.
Dylan’s bravery in the face of epilepsy was an inspiration, and as his friends and family, we couldn’t let his death be in vain. In the years since his passing, we have turned grief into action by advocating for greater epilepsy and SUDEP awareness and working with lawmakers to craft legislation designed to better support individuals suffering from recurrent seizures.
In honoring Dylan’s life, we hope that no other family has to suffer a loss like we did and that Oklahoma now has systems in place to support those living with epilepsy. Dylan’s Law ensures his story will not be forgotten and that his legacy will make a difference for thousands of Oklahomans.

Though worker advocates cheer more affordable premiums, some scoff at ""safe workplaces"" claims and say the state is too stingy with its $2.8 billion fund when it comes to helping injured workers.
The post Wyoming employers get a break on workers’ comp premiums for third straight year appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming employers participating in the state’s workers’ compensation program will experience a 15% break in premiums next year, the third rate reduction in as many years. 
That will result in a combined annual savings of $66 million, according to the Department of Workforce Services. Employers in good standing, and with three or more years in the program, may enjoy even bigger savings.
“By lowering workers’ compensation costs, we are helping employers invest in their workforce, strengthen their operations and continue to build safe, resilient workplaces across our state,” Gov. Mark Gordon said in a statement announcing the rate reduction.
All employers of businesses in Wyoming classified as “extra hazardous” are required to participate in the state’s workers’ compensation program, which is administered by the Department of Workforce Services. Others may voluntarily enroll, which typically entitles them to legal immunity for workplace injuries. The program is funded by premiums paid by employers to cover lost wages and medical bills for their employees who are injured on the job.
Wyoming is one of the few states that does not offer workers’ compensation benefits to undocumented workers.
$2.8 billion fund
The state can afford to offer lower premiums, Workforce Services Director Elizabeth Gagen suggested, because “Wyoming’s strong safety culture and responsible business practices are paying off, creating lasting benefits for both our workforce and our economy.” 
The chart depicts 10 years of Wyoming’s workers’ compensation fund. (Wyoming Workforce Services)
A September report to the Legislature’s Joint Labor, Health and Social Services Committee indicates the workers’ compensation fund is growing at a rate that surpasses expenditures and liabilities.
“The average annual rate of return on the [workers’ compensation] investment portfolio over the past five years is approximately 6.8%,” Workforce Services Deputy Director Jason Wolfe told WyoFile via email. “Coupled with year-over-year declines in the number of injuries, as shown in the report, and sound cost containment and case management strategies, this means we’re typically spending a bit less than we’re making.”
The state’s workers’ compensation fund has risen steadily from $1.8 billion in 2015 to more than $2.8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2025, according to the state’s report. During the same period, annual claim expenditures have grown from $178 million to nearly $194 million.
Critics dispute safety claims
Worker advocates question assertions that expenditures remain moderate due to safe workplaces and a decline in work-related injuries. They say not all injuries are reported, while pointing to Wyoming’s chronic worst- or among-the-worst workplace fatality rates in the nation.

Yes, Wyoming’s workers’ compensation program works well when it comes to acute injuries with an easily defined recovery prognosis, some say. But the state tends to fight against expensive and prolonged claims related to things like back injuries, chronic pain and illnesses.
Any notion that Wyoming’s flush workers’ compensation fund is due to a strong workplace safety track record is “bullshit,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said.
“I mean, we may have [fewer] claims,” Kindred told WyoFile, “but we still kill more people than any other state.” And she suggested that the state’s moderate workers’ compensation expenses might derive from Wyoming’s bootstraps mentality, which discourages injured workers from making a claim or fighting a challenge to a claim.
“I’m just picturing my guys having to, again and again, go to hearings and court cases in front of anybody in power and say, ‘I need help,'” Kindred continued. “It’s insurmountable, and it’s hard to get people to admit they need help.”
Asked to respond to such criticism, Wolfe, of workforce services, said, “The evidence actually shows our denial rate of claims to be fairly steady, with a slight decline over the last five years. The denial rate is approximately 5%-6% of annual claims.”
“Because the state is not a for-profit insurance company, it is perfectly appropriate to make sure that Wyoming businesses are paying a fair amount,” Lawyers and Advocates for Wyoming Director Mark Aronowitz told WyoFile. 
“At the same time,” Aronowitz continued, “I believe that ‘sound cost containment and case management strategies’ should include a detailed analysis of all workplace fatalities and serious injuries in order to prevent similar incidents from ever occurring again.”
That type of deliberate, all-inclusive analysis is not happening in Wyoming, according to worker advocates. 
“Resources wisely spent on injury prevention could help save the fund, and employers, millions of dollars over time,” Aronowitz added, “while, more importantly, reducing our perennially unacceptably high workplace fatality rate.”

A recently passed resolution to limit free speech demonstrates how little the state Republican Party believes in the First Amendment, writes columnist Rod Miller. 
The post Charlie Kirk and the hypocrisy of the Wyoming GOP appeared first on WyoFile .","Among the many freedoms guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, there is one freedom that is conspicuously absent. Nothing therein guarantees your freedom to not be annoyed, shocked, scared shitless or offended by what someone else says.

Opinion

Pluralism, as we Americans enjoy, almost guarantees that someone WILL be offended by something that someone else says. I’m here to testify that is a good thing. It guarantees that we will not become a nation of frightened intellectual pantywaists.
Censorship in favor of anyone’s tender feelings indicates a lack of faith in our freedom of speech, our collective mental resiliency and in our basic American liberty. I wish the Wyoming Republican Party would realize that.
A hadith is a fundamental precept of the Islamic faith, but one that does not necessarily issue from the Quran. A hadith is a sort of apocryphal truism that has found its way into the Muslim canon by repetition. An example would be the Islamic law that nobody can make an image or draw a picture of the Prophet. Such an act is considered offensive to the faith, and can and has resulted in the artist’s death.
When the Wyoming Republican Party recently passed a resolution to investigate, condemn and punish people who cheered or spoke inappropriately when Charlie Kirk was killed, they created a new hadith that is blasphemous to our constitutional canon. And they demonstrated publicly how little they believe in our First Amendment freedoms.
Apparently, the nasty rhetoric spouted by Kirk’s opponents after he was killed shocked and appalled the Wyoming GOP, and they determined that they had to put a stop to it. But they forgot that the First Amendment to our Constitution contains no penalty for shocking or appalling speech. Nor does it place conditions on speech or mention consequences for speaking freely. It just says that, in our country, speech is free.
In passing the aforementioned resolution, the Wyoming GOP also ignored the “Timeless Truth” in Plank 22 of its own platform, which states, “Freedom of speech includes the freedom of the individual to express his or her beliefs, ideas and opinions without fear of retaliation, censorship or legal sanction by government.”
The Wyoming GOP’s resolution says that those who celebrate and condone political murder, such as the murder of Charlie Kirk, should be investigated and punished. Yet, just a few days ago, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman was in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump. This is the same Saudi crown prince who ordered the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post reporter whom the Saudi royal considered an enemy.

When a reporter at the meeting asked Trump about the murder, he shrugged and said, “Things happen.”
Will the Wyoming GOP investigate and punish Trump for condoning political murder? Don’t hold your breath.
For a once-proud political organization like the Wyoming Republican Party to dishonor itself by passing a resolution that is clearly contrary to our Constitution, as well as to its own platform, causes us to ask why such forked-tongued hypocrisy occurred. I have a couple of thoughts.
I smell the influence of the Freedom Caucus on this one. This looks like a continuation of their Sharia-esque power grab in the Cowboy State, and their my-way-or-the-highway attitude toward anyone who doesn’t buy into their bullshit.
This resolution also suggests that power has gone to the Wyoming GOP’s head, and their hubris is showing. For a political party to try to supplant the Constitution through its own internal pronouncements appears just a tad bit despotic.
The First Amendment says what it says, and means what it means, and there’s not a thing the Wyoming GOP can do about that, no matter how many hadiths they write to the contrary.
They’ll probably consider this column some sort of unpatriotic hate speech directed toward a tender spot in their insecure self-identity, and call for me and anyone else who points out their hypocrisy to be investigated and punished. Screw ‘em!

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)Four members of the West Virginia Legislature signed onto a national bipartisan letter this week opposing a policy under consideration by Congress that would allow the federal government to preempt state regulations on artificial intelligence.
The letter was signed by 280 state lawmakers from across the country, including West Virginia’s own Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, and Dels. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha; Bill Ridenour, R-Jefferson and Margitta Mazzocchi, R-Logan. 
In the letter, lawmakers expressed their “strong opposition” to any federal policy that would prohibit states from implementing and enforcing their own regulations on AI. They also shared concerns over how federal preemptive measures on the technology could undo and undermine laws already in place.
“As state lawmakers and policymakers, we hear regularly from constituents about rising online harms and the growing influence of AI on their lives,” the letter reads. “… In the years ahead, AI’s impact will require lawmakers to consider consequential public policy questions, making it essential that states retain the authority to act.”
The opposition to federal preemption over AI comes after a similar provision to stop state regulation was pulled out of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act due to bipartisan opposition earlier this year. That provision would have implemented a 10-year moratorium on state and local AI regulations.
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson
“I was one of the people that wrote in protest of the provision that would have preempted AI regulation in the Big Beautiful Bill, so when I saw that they’re attempting to do it again, obviously I still feel the same way. Not much has changed here in the past few months,” Rucker said. “I still feel that it is not acceptable that the federal government is trying to co-opt state’s rights when it comes to this, and no, I am not okay with that.”
After its failure in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, national news outlets reported last week that the Trump administration was considering an executive order to ban state regulation on AI. On Nov. 21, Reuters reported that the executive order effort was being put on pause. 
Instead, according to Punchbowl News, the executive branch and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., want to see the same preemption provision included in the National Defense Authorization Act. That legislation sets the budget and policy priorities for the nation’s military and defense infrastructure over the upcoming fiscal year.
Currently, there is little to no oversight for AI nationwide. Some localities have already passed their own laws to regulate the technology and, in some cases, ban it from being used for certain purposes. They’ve also implemented certain penalties for individuals who use the technology to promote harmful deepfakes, misinformation and more.
Proponents for federal preemption over AI regulation have said they don’t want there to be a patchwork of different policies state-to-state regarding the technology. AI industry leaders — specifically companies that create the AI technology in question — support federal control over regulation as opposed to state control. They worry that state regulation could stifle innovation. Under the current administration, it’s likely that federal regulation would be more lax compared to the approach taken in some states. 
Rucker said she’s concerned over the AI industry — dominated by deep-pocketed tech companies and venture capitalist firms — benefitting from a lack of regulation that could ultimately harm regular citizens.
“I know that this push is, again, being pushed by big-money interests and that is very hard for the average American to fight,” Rucker said. “I worry that they’re trying to take advantage of the average citizen not really paying attention to [the National Defense Authorization Act].”
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha
Young said she holds similar concerns. She said it’s easy to boil an issue like this down to politics, but the concerns are much deeper than that and it’s clear that both President Donald Trump and his administration are betting big on AI development as well as political support from the industry’s leaders.
This week, the White House signed an executive order to “accelerate” the use of AI in scientific research. That followed numerous other executive orders meant to increase the use and dependence on AI in numerous sectors, including education, energy and more.
And Trump, as well as other political leaders, have grown closer to those who head AI companies and others that create the hardware they rely on to operate.
“I don’t want to be hyper-political, but Trump has all the billionaires in his pocket on this. This is why they [the federal government] want to regulate it,” Young said. “They want to be able to do whatever they want to do, and a lot of times they want to do it with state and federal dollars, but they don’t want any safety provisions. That’s a problem and it’s one we should be able to confront as elected lawmakers.”
Young and Rucker both said they were grateful that the fight against federal preemption continues to be so bipartisan. None of the concerns around the industry are partisan, Young said. Rucker said it “gives [her] hope” to see pushback come from both sides of the aisle in time of high political polarization.
“It shows that at the end of the day, people can really win if they put special interests aside, then if we just all focus on putting the people forward — which is our job to do as the government and what we’ve been elected to do as state [lawmakers],” Young said. “We’ve seen that happen and be successful in bipartisan ways. There’s bipartisan AI bills all over the country … that shows that we can just put the politics aside and put people first, but we need to have the right to do that.”

Georgia’s state Capitol in Atlanta underwent its annual winter transformation last week, with some workers hanging wreaths around the building’s numerous lampposts, and others attending to the monumental task of installing the Capitol Christmas tree.
The tree will eventually be decked out with over 35,000 lights, and ceremonially illuminated during the annual tree-lighting ceremony with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. But the process of installing the tree takes a coordinated effort from a number of Santa’s helpers — along with more than a few hardworking Georgians.
This year’s tree, which is sitting in the rotunda at the state Capitol, measures a whopping 26 feet tall. Maya Homan/Georgia Recorder
This year’s tree, which is sitting in the rotunda at the state Capitol, measures a whopping 26 feet tall. According to the Georgia Building Authority, it is an eastern red cedar that was donated by a resident of Lindale, which sits about 60 miles northwest of Atlanta. 
Taylor Willingham, a chief ranger at the Georgia Forestry Commission, has helped with the process of transporting the Capitol Christmas tree for the past several years. He said harvesting the tree is typically a three-hour process that begins early in the morning and requires the combined efforts of the Georgia Forestry Commission, the Georgia Building Authority and Georgia State Patrol. 
The process, he said, “is fairly intricate, because you definitely want to deliver a beautiful Christmas tree for everyone to see.”
Once the chosen tree is loaded onto a truck from the Georgia Forestry Commission, it begins the long journey to the heart of Atlanta, with members of the Georgia State Patrol leading the way and the Georgia Building Authority bringing up the rear. This part of the trip, Willingham said, can be precarious at times.
“You have to be extra careful with the tree so it doesn’t catch on signs or anything as you travel,” he said.
But it is also among the most memorable parts of each year’s sojourn to the Capitol, as Georgia residents get the chance to catch glimpses of the tree’s journey.
“You can see the excitement in people’s eyes,” Willingham said. “You can see how people just light up when they realize what’s going on.”
Workers use a crane to lift the tree inside the building, then stand it upright and secure it to the third floor balconies.
A tree lighting ceremony will be held in December, though the exact date has not yet been announced.
Chuck Berry, the owner of Berry’s Tree Farm and the president of the Georgia Christmas Tree Association, said a Georgia-grown red cedar is a natural choice for a place like the state Capitol.
“To me, the red cedar is a traditional Christmas tree,” he said. “It’s what most people, years ago, grew up with.”
However, he added, commercial Christmas tree farms tend to favor faster-growing cypress trees over cedars, so Georgia residents may be unlikely to find one at their nearest tree farm. 
For families who are shopping for a tree this year, the Georgia Department of Agriculture recently published a map of Georgia-grown Christmas trees that includes nearly 100 farms across the state. 
“The advantage of a Christmas tree farm is you actually get to know when [the tree] was cut, so there’s no question as to how fresh it is,” Berry said. “Most Christmas tree farms in the state now offer activities for families and children, so you’re not necessarily just getting a Christmas tree, you’re actually building memories.”

(Photo by Kirk Fisher/Getty Images)Those of us who love Priest Lake cannot help but notice the increased intensity of logging activity on the east side. 
Driving along the east side road, we encounter clear cuts down to the road. Streams such as Cougar Creek and Bear Creek have had extensive logging and road building throughout their watersheds. To explain the changes, I think it is useful to explore how the endowment lands came to be as well as their intended and current use.
With westward expansion after the American Revolution, Congress sought to regulate the acquisition of land in the old Northwest Territories (consisting of lands west of the Appalachians, north of the Ohio River and east of the Mississippi). Townships were established as 6×6 miles with 36 one by one mile (640 acres) sections. 
Thomas Jefferson felt that an educated electorate was necessary for the new democratic republic and designated section 16 of each township for the benefit of the public school. Prior to this, education was a privilege of the elite with most ordinary children having to work from the moment they could carry a hoe or churn the butter. Income from section 16 went into a fund to support the school. 
The system was workable because farmland in the old Northwest was and remains highly productive. With an increasing population, the land became much more valuable and was sold off. The proceeds went into a school endowment fund. And even today, profit from those state funds goes exclusively to public schools. 
With further expansion of the population westward the landscape changed considerably where there were many areas that were not economically productive. For instance, a section of land in Owyhee County might support one cow, a dozen jack rabbits and a few rattle snakes.  
Recognizing the geographic diversity in the West, the states were allowed to consolidate their section 16’s into contiguous areas. In Idaho, the most productive endowment lands are in the north. These lands do not belong to the state, but to the school endowment. 
They are governed by the Land Board, consisting of the five highest-ranking public officials and managed by the Idaho Department of Lands. Sale of lands, logging and lease arrangements provide money that goes into the endowment fund. The endowment lands, described by the Land Board as their “sacred trust,” are constitutionally mandated to maximize revenue for the benefit of the schools. Each year the Land Board decides how much money goes to public schools. 

 Managing Idaho’s forest lands

Prior to 2000, the Idaho Department of Lands managed the forest with the understanding that from the time to harvest to regeneration and re-harvest was 80 years. This was the standard of practice in the Northwest for the U.S. Forest Service as well as private companies such as Weyerhaeuser. 
In 2006, an industry sponsored nonprofit organization, Forest Biometric Research Institute, was established to study forest inventory, growth and management in Oregon. This organization views their forests as working forests. 
With the logging mills adapting to smaller diameter logs, the institute has determined that a crop rotation of 40-45 years is adequate. They have developed their own proprietary software to facilitate management toward this goal. 
Over time, timber companies all over the West have followed along in lock step. Just in the last few years, this includes the Idaho Department of Lands. What we see now rolling down Highway 57 are large logs that are clearing the senescent forest to make way for the tree farm. Ultimately, after this burst of intense logging of large trees, the steady state working forest will produce logs of 8-10 inches’ diameter. The tree farm will look very different from the forest we have known.
We have concerns. One is that the endowment lands cannot sustain a re-harvest interval of 45 years. Another is that the annual contribution to our public schools is a token amount. We also feel that the Land Board may not be living up its fiduciary responsibilities as trustees.
In the Northern Rockies ecological zone, the growing season is short and winters are long. Therefore, it takes a considerable number of years for a conifer to mature compared to the same species in the milder wetter climate of the Oregon Coast (home to Forest Biometric Research Institute).
 Our soils are young, only established since the last glaciation. The soils are nutrient poor, easily erodible and the terrain is mountainous with steep slopes in many locales. Given these conditions, a rapid crop rotation may deplete the soil of nutrients and abet soil erosion. 
For the last five seasons, the Selkirk Conservation Alliance has monitored the stream chemistries of 18 Priest Lake tributaries. Watersheds that have experienced limited human impact have very low levels of the nutrient phosphorus; however, Cougar Creek which flows into Cavanaugh Bay has consistently demonstrated high levels. We are certain that high levels of phosphorus can be used as a proxy for soil erosion. 
Examining the Cougar Creek watershed, there has been intensive road building and logging over the last 10 years. With GIS modeling, we can predict the intensity of soil loss in a drainage, and we are actively exploring the possibility of engaging a GIS expert to pursue this project. This will help determine the quantity of soil loss over time. Soil loss can occur quickly, but in our region the rebuilding of soil can take 30-100 years.
 Idaho schools face real funding needs

Thomas Jefferson envisioned that section 16 would fund public education. Maybe 200 years ago that was workable, but the population is ever increasing, education for kids is 13 years instead of eight and the amount of information needed to navigate a modern world is much greater. 
In the West Bonner County School District, the cost of educating one student is about $13,500 per year. The state contributes about $10,500, and it is expected that the district will come up with the balance. Unfortunately, the school district has had trouble with passing school bond levies such that last year the local Priest Lake Elementary School was threatened with closure. Fortunately, the last levy passed, although not by a large margin. 
It is not like our district is fiscally irresponsible. Our teachers are poorly paid. Of the 115 school districts in Idaho, our teachers’ salaries are fifth from the bottom. The infrastructure also is in bad shape. So you might expect that the endowment fund would provide a substantial amount of fiscal relief, but in reality, the fund provides each K-12 student in Idaho with a whopping $200 (2024).
The Idaho Land Board is the trustee for the endowment lands. As such, members must act as fiduciaries to invest wisely in order to maximize returns. And they must never erode the corpus of the trust which includes the endowment fund and the endowment lands. 
The current balance in the fund is $3.3 billion. Last year the board allocated around $100 million to various recipients to include $63 million to public schools, $3.6 million to Idaho State University, $12.8 million to the University of Idaho and a lesser amount to Lewis-Clark State College. Appropriately, these recipients are educational institutions, but money was also given to State Hospital South, the Capitol Commission, Veterans Home and to Juvenile Corrections. 
These latter recipients were no doubt worthy, but why should they receive funding from the endowment fund? This looks like mission creep. Altogether, the distribution represents about 3% of the fund, and yet in the last 20 years, the fund has kept track with the S&P 500 earning about 9% per annum.
In January 2023, 18,000 acres of timber land were purchased mostly in Bonner and Boundary counties with the expectation that the lands would generate 4% per year. The $50 million came mostly from the purchase of cottage sites at Priest and Payette Lakes. 
Given the proven successful track record of the fund, would it not have been more judicious to direct the windfall money to the widely diversified general fund? No financial adviser worth his salt would recommend putting all your eggs in one basket. 
With reliance on timber sales, the board is at the mercy of a highly cyclical industry which may not have a bright future. So far, engineered wood products have not reached the point where they can compete with traditional wood products, but they offer tremendous long-term advantages. Some products are as strong as steel, fire resistant and can be made of inferior wood such as southern yellow pine which currently is not used for general construction because it lacks strength. 
The ICCU basketball arena at U of I is made from engineered wood as well as the newly remodeled PDX airport. The aesthetic is warm and inviting, and these structures will lock away carbon for a very long time. The purchase of more timber land with the hope of generating 4% is a giveaway. 
So you ask: Who benefits from the school endowment fund; is it Idaho schools or is it the forest products industry of Idaho? Is the Land Board a fiduciary for the endowment lands or for the industry? 
Our school children’s sacred trust is being profaned.

(Photo: Dollywood)We are a nation and state divided — on paper anyway. 
The last presidential election was decided by a difference of 1.47%. Here in Tennessee, Republicans have held a supermajority in the state legislature for a little over a decade, but when given a choice statewide and gerrymandering is taken out, our Tennessee values are a lot less divided than our legislature would reflect. 
If you look at polling from Vanderbilt University, Tennesseans in clear majorities support recreational marijuana, red-flag gun safety laws and exceptions to the abortion ban for rape, incest and the life of the mother. Our Republican-dominated legislature may not do anything about it, but Tennesseans agree on a lot more than we disagree. 
Another thing Tennesseans share in wide agreement? Our complete adoration of singer, songwriter and Tennessee icon Dolly Parton.
Dolly Parton is universally beloved. In 2019, the New York Times put out a piece entitled “Is There Anything We Can All Agree On? Yes: Dolly Parton”  She has always been a topic that could be brought up around a dinner table or in mixed company and agreement can be found. 



				We’d be a lot better off if we saw each other the way we all see Dolly: familiar, human and worth a little grace.			


I grew up on the Cumberland Plateau and spent my birthdays as a child at Dollywood. When I came out as gay, she was an affirming fixture. I have always called her the patron saint of the Southern Queer. She was never loud about her politics — what once was a Tennessee tradition — but she always made clear where she stood. On her recent “Rockstar” album, a song called “World on Fire” has a line:
“Greedy politicians, present and past / They wouldn’t know the truth if it bit ’em in the ass.”
If there’s ever been a bipartisan sentiment, that is it. 
I’m so tired of division. Not disagreement, which is healthy and part of a strong democracy, but the division that we’ve been experiencing for so many years. I’m a Tennessean. I have Republican friends. I don’t always understand their lifestyle or reasoning for their beliefs, but they are my neighbors and I’d really like to be able to acknowledge their presence in Kroger without wondering if I’m safe to be around them.
We’d be a lot better off if we saw each other the way we all see Dolly: familiar, human and worth a little grace.
We’re starting to see a crop of gubernatorial candidates pop up. When the Aftyn Behn/Matt Van Epps race for Congressional District 7 winds up in a few days, I expect we’ll see some more. For any of the candidates, considering running, I’d point them to Dollywood.
Writer Eric Patton gets a little Dolly Parton magic — and cinnamon sugar in his beard. (Photo: Submitted)
As someone who holds a Dollywood season pass, I’m there often. I love going, because the experience reminds me of what is still good about my home. On any given trip to Dollywood, you’ll see a church youth group next to a group of gay men decked out in Dolly shirts. Newlyweds on their honeymoon shopping for knicknacks. A rural family on the only vacation they can afford this year waiting patiently for their time on board Wild Eagle. Immigrants and folks here on tourist visas, all excited to share in home-spun fun and down-home goodness. 
We need a governor who will ask themself “What Would Dolly Do?” She’d make sure Tennesseans are fed, educated and breathing clean air. She’d make sure they’re getting along. She’d make sure they have access to cutting edge healthcare they don’t have to go into bankruptcy over. She’d make sure if something bad happened to their community, she’d fight for everything she could to take care of them. 
I know we can’t get Dolly herself, but whoever it’ll be needs to be as close as we can get. 
Our next governor should be someone who understands the job is more than policy. It’s about restoring the basic social adhesive we’ve let disintegrate. We will need someone who can walk through Dollywood and see the same thing you’ll see on any given day there: people worth loving, not voters worth dividing. 
And if we’re in need of something to get us to stick together, I’m pretty sure there’s some cinnamon sugar stuck in my beard from the last trip.

But for too many of us, it’s getting harder to find something to be thankful for.
We are, of course, thankful for what matters most — our friends and families, the people who stand by us when times are tough. We’re grateful for the roof over our heads, the food on our tables, and the laughter that fills our homes, even when the world outside feels uncertain. We’re thankful for neighbors who lend a helping hand, for the church dinners that make sure no one goes hungry, and for the resilience that runs deep in West Virginia’s hills and hollers. These small blessings — love, community and connection — are what carry us through the hard times and remind us what we’re fighting for.
But times are hard right now. Really hard, and under H.R. 1 — the Big, Beautiful Bill — it will only get harder for West Virginians. People are working full-time jobs — sometimes more than one — and still can’t make ends meet. The cost of living has soared, while paychecks have barely budged. A trip to the grocery store evokes a glimpse at one’s bank balance before completing the clicklist. Gas prices creep higher. Rent keeps climbing. The electric bill is a shock every month. Families are cutting corners just to stay afloat — skipping meals, rationing medicine and hoping nothing goes wrong, because one unexpected expense can send everything crashing down. It’s something I’ve been hearing everywhere lately — the same frustrations, the same fears — especially over the last six weeks.
It shouldn’t be this way in America. It especially shouldn’t be this way in West Virginia, where people pride themselves on hard work, faith and taking care of their neighbors. But instead of finding relief this holiday season, we’re watching Congress make choices that will make things worse.
While families are struggling to put food on the table, our leaders in Washington are choosing to take health care away from millions of Americans — including tens of thousands of West Virginians. Cuts to Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies will push people out of coverage, forcing parents to choose between taking a sick child to the doctor or keeping the lights on.
And this isn’t abstract — it’s happening right now. When I re-enrolled in my own ACA marketplace plan earlier this month, my premium had increased by 410%. Let that sink in. Four hundred and ten percent. The same plan — except without dental and vision insurance that I have today — but now costing over four times more. I’m not alone. More than 67,000 West Virginians rely on the ACA for health insurance, and many are seeing staggering increases they simply can’t afford. These are real people — neighbors, teachers, small business owners — now forced to decide between health care and survival. 
It doesn’t have to be this way. These are policy choices — deliberate decisions to favor the wealthy and powerful over ordinary people. Congress found the money for new tax breaks for millionaires and big corporations, but somehow there’s “not enough” to help working families see a doctor or afford their prescriptions.
The truth is, this Thanksgiving, West Virginians are paying more and getting less. Grocery prices are up. Gas is up. Rent is up. Prescription drug prices are up. But wages? They’re not keeping up. And when families finally do reach for help — for Medicaid, SNAP, housing assistance or affordable coverage through the ACA marketplace — they’re told, “sorry, you’re on your own.”
That’s not gratitude. That’s greed, dressed up in a suit and tie.
When Congress votes to take away health care from people who clean their offices, deliver their mail, care for their children and stock their grocery store shelves, they’re not balancing a budget — they’re breaking a promise. They’re saying the lives of ordinary Americans are expendable. They’re saying it’s acceptable for a child’s asthma to go untreated, for a parent to skip insulin, for a senior to face eviction because medical bills drained their savings.
West Virginians know better. We know that gratitude isn’t just about counting blessings — it’s about sharing them. It’s about making sure everyone has enough to eat, a safe place to live and the ability to see a doctor when they’re sick.
This Thanksgiving, as our leaders in Washington pat themselves on the back for “fiscal responsibility,” let’s remember who’s really paying the price. Not the wealthy. Not the lobbyists. Not the corporations that got yet another round of tax breaks. It’s the single mom in Beckley who lost her health coverage. The retired miner in Logan who can’t afford his blood pressure medication. The family in Charleston wondering how they’ll pay next month’s rent.
So, this year, let’s tell the truth: there’s not a lot to be thankful for when our leaders choose cruelty over compassion. But there is still something to fight for.
Because West Virginians don’t give up easily. We believe in looking out for one another. We believe that every person deserves health care, dignity and a fair shot at a good life.
And we’ll keep fighting — through every cut, every challenge and every broken promise — until compassion guides policy again.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)PRESTONSBURG — BeLinda Click shivered in the cold fog as she greeted each person in a long line of cars, checking each one’s referral letter saying they’d been pre-approved for a free Thanksgiving meal. 
By 10 a.m. on Monday, the line of cars stretched deep into the parking lot at Big Sandy Community and Technical College in Prestonsburg. 
About 100 people signed up to get boxes at this location through God’s Pantry’s Sharing Thanksgiving program, which for 31 years has given people in need the ingredients to make a traditional holiday meal for up to a family of eight — turkey, cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes, corn, stuffing mix and more. 
Between Monday and Tuesday, God’s Pantry distributed around 7,500 Thanksgiving meal boxes at various sites in Central and Eastern Kentucky. 
“Have a happy Thanksgiving!” Click called out to the passengers in car after car. She knows what it’s like to need help. That’s why she’s here.  
In 2022, the deadly flood that devastated much of Southeastern Kentucky destroyed her family home. 
“We had such a downpour all at once,” she said. “It caused a mudslide behind our house, and it pretty well rotted out the whole back half of my house, and we had to move.” 
She and her family have lived in an apartment ever since. She got very little help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), she said. When the government failed her, though, her community stepped up. 
Saint Vincent Mission in David helped her — with food, supplies to help her rebuild and volunteers who helped her and her husband with the rebuilding. In turn, Click started volunteering with the Christian organization and now works as the food pantry director.

Click, 39, has also had benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for years. The Wayland woman’s benefit was paused during the recent government shutdown, along with roughly 600,000 other Kentuckians who need the benefit to buy food. 
“That was pretty scary,” said Click, “not knowing how you’re going to feed your family.” 
During the shutdown, Saint Vincent’s food pantry saw about 15-20 new clients in need of food who came in with the “panic of not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.” It made her job as a worker and volunteer at the pantry “that much more important,” she said. 
The shutdown is over, but the fallout from decisions made in Washington could continue for a while. And as the holiday season kicks in, many Kentuckians will need even more help. 
“There’s probably a higher demand of people (who need) holiday meals,” Click said. “Because what they live on now… they probably really can’t spare.” 



How to help:
Halligan said people who want to help neighbors dealing with food insecurity can help in a variety of ways — through donating time, money or food and through advocating for anti-hunger policies. 
“I think it’s up to a household; it’s up to an individual to decide where they can make the most impact, and if somebody can do all three, great, and if they can’t do one, or if they can only do one, pick the one that you can do and lean in,” Halligan said. “And if it’s not with God’s Pantry Food Bank, it’s with some other organization that is part of the hunger safety net — help them. It’s not about God’s Pantry Food Bank. It’s about 280,000 people who need the hunger safety net to work for them.”

An ‘unconscionable level of increased food insecurity’

Michael Halligan, the president and CEO God’s Pantry Food Bank, said the hunger safety net has gotten an energy boost in 2025 thanks to public awareness of hunger that increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“I see community leaning in more than I’ve ever seen. Volunteers, neighbors experiencing hunger, sponsors, businesses, elected officials, I see community leaning in more than I’ve ever seen, and some of that is the circumstances of the time,” Halligan said. “We often talk about Kentuckians being resilient. What I see is the blessings of people helping people that allows that resiliency to become apparent, that allows that resiliency to happen, and if it’s not for community engagement, I’m not sure where we would be.” 
During the recent government shutdown, God’s Pantry saw a 40% increase in food insecurity in the 50 counties the organization serves, Halligan said. Before the shutdown, about 280,000 people in Central and Eastern Kentucky were living with food insecurity, he said. From the first week of October to the first week of November, around 400,000 people needed food help.
“Those were federal workers without paychecks. Those were folks who had never experienced hunger before that, all of a sudden, were asking, ‘What do I do? How do I get food?’” Halligan said. “Those were folks that lost SNAP benefits, even for a short period of time, and we’re still seeing the impact of that. It will take a while to recover. It will take a while for everything to kind of restabilize.” 
This increase in food insecurity in an already hungry state was daunting, Halligan said: “The instantaneous impact of that unconscionable level of increased food insecurity was difficult to deal with.”

The organization was able to bump up food distribution thanks to financial and food donations, he said, but food pantries can never replace SNAP benefits, which provide roughly nine meals for every one meal food pantries can offer, according to Feeding America. 
God’s Pantry, part of the Feeding Kentucky network, also got some of the funds from the $5 million pot Gov. Andy Beshear allocated to food banks from the rainy day fund. 
Still, God’s Pantry and other food pantry networks could see increased demand even beyond the holiday season.  
On Nov. 1, changes to the SNAP program passed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act went into effect.  Veterans, the homeless, recent foster care youth and adults ages 54-64 are no longer exempt from work requirements to receive food benefits for themselves and their families. 
“We’re prepared to be able to do the things that we need to do to provide assistance, but we don’t know exactly what the number is yet,” Halligan said. 
The expanded work requirements, mandated by the federal budget bill, are expected to cost 114,000 Kentuckians their food assistance, policy experts have estimated. 
‘I hate to see people hungry.’

Volunteers keep the food safety net wheel turning, Halligan said. In 2024, more than 5,000 volunteers contributed about 33,000 hours of work to God’s Pantry. 
“Imagine if we had to pay for all of that,” he said. “We would not be able to distribute as much food, because we would have more payroll costs.” 
At the Sharing Thanksgiving event Monday, at least 30 volunteers were spread across the parking lot to greet meal recipients, check people in, load cars and more. 
Joey Waddell, the chief operating officer at Highlands Appalachian Regional Healthcare (ARH), was among the volunteers loading turkeys and Thanksgiving meal staples into vehicles.
“We try to be involved in as many community giving events that we can to help those that don’t have the means that maybe other folks do,” Waddell said, crediting his Christian faith with the desire to help others. He also recently participated in a dancing fundraiser for unhoused people and a coat drive for children. 
“Everybody’s appreciative and thanking us,” he said. “Putting others first, that’s where my heart is.”

Phil Mills, a respiratory therapist, God’s Pantry volunteer and the director of Fishes and Loaves, a community food pantry associated with St. James Episcopal Church in Prestonsburg, said he’s always found himself in a “helping role.” Mills was also out at Big Sandy on Monday to help keep the line of cars moving. 
“I do enjoy helping people,” said Mills, 56, who grew up in Martin County. “There’s a big need. There’s a lot of people that need. I always thought I grew up poor, until I’ve seen some other families and (realized) I had a lot. Probably not everything everybody wants, but there’s always somebody in worse shape than you.” 
His father worked in the coal mines, Mills said. He and his four siblings got a small, meaningful present or two at Christmas.  
“Now, I see all these people coming in. We have mothers come in with children; they can’t feed them, they don’t have toys for them,” he said. At Fishes and Loaves, staff try to find little toys and snacks for the kids — something extra to make them happy. 
“I’ve always been a helper. I’ve been a caregiver for parents, partners, relatives that needed other things. It’s just the caregiver in me,” Mills said. “People say I have a big heart. I don’t know if it’s a big heart. I just like helping others. I hate to see people hungry.” 
Anyone can find themselves in a position where they need food assistance, Halligan said. They could lose a loved one or a job, be in a traffic accident or find themselves caught between the politics of a government shutdown. 
“What I see right now is community understanding that more than they’ve ever understood it,” Halligan said. “We often talk about sharing the blessings of life around the Thanksgiving table, and that’s what sharing Thanksgiving is about. But I see people starting to understand the importance of sharing those moments 365 days a year, not one.”

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)A months-long budget stalemate, resolved earlier this month, netted increases for both the Pennsylvania State Police and Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency — which plan to boost staffing and invest in technology updates.
State police will get an additional $69.3 million for operations, enough to fund four new cadet classes to increase its ranks. Staffing is critical for the 1,279 municipalities that don’t have police departments and rely solely on troopers for their law enforcement needs. 
“Our focus is firmly on safeguarding the public and ensuring that every community within the Commonwealth receives the support it requires during critical times,” said State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris. “These investments are crucial in providing our members with the tools and resources needed to respond promptly and effectively to urgent situations, ultimately enhancing our collective resilience.”

Emergency management will receive $40 million in its disaster response fund, up from $20 million, “to offset (the) sudden loss in federal support,” according to a press release from the agency. The Trump administration has sought to transform the Federal Emergency Management Agency and publicly discussed shifting more responsibility to the states. 
Another $5 million bump to the Commonwealth Disaster Recovery Assistance Program will increase direct support to impacted Pennsylvanians.
“Programs like DRAP make an immediate and meaningful difference for our communities. After the May 13th flooding, many Somerset County residents were able to rely on DRAP to help begin their recovery when they needed it most. This support filled a critical gap for families who were facing unexpected losses,” said Somerset County Emergency Management Agency Director Joel Landis.

(Photo by Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas voters have a good bit to be grateful for this Thanksgiving holiday, as the 2026 election season picks up steam.
Voters in Senate District 26 and House District 70, especially, can thank the state Supreme Court for denying Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ request to delay compliance with two circuit court rulings that ordered special elections in those districts be held sooner than Sanders previously set them.
Voters in both districts sued after Sanders set special elections for June 9 to replace a deceased senator and a representative who resigned to take a job with Arkansas PBS. The plaintiffs argued the election date, coming well past the end of the Legislature’s fiscal session, deprived them of representation in violation of the state and federal constitutions.
In defiant Nov. 16 proclamations, Sanders reluctantly rescheduled the general elections in the two legislative districts for March 3, the same day as the 2026 party primaries elsewhere in Arkansas. She set the primaries in the two districts for Jan. 6, barely six weeks from today.
Sanders said she complied with the two court orders she’d tried to stop “under duress.” She stubbornly insisted that the court’s decision was “unlawful” and said she remained confident she’d prevail as the appeal continues.
That confidence requires faith that the Arkansas Supreme Court will reverse itself and the two lower court judges before Jan. 6. I find it hard to believe the state’s high court will halt an election it’s already said needs to be held sooner rather than later. I find it even harder to believe that the justices will declare an election null and void once the votes are cast. Not impossible, but unlikely.
Regardless, voters in Senate District 26, many of whom oppose a Sanders-backed plan to put a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, have a surfeit of candidates to choose from come Jan. 6 as five Republicans vie to replace the late Republican Sen. Gary Stubblefield of Branch. Stubblefield had been a staunch opponent of the administration’s choice of the site for the prison.
The winner of the primary will face independent candidate Adam Watson, a founding director of Gravel & Grit, a nonprofit dedicated to opposing the prison.
District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
Voters in House District 70, which had been held by Republican Rep. Carlton Wing of North Little Rock, get to choose between two Democrats on Jan. 6, with the winner facing a Republican candidate on March 3. District 70 lies entirely within Pulaski County.
 The bigger picture

Those aren’t the only Arkansas voters who should feel thankful this year, as Democrats field 75 candidates across executive, legislative and congressional races in hopes of loosening the Republican lock on the state’s congressional seats and reducing the GOP supermajority in the General Assembly. 
Those candidates provide voters ample opportunity to decide whether they want “change or more of the same,” to steal a phrase longtime political observer Skip Rutherford used in reference to the national political stage a week ago.
The former dean of the Clinton School of Public Service characterized the election of Democrats with widely divergent political views — from the Democratic Socialist mayor of New York City to the moderate governors of Virginia and New Jersey — as “send-a-message” elections.
From a national standpoint, the dissatisfaction of voters over the price of groceries and the rising cost of health insurance will be a message that Republicans and Democrats ignore at their peril in 2026’s midterms, Rutherford said at an Arkansas Times-sponsored lecture.
Rutherford, an adviser to Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, drew comparisons between the recent Democratic victories and that election’s “It’s the economy, stupid” slogan, attributed to campaign consultant James Carville.
I think Rutherford’s right, but Republicans can also use the economy card, and it’ll be interesting to see how that plays out in legislative races next year, especially with Sanders’ active involvement in several races.

But Gov. Jared Polis seems to have a different idea.
For some mysterious reason, he appears to think there might be some merit to the request. No matter how he comes down on the matter, he has already undermined the rule of law and insulted every local official who helps manage honest elections in the face of right-wing extremist threats.

Peters is serving time in state prison, and for good reason: The Republican former Mesa County clerk was the linchpin in a plan to breach the security of her own election equipment to prove the “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen. She was convicted in state court of multiple counts related to the scheme, including four felonies, and sentenced to almost nine years behind bars.
The local district attorney who prosecuted the case was a Republican in a county that favored Trump by 28 percentage points, and there is no credible reason to think the conviction was unjust or compromised by politics.
But in MAGA America, what matters more than anything is personal loyalty to President Donald Trump, which Peters offers in ample measure. That’s why the president has repeatedly demanded that she be released, claiming preposterously that “she did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election” and promising “harsh measures” if Colorado fails to comply.
In March, J. Bishop Grewell, then the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, and Peter McNeilly, then an assistant U.S. attorney for Colorado, were among three Justice Department officials who told a federal judge in Colorado they were reviewing the state’s prosecution of Peters. This month, Trump’s Bureau of Prisons formally made a request to the Colorado Department of Corrections to transfer her to federal custody.
The request is corrupt and deserves no consideration. Trump wants to aid a criminal ally, as he’s already done so many times since January.
“One is only left to assume that either the Trump administration wants her moved to federal custody so that they could somehow then release her outside of the jurisdiction of Colorado, which would be a blockbuster obstruction of justice by the U.S. government against a lawful state criminal order, or they want to put her in federal custody to give her some improved conditions,” lawyer Marc Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, said during an interview with podcaster Brian Tyler Cohen.
Yet more than a week after the Trump administration sent its request to the state, Polis’ office in a statement to Newsline said he was still “reviewing” the request.
There’s nothing to review. As stated by Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, and Dan Rubinstein, the Republican district attorney who prosecuted Peters, in a joint letter last week imploring Polis to deny the administration’s request, Trump “has no legal basis to interfere with the sentence in this case,” and the request is an attempt “to circumvent Colorado’s sovereignty.”
Even if Polis ultimately decides to deny the request, his long silence in the face of such brazen lawlessness has already made him look weak, and it has done real damage. During a Tuesday press conference, when a bipartisan group of local election officials from around the state exhorted Polis to deny the request, county clerks said they have experienced an “immediate uptick in concerns about safety” in relation to the Peters case.
The clerks said they have yet to even hear from Polis, even though they sent him a letter last week requesting a meeting with him about Peters.
This is hardly the first time Polis has appeared to accommodate Trump or fully sided with team MAGA. His administration has been all too eager to supply sensitive information about Colorado residents to ICE as part of Trump’s inhumane mass deportation program. 
In the Peters case, he risks undermining the rule of law and fueling doubts about voting in a state where brave Democratic and Republican officials have done so much to defend free and fair elections.
He owes it to anyone who hopes systems of justice can withstand authoritarian attacks to quickly, forcefully and publicly tell the Trump administration that Peters isn’t going anywhere.

The measures come as Virginia ramps up for the expected increase in traffic, which is also being driven by travelers avoiding air travel as the federal government cuts back on flights due to a shortage of air traffic controllers. 
An additional 1.6 million people will travel at least 50 miles from home over the holiday period between Nov. 25-Dec. 1, compared to the previous record of 80.2 million, according to AAA.
 Buckle up before taking off

Last March, Virginia passed a new traffic law requiring all passengers, whether in the front or back seats of the vehicle, to be properly buckled up. The previous law only required adults to wear seat belts when occupying the front seat, which contributed to Virginia raking the worst in the nation for seat belt use in 2023 with just 73.2% of residents buckling up, far below the national average of 91.9%, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

“We are literally the worst at wearing our seat belts,” said Christy King, a Virginian resident, on a recent episode of the Responder Safety podcast. King advocated for the law change last January, following the death of her son, Christopher, in a car crash.
The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles advises rideshare drivers and passengers to comply, as well.
Last year, five of the eight people who died in crashes during the holiday period were not wearing a seatbelt. Virginia also recorded 768 traffic-related injuries in the same time frame. The new law follows the annual nationwide Click It or Ticket campaign, which raises awareness about seat belt use.
“Whether you’re traveling across the commonwealth to visit family or just heading down the street, remember that everyone wants to make it home safely for the holidays,” said DMV Commissioner Gerald Lackey, the governor’s highway safety representative, in a statement. “Be patient, be courteous, and buckle up. The best gift you can give your loved ones is your safe arrival.”
 Express lanes, closures

On Friday, the 2.5-mile extension of the Interstate 495 Express Lanes in Northern Virginia opened, which officials say will ease congestion in the area. The new lanes have already created some concern about the possible bottleneck the traffic would create going into Maryland.
The extension starts near the Dulles Corridor Interchange and terminates just before the American Legion Bridge, and includes new connecting ramps. The extension also includes new bridges carrying sidewalks and a shared-use trail parallel to Interstate 495, upgraded noise walls to protect nearby neighborhoods, and express bus service connecting Virginia to Maryland via the American Legion Bridge.
The extension is part of the $660 million 495 NEXT project between Virginia and Transurban, private partner and operator of the existing I-95, I-395 and I-495 Express Lanes. Construction began in March 2022. Final completion is expected to occur mid-2026.
Beginning Wednesday at noon, the Virginia Department of Transportation will suspend many highway work zones and lift temporary lane closures on interstates and other major roadways statewide until noon on Dec. 1. The transportation agency said motorists may encounter semi-permanent work zones. 
Travelers can check VDOT’s list of travel advisories for notices around the commonwealth.
Express-lane directionality on Interstates 95 and 395 will be adjusted for holiday traffic, providing a cost benefit for motorists. On Thanksgiving, the lanes will operate southbound all day.
Drivers with three or more people in the car and an E-ZPass Flex set to “HOV ON” can ride for free. 
Travelers who need to cross bodies of water between the Hampton Roads Peninsula and Southside during construction of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel Expansion Project are encouraged to use alternate routes such as the I-664 Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel, the Route 17 James River Bridge, the free Jamestown-Scotland Ferry or I-95 to minimize potential delays.
Motorists using Route 17’s George P. Coleman Memorial Bridge should expect delays between 45 and 60 minutes due to mechanical issues. No work requiring lane closures will be conducted at any of the water crossings during the Thanksgiving holiday.

(Photo by Getty Images)On Thursday, Nov. 26, 1789, George Washington woke early. Assisted by his enslaved valets – William “Billy” Lee and the young Christopher Sheels – he powdered his hair, put on his favorite black velvet suit, tied his white neckwear and donned his yellow gloves.
Finally ready, he set out to travel the short distance from the President’s House, at what used to be 3 Cherry St., New York, and St. Paul’s Chapel, which still stands at 209 Broadway.
He had an important aim that day: to celebrate Thanksgiving. Washington had thought carefully about this Thanksgiving, the first of his presidency. On Oct. 3, 1789, following the recommendation of a joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives, Washington had issued a proclamation. He urged the people of the United States to celebrate “a day of public thanksgiving and prayer.”
But Washington believed that particular Thanksgiving in 1789 was a crucial occasion. He would use it to call on the people he now led to hold their new country together in the face of forces that he knew could pull it apart.
 Devotion in the service of unity

It was not the first Thanksgiving Americans celebrated. The firsttook place at Plymouth colony in the autumn of 1621 – Pilgrims held a feast to thank God for their first harvest and invited members of the neighboring Wampanoag tribe.
It was not even the first national Thanksgiving – which was held on Dec. 18, 1777, at then-General Washington’s behest. Nor was Thanksgiving yet a federal holiday to be observed every last Thursday of November – it became so with the 1863 proclamation of President Abraham Lincoln.

Nov. 26, 1789, was a Thursday, and the weather was miserable. Few New Yorkers showed up at St. Paul’s Chapel to see the president: “I went to St. Pauls Chapel,” Washington wrote in his diary, “though it was most inclement and stormy.” There were “but few people at Church.”
The president had prepared for the occasion. He also contributed a sizable sum of his own money to buy beer and food for prisoners confined for debt in the New York City jail. The donation was deemed to be a magnanimous and moving gesture, suitable to the spirit of the holiday. A week later, in an advertisement in the Dec. 3 issue of the New York Journal, those very prisoners returned their “grateful thanks” to their president “for his very acceptable donation on Thursday last.”
Washington’s first Thanksgiving as a president may have not been tremendously successful, given the scarce attendance at the church service.
Yet, as a scholar writing a biography about Washington, I believe it was an important step in his much larger political plan to bring the executive branch to the people’s doorstep.
What Washington wanted was a virtuous kind of populism in the new country he led. Washington’s populism wasn’t about inciting an angry mob; it was about sharing in their rituals, worshiping their God, speaking their own language. And he did so in the sole interest of the American people.
Thanksgiving 1789, for Washington, was at once religious and more than religious. Washington’s proclamation invoked devotional language, literally. The upcoming festivity, in his words, could “be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be.”
But Washington’s main concern was political. The nation was recently formed, and he feared that it could easily collapse. Its many internal divisions and separate interests could be lethal. Consequently, the president wanted this holiday to be a civic celebration in which “we may then all unite.”


Washington’s proclamation was printed in newspapers throughout the country. George Washington’s Mt. Vernon
 ‘Pardon our national…transgressions’

As its first president, Washington recognized that the United States was born out of slavery, conquest and violence as much as of sacred principle. Civic unification required acknowledgment of these flaws. Thus, in the proclamation, Washington asked God “to pardon our national and other transgressions.”
A tremendously self-aware man, Washington knew that he was a deeply flawed person himself.
He was a slave owner, a relentless pursuer of African American fugitives and a destroyer of Native American villages. He was also a warrior who deployed brutality against enemies. He was a commander who resorted to corporal punishment with his own soldiers. Washington believed that he was not a saint to be mindlessly imitated. This made him humble in his duties.
More importantly, Washington also grasped the power of his symbolic position as president. He sought to leverage that for the good of the nation.
As president, Washington could not advertise his actions effectively via Twitter and social media. He had to show himself around constantly, no matter the weather. He had to painstakingly attend balls, plays, dinners, public receptions and of course the church. Every occasion, every Thanksgiving counted.
Through his outings, Washington met with a diversity of people, including those who were second-class citizens or were not citizens at all. Women, for example, greeted Washington at nearly every stop of the extended presidential trips he took between 1789 and 1791. Textile workers in New England, Jewish leaders in Newport, many enslaved persons in the South and churchgoers everywhere did the same.
These women and men, in bondage or free, believers or skeptics, played a part in the invention of a new political theater. Maybe, it was just a theatrical illusion. But these individuals – just like the prisoners in the New York City jail – thanked President Washington because they felt they were voices in a larger political culture.
Washington made sure his Thanksgiving message – not simply a message, but a “proclamation” – sounded clear and strong: May God “render our national government a blessing to all the people, by constantly being a Government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed.”

The center is trying to get a handle on industry-wide financial issues. (Photo by Maya Mitchell/New Hampshire Bulletin)At first glance, The Growing Years Early Childhood Center in Manchester doesn’t look like it’s financially struggling. The parking lot is full, and the hallways are loud with the sounds of infants and playing toddlers. But the main hall leads to an empty classroom because Kitty Larochelle, the center’s executive director, can’t afford what’s necessary to reopen it. 
“That could fit up to 14 toddlers,” Larochelle said. “We would need four teachers for that classroom, and right now that’s just not feasible.” 
Despite being at capacity and having a waitlist, The Growing Years and other early childhood education centers in New Hampshire are struggling to stay afloat. Even centers in the state’s more populated areas are finding it difficult to make ends meet.
Centers barely, if at all, break even because they cannot charge “the true cost of care” without raising already-expensive tuition. The most recent data shows that the average annual price for an infant in center-based child care was $17,250, and the average price for an infant and a 4-year-old was $31,868 in 2023, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute. 
Meanwhile, low salaries for child care workers have contributed to a workforce shortage and exacerbated capacity issues as a result. According to Larochelle, it is a “balancing act” for her and other center directors to get a handle on the challenges, as everything goes hand in hand.  
“We have to be highly, highly aware that most of our income comes from our families, so we can’t overcharge our families and feel good about that,” said Larochelle. “But at the same time, we’re trying to get our staff wages to a reasonable amount so that we maintain our workers.” 
Expensive expenses
Nearly everything that goes into running a child care facility carries a high price tag. 
“We’re broke all the time,” said Marianne Barter, executive director of Merrimack Valley Day Care Service, a nonprofit in Concord and Boscawen that prioritizes care for children at risk of abuse and neglect.  
Salaries and benefits are the biggest expense of most centers, Barter said. Additionally, providing healthy food and diapers, paying the mortgage or rent on their five locations, utilities, and building maintenance contribute to tight finances. 
“I have horrible buildings,” Barter said, including one that experienced heating and plumbing issues in late October. “Many child care facilities are in buildings that were not intended to be child care facilities. … [It] is a constant nightmare.”
Additionally, businesses must have insurance and keep up with state child care licensing standards, both of which providers say are expensive. Centers struggle to find affordable liability insurance because agencies offer it sparingly, and those who do can charge high premiums due to the risk.  
Barter almost had to close her center’s doors when her former insurance agency stopped offering child care insurance, but ended up securing a policy from a different insurer.
“You’d be out of your mind not to have liability insurance,” Barter said. In New Hampshire, child care businesses are only required to have workers’ compensation insurance. “Kids get hurt all the time. You could get sued at any time. These are other people’s children. This is the most important thing in someone’s life and they’re entrusting it with you every single day. The risk involved with that is incredible.” 
There is a financial difference between nonprofit and for-profit centers, but both Barter and Larochelle said it is small and comes down to taxes and grant eligibility. Across the industry, employers are managing employees who are struggling to pay rent, fix their cars, and care for their own children. 
“I assume it’s on average with everyone else,” Barter said about how running a nonprofit early education center is different. “Even if we’re doing a little bit better, it’s like being the skinniest kid at fat camp. Nothing glorious about it.”
The Growing Years raised tuition for the first time in two years this year to try to combat their financial challenges. Larochelle said it is “extremely difficult” to balance her budget. 
“Even though we are a for-profit center, I can tell you it’s like for very little profit, because we are taking care of our staff the best that we can and are still being mindful of the families we serve,” she said. 
Workforce shortage ripples
For the past decade, the child care industry has experienced high employee turnover, and businesses are struggling to recruit workers due to low wages. According to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, the median yearly salary of child care workers is $32,490, less than that of preschool teachers, kindergarten teachers, and almost all other occupations in the state. 
A bachelor’s degree, an associate’s degree, or a certificate in the field is required for early childhood education providers. People with degrees can make more at a pre-school than at an early learning center, which draws them away from the field. 
“There’s not a lot of people who want to enter the field making $15 an hour,” said Shannon Tremblay, director of New Hampshire’s legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Committee. 
The inability to pay employees properly is a personal burden for child care directors. When asked about it, Larochelle could not put it into words. Barter said said she wasn’t sure she could describe it.
“The fact that I cannot pay these incredible people what they are worth is just constant frustration,” she said. “As a person who runs this agency, it feels awful when I know one of my staff is struggling. God, I hate that and my board hates it, too.” 
As a result, businesses lack a sufficient number of employees to maintain the legally required child-to-adult ratios, resulting in a capacity shortage. There are more children needing care than spots available, even if a business has the classroom space in its building. Without the staff, those classrooms stay closed. 
“They may have one or two classrooms that they’re not filling and they can’t fill them because they don’t have staff,” Tremblay said. “They could fill it with their wait list, probably threefold, but they can’t bring in those kiddos because they don’t have the staff.” 
The empty classroom at The Growing Years has been that way since the COVID-19 pandemic. Larochelle said that hiring new employees is a “gamble” because if they quit, families could risk having care stripped away. 
“We don’t want to open up a classroom and then find out that employees don’t stay more than two months because that puts in jeopardy care for 14 families,” she said. “We want to make sure that we have a solid base and that we can provide care on a daily basis, and even if someone calls out that we have someone who can fill in and we can still meet our ratios.” 
To address staffing issues, Larochelle said she tries to “cultivate” her own staff by hiring and mentoring interested people at the center while they earn their degree or certification in early childhood education. She said it’s necessary because “early childhood education is not really promoted as a sustainable income to live off of.” 
For veteran providers, Larochelle has tried to increase the incentives. Providers have a half-day off each week, leaving by noon. In the past, the center has held fundraisers for families and employees to help during difficult times. Larochelle said the center’s owner has helped with household expenses, such as new car tires.
“We care for our staff as if they were family. We support each other, we’re always checking in,” she said. “It’s an extremely difficult and challenging job if done right,” said Larochelle. “Those who don’t care don’t stay in the field.”
State investment is low but growing
The state offers the Child Care Scholarship Program, but it helps families, not businesses. The CCSP reduces the cost of child care for eligible families by providing direct payments to qualified providers. 
While the program is great for easing a family’s access to early education for their children, Barter said it does not help businesses, since the state is not paying them the actual cost of care, just the average. 
“We do not collect a cost share, we just bill the state and this is a gap,” Barter said. “From an affordability standpoint, when the state moves over to a cost-of-care model instead of a market rate model, that’s going to be hugely impactful for child care centers, because it’s going to mean that the rate they pay for scholarship students is going to be based on the actual cost, not just the average of what we all charge, which is never enough.”
The Department of Health and Human Services has made child care a priority for the biennium, but has also left $15 million in funding for child care employers in limbo by trying to fund it with federal dollars. 
In the 2026 legislative session, legislation is proposed to give businesses a tax credit for expanding child care, to use state funds for $15 million in child care for employers, and to ease municipal zoning requirements that are making it hard for new businesses to open. However, there is also legislation to repeal the state’s $15 million allocation to child care employers. 
“When we don’t show up, there’s an awful lot of people who do not show up for work. That on its own should have more value than it does in this state,” Barter said. “For every person I hire, eight other people get to go to work. I can’t think of any other job that’s like that.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/growingyearsbiz-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-26 05:56:18.786224

One of the main debates at the Ohio Statehouse this year has revolved around how to fix and reduce the skyrocketing property tax burdens.
“People are suffering, they’re losing their homes,” Lakewood resident Beth Blackmarr said.
But the legislature has to remember they need to support public schools, Parma Schools Superintendent Dr. Scott J. Hunt said.
“We continue to need operating dollars,” Hunt said.
Lawmakers passed four bills that Republicans say deal with the first issue, providing help for taxpayers.
“These are very, very important reform bills that are really the most consequential in almost half a century,” state Rep. David Thomas (R-Jefferson) said.
House Bills 186 and 335 limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation. These bills passed both chambers in a bipartisan fashion.
H.B. 309 allows county budget commissions to reduce property tax levies. It mainly passed along party lines, but a few Democrats joined the Republicans to pass it, while several members of the GOP voted no.
H.B. 129 implements a check on tax increases from school levies. In the House, it passed overwhelmingly, but in the Senate, all Democrats and state Sen. Bill Blessing (R-Colerain Township) voted no.
“We will no longer have huge increases in people’s property tax bills if they did not vote for that,” Thomas said.
Schools have been arguing for months now that these bills take away much-needed dollars for kids, when they are already facing cuts from the state in expected funding.
“We’ll talk about [cutting] staffing, which impacts what programs we might consider to remain here at Parma and those that we might not be able to support,” Hunt told me. “Certainly, those things impact the quality of education we can provide for our students.”
The district will need to dramatically reduce its services if its levies continue to fail, he added.
“Everything will be on the table: transportation, potentially participation fees, we’ll be looking at our buildings,” Hunt said.
But Lakewood homeowner Beth Blackmarr, who is fighting to abolish property taxes altogether, said she doesn’t want to hurt the schools. Lawmakers aren’t doing enough to actually provide relief, she said.
“They knew they were supposed to do something,” Blackmarr said. “They ignored it in favor of pet projects like the Browns stadium.”
Instead of spending months focusing on how to use unclaimed funds to move the Browns to Brook Park, she said, affordability should have been the legislature’s focus.
Thomas said it has been his priority, and he plans to continue that.
“It is not enough,” Thomas said. “We need to do much more.”
It’s unclear how much money this legislation would actually save taxpayers like Blackmarr. But she said one thing is clear — these bills needed to pass years ago to actually impact her bills.
“This is a huge problem, and, by the way, a problem of the legislation’s own making,” Blackmarr said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-26 10:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT begins broader debate over vanishing federal funds,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/26/ct-begins-broader-debate-over-vanishing-federal-funds/,State leaders now must decide whether CT should indefinitely dedicate millions to reverse gaps created by retreating federal funding.,"State officials recently reserved $500 million, on paper, to bolster federal human service programs for roughly two months.
But this emergency funding really represents the start of a much broader debate.
Gov. Ned Lamont and the Democratic-controlled General Assembly now must decide whether Connecticut should indefinitely dedicate state dollars — potentially for several years — to reverse new gaps in health care, nutrition, and energy and housing assistance created by retreating federal funding.
“The need to be looking holistically, long-term, at these things is important,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, told the Connecticut Mirror this week.
“We don’t know how dire the [federal funding] crisis will be,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who noted Connecticut could be dealing with a devolving federal funding situation for an array of core programs for years to come. “Are we really going to go over a cliff?”
At the bottom of that potential cliff are more than 140,000 enrollees in Access Health CT, the state’s health insurance exchange, who stand to lose federal subsidies that cover all or a portion of their premium costs. The New York Times reported this week that President Donald Trump is weighing a possible extension of those benefits but hasn’t reached a decision yet.
Also at risk are an estimated 36,000 immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness who are at risk of losing Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits between Dec. 1 and March 31 because of new work requirements and other rules changes.
Both stem not from the 43-day federal government shutdown, which ran from Oct. 1 through mid-November, but rather from ongoing cutbacks ordered in July by the Republican-led Congress and Trump.
Most of the federal funding cuts in that bill, particularly those centered on Medicaid, don’t take effect until 2027 or 2028.
But there are others, besides nutrition assistance and health insurance subsidies, that will be felt sooner.
Since federal funding for the thousands of Connecticut students who receive free and reduced price school meals is determined partly by SNAP caseloads, school districts could be facing reductions there.
And to help pay for federal tax cuts also enacted as part of that omnibus July measure, the Trump administration has recommended cuts in 2026 to some forms of affordable housing assistance for many more.
So, while state officials agreed to use $500 million from last fiscal year’s surplus to potentially mitigate federal cutbacks in human service programs between now and Feb. 4, when the regular 2026 General Assembly session starts, the populations at risk now still could be in jeopardy two months from now and likely long after, absent state intervention.
“What’s more, excessive tariffs have made life more unaffordable — from groceries to housing to holiday gift-giving,” said Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children. “Connecticut must be vigilant and proactive so that our residents are protected.”
Lamont, who has sole authority to propose disbursements from the $500 million response fund this winter, already has begun talks with legislative leaders on how to use that money.
The governor, a fiscally moderate Democrat, traditionally been wary of using state funds to supplement programs normally funded by the federal government.
But Lamont also said last week that “we’re going to take care of people in need.”
When asked earlier this month whether he would support a state-funded SNAP benefit to protect the 36,000 recipients affected by recent federal rules changes, the governor was open but noncommittal, saying only “we’re looking at that.”
He also said his administration is working with state Comptroller Sean Scanlon to develop a new option to help residents and small businesses buy affordable health insurance. The governor last week tapped Scanlon’s chief health policy aide, Josh Wojcik, to become the administration’s new budget director.
But regardless of whether Lamont dedicates portions of the $500 million reserve to bolster weakened federal human service programs this winter, legislative leaders say they expect many Democratic state legislators next year will want to commit state funds on an ongoing basis toward this social safety net.
“This is just not a normal situation,” Ritter said, predicting Connecticut and many other states may spend the next few years deciding what degree of federal cutbacks are intolerable. And if so, Ritter added, states also must decide how much of their own funds they can afford to spend to improve the situation.
But while Lamont and top state lawmakers also say Connecticut never can afford to reverse all federal cutbacks, they also note it has more options financially than do most other states.
With more than $4.3 billion in its rainy day fund, equal to 18% of the annual General Fund, Connecticut has one of the larger budget reserves in the nation.
And unlike most other states, Connecticut also has a complex series of budget caps that force large annual surpluses.
Surpluses here since 2017 have averaged more than $1.8 billion per year, about 8% to 9% of the General Fund. Connecticut has used those dollars to build reserves and whittle down its considerable pension debt.
And if Lamont and his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly seek to bolster federal human service programs by scaling back those surpluses somewhat, they could face strong opposition from minority Republicans.
GOP leaders during the federal government shutdown last month, when state aid from Washington was stalled temporarily, endorsed using $500 million from last fiscal year’s state budget surplus to prop up federal nutrition and heating assistance programs.
But if Connecticut is going to launch new state spending, year after year, to replace vanishing dollars from Washington, it shouldn’t come at the expense of local efforts to pay down pension debt, Republicans say.
Connecticut entered this fiscal year with $33.5 billion in unfunded pension obligations, a burden created by more than seven decades of improper savings prior to 2011, and still carries one of the highest debt levels in this category nationwide.
If Connecticut is going to start providing nutrition benefits, heating assistance or health care subsidies on an ongoing basis, said state Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, then officials here should pay for them through matching spending cuts elsewhere in the state budget.
“We always need to make sure everyone is fed and everyone’s home is heated,” he said. But “it’s about prioritization.”
Harding added that “it’s a very dangerous precedent to set if we basically say we as a state government are going to address every single cut that comes our way from the federal government.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_6004.jpg,,,2025-11-26 05:56:18.786224

States have gotten creative in trying to lower patients’ prescription drug copays by targeting different parts of the drug supply chain. (Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)Fruth Pharmacy, a small chain that once had more than 20 stores in southeastern Ohio and nearby towns in West Virginia and Kentucky, has announced that it is closing and selling its prescriptions to Walgreens next month.
Given Walgreens’ own financial woes, the news could add to the growing problem with pharmacy deserts in rural areas of both states. 
Lynne Fruth, president of the 73-year-old chain, has been a vocal critic of pharmacy middlemen owned by giant health conglomerates. Each is among the 15 largest corporations in the United States, and together, their middlemen control nearly 80% of prescription drug transactions.
The middlemen are called pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs. Their owners — CVS Health, UnitedHealth and Cigna-Express Scripts — have pharmacy operations of their own, and their middlemen determine how much to reimburse their competitors and affiliated pharmacies for the drugs they dispense.
That’s an obvious conflict, Fruth has maintained.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“By reimbursing pharmacies less money than a medication costs, PBMs have caused the closure of thousands of pharmacies across America,” Fruth said in a written statement that was reported by WCHS in Charleston. “The continued closings of pharmacies must be a wake up call for lawmakers to hold PBMs accountable before all pharmacies disappear.”
Andy Becker, the chain’s CEO, said that it’s been under stress from PBMs for years, but a cyberattack against a company owned by one of the conglomerates was the proximate cause of the demise of Fruth Pharmacy.
Change Healthcare, which is owned by UnitedHeath Group, handles payment and prescription processing for thousands of pharmacies. It was the victim of a ransomware attack in early 2024.
It meant that Fruth couldn’t fill any prescriptions for six days. Then it couldn’t fill electronic prescriptions for another week.
“That’s 90% of our new prescriptions that were coming in,” Becker said in an interview. “Then for another eight to 10 days, our controlled substance prescriptions weren’t coming in. We couldn’t win. If I can’t fill your prescription, you’re going to Walmart or wherever. And once somebody moves somewhere else, they’re not coming back until they get mad at Walmart or Walgreens or wherever they move. In that three or four-week period, we lost 15% of our customers.”
The Fruth closing comes after 223 other Ohio pharmacies shut their doors last year, according to the Ohio Board of Pharmacy. The number still in operation dropped below 2,000 for the first time in memory.
In addition to small chains and independent pharmacies going out of business, Rite Aid declared two bankruptcies and closed all its stores — including hundreds in Ohio and Michigan.
Pharmacy closures can be particularly hard on the poor and elderly in small communities such as Wellston, Ohio, where a Fruth store closed earlier this year. If customers’ prescriptions are transferred to the Walgreens in Jackson, that means they have to find a way to travel 10 miles each way. That”s not an easy task if you can’t drive or if you lack reliable transportation.
For many such customers, a pharmacist can be the only medical professional to whom they have ready access. A pharmacist can help them manage chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension.
Fruth is transferring prescriptions to Walgreens, which has faced troubles of its own. In March, the pharmacy chain announced that it was selling itself to Sycamore Partners, a private equity firm. Such businesses are known for aggressively cutting what they see as underperforming assets.
Unlike CVS, Walgreens doesn’t own a PBM. Such middlemen decide which drugs are covered by insurance, and they negotiate huge, non-transparent rebates in exchange for putting drugmakers’ products on their formularies. That’s a mechanism that pushes up list prices of drugs, according to the University of Southern California’s Schaeffer Center.
The conglomerates that own the big-three PBMs also own top-10 insurance companies. 
In addition, CVS owns the largest retail chain. And it, UnitedHealth and Cigna-Express Scripts own mail-order and specialty pharmacies as well. Their PBMs decide how much to reimburse their own pharmacies and those of their competitors — raising suspicions that they favor their affiliated stores.
In January, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report accusing the big PBMs of wild price hikes and possibly steering patients away from competing pharmacies.
But the term expired of the FTC chair who led the effort. Then President Donald Trump tried to remove two Democratic appointees who also supported scrutinizing PBMs.

(Photo by Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)Though still in high school, Katya Fromuth has long been involved in activism for various causes, including speaking at the No Kings protest in Portland this fall.
That was where Maine Morning Star first met the 17-year-old Yarmouth High School senior, as she weaved through the crowd handing out flyers about her youth organization that is now scheduled to have its first meeting in December. 
“Members of my generation want the ability to shape our future,” Fromuth said in an interview this month. “It’s really important to bring them together and give them hope, get them aware, get them angry, but also say, ‘Hey, we’re in this together, and we’re going to be in this together until we get the job done.’” 
Since Donald Trump was reelected, she’s been joining actions, such as those organized by her local chapter of Indivisible, a progressive organization initiated as a reaction to Trump’s first presidency. And, while she respects the work being done, when she looks around at those leading it, she sees people twice her age. 
So she decided to start The Franklin Project — named after U.S. Constitution drafter Benjamin Franklin — a network of 16 to 35-year-old Mainers united to fight authoritarianism through non-violent protests and canvassing. 
“It’s our future,” Framuth said of her and the handful of other young Mainers who have joined her effort so far. 
Framuth intends to shape that future using two distinct methods: demonstrations and one-on-one conversations. 
The project will have a human rights rapid-response team that works with local groups to stage protests, such as immigrant advocacy organizations to respond when someone in the community is mistreated by federal immigration authorities. But these won’t be typical protests with signs and chants, she said. 
While the group will eventually come up with its methods together, Framuth said she’s inspired by groups that push for change through financial pressure. One example is recent protests against Elon Musk’s role in the Trump administration through boycotts of his company Tesla and demonstrations in showrooms. The company’s stock has since plunged. 
Closer to home, Framuth is inspired by the tactics used by the group that organized against the Wells Police Department’s contract with federal immigration authorities, specifically sun-up to sun-down protests, which she thinks show determination. The police department ended its contract in October after months of objections through local protests and comments at select board meetings. 
The Franklin Project will also organize what Framuth calls the citizen’s canvass, which will involve its members knocking on doors in their communities to speak with their neighbors about their broad concerns with what’s happening to American democracy, rather than a specific issue or candidate. 
“In most cases, I’m sure they will say ‘no’ at the start,” Framuth said, “and then we will just recalibrate and figure out, ‘OK, what are the ways in which we can communicate better?’” 
When Trump began his second term in January, Framuth had been taking classes abroad through the School for Ethics and Global Leadership, a semester-long residential program for high school juniors focused on ethical thinking skills and leadership development. 
She was placed in an apartment with people of various political ideologies, as the school selects a diverse cross section of students from across the U.S. to attend, and she said that experience taught her that everyone has more in common than they think. 
“These people, who before that program I thought gotta be somewhat out of their mind, turned out to be very good friends of mine,” Framuth said. “We worked through a lot of our political differences — we are still working through those differences.” 
She’s now hoping to scale up her own personal experience through the citizen’s canvass, which she sees as an antidote to authoritarianism.  
“That’s one of the ways that an authoritarian government succeeds, is when it really divides the population,” Framuth said. “If you want to prove them wrong, then say, ‘Hey, you actually can’t divide us.’” 
The first meeting of The Franklin Project will occur at 6 p.m. on Dec. 7 in Portland at a location to be determined.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Katya_no-kings-portland-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-26 04:57:20.259765

Ohio has 24 counties without an OB-GYN, including two that border Union County — Champaign and Hardin, according to the nonpartisan nonprofit KFF, an independent source of research and information on national health issues. The data they used was from 2021.
The 24 counties without an OB-GYN according to KFF are: Adams County, Athens County, Belmont County, Carroll County, Champaign County, Fayette County, Fulton County, Hardin County, Harrison County, Hocking County, Jackson County, Meigs County, Monroe County, Morgan County, Morrow County, Noble County, Ottawa County, Paulding County, Perry County, Pike County, Putnam County, Shelby County, Vinton County, and Wyandot County. 
“We do have patients that travel 30 plus minutes from Champaign County, they either travel to us or they travel to Springfield,” Martter said, who has been an OB-GYN in Marysville for 16 years. “There’s also Hardin County, which is a maternity care desert. I have patients that travel from Kenton to see me, which is probably 45-ish minutes.”
Patients might have to take time off work to get to their appointments or might need to get a babysitter to watch their other children. A lot of times patients driving farther distances have to rely on back roads, Martter said.
“There’s no freeway,” she said. “We’re hoping that the roads are safe to travel on, that there hasn’t been an accident that puts them behind even more trying to get back to their job or their children. It does really impact them and their availability to come to us.”
Critical situations can happen during delivery. 
“You need to get to a hospital in a pretty short span of time in order to have the baby and mom still be viable, still actually surviving and being not just the baby living in the NICU,” said Maya Dunson, a second-year medical student at Ohio State University.
Those long distances can sometimes prohibit patients from getting prenatal care.
“I have a lot of patients that share a car with their partner, and they can’t always drive the 30 to 45 minutes or afford the gas money to come see us for adequate prenatal care, which obviously affects not only the mom, but the baby at that point,” Martter said. 
Despite the challenges, she enjoys practicing in a smaller town. 
“There’s something to be said about a small town … and knowing that when you go to the grocery store, you’re going to potentially see multiple patients that you’ve delivered,” she said. “I take care of entire generations of families.”
Nationally, there were 38 practicing OB-GYNs per 100,000 women in the United States and nearly half of the nation’s counties had no OB-GYNs in 2021-22, according to KFF’s data. Nearly 80% of rural counties had no OB-GYNs, according to KFF. 
“The biggest issue is obviously access,” said Ohio state Rep. Anita Somani, D-Dublin. “What happens is people don’t get care.”
Telehealth appointments increased in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the lack of bandwidth in rural areas can get in the way of telehealth appointments.
“They have dial up and so you can’t really have adequate visits with them,” Martter said.
Ohio has 13 counties that are maternity care deserts — meaning they lack hospitals with obstetric care, birth centers and obstetric providers like OB-GYNs, according to the March of Dimes.
“If you’re in one of those areas, you’re traveling anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to get care,” said Somani, who has been an OB-GYN for more than 30 years and works in Columbus. “It’s going to take a long time to rebuild and improve maternity deserts.”
The 13 counties that are maternity care deserts are Belmont County, Carroll County, Champaign County, Fayette County, Hardin County, Jackson County, Meigs County, Monroe County, Morrow County, Noble County, Perry County, Putnam County, and Vinton County. 
“The situation is only getting worse,” said Maya Neidhart, a second-year medical student at Ohio State. “There are still patients in those areas that need access to prenatal care. … Minutes do make the difference.”
Neidhart is from Meigs County and hopes to return to southeast Ohio after graduating to practice as an OB-GYN.
“It has always been my goal to be able to return to the community I’m from and serve it, but it really just depends on if I feel safe to practice in the state,” Neidhart said. “Not having access to abortion care also leads to poor maternal mortality outcomes when people terminate pregnancies in unsafe ways.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. Ohio voters passed a ballot measure in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.
Ohio has six surgical abortion clinics located in Columbus, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Bedford Heights, Cuyahoga Falls, and Dayton. Toledo’s abortion clinic switched to just a medication abortion facility in 2019.
The state had 45 abortion clinics in 1992, Somani said. 
“There’s been just a huge decrease in a lot of those clinics,” Somani said. “The bigger problem is, when you restrict abortion, you can’t train the next generation to be able to do the care that they need to.”
Dunson and Neidhart are both members of Medical Students for Choice, an international advocacy organization focused on educating medical students about reproductive health care, including abortion. They have more than 300 chapters on medical school campuses. 
“Med Students for Choice is there to make sure that medical students get the training that they need to become abortion care providers,” Neidhart said. (Abortion is) part of full spectrum obstetric and gynecology care, so it’s absolutely something that it is health care, and it’s needs to be part of the conversation when we’re talking about access to reproductive health care.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)In June 2024, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump charged on his social media platform that “much of Higher Education has lost its way, and is now corrupting our Youth and Society with, SOCIALIST, and ANTI-AMERICAN Ideology.” He vowed to remove such “wokeness” from U.S. education.
Trump has primarily targeted elite private universities in his attacks on higher education, but Kansas state universities may not escape collateral damage. For example, Kansas State University, not known to be a hotbed of “socialist and anti-American ideology,” has taken on more than its fair share of flak.
A bit of history is in order.
Upon his first day in office this past January, Trump took his first stab at terminating “wokeness” in education. He declared by executive order that the words “diversity, equity, and inclusion” were “illegal and immoral” in their application throughout the federal government, including in grants and contracts with colleges and universities. He ordered the threatening words and related practices to be banned.
A few weeks later, the national office of Young America’s Foundation filed a detailed civil rights complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, asserting: “On behalf of our YAF members at Kansas State University and all truth-seeking students on that campus, YAF requests that you open a formal investigation into Kansas State for its promotion of DEI, racialism, and gender ideology in violation of the First Amendment, civil rights laws, and President Trump’s executive orders.”
YAF, likely an organization most Kansans have never heard of, promotes itself as “the leading organization for young conservatives” and has an active chapter on the K-State campus.
In the meantime, Kansas Republican state lawmakers were considering how Trump’s demands could be applied to higher education in Kansas. They finally settled on attaching a directive to an omnibus appropriation bill with financial penalties for state universities that failed to:

Eliminate any positions that relate to DEI.
Eliminate any mandates, policies, programs, preferences and activities relating to DEI.
Eliminate any training requirements in DEI for any employee.
Cancel any state grants or contracts relating to DEI.

For good measure, state lawmakers also outlawed gender-identifying pronouns or gender ideology in email signature blocks on state email accounts and any other form of communication.
The Kansas Board of Regents provided guidance to state universities on the matter, and the universities, including K-State, dutifully complied. The forbidden words were scrubbed from their websites, program descriptions, and personnel. In some cases, potentially offending units were eliminated or consolidated, or rebranded to avoid being a target.
For the conservative students at K-State, this cleansing had not gone far enough. The K-State chapter of YAF claimed the university’s actions were a “shell game,” and there was “much work to do.”
Then, in early September, former Gov. Jeff Colyer, now a gubernatorial candidate, saw an opportunity to score political points with Trump’s MAGA base by calling for the firing of a “far-left extremist” on K-State’s staff. Colyer issued a formal campaign statement, asserting: “Kansas State University has made a serious mistake hiring far-left extremist Derron Borders into its Office of Civil Rights.” According to press reports, K-State suspended Borders.
Next, days after the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, Colyer found another opportunity to target K-State. He posted on social media a video in which Kirk called out K-State as “the worst” university in the country for infringing his free speech. The video reminded followers of an incident one year earlier in which university officials had cut Kirk’s microphone during his “You’re Being Brainwashed Tour” to the campus. In fact, Kirk had arrived late and spoke for an hour but had exceeded university time limits for blasting loud speakers in the student plaza during class time.
Colyer promised that if he were elected governor, students at state universities would be protected from “woke overlords” that seek to silence them.
Then, a couple weeks ago, state Senate Majority Leader Chase Blasi claimed that state lawmakers were hearing complaints from parents of K-State students. According to Blasi, “some of the universities are rebranding these programs to do the same things that the Legislature has explicitly prohibited.” State lawmakers are now investigating course syllabi in selected academic units at K-State and other universities.
Does the banning of forbidden words mean that our state universities will now be committed to becoming less diverse, less equitable, and less inclusive? I doubt that. I doubt further that most Kansans want state universities characterized by homogeneity, inequity, and exclusiveness. Our state universities have long histories as powerful equalizing forces in American life, and I expect that to continue.
With experience as a student, alum, faculty member, and administrator at three state universities in Kansas over a period of 50 years, I do not believe one would find much “wokeness” in our state universities. Nor are those universities corrupting students with socialism, nor with anti-American ideas, nor with left-wing or right-wing ideologies.
K-State’s experience this past year provides a cautionary tale for all state universities in this Trump era. I forewarn my faculty colleagues that they are ripe targets for agents near and far if they wander outside their respective disciplines into this political quagmire. University officials should remain agile, diffuse incidents that arise, and protect their faculty and staff. And the Kansas Board of Regents should continue its strong defense of academic freedom.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)Every Thanksgiving there is a brief (underscored) kumbaya moment in my household before everyone digs into the traditional spread. We join hands to acknowledge the benevolence and beseech the blessings of the Almighty. 
In recent years, I started tacking on an addendum to our prayer, a petition for divine intervention to save the country we love. 
Sure, my one-more-thing entreaty has irked some in the motley crew gathered, but it has become ever more pertinent as America stares into the abyss. 
Even the most apathetic among us know something is deeply wrong in the nation we pledge allegiance to from an early age. 
People are noticeably on edge, worried, broke. 
Sticker shock at the grocery store has blown a gaping hole in monthly budgets. Rent increases are ridiculous. Electric bills have spiked. 
Paychecks do not keep up with inflation. Wages are down for Ohio’s most common occupations.  
It is impossible for many to get ahead in a state that ranks 18th in the country for financial hardship. 
To make things worse, Trump’s erratic tariffs are raising prices for Ohio consumers and businesses. 
Commerce has slowed. The labor market has softened. Company layoffs surged to a two-decade high in October across the country. 
Pessimism is only growing about the state of the economy. Agriculture, Ohio’s largest industry, has been bankrupted by the trade war Trump started. 
It has left Ohio farmers, who depend on foreign market demand, in the red.  
The promised “golden age” from the convicted felon rings hollow for family farms going under. 
It also rings hollow for low-income MAGA faithful left adrift with shredded safety nets after food stamp and Medicaid funding was slashed by hundreds of billions to offset trillions in Trump tax cuts to the ultra-rich.

Working class Trump supporters, who augment their meager take-home pay with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to buy groceries, got a rude awakening recently when their hero callously let SNAP benefits lapse for the first time in the program’s history. 
Food aid for the poorest Ohioans was delayed in the longest government shutdown on the books while the Republican-controlled U.S. House left town, the Republican-controlled  Senate killed time, and the Republican president preoccupied himself with destroying the East Wing of the White House to build a glitzy ballroom as families went hungry. 
Trump fixated on his marble remake of the bathroom off the Lincoln bedroom as more than half a million Ohioans feared being priced out of affordable health insurance if cost-saving subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans were not extended. 
But Trump wants to scrap Obamacare altogether and Republican majorities in Congress prefer padding the portfolios of the wealthy to helping constituents who could lose health coverage when the ACA subsidies expire at the end of December. 
Meanwhile, when the convicted felon isn’t consumed with garish vanity projects and pocketing $1.8 billion in cash and gifts since his 2024 reelection, he is bent on militarizing U.S. cities with boots on the ground. 
Ohio National Guard troops, deployed on nebulous grounds to Washington D.C. in August by a spineless governor, have (inexplicably) had their landscaping and trash removal deployment extended by Mike DeWine until the end of February. 
Simultaneously, Trump is presiding over aide Stephen Miller’s unspeakably cruel (and unconstitutional) campaign to brutally terrorize largely law-abiding undocumented and documented citizens with masked goons operating without constraint (or warrants) as the regime’s secret, unaccountable police on a mission to fill deportation quotas with brown people who speak Spanish.
As a child sex-trafficking scandal involving Trump’s longtime wingman inches closer to the adjudicated sexual abuser dozing behind the Resolute desk, Trump is throwing whatever distraction sticks to the wall. 
He’s siccing the Justice Department on political opponents, calling for the execution of congressional Democrats, conducting extrajudicial killings of alleged drug smugglers with blown up fishing boats in the Caribbean, threatening an unprovoked attack on a sovereign country (Venezuela) with a massive military build-up off its coast, and rewarding Russia for invading Ukraine.
It’s a lot. 
Trump and his sinister Project 2025 architects are moving with all deliberate speed to establish tyrannical rule in America 250 years after Americans fought to the death for freedom from absolute power. 
They fortified themselves with the armor of inalienable rights that were non-negotiable. 
It was a lot. World-changing. But somehow, enough colonists summoned the courage of their convictions to live free and wrested independence from a despotic monarchy. 
They risked much to secure “the Blessings of Liberty” for themselves and their posterity. Until now.
This imperfect union, founded on the intrinsic worth of every human being and rooted in ideals from self-determination to equal protection under the law is hanging by a thread in 2025. 
But somehow, those lucky enough to inherit what past generations died to preserve have summoned the courage to push back, to mass protest, to litigate injustice, to hold power to account, to resign on principle, to decry vindictive prosecutions, sadistic ICE indignities, denied due process, threats against judges, election workers, the press. 
They often risk much to stand up. But their fearlessness inspires others to follow and secure “the Blessings of Liberty” for Americans not yet born. 
At least that’s what I pray for this Thanksgiving and always.

Currently, GAs are fighting to protect academic freedom in their workplace, as the Graduate Employee Union (GEU-UAW) continues bargaining its contract with the university.
In labs and classrooms, graduate student employees teach undergraduates, run experiments, conduct surveys, and generate much of the scholarship credited to UConn. They are not casual “students” on the sidelines living by the motto of “C’s get degrees.” They are employees who keep UConn’s research and teaching enterprise running. As dedicated researchers, curious scholars, and paid employees, GAs perform essential research, writing, and teaching labor that faculty, given other commitments and time constraints, cannot shoulder on their own.
Although UConn’s Graduate School does not yet have its own academic freedom policy, the UConn Law School approved its own Policy on Employee Academic Freedom and Freedom of Expression in May 2025. The law school’s academic freedom policy makes clear that protections apply to every law school employee, “without regard to their status” — i.e., tenured or adjunct, student-worker or professor. Indeed, the law school’s policy explicitly extends to student-workers in their capacity as employees. The policy states that, to serve its “mission,” the law school “should not insulate students from ideas because they may find them controversial, offensive, or disagreeable.”
On the basis of this policy alone — one that resembles the very same language proposed by the GEU-UAW, and one that has been approved within the very same university — it makes no sense for the university to deny graduate student employees either the same freedom to teach and discover that it grants to full professors or the same protections that it affords a select group of student-workers in the law school.
In effect, the GEU’s proposed Article XX on academic freedom would write into the existing contract what the law school’s policy — and both the U.S. Constitution and state law — already imply. That is, graduate student researchers and instructors deserve the same freedom in teaching and research as anyone else on campus. Crucially, for graduate student employees, academic freedom is not merely an intellectual value — it is a workplace protection that ensures research and teaching are governed by scholarly judgment rather than managerial preference.
Academic freedom in the classroom and in the law
Academic freedom means that students, professors, instructors, and researchers can pursue and discuss ideas freely and in the open — even controversial ideas. High courts have long held that students enjoy this right. For instance, the U.S. Supreme Court famously ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) that students may wear anti-war armbands because “[i]t can hardly be argued that either students or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”
By the same token, a UConn graduate assistant, professor, or student should be able to investigate or speak up about any relevant topic in class or research. As both John Stuart Mill’s ‘Harm Principle’ and decades of free speech case law make clear, limits on open thought and discussion in a democratic society should kick in only when the speech in question threatens a material disruption to the educational environment, or incites violence and causes direct harm.
What this means in a democracy is that speech, expression, and inquiry cannot be curtailed because they might merely provoke discomfort or disagreement. As Justice Fortas wrote for the Court in Tinker, “Any variation from the majority’s opinion may inspire fear. Any word spoken, in class, in the lunchroom, or on the campus, that deviates from the views of another person may start an argument or cause a disturbance.” Nonetheless, this potential for contention does not constitute grounds for suppression.
We can (and universities have) set reasonable rules, such as requiring classes to end on time or banning in-class interruptions. However, another important point emerges: any restriction must be viewpoint-neutral. In constitutional terms, “time, place, and manner” regulations on political speech must be content-neutral and narrowly tailored. The law school’s policy reflects these constitutional principles, making a public commitment to “protecting the rights [of employees] as provided by law.”
Beyond the U.S. Constitution, the law school’s academic freedom policy notes its compliance with Article 1 Section 4 of the Connecticut Constitution: “Every citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.” It also cites Connecticut General Statute Section 31-51g,[6] which both protects employees from retaliation for exercising their federal and state constitutional rights to free speech. It further notes that its rules comply with articles XIV and XV of UConn’s by-laws, which contain the university’s provisions on “academic freedom for faculty and professional staff” and “the expression of dissent” (as described in the law school’s policy).
Academic freedom: a policy and a principle
The Graduate Employees Union’s proposed Article XX on academic freedom would write into the contract what UConn’s mission already implies: that every scholar can teach, research, and speak freely. The GEUs proposed language states that GAs may “present and discuss all relevant matters in and beyond the classroom” and “speak or write without any censorship, threat, restraint, or discipline by the University” in the performance of their duties. It similarly affirms GAs’ right to openly express themselves on any issue, including university policy or governance.
What does this mean? It means, per the proposed language in Article XX, that graduate instructors could cover any course-relevant topic or pursue any line of research without fear that unpopular conclusions will lead to lost funding. Instead, controversial questions would be fair game for study and debate. Graduate students could write articles, testify in public forums, or post on social media about social or political issues without fear of retaliation by the institution.
In a serious R1, scholars should not worry that open-ended inquiry will jeopardize their degrees or appointments. As Albert Einstein said, “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence… Never lose a holy curiosity.” Indeed, as one learns from the famous philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, science is supposed to be disruptive, perhaps even revolutionary.
The UConn Law School’s academic freedom policy evidently echoes this sentiment in its commitment that the university “should not insulate students from ideas because they may find them controversial, offensive, or disagreeable.” But it is not enough for these principles to sit on paper. They need clear, enforceable language in our agreements and in our relationships so that existing policies carry real weight in practice.
So where do we go from here? The answer: “shared governance.” This is the answer put forward in a CT Mirror op-ed authored by Political Science Professors Jeffrey Dudas and Jeremy Pressman. Dr. Dudas is the current president of UConn’s American Association of University Professors (AAUP) chapter, while Dr. Pressman serves on the chapter’s executive committee.
GAs are not asking for much in the proposed language of Article XX. They are simply asking to be met and heard in good faith during this bargaining process and in future negotiations. These are not radical demands; they restate the core principles of academic freedom, open discussion, and transparency in public institutions. UConn’s own by-laws, state law, and the First Amendment already underwrite these guarantees. Writing them into the union contract would affirm that UConn genuinely values free inquiry at every level of the university.
Upholding UConn’s public mission
Academic freedom, open debate and discussion, access to information, and spaces for contestation and experimentation are not luxuries. They are the vital organs of higher education, if not of democratic society at large. A public university that disciplines scholars for inconvenient truths or compels instructors to sanitize their syllabi abandons its fundamental commitments to dialogue, learning, and the common good.
UConn’s reputation depends on independence from partisan influence, a willingness to innovate by taking intellectual risks, and a steadfast commitment to truth even when it is uncomfortable. Attempting to polish its image or placate critics through brand management is, as a philosopher might say, a preoccupation with form over substance. Put differently, no amount of messaging, fed hand-to-mouth from consultants to administrators, can ever substitute for the real work of protecting free inquiry, open discussion, and the people who carry them out.
GAs following UConn’s values by speaking clearly, honestly, and frankly in class or as a private citizen deserve the same protection as any full professor. For example, a teaching assistant in an American politics course should not fear discipline for answering a student’s question about gerrymandering, immigration policy, or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to the best of their knowledge and ability. When even one instructor — from a senior professor to a first-year TA — is chilled or pushed out for doing their job, the intellectual life of the entire campus diminishes. And when such pressures accumulate, the prognosis is clear: the fall of academic freedom leads to an intellectual anemia that weakens the entire institution.
If UConn truly values its position as the state’s flagship public research university and its central role in shaping Connecticut’s future professionals and leaders, then it must do more than count publications or measure productivity by the spreadsheet. As Professors Jeffrey Dudas and Jeremy Pressman remind readers, the university must begin listening to the academic departments, faculty, and student-employees, who are “the beating hearts of the UConn community.” That means supporting fair pay, due process, and unequivocal academic freedom for graduate employees. Graduate employees are not asking for perks. They are asking for parity with existing university policy and with the values UConn professes publicly.
At the end of the day, defending academic freedom is defending democracy. UConn must be a marketplace of ideas, not a walled garden for the ivory tower. Granting GAs the protections in Article XX is not a labor concession. It reaffirms, as Justice Oliver Wendall Holmes said, that “the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas.” That is a lesson worth teaching every student.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It’s a done deal.
The Prince George’s County Democratic Central Committee chose Del. Kevin Harris (D-Charles and Prince George’s) on Tuesday night to fill the District 47 Senate seat vacated this month by Michael Jackson, who is now the State Police superintendent.
Tbe Democratic Central Committee in neighboring Charles County also selected Harris last Saturday. The Calvert County Democratic Central Committee is still set to meet Saturday for the seat, which includes parts of all three counties, but with two counties already in Harris’ corner, Calvert cannot change the outcome.
Once a majority of county central committees have decided on a candidate, that one name needs to be forwarded to the governor’s office, according to an Oct. 21 letter from Attorney General’s office that summarized the process.
Of the 26 Prince George’s committee members, 16 chose Harris and the remaining 10 nominated Del. Jeffrie Long Jr. (D-Calvert and Prince George’s). Attorney Jason Fowler of Calvert County received no votes Tuesday.

“We have three great candidates. Greatly appreciate all the people who came out in the rain,” Harris said after the vote. “Always remember we’re still one community … [and] still going to work together as one team, no matter what.”
Harris had two major supporters who spoke on his behalf: Jackson, the former senator, and Prince George’s County Executive Aisha Braveboy (D).
“I know that we need a leader who can be effective in Annapolis, and I know that Del. Harris is that leader,” Braveboy said. “He’s a good person. He’s a great leader, and he knows how to bring people together.”
Tuesday’s more than one-hour public hearing in Prince George’s included a break while the committee checked on whether Fowler’s paperwork had been received on time. It had and he was able to participate.
All three candidates answered eight questions that included opinions on data centers, strategies to help Marylanders who lost their jobs and benefits due to Trump administration policies and how would they balance the needs of a district with three counties that each govern differently. The candidates were interviewed one at a time while the other two were out of the room, so they could not hear each other’s answers.
All three said they would support continued funding for the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reform plan.
In terms of immediate priorities, each candidate offered a different answer.
Fowler, who has experience in tax law, said he would figure out how to decrease a nearly $1.5 billion deficit state lawmakers are expected to face in next year’s budget.

“How do we derive tax revenue, and how do we do it the most efficient way?” he asked. “That’s some experience that I can bring to the table, and I believe that that’s what we need.”
Harris said he would continue to focus on education and economic development. He highlighted his work on the state’s Promise Scholarship, which is for eligible high school graduates, or those who earned a GED, to attend a community college.
“I believe when folks get certifications, they can actually get in the workforce on day one,” he said. “You still go back and finish your degree, or at least you have in some cases, a full-time job [and] be able to support your family and still go to school.”
Long said he would work to unite the entire legislative district, and to secure investment in rapid transit for Southern Maryland. He also said he would work to diversify “our income tax base to ensure that we can give our seniors that break that they so rightfully deserve.”
Once Gov. Wes Moore (D) receives a nominee’s name, he has up to 15 days to officially appoint him to represent District 27 in the state Senate.
With Harris appearing to get the nomination, his District 27A House seat, which represents parts of Prince George’s and Charles counties, would become vacant.  That means the Democratic Central Committees in those counties will need to meet again soon to nominate someone to fill Harris’ District 27A seat.
The General Assembly convenes for next year’s 90-day session Jan. 14.

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore’s new district court building has been open since last month, but a ribbon-cutting Tuesday was for more than just the building – it was to mark its new name, for the first Black woman to ever serve on any bench in the Maryland.
State officials and family members were on hand to rename district courthouse to honor the legacy of the late Judge Mabel Houze Hubbard. John Hubbard, son of the trailblazing judge, said he was “elated” that his mother’s memory and legacy would be honored with the building’s name change.
“She wanted everybody to have a fair chance and to really feel like they were heard,” he said. “I think people really remembered her and she stuck with people because of the way she made them feel … I can understand why people really, really appreciated her.”
The new courthouse, located at 500 Calvert Street, opened for public use in mid-October. After a push from district court judges to have it named after Hubbard and her legacy, state officials approved the name change later that month.
A newly opened district courthouse in Baltimore was renamed to Mabel H. Hubbard District Courthouse, honoring the first Black woman to be appointed to any bench in Maryland
Lt. Gov. Aruna Miller (D), on hand for Tuesday’s ribbon-cutting event, said the new courthouse represents a “safer, modern, more accessible system of justice for Baltimore.”
“The fight for justice … takes on an even deeper meaning when people who were once denied access to justice, equality and opportunity rise to the highest levels of the system itself – as Judge Mabel H. Hubbard did,” Miller said.
“She was a barrier breaker and a history maker … at a time when people who looked like her walked into courtrooms only to be told, in ways spoken and unspoken, that they didn’t belong,” Miller said.
Born in Detroit in 1936, Hubbard first worked as an English teacher and administrator in Pennsylvania before receiving her Juris Doctorate degree at the University of Maryland School of Law in 1975, according to state documents.
In 1978, she was appointed as a master-in-chancery for the Supreme Bench for Baltimore City, what is now called the Baltimore City Circuit Court, marking her as the first Black woman to be appointed to a bench in Maryland.
District Court Administrative Judge Geoffrey Hengerer said that Hubbard brought “style and perspective” to District 1, donning bright red lipstick and bright red glasses and using humorous turns-of-phrase in the courtroom that became known as “Hubbard-isms.”
“But ultimately, Judge Hubbard had a calm, deliberate demeanor that resonated,” Hengerer said at the ribbon-cutting.
In her career, Hubbard served on both the District Court and the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, retiring from the latter in 1999. During that time, she was also known for mentoring other Black woman attorneys.

The new five-story 168,000-square-foot courthouse houses eight courtrooms, a detention area and multiple state and local agencies, among other features.
General Services Secretary Atif Chaudhry said the facility was a “huge achievement” for the state in both construction and in adhering to energy and carbon neutrality goals.
“We accomplished something really remarkable here in this facility, without acquiring additional land or disturbing the surrounding community,” Chaudhry said. “We took an old state building which was at the end of its useful life … and pulled it back to its steel frame. We then built it back up stronger, safer. More efficient and more accessible.”
The facility’s name change was approved by the Board of Public Works in October, when the facility was only known as the New Baltimore City District Court.
During that meeting, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said the name change would honor Hubbard’s “service … her leadership, and her commitment to the people that that court will serve for generations to come.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_november25_hubbardcourt_ribboncutting_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-26 03:56:54.161759

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)It’s the not-so-giving season for a group of climate advocates who are losing faith with the Moore administration’s promises to promote clean-energy policies, and they demonstrated their displeasure Tuesday by sending Gov. Wes Moore a “Thanks … for nothing” card.
“We were thinking about what we wanted to thank this governor for,” said Jorge Aguilar with the group Food and Water Watch, as he held the snarky greeting card outside the Department of the Environment in Baltimore. “Our membership could not think of many things, because we think he has not delivered on many of his promises.”
Aguilar and 10 other advocates walked over from a nearby park with the large card in hand to deliver it to the environment department, where they were greeted by the department’s chief of staff, Scott Goldman.
Aguilar handed Goldman the card, walking him through the group’s many criticisms of the Moore administration. Those concerns largely centered around what the advocates see as a lack of follow-through on Moore’s energy platform that he campaigned on. They also worry Moore has backed policies that actively backtrack on clean-energy efforts.
Advocates with Food and Water Watch gathered in Carroll Park before walking over to the Department of the Environment. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).
“He signed the Next Generation Energy Act, which is going to promote new gas plants and new power plans,” Aguilar told Goldman. “This is after he promised to reach 100% clean energy by 2035. Instead, we’re going in a different direction.”
Aguilar said Moore has been “promoting data centers” which will “demand a lot of energy and a lot of water” at the expense of Maryland residents. He also pointed to the governor’s veto of a bill that would have studied the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland.
“So our hope is that in 2026, the administration rights these wrongs and does better for Maryland,” Aguilar said. “We’re here really to deliver the message that we’re pretty upset.”
Aguilar said there’s “a lot of good stuff” happening at the department, but the advocates lay the blame on Moore for “not showing leadership” in his climate policies.
Goldman respectfully listened to the group’s concerns and accepted the card.
“I will take this in, and thank you for doing all this, being out in the rain,” Goldman told the advocates. “I know we all want the same thing, I know the governor does as well.”
The Other Kevin Anderson
Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday tapped Kevin Anderson to be the new delegate from Lower Shore District 38A.
For those scratching their heads about now, we’re not talking about the Kevin Anderson who served as Maryland secretary of Commerce until January and still works in the administration. This is Howard “Kevin” Anderson, a Somerset County Republican who is the third generation to run the family farm and seed business.
Anderson fills the seat left empty by the sudden death last month of Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) who had just filed to seek election to a fifth term when he died.

Anderson was one of five candidates from the district, which includes Somerset County, southern Worcester County and a bit of Wicomico County south of Salisbury. He was chosen by the three counties’ Republican Central Committees earlier this month and forwarded to Moore.
In making the announcement, Moore called Anderson “a son of the Eastern Shore, with deep roots in Somerset County and a lifelong commitment to growing Maryland’s agricultural sector.”
“He understands the needs of his community firsthand, and I am confident that he will serve his constituents with dedication and distinction,” Moore said in a statement. “I look forward to working in partnership with Kevin to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.”
Anderson owns and operates Wimberly Farms in Somerset County, growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley together with his father, wife, and two daughters, according to the announcement from the governor’s office. It said Anderson and his father also operate a seed conditioning facility where they clean, treat and bag soybean, wheat, and barley seeds, the third generation to do so.
He earned the National Young Farmer Achievement Award in 2002 from the American Farm Bureau Federation, and was named a National Outstanding Young Farmer by the Outstanding Farmers of America in 2007.
Anderson sits on the Maryland Grain Producers board of directors, and serves as vice president of the Maryland Crop Association, in addition to serving on various statewide boards, local civic clubs, and organizations to promote the seed industry.

Braveboy names Okoye to planning board
Prince George’s County businessman Billy Okoye was sworn in last week as the newest member of the Prince George’s County Planning Board of The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, succeeding Dorothy Bailey, the former vice chair of the board.
Okoye, who was appointed by County Executive Aisha Braveboy and confirmed by the County Council, joined his first board meeting last week.
“His experience in business, community advocacy, real estate, and technology will offer a new dynamic to our forward-thinking Planning Board and award-winning agency,” said Prince George’s County Planning Board Chairman Darryl Barnes.
Okoye, who has real estate broker’s licenses in Maryland and the District of Columbia, was founder and principal broker of Sold 100 Real Estate Inc., according to a planning board press release, as well as group managing director of BMO General Contractors. He serves as chairman of the United African Advisory Board which works to strengthen community engagement and representation under Braveboy’s office.
“My professional journey has given me a practical ground-level understanding of our County’s vision for growth as outlined in the 2035 plan – the guiding framework for sustainable and equitable development across communities,” Okoye said in a statement. “I look forward to our collaborative work to revitalize the inner-Beltway neighborhoods into vibrant, transit-oriented economic hubs that attract jobs and opportunities.”
The five-member Prince George’s County Planning Board oversees planning and zoning in the county, as well as administering the county’s public recreation program. Together with the Montgomery County Planning Board, the two bodies operate as the Maryland-National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which oversees land use, planning, zoning, and parks and recreation in the suburban Washington counties.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)As he argued in Baltimore’s federal courthouse Tuesday, attorney Harris Eisenstein pulled a bright orange hunting vest from his bag and hoisted it into the air.
“This is all that it takes,” he said.
If power line surveyors from PSEG Renewable Transmission simply don the fluorescent orange and pink that hunters are well accustomed to, they won’t face any real danger completing environmental inspections in rural Maryland during hunting season, Eisenstein said.
PSEG, the company behind the Maryland Piedmont Reliability Project, a 67-mile transmission line planned through Baltimore, Carroll and Frederick counties, doesn’t think it’s quite so simple.
Surveyors for the proposed line could be crouched in the underbrush, rummaging about, making them difficult for hunters to see, even if they wore bright colors, said Kurt Fischer, an attorney representing PSEG.
The company is asking U.S. District Judge Adam B. Abelson to prevent landowners from hunting, or allowing hunting, on their property on any days when PSEG has indicated that it plans to come and survey — unless they contact the power company to request permission.
The landowners, who number in the hundreds, oppose any court-ordered hunting ban, “even for a minute,” Eisenstein said.
“They are creating a recipe for a tragedy,” Fischer said.
Abelson declined to rule immediately after Tuesday’s hearing, but acknowledged arguments on both sides: The surveyors have a right to enter private property to conduct their inspections, as required by the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, he said, but landowners have a right to hunt on their own land during the proper season.
US marshals won’t be used for protection during Maryland power line surveys — for now

“What we have are competing rights,” Abelson said Tuesday. “I’m trying to put these competing rights together and find a reasonable solution.”
Attorneys representing several hundred landowners proposed that PSEG give 72 hours notice of survey activities during any Maryland hunting season, and provide specific details about their activities so hunters can prepare for their arrival. That, in addition to requiring that surveyors wear the bright-colored gear.
The two sides were in the same courtroom in May, when the power company and the landowners sparred over whether the court could require property owners to allow the surveys over their objections.
Abelson concluded in June that PSEG has the authority to complete the surveys, which will ultimately inform the Maryland Public Service Commission’s decision whether or not to allow construction on the power line to begin. The landowners have appealed his ruling to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
On Tuesday, Abelson gave PSEG that same authority over a third group of landowners, over protests from their attorneys, who said new information has emerged since Abelson’s June ruling, calling into question the urgency of the power company’s requests for land access.
Namely, the PSC issued a procedural schedule in September saying it will not make a final decision on the power line until February 2027, at the earliest. PSEG had said it needed surveying authority to meet a deadline from power system regulators to have the line in service by June 1, 2027.
“Their … application is stuck in the mud no matter what happens in this case,” Eisenstein said.
Despite the new PSC schedule, power company attorney Emily Wilson said time “very much remains of the essence here,” citing a letter from regional electric grid operator PJM Interconnection that calls for the line to be placed in service as soon as possible to avoid possibile grid failures.
Review for Piedmont power line will take until at least February 2027, Maryland regulators say

Eisenstein also argued that PSEG will need to conduct geotechnical boring surveys, but Maryland law does not allow it to compel that more invasive surveying, making it unlikely the company can meet its obligations.
Wilson argued that the Maryland Power Plant Research Program could determine that the geotechnical surveys are not necessary. Whether they are or not, it doesn’t change the fact that state law is on PSEG’s side with regard to property access, she said.
“What this case is focused on is the land access,” she said. “They do not have a right to exclude the company in this way.”
David Wyand, another attorney for the landowners, argued that the legislature only gave eminent domain powers to companies that have already been granted permission to construct their line. Technically, a state government entity, such as the Maryland Power Plant Research Program, could conduct the surveys, Wyand said, but PSEG can’t — as a private company.
“The General Assembly has specifically not said that PSEG has that right,” Wyand said.
But Abelson said that none of the new information changed his mind that PSEG should be able to collect its survey data, unimpeded by the landowners who disagree.
It’s unclear whether landowners will sway Abelson on the hunting issue, which they argue is urgent. Maryand’s firearm season for white-tailed deer, for instance, begins Saturday, and runs until Dec. 13.
Matt Moran, an Adamstown landowner in the path of the power line, said after Tuesday’s hearing that he recently received a notice from PSEG advising him that it plans to survey in the weeks ahead. If Abelson rules that landowners cannot hunt on any day when PSEG might  survey, Moran said he would only have one day open to hunt.










They are out-of-state. And they are out of touch.

“That leaves me with one day to go out and get the venison that I need to feed my family, because I rely on venison to feed my family,” Moran said. “If you look in the freezer at my home, you’ll see that there’s more venison than there is beef, pork, chicken and fish combined.”
Attorneys for the landowners argued that hunting is not just a valued pastime for many rural Marylanders, but a relied-upon method for gathering food and reducing the number of animals that eat their crops.
“They are out-of-state,” Eisenstein said of New Jersey-based PSEG. “And they are out of touch.”
Eisenstein said PSEG’s practice of sending one notice to warn landowners about “multiple weeks” of surveying, even though actual surveys may only occur on particular days, “cloud” landowners’ lives. PSEG’s proposed hunting order could restrict the activity for weeks at a time, infringing on hunters’ rights, Eisenstein said.
PSEG’s attorneys argued that the company routinely coordinates with landowners who call with concerns about specific days, and that the company would “ideally” be able to come to agreement with landowners regarding hunting days.
But not all landowners are willing to work with PSEG. Some will not even correspond with the company, Wilson said. On at least one occasion, a landowner referenced hunting season in a Facebook post that PSEG perceived as a threat.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“We need that protection in place to protect our surveyors and their assistants,” Wilson said, “so that a really unfortunate accident does not occur.”
Wilson argued that Abelson needs to universally bar hunting during the survey work, and allow exceptions for particular properties. Eisenstein countered that hunting bans should be the exception — not the rule.
Nancy Gardetto, owner of Copper Penny Farm in Adamstown, said she, her husband and their two children are eagerly awaiting Saturday’s opening of deer season, which they also use to stock their freezers with venison, and cut down on the deer population to protect crops.
Gardetto also got a surveying notice from PSEG overlapping with the weeks of the hunt. She said she called PSEG to advise the company that it should not survey her property during that period because there would be hunting, and she feels the company should oblige. She made sure to emphasize that she was not making a threat, she said.
“They claim to have great coordination with all the property owners,” Gardetto said. “If that’s the case, I don’t understand why we need to ask permission to hunt our own farmland. I don’t understand why they can’t contact us and say: ‘Hey, we’ve got guys coming out tomorrow. Is anybody going to be there hunting?’”
“I don’t know why we had to be dragged into court to be forced into this,” Gardetto said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9664-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 22:56:40.832612

In a time of limited resources and inequitable access, maybe we should try, writes Kalman Hettleman. But he also says that, despite challenges, now is not the time to abandon GTE, but to reform it.","Gifted and talented education is essential, but also divisive, writes Kalman Hettleman, who says the programs need to be reformed in the name of equity and resource allocation. (Photo by Christopher Furlong/Getty Images)What could be wrong with public schools providing instruction tailored to fulfill the potential of “gifted and talented” students (GTE)? Our nation has a vital interest in gifted and talented citizens and workers.
The National Association for Gifted Children states that education for gifted and talented students must move students “at an educational pace matching their abilities and readiness for advanced curriculum rather than restricting them to a set of grade-level standards based on their age.”
That’s the persuasive case for more GTE. Nonetheless, the New York Times reports that GTE is “one of the most volatile issues in public education.” A leading analyst finds that “there is no issue in American education that is more fraught.”
Why is GTE so controversial? Why, despite strong support from parents and vigorous national and state advocacy movements, is progress lagging?
There are two huge obstacles. One is cost. The second is even more fundamental: It’s widespread criticism that GTE is inequitable and elitist; only a small percentage of students found eligible are Black, Latino or poor.
That makes it a political hot potato. Identification is pivotal, and requirements are being revised to replace subjective parent and teacher referrals with, as stated in Maryland’s model, “universal screening … and multiple indicators of potential.”

One dilemma is finding the right age for identification. A recent journal article concludes that giftedness is mobile: It can be influenced by nature or nurture. Policies vary. Maryland requires identification “as early as possible, but no later than Grade 3.”
Beyond identification, the lack of earmarked federal and state funds for GTE is a major barrier. The uncomfortable policy question is: Given very scarce funding for public schools, what priority should GTE get?
When I was a member of the Baltimore City school board in the early 2000s, there was an 8-1 vote to reallocate funds to gifted and talented students. I was the lone dissenter. I reasoned that – because city schools were extraordinarily underfunded and the overwhelming majority of students, predominantly Black and poor, weren’t coming close to meeting reading and math standards, we couldn’t afford the reallocation.
I think back on my vote uneasily. Highest priorities can’t be exclusive priorities. A balance must be struck between extra instruction for low-performing students and other valuable school programs, from art and music to career and technical education to GTE, and so on.
The leading national proponent of GTE is the Fordham Institute education think tank. Its president, Michael Petrilli (a policy star), has written  “How can we depolarize ‘gifted education’?” He points out the U.S. not only trails other countries in basic reading and math proficiency; we are far behind in “advanced” achievement. And his chief recommendations parallel the Maryland model.
But what’s actually happening on the ground? Data is limited but each local district does pretty much its own thing, subject to state guidance on best practices. Among the practices:  professional learning, enriched instruction, grouping, co-teaching, GTE specialists and self-contained classes.
A Hechinger Report in 2021 stated that Maryland’s 16% participation rate in GTE is highest in the nation. Still, Maryland reports that children living in poverty are the most underrepresented group in gifted and talented programs. Even the most committed GTE educators and advocates agree there’s a long way to go.
So now, should we come down on the side of more or less GTE? In a more moral nation, the problem would go away. There would be enough money to provide all students – from low-performing to gifted and talented – with an adequate, equitable education.
Of course that’s a cop-out. In the real world, the inescapable issue is whether the equity issues are so knotty that GTE, as some critics argue, should be abandoned altogether. I don’t think so.
Instead, even without more funding, GTE can be improved in various ways. For example, more data and evaluation of what’s working best. Another is to target scant money to what are called “talent development programs“ that seek to expand the number and racial balance of students qualifying for GTE.
Still, in the near future, I can’t support more funding because of the multiple competing needs. Advocates must, in the midst of the state’s fiscal crisis, set limited priorities.
For now, sorry to say, the best we can do is forcefully advocate for brighter prospects in the years ahead.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-52077072-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-11-26 08:58:48.208505

Richard Blumenthal sees a “flagrant abuse” of norms and traditions throughout President Donald Trump’s first year back in the White House, the Connecticut Democrat said during an appearance on The Connecticut Mirror’s “In The Room” series.
Appearing Tuesday night from West Hartford Town Hall with host John Dankosky, Blumenthal was peppered with questions about the temporary hold on federal nutrition assistance, Trump’s recent threat to Democratic members of Congress and the dismissal of criminal indictments of officials who have clashed with the president.
As he answered each of these questions, Blumenthal essentially started with a caveat about how he views the administration.
“We are living with an administration that is cruel and stupid in a lot of what it does,” Blumenthal said when discussing the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s unprecedented hold on SNAP benefits during the government shutdown.
The hour-long conversation delved into familiar themes and issues that Blumenthal has waded into in recent months, including his concerns of politically motivated prosecutions and investigations. 
The three-term Democratic senator questioned U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi at a Senate hearing last month about any conversations she may have had with Trump regarding the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. That line of inquiry landed him in hot water with Trump, who issued a threat of an investigation into the senator over a past characterization of his military service.
On Monday, criminal indictments of Comey as well as of New York Attorney General Letitia James were dismissed as the judge found that Trump’s appointment of the interim prosecutor was unlawful.
Blumenthal, who formerly served as Connecticut’s attorney general, said that other than the Watergate scandal during the Nixon administration, there has generally been a tradition to keep the Justice Department independent from the White House.
“What we’re seeing is the most kind of flagrant abuse of that tradition and norm. Theoretically, the president could say and he has said ‘go after so and so’ regardless of the evidence, but here’s what happens: The cases are dismissed,” Blumenthal said, referring to the dismissals this week of the Comey and James cases.
He has proposed various bills as a counter, including one aimed at preventing political prosecutions that “would essentially prohibit these kinds of contacts between the White House directing the Justice Department.”
But Democrats have little recourse as the minority party in both chambers of Congress. And Blumenthal was candid about the likely fate of some of that legislation.
“I’m very clear there is not a chance that we’re going to have this legislation adopted any more than my legislation on the Insurrection Act that would prohibit the use of military troops against American citizens without some congressional review,” he said. “There are a lot of measures where guardrails and safeguards should be imposed that we will not see in this administration.”
Blumenthal also aired concerns about the start of investigations into some of the members of Congress who posted a video addressing U.S. service members and encouraging them to protect the Constitution, even if that means defying illegal orders. The video featured six Democratic lawmakers who are all veterans of the military and intelligence services.
Trump called it “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
“I was just aghast. I would have been astonished, but it is President Trump, so we’re accustomed to hearing pretty astonishing things from him,” Blumenthal said Tuesday.
Blumenthal pointed to the bipartisan reaction a mere two months ago “when all of us agreed to lower the temperature” after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was fatally shot. He said he expects those members of Congress to face a deluge of threats.
During an appearance on Fox News, Trump walked back the comments about the video, saying he wasn’t calling for the lawmakers’ execution. “I’m not threatening death, but I think they’re in serious trouble,” Trump said. 
Connecticut Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said he didn’t agree with Trump’s comments, but he believed people on both sides of the aisle have contributed to the growing political violence in the country.
Blumenthal agreed with the sentiment that political violence has intensified in the U.S. and emanates from both ends of the political spectrum.
“There was a point where I received the intelligence briefings on threats to this country where they shifted from fears about extremists from outside the country to extremists within the country, and this is not limited to [the] right or left,” he said.
Blumenthal was originally supposed to sit down for the “In the Room” event last month but needed to stay in Washington for Senate votes in the early days of the government shutdown. After a record 43 days, the federal government reopened after the Senate struck a deal.
The Connecticut senator reiterated his disappointment over the deal since it didn’t meet Democrats’ demands over health care, specifically on the extension of enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans.
Congress remains locked in a fierce debate over the fate of the tax credits, which were established under Democrats’ pandemic relief bill in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025.
The subsidies were intended to be temporary, and when they were extended for another two years in a different Democratic bill in 2022, the party at the time had control of the White House and all of Congress. Shouldn’t they have made it more permanent when they had the chance instead of subjecting it to budget fights?
“It’s probably more frequent than not that government programs go for a period of time and they have to be reauthorized. So that’s not too unusual. But the point here is these subsidies were expected to be wildly popular, and guess what? They are wildly popular, and you know where most of the people who benefit from them live — in red states that Donald Trump won,” Blumenthal said.
He said if Democrats win the majority in the 2026 midterms, there’s “no question that we will try to adopt a more permanent solution.”
But as things currently stand, the enhanced subsidies are set to expire on Dec. 31. And without congressional action, premiums are expected to rise for many in 2026.
Reports suggested Trump was warming to a temporary extension of the subsidies for another two years in a plan that was expected to be released on Monday. It would also limit eligibility to those who make up to 700% of the federal poverty line.
While an announcement was never officially scheduled for Monday and the details were light, the forthcoming proposal was delayed as the framework started to get pushback from some congressional Republicans skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, according to MS Now.The Senate is expected to take a vote on extending the subsidies by the second week of December. But Blumenthal isn’t holding his breath on the outcome.
“Donald Trump over the weekend said, ‘OK we’ll extend the subsidies for a couple of years,’ and he was immediately deluged by his right wing with criticism, so I think you have to recognize that we’re up against MAGA here,” Blumenthal said. “I think there will be a vote, and, unfortunately, I think Republicans will be bludgeoned into voting against health care tax credits extensions.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/blumenthal-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 21:57:01.301727

Twelve score and nine years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.  
Now we are engaged in an uncivil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and dedicated, can long endure. Each day we are met with a new battle in this war. We acknowledge the heavy price paid by generations that this nation might live in freedom. It is altogether fitting and proper that we do this. We cannot rest until the principles of democracy, decency, and the Constitution are restored.  
But, in a larger sense, we cannot venerate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow our great institutions while the president desecrates and dismantles them. The brave and wise who came before expected that we would add not detract from their unfinished work. The world may little note, nor long remember the falsehood and cruelties now spoken and texted, but it will never forget the lasting damage being done here. 
It is for us the living, who still believe in democracy to be dedicated to advancing this unfinished work. We must take increased devotion to this noble cause for which so many have given their last full measure of devotion. Only by doing so can we be resolved that they did not do so in vain.   
Let it be our solemn request that this nation, under God, shall preserve the freedom so dearly won, free from hatred and autocratic ruin; and that the government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from the earth.

Dorene Lorenz of Juneau filed the suit on Friday in Juneau Superior Court, seeking damages from Jeff Landfield and the other owners of the Alaska Landmine, a popular Alaska political website that publishes a mixture of news, commentary and parody.  
Landfield, who backed Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, also publishes the Alaska Political Report, a sobersided news digest priced at $1,299 per year for lobbyists and others interested in activity at the state Capitol. 
Lorenz’s suit stems from a social media post in which Landfield ridiculed a recent appearance by Lorenz at a United Nations event in Switzerland. 
Landfield went beyond that appearance, which he labeled “bizarre,” and said, “This woman is an absolute nut. Remember when she got in trouble for using … state money for the Jesse Lee Home for herself?”
Lorenz asked for a retraction. Landfield refused, and reiterated his belief in a video posted on Facebook.
Lorenz filed her lawsuit in response, saying Landfield’s claim is false. She asked for financial damages for slander and defamation, a correction and retraction. 
Lorenz, who has experience representing herself in court, filed the lawsuit on her own behalf. 
“She’s a f***ing lunatic,” Landfield said of the lawsuit on Tuesday. 
“Anyone who has themselves as a client is a fool, as the old saying goes,” he said, adding that he looks forward to the discovery process and showing what happened with the Jesse Lee Home.
That building was a former orphanage and the home of Alaska Flag designer Benny Benson in the early 20th century.
During the administration of Gov. Bill Walker, state lawmakers allocated almost $7 million to restore the building, but grants given to a Lorenz-chaired nonprofit called the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home were terminated after a series of “reporting issues and accountability issues.”
Lorenz said by text on Tuesday that most of the grant money was never disbursed to the nonprofit she administered.
In 2018, Fred Parady, then deputy commissioner of the Alaska Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development, told Alaska Public Media that he didn’t think anyone involved with the project stole money. 
In her legal complaint, Lorenz notes that Landfield was aware of that reporting and repeated his claim anyway.
Under Alaska law — which mirrors federal law — a public official filing a defamation claim needs to prove that someone knew what they were saying was a lie or that they willingly ignored evidence that their statement was a lie. 
By text message, Lorenz said the 2018 reporting by Alaska Public Media shows that the state believed that the Friends of the Jesse Lee Home were spending too much money on classes within the school and not enough on the building itself. 
“Landmine has asserted otherwise, with actual malice, and continues to do so,” she said. “Not cool.”

Department of Veterans Affairs)Caring for South Carolina’s elderly veterans has been one Upstate company’s focus for nearly three decades. A recent state contract will further extend that streak.
Anderson-headquartered HMR Veterans Services operates four of South Carolina’s six nursing homes for veterans.
The company started with the Richard M. Campbell Veterans Nursing Home, located in Anderson and named for the brother of the late former Gov. Carroll Campbell. Richard Campbell was a sergeant in the U.S. Army killed in action during the Vietnam War.
HMR has run Campbell’s namesake home since 1998 and will continue to do so through at least February 2033, along with Veterans Victory House in Walterboro. HMR has held contracts on the Lowcountry home since 2007.
For its services at the two homes, HMR will receive an estimated $375 million, paid by state and federal taxes. HMR was the lowest bidder of three finalists — at a rate of $333 per bed per day, compared to the high bid of $425 per bed per day — for seven-year contracts starting March 1.
Contracts for two other homes HMR runs — one in Gaffney and one in Florence — are out for bid now.
Outside the Palmetto State, HMR also runs all five of Alabama’s veterans homes and six out of 10 in Texas.
That brings the company’s total to 15 homes with 3,000 employees across three states.
SC’s investment in veterans
In SC, hundreds of veterans go homeless. These groups received state money to help.

For all six homes in South Carolina, state taxpayers spend about $80 million annually to collectively care for 800 veterans, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
In a state with 400,000 veterans, the homes always have a waiting list, he said.
Future expansions, including new homes planned for Orangeburg and Horry counties and a replacement of a Columbia home with a newer facility planned for Lexington County, will eventually increase capacity to more than 1,080 veterans.
The construction timeline of those new homes depends on congressional spending, since federal taxes cover 65% of the cost. South Carolina must kick in the other 35%. Total funding could five years away, Hilliard said.
A focus on veterans
Operating homes for veterans is the only thing HMR does, which makes the company unique nationwide, Russell Keogler, vice president of corporate operations, told the SC Daily Gazette.
“There are competitors out there, but their main focus is on traditional nursing homes,” Keogler said. “For us, this is all we do and all we do every day.”
That gives HMR an advantage when it comes to meeting the unique needs of veterans, according to Keogler.
HMR has specialists on hand to treat illnesses more common to veterans, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. As Vietnam and Korean War veterans are aging, they are also facing more health complications from exposure to toxins, such as Agent Orange used during the war to remove trees and foliage in the dense jungle battlegrounds.
A company history
Still, HMR wasn’t always just a veterans-based company.
Michael McBride, a nursing home administrator, founded it as Health Management Resources, Inc., in 1993, after leasing his first six nursing homes.
Its first veterans’ home, the Campbell facility, became part of the portfolio in 1998, seven years after it opened. That’s also when Army veteran William Biggs, the husband of freshman U.S. Rep. Sheri Biggs, joined as CEO. He had been the administrator of the home in Anderson when HMR took over the contract.
At one point, HMR had as many as 27 veteran and non-veteran facilities across five states, according to McBride’s biography on the company website. In 2010, the company sold 21 hospice, rehab and pharmacy locations to a private equity firm but held on to the veterans’ services side of the business.
McBride continues to sit on HMR’s board of directors, as does the widow of another HMR co-founder, Ed Childress.
William Biggs retired and Ladeeb Diab replaced him as CEO in May 2023. Eight months later, Biggs’ wife launched her campaign for the ruby red congressional seat being vacated by Rep. Jeff Duncan, who chose not to seek an eighth term. Sheri Biggs, a nurse practitioner, emerged the winner of a seven-way GOP primary contest in June 2024. Her 3rd District win last November sent two South Carolina women to Congress for the first time ever.
William Biggs declined to comment for this article, citing a noncompete agreement he signed upon retirement that prevents him from speaking about the company.
The congresswoman, in financial disclosures filed last month, reported more than $4 million in income  from the sale of her husband’s minority interest in HMR businesses.
Members of Congress are required to annually disclose their finances. But they’re only required to report a range of how much their assets and liabilities are worth, so the couple’s exact earnings are unknown. But she valued the capital gains for each of four HMR businesses at more than $1 million.
‘Push the envelope’
Keogler said HMR has sought to “push the envelope” in other ways as well.
For example, at the request of states it contracts with, HMR began running its own pharmacies at its homes, instead of calling in prescriptions from elsewhere.
“We can do all of our medication reviews right in house, and our pharmacists actually know the residents,” he said. “It’s no longer just filling a prescription. It’s taking care of a veteran who you see every day.”
HMR also weathered staffing shortages exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. It does so through a scholarship program, paying for the education of any certified nursing assistant employed by the company who wants to pursue a higher-level licensed practical nursing degree.
New SC law aims to ensure no veteran dies without proper recognition

“We help cover the cost of their tuition and books. We provide them a mentor to help guide them through the program, all while they can continue to work on this flexed academic schedule that builds professional growth for the individual and provides us a constant source of new nurses,” Keogler said. “I think it’s those innovative practices, which we’ve accelerated over the last two years, that really caught the attention of our state partners.”
A huge cost benefit
There are other reasons South Carolina’s more than 386,000 veterans and their families may choose a veterans home.
“It’s really camaraderie and connection,” Keogler said. “There’s a true brotherhood that exists in the service and that comes out later on in life.”
Also, there’s a huge cost benefit to families when they select a state veterans home. With military service benefits, the cost is far less than that of a traditional nursing home.
The federal government pays states a daily rate which can cover up to 50% of the homes’ operating costs. For veterans deemed at least 70% disabled due to injuries related to their military service, their cost is covered in full, according to Heyward Hilliard, director of veterans’ homes for the South Carolina Department of Veterans’ Affairs.
The remaining costs are covered by state taxes or by the veterans themselves, said Hilliard, who was previously HMR’s executive vice president of operations. He joined the state agency in April 2024 after it took over the homes’ operations from the state mental health agency.

Above average
South Carolina also is in the minority of states — one of 13 — that pay private contractors to run all of its homes, though more states are trending that direction, Hilliard said.
While private contractors run the homes, the state public health agency and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are tasked with inspecting them. And the state veterans agency employs someone on site at each home, Hilliard said.
“Our homes consistently perform at or above national averages,” he said.
Three of the four HMR-run homes in South Carolina have recently received high marks.
State and federal regulators inspected the Anderson and Walterboro homes seven times over the past four years. Some reviews were the result of complaints and required the homes to make improvements. But each received a government rating of four out of five stars.
The Gaffney home has gone through four inspections and one improvement plan in that time and has a perfect rating.
The Florence home, however, sits at a two out of five. Federal reports site shortfalls in a handful of patient treatment plans for residents with medical issues including diabetes, a feeding tube and ulcers and bedsores.
The Columbia home, which is run by Avalon Health Care Group rather than HMR, also has a two-star rating. The same group also runs the state’s newest veterans’ home in Sumter, which opened in January. It hasn’t been rated yet.

HMR also made headlines in 2018, when the wife of a U.S. Air Force veteran alleged her husband suffered repeat infections, hospitalizations and unexplained bruises while he was in the Walterboro home, the Independent Mail reported.
And in May 2018, HMR settled a $425,000 lawsuit involving a veteran at the Anderson home who had a latex glove lodged in his airway. He died five days later.
Hilliard, who was still working for HMR at the time, told the Independent Mail: “Health care is a very litigious environment. A settlement does not constitute an admission of liability.”

Spencer Cox said he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals.,"Gov. Spencer Cox responds to a reporter’s question during the governor’s news conference broadcast by PBS Utah at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City on Tuesday, Nov. 25, 2025. (Pool photo by Tess Crowley/The Salt Lake Tribune)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said Tuesday he’s in favor of adding more justices to the Utah Supreme Court and more judges to the state’s Court of Appeals. 
“It’s something that I do support,” Cox told reporters Tuesday during his monthly news conference hosted by PBS Utah.
The governor also said he doesn’t see growing the benches as court packing, a practice members of Utah’s congressional delegation denounced when it was proposed at the federal level by Democrats.  
State lawmakers considered making the move earlier this year as they grew more frustrated with recent Utah Supreme Court decisions, including one maintaining a stay on a ban they passed on abortion while it’s challenged in court. Another decision limited the Legislature’s power to undo and replace voter-approved government reform initiatives.

Rather than citing dissatisfaction with the courts’ written opinions, lawmakers at the time pointed to growing caseloads and complex legal arguments. The governor echoed those reasons Tuesday, saying it makes sense to expand Utah’s Supreme Court from five justices to seven to “start moving justice quicker through the system. I think that really matters.”  
Data provided by the Utah court system points to the appeals’ courts growing caseload, with legal filings at the Utah Supreme Court reaching a high of 270 in the state’s 2025 fiscal year, which ends in June. The Court of Appeals fielded 1,143 filings in the same time frame, up 7% from a year earlier. 
But two Utah Supreme Court justices have said growing their panel won’t help them.
Justice Paige Petersen said earlier this year that it’s “misinformation” and “absolutely false” to say “we need more members of the court because they have a backlog.”
“We haven’t had a backlog for years,” Petersen said in a Utah Judicial Council meeting in February.  
Utah Supreme Court disputes lawmakers’ allegations that it’s not productive enough

Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told The Salt Lake Tribune in October that adding more justices could lead to more deliberation, delaying timelines further. He told the newspaper he and his colleagues care about being efficient “but more than anything else, we want to get it right under the law, under the Constitution.”
When Democrats in Congress proposed expanding the U.S. Supreme Court in 2021, Utah’s Republican U.S. senators condemned it as an attempt at court packing, saying legislators were trying to undermine the independence of the judicial branch. 
Asked if expanding the appeals courts in Utah would be court packing, Cox said, “I’ve never looked at it that way.” He told reporters he does not share the same consternation lawmakers have with the courts. 
A majority of states have at least seven justices. That includes neighboring Colorado and Nevada. Idaho and Wyoming have five. 
Cox said he also supports setting aside more resources for district court judges, who oversee criminal cases and lawsuits throughout the state. 
“I’ve seen their dockets,” Cox said. “They’re really backed up.” 
The governor last month signed a bill into law last month that allows him to pick the Utah Supreme Court’s chief justice every eight years. Cox had vetoed an earlier version that set the term at four years.

(Courtesy of Union Omaha)OMAHA — Omaha city officials are taking steps to unlock a state incentive to help pay for two multimillion-dollar sports complexes, touting the public value of the projects in drawing tourism and other dollars.
But as the City Council on Tuesday gave its full throttled, 7-0 support to request help via the Sports Arena Facility Financing Assistance Act, Gov. Jim Pillen doubled down on his resistance.
Pillen, whose approval is required to tap the incentive, told the Nebraska Examiner this week that the state has been “duped” for too long in approving sales tax exemptions he believes only shift the burdens to property taxes.

“Our state sales tax has been Swiss cheese for 45 years plus,” he said. “We don’t have a sales tax base to afford to do very much of anything.”
The governor has said he will not consider approval of any SAFFAA application until June at the earliest — after the next legislative session during which he hopes lawmakers will pass property tax relief. 
Omaha City Council members pushed back on any notion that the turnback tax incentive for the two Omaha projects would harm the state’s financial picture. Councilwoman Aimee Melton, a Republican, called it a “win-win.” 
“This will be revenue positive,” Melton said. “The state will see an increase in revenue from Day One.” 
 Governor support needed

At issue is a state incentive for arenas and sports complexes previously approved by the Nebraska Legislature. Applicants go through a state board that includes the governor, who must be among the majority for a project to be approved. Nine projects not including the two Omaha athletic complexes already are pending.

Here’s how the financing incentive generally works for qualified Omaha ventures: Up to 70% of new state sales taxes generated within 600 yards of a sports facility goes to help pay off bonds for construction. The “new” tax revenue refers to sales at the facility or at retailers that sprout in the designated zone for a certain time after the project is announced. 
In most cases, city voters must approve the use of such bonds.
Omaha officials Tuesday expressed doubt that the two athletic complexes in question would move forward without the SAFFAA turnback tax approval. If all hurdles were cleared, the state incentive would help cover costs for:

Up to 16 multi-purpose athletic fields, a concession area and parking facilities at Tranquility Park near 120th and West Maple Road. The joint SAFFAA application will be submitted by the city and the nonprofit Omaha Public Facilities Corp. Public records show the city will seek up to $65 million in revenue bonds to pay up front costs. Initial documentation does not indicate how much of the turnback tax is being sought.
An open-air soccer complex owned by the city and used by the Union Omaha professional team near 11th and Izard Streets. Soccer officials project the overall stadium will cost $140 million, including $114 in “hard” costs and the rest for infrastructure. Partners in the application are the city and Downtown Soccer Stadium, a nonprofit affiliated with the Union Omaha ownership group. The city says it will request $25 million from the state turnback tax.

Jennifer Taylor, deputy Omaha city attorney, said if the turnback tax was not granted, Omaha would have to stop and reevaluate.
“We’ll have to put the brakes on,” she told the council.
 New ‘gateway’ to city 

David Levy, an attorney representing the Union Omaha project, described the 6,500-seat stadium as “a milestone in a long and really exciting journey.” It would be home to both the men’s professional soccer “Owls” team and a new women’s soccer team.
New $140M Union Omaha soccer stadium, mixed-use village could hinge on paused state sports incentive

Other community uses, including games by high school teams, are envisioned for the stadium, which would be owned by the city and leased and managed by Union Omaha. 
Levy said that projections show the stadium generating more tourism-related and other revenue for the city and state than the $25 million sought from the turnback tax over 20 years. Other sources, including tax-increment financing and program revenue, also would help pay for the stadium.
Partners expect new private housing, retail and commercial development of between $300 and $400 million near the complex. 
“This will be a great gateway and front door to our city at that location,” Levy said.
Melton said the land on which the stadium would rise currently is largely vacant and draws little property tax revenue. She said new tax revenue to be generated in that stadium zone would not exist if not for the project.
The city is seeking to buy the roughly 25 acres around 11th and Izard Streets from Union Pacific Railroad for $18.7 million for the soccer stadium project. 
In a move not necessarily related to the stadium, the railroad seeks to buy back from the city long-vacant land at 1441 Capitol Ave. That square block, priced at $7.3 million, was once Union Pacific’s headquarters. The railroad told the Nebraska Examiner in a statement Friday that it is considering developing the property, but no firm decision has been made.
Public hearings on both land purchase agreements are to take place next Tuesday.
 Tranquility growth

In an effort to safeguard taxpayers, both sports complex agreements are to include assurances that partners have sufficient funds before the projects move forward, Taylor said. 
City Councilman Pete Festersen, a Democrat, said he was excited to support the projects he sees as a lure for families and young athletes and hoped that state partners would look favorably on the ventures.
At age 50, Omaha’s Tranquility Park athletic complex is getting $54 million makeover

The turnback tax application, he said, “is very important to the overall picture.” 
Around the Tranquility Park campus, which is a half century old, the Mulhall family proposes to build a mixed-use private development — contingent on the new additional sports facilities, council members said. 
The City of Omaha began talking years ago about upgrading the park to draw regional and national tournaments. The park is managed by the Omaha Parks and Recreation Department.
In early 2024, the city selected JEO Consulting Group for planning development and design. The city tapped Kiewit as construction manager.
City Councilman Brinker Harding, a Republican running for Congress in the Omaha-based 2nd District, urged state decision-makers to approve all turnback tax projects if they’re revenue positive. He said he sees benefits to athletic activities beyond physical exercise. 
“It teaches our kids responsibility, dedication, accountability, sportsmanship and those are all good values we want to instill in our youth,” he said. “I’m a big believer in that youth sports can be a great pathway for that.”

But as we transition away from fossil fuels, energy demand will increase as we electrify our lives and as energy-intensive industries proliferate.  
This complicates our state’s path to decarbonization.
As part of the transition, solar energy in Washington could cover tens of thousands — possibly hundreds of thousands — of acres in the coming years.
Where all those solar panels go is a serious question.
Rooftop solar is great. However, the most ambitious estimates show that, at best, it would meet less than 30% of the state’s energy needs.
Farmland is a prime target for solar developers because the land is typically flat, already cleared, relatively accessible and sunny.
But the prospect of farmland conversion to solar energy has created tensions in rural communities and led to roadblocks on agricultural solar arrays.
Rather than converting farmland to solar facilities, we could build solar arrays and continue growing crops and raising livestock beneath the gentle shade of the panels. This approach is called “agrivoltaics,” and it could be one way to ease competition between the agriculture and solar energy sectors.
Solar arrays cast a shadow but don’t fully shade the land beneath.
This means some crops and smaller livestock can be grown and raised underneath and between the panels. And if you raise the panels a few feet higher, beneath them you can grow taller crops, trellised fruit trees, or graze cattle.
Even better, the partial shade from the solar panels can reduce sunburn and heat stress for fruits and vegetables and improve animal welfare. The shading can also reduce irrigation needs.
Solar panels and support posts can be used to replace some farm infrastructure as well, like trellising and shade cloth.
Through a collaboration between American Farmland Trust, Washington State University, The Nature Conservancy, and colleagues at University of California, Santa Barbara, we recently published a report on the feasibility of agrivoltaics in Washington for the state Department of Commerce. The research was funded by Climate Commitment Act revenue.
Our work included cutting-edge modeling to assess the joint production of solar energy and crop yield and quality at the field scale for apples, lettuce and berries. And we surveyed more than 100 farmers statewide to learn about their perspectives on solar energy, including agrivoltaics.
Our discoveries show incredible potential for the future of clean energy in Washington.
Farmers surveyed were substantially more supportive of agrivoltaics than converting farmland to solar arrays without maintaining agricultural production.
Fifty-five percent of the farmers surveyed were more interested in marrying solar and agricultural land when they learned about the idea of agrivoltaics and 57% of the farmers surveyed were moderately or very interested in hosting an agrivoltaics system on their lands.
Washington residents deeply value protecting both agricultural and natural lands. They also value rapidly transitioning to renewable energy sources.
In 2025, the state Legislature passed Senate Bill 5445 to encourage a diversity of distributed energy systems, including agrivoltaics.
This is a great start, and we need more. Farmers and ranchers, solar developers, scientists and policy makers can build on this momentum to support Washington’s agricultural communities, protect our lands and build the renewable energy future we need without losing valuable agriculture and natural lands.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/solar-farm-agricultural-land-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

Jim Pillen speaks at an event at the Washington County Fairgrounds. Oct. 19, 2025 (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump endorsed Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen’s reelection bid at a momentthat some hope might prevent a bruising GOP primary for governor with former Trump donor Charles Herbster.
In a social media post Tuesday, the president gave Pillen his “complete and total Endorsement for re-election.” Trump pointed to Pillen “working tirelessly to Champion Nebraska Values” and other reasons.

“A very successful Veterinarian, Businessman, former Nebraska Cornhuskers football player under the LEGENDARY Coach Tom Osborne, and now, as Governor, Jim has a Proven Record of Success!” Trump posted on Truth Social. 
The president ended the post as he does most of his GOP endorsements on social media, writing, “HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
Pillen, in a Monday afternoon response to the president on social media site X, wrote that he was “deeply honored to have earned” Trump’s endorsement. 
“Conservative leadership matters, as he has proved time and again,” Pillen said on social media. “Thank you, Mr. President.” 
The endorsement comes as Herbster has increasingly sharpened his criticisms of the governor online. Herbster has said he is considering a rerun of his 2022 GOP gubernatorial bid, which he lost to Pillen, finishing second in a three-way race at the top with then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, who is running for the U.S. House in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.

Herbster told the Examiner recently that, “Pillen’s shortcomings make it hard to say no” to running in 2026 and that he will decide closer to the new year. He had criticized Pillen for, among other things, not listening to the business community, for not selling the state aggressively enough to business leaders elsewhere and for resisting voter-approved medical cannabis. 
Herbster, in a statement, said while he is disappointed in Trump’s endorsement, “it is entirely reasonable that he would endorse the incumbent Republican governor.” He said he is still committed to exploring a run for governor. 
“This race is not about President Trump,” Herbster said. “It is about hard-working Nebraskans trying to make ends meet. It is about our farmers and ranchers, who have been asked to sacrifice for far too long. It is about the businesses trying to grow and bring jobs to our state, only to be met with roadblocks and mismanagement from this administration.”

Trump backing Pillen is a dramatic change from the last time Herbster faced the former University of Nebraska regent. In that race, Herbster had Trump’s endorsement, and the governor was backed by then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, whom Pillen appointed to the U.S. Senate in 2023. Herbster was the president’s first major endorsed Republican candidate to lose in a 2022 GOP primary.
Pillen cruised to a general election victory against then-Democratic State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue after beating Herbster. 
The governor worked hard to earn Trump’s endorsement, taking far more trips to Washington, D.C., and the White House than his predecessors. He also vocally supported the Trump administration locally, including volunteering the state to host a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement jail for migrants awaiting deportation proceedings at a state prison facility in McCook.
Pillen has taken some criticism at home from Democrats and some in his own party for what they said was putting Trump’s interests ahead of Nebraska’s.
Local political observers were buzzing Tuesday about the endorsement and what it might mean for the potential GOP primary. GOP consultant Perre Neilan of Neilan Strategy Group of Lincoln said the endorsement might make Herbster reconsider running. Most endorsements are “nice to have but not critical.” Trump’s endorsement in a GOP primary is a “big get for Governor Pillen.”
“The Trump endorsement will definitely give Herbster pause,” Neilan said. 
Jacy Todd, another GOP candidate for governor, said, “It’s not about President Trump’s endorsement. It’s about the people of Nebraska endorsing me.” 
“Makes me wonder what President Trump sees in Pillen with the way he has poorly run our state,” Todd said. 
This week, former State Sen. Lynne Walz launched an exploratory committee to consider a 2026 run for Nebraska governor on the Democratic side. 
Republicans outnumber Democrats in Nebraska by roughly 2-to-1, with about 22% of the electorate either registered either nonpartisan or with a third party. The primary is May 12. The general election is Nov. 3.

NorthWestern Energy said a portion of the new Colstrip shares it will acquire on Jan. 1, 2026, will be transferred to a new subsidiary — one the utility said is not under the authority of the Public Service Commission.
In a recent letter to regulators, NorthWestern Energy also said the deal does not require approval by the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern sent the letter in response to questions from the Public Service Commission about an October filing the utility made with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission about the new shares.
In the filing, the subsidiary, called NorthWestern Colstrip 370 Pu LLC, requests federal approval for selling electricity on its own as a separate and “unregulated” entity.
The filing has raised questions from not only the Public Service Commission — charged with regulating monopoly utilities in the state — but also a Montana energy watchdog.
For starters, does the filing leapfrog a critical step?
Does the transfer of assets from a regulated utility — whether Puget Sound Energy or NorthWestern — to a NorthWestern holding company subsidiary require federal and state regulatory approvals?
And either way, what does it mean for existing customers?
In a unanimous decision Friday, the Public Service Commission voted to hire outside counsel to intervene in the docket, and in subsequent motions on Monday, it revised the deal to spend as much as $25,000 on the intervention.
“The Commission felt it was important to intervene because we have deep concerns about whether the actions of NorthWestern Energy were in the public interest and what the impacts to customer bills will be based on these decisions they’ve made,” said Public Service Commission spokesperson Alana Lake.
Acquiring more Colstrip shares
In the last couple of years, NorthWestern Energy announced two deals to acquire additional shares of the coal-fired plant at Colstrip, taking its ownership from 15% to 55% of the plant as of Jan. 1, 2026.
NorthWestern announced the price tag for the acquisitions at Colstrip units 3 and 4 to be zero dollars, even as other companies back away from coal, facing state restrictions on carbon emissions and steep upkeep for old plants. (Units 1 and 2 were shuttered in 2020.)
NorthWestern Energy announced in July 2024 it would acquire Puget Sound Energy’s 370 megawatts of the Colstrip Plant.
The utility said that acquisition, coupled with a previously announced deal to acquire Avista’s 222 megawatts, would ensure Montana customers have “cost-effective generation” available during a transition to a “cleaner energy future.”
NorthWestern said the acquisition of the Puget shares would provide a benefit to existing customers starting on Jan. 1, 2026.
But in its letter to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern described a different plan for the Puget shares. It said its subsidiary, NorthWestern Colstrip 370 Pu LLC, intends to sell the energy on the wholesale market under federal jurisdiction until NorthWestern customers need the capacity.
“To that end, Colstrip 370Pu entered into a 21-month contract with Mercuria Energy America, LLC, for the sale of all the output of the Puget Share,” NorthWestern said in its letter.
Bloomberg describes Mercuria as an energy and commodity trading company.
Separate from this case, but at the fore in Montana, is significant demand from data centers on the near horizon, a controversial issue that’s unfolding in communities and at the Public Service Commission.
NorthWestern acknowledged it included the Puget shares in its own capacity forecasts, but also said analyses, both before and after the announced acquisition, show it could meet its energy obligations without those shares.
So setting the asset aside is a benefit to customers, NorthWestern said.
“Holding the Puget Share outside the Montana Utility (NorthWestern Energy) relieves customers of responsibility for any costs or liabilities associated with the asset prior to it being required to meet utility load, while allowing the company an opportunity to offset O&M (operations and maintenance) costs through wholesale sales,” NorthWestern said.
Is it indeed a good deal for existing customers, as the utility said?
Anne Hedges, head of the Montana Environmental Information Center and one of NorthWestern’s outspoken critics, said other utilities have created similar setups, and the deal isn’t unusual.
But NorthWestern submitted the proposal to the feds just last month, and with the shares set to transfer come 2026, there’s little time to tell how customers will be affected.
“This deserves a whole lot more attention than NorthWestern is allowing, and that is what is so frustrating,” Hedges said.
Energy conservation group moves to intervene
Problems already are apparent in the filing in the federal case, however, said the Montana Environmental Information Center, a nonprofit and conservation watchdog, in its request to participate in the federal case.
For one thing, the nonprofit argues the subsidiary doesn’t show it secured federal authorization for the planned transfers in the first place.
In the absence of that authorization — or, alternatively, an explanation for why one isn’t necessary — the subsidiary’s filing to get approval for selling energy wholesale is “fatal,” the nonprofit argues.
Secondly, in the filing, the NorthWestern subsidiary has not shown existing customers aren’t getting shorted, the Montana Environmental Information Center argued.
The subsidiary’s filing is a request for a pricing structure for the plan to sell energy on the wholesale market. But the nonprofit said evidence suggests existing customers are getting a raw deal compared to anyone who might benefit from the wholesale sales.
For example, the maintenance costs the subsidiary provides in the filing are historical ones, lower than future projected costs, the nonprofit said. Additionally, it said, a new fuel agreement increases those costs at Colstrip as of Jan. 1, 2026.
In other words, the NorthWestern subsidiary “significantly underestimates” actual maintenance and operations costs, the nonprofit said. And it said the subsidiary itself describes its pricing structure as representing “ceiling rates,” meaning actual rates paid by wholesale customers could be lower.
“This means that NorthWestern’s retail customers will likely pay more than the affiliate’s wholesale customers for Colstrip-generated power, and risk being charged the affiliate’s unrecovered costs to maintain and operate the plants,” the nonprofit said.
Citing a statement by NorthWestern Energy, it also said the utility appears to have transferred transmission capacity to the new subsidiary “on terms that may reflect a subsidy by the utility’s retail customers.”
(In the meantime, NorthWestern continues to argue its transmission infrastructure is “severely constrained” and requires additional capital for reliable service, the nonprofit said.)
Hegdes said the cost of operations and maintenance for the Puget shares might be close to $25 million. NorthWestern earlier said the Avista shares would cost $18 million in operations and maintenance, and it asked to temporarily tap a customer credit to pay.
To ensure existing customers aren’t picking up the tab for costs that aren’t theirs, Hedges said state and federal regulators need data from NorthWestern, evidence of firewalls, and time for a rigorous assessment.
Instead, she said NorthWestern is offering a “shell game” and short shrifting the federal review process.
“We need transparency to show that NorthWestern and its market customers are the ones who are going to be shouldering those costs,” Hedges said.
Public Service Commission ponies up to intervene
In a Nov. 5 letter, the Public Service Commission asked NorthWestern Energy questions about the federal filing and pointed out its own role in overseeing utilities.
“The Commission has consistently exercised authority over mergers, sales, and transfers of utilities and utility property,” the letter said. But it said “it appears that NorthWestern Energy intends to transfer property that it has characterized as utility property.”
The letter asked NorthWestern to clarify whether it would seek approval from the Public Service Commission, and it asked for a “comprehensive explanation” if the answer was no.
In its response, NorthWestern Energy said it doesn’t own the Puget shares nor is it acquiring them “at this time,” and a separate “non-utility subsidiary” will acquire them on Jan. 1, 2026, so there’s “no basis” for the Public Service Commission to assert jurisdiction.
“Neither the Puget Share nor the Puget Agreement (the contract to acquire the Puget shares) has ever been used to serve Montana customers, placed in rate base, or recovered through Montana rates,” NorthWestern said. “The transfer of ownership will occur directly between Puget Sound Energy and Colstrip 370Pu, which is not a regulated public utility.”
But Lake, executive director for the Public Service Commission, said the Commission continues to have questions about the deal, including whether NorthWestern’s assertion the Puget shares transaction isn’t subject to state regulatory authority has merit.
Lake said she expects the Commission also will open a docket to investigate that question. For the time being, however, she said the priority is to ensure the Public Service Commission is able to intervene in the federal case given the risk the deal poses to customers.
The Public Service Commission is seeking late-intervener status in the case.
In one of its filings, the NorthWestern subsidiary explains why the call for federal approval of the transfer should be rejected. In part, it asserts the transfer of shares isn’t relevant to its pending request — for a wholesale pricing structure — and the amount of money at stake doesn’t hit the threshold for approval anyway.
Friday, Mike Green, a NorthWestern official, apologized to commissioners for not keeping them better apprised of its plans with the Colstrip plant.
“We’ve had some discussion about whether or not we should have come to the commission and sought your approval,” Green said at the meeting. “I will submit to you, we probably should have told you what we were doing, but I will also respectfully submit we didn’t need to, and there was no basis for us to ask for approval.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1248907535-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

“I think it’s under two minutes … before the light will change,” said Nick Tsouknakis, owner of the nearby Quechee Pizza Chef. “So, you know, once people realize that, then it’s not that much of an issue.”
While the delays may be minor, Tsouknakis does attribute a decrease in the numbers of passersby to the bridge construction, which has been ongoing from spring to late fall since 2023.
“We’re going on 32 years here, and we’ve had constant gains over the years,” Tsouknakis said. “But less so since the bridge has been worked on.”
Route 4 is a primary connector between the Connecticut River Valley and destinations further west, from skiers traveling toward Killington to trucks driving to the New York Thruway. The bridge, which stands 165 feet over Vermont’s deepest gorge, draws hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.
Originally expected to be completed in 2024, the project has been extended by delays due to supply chain issues and staffing shortages, according to the Vermont Agency of Transportation, or VTrans.
Work has included rehabilitation and cleaning of the structural steel arch and its framing, which support the bridge deck, according to VTrans. In addition, railings and new sidewalks will be constructed.
In the construction season that is now concluding, workers completed a driving lane and walkway on the bridge’s south side, according to VTrans. Work on the north side, however, won’t be finished by the end of this year’s construction, as was originally planned.
The delay stems from the discovery of “additional deterioration of critical components of the steel arch” in the summer of 2024, according to a news release from VTrans last week. The development required additional design and detailing, the release said.
The extra work required traffic to be restricted to one alternating lane last winter, and is also the cause of this winter’s inability to open both lanes, according to the release. The bridge sits beside the Quechee State Park, which has closed certain trails during construction. Pizza Chef is among several nearby shops and restaurants that have experienced decreased traffic during construction.
Still, Tsouknakis understands the need for the bridge construction.
“It was something that needed to be done,” he said. “At the end of the day, I think it’ll be really nice.”
Although the north side has no accessible sidewalk, the contractor has vacated the southwest parking lot, which is now open to the public for parking, according to the project website. There is a protected sidewalk from the lot to the accessible bridge sidewalk.   
Construction will resume in March 2026 under the project contracted by the Glenmont, N.Y.-based Harrison & Burrowes Bridge Constructors, Inc. VTrans expects the project to be completed with two lanes of traffic and both sidewalks open for public use by late June.

The allegations center on how the state’s email management system handles Honor Wyoming’s emails to lawmakers. 
The post Dark money group questions transparency of Wyoming lawmakers, legislative staff appeared first on WyoFile .","Honor Wyoming, a conservative political group in Wyoming, has alleged since at least January that the state is blocking and censoring constituent emails to lawmakers, threatening to take legal action as a result. 
The allegations have led to the creation of a legislative panel to examine the matter, and even prompted some critics to accuse the group of pushing for transparency while not being open about its own leadership.
Since the organization made an expensive entrance into the state’s political landscape in 2024 via social media ads and billboards, Honor Wyoming has offered a convenient way for its website visitors to bulk email Wyoming lawmakers. 
When that resulted in thousands of emails landing in lawmaker junk or quarantine folders due to the state email management system’s default security settings, Honor Wyoming cried foul, describing the situation as a free speech violation. 
“Whether wittingly or unwittingly, the Wyoming Legislative Services [sic] Office has been censoring communications with legislators,” the group posted on its website in March. Three months earlier, the group had sent a letter to the state, threatening legal action if the situation was not remedied. 
In April, the Legislature formed a subcommittee to evaluate the group’s concerns in the off-season, also known as the interim, and to better understand the inner mechanics of Microsoft Outlook, the email management system used by the state of Wyoming. Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, co-chaired the subcommittee with Sen. Barry Crago, R-Buffalo, alongside members Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, and Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson. 
Ultimately, the four lawmakers split on whether legislation was necessary, and tensions flared last week as the Management Council discussed the subcommittee’s findings. 
“All of the emails are being delivered,” Crago said at the meeting in Cheyenne. “Every one of us in this room and all of our colleagues are receiving the emails from the group that has showed up here to testify and asked for transparency, oddly enough, but can’t even tell us who their board of directors is. I find that somewhat ironic — asking for transparency when unwilling to tell us who’s paying the bills back home.”

Because Honor Wyoming is a nonprofit, it is not legally required to publicly disclose the details of its funding. When the source of political money isn’t known — unlike funds raised by politicians and political action committees, which are required by law to be publicly disclosed — it is referred to as dark money. According to The Center for Public Integrity, nonprofits and corporate entities, such as limited liability companies, are the two most common vehicles for dark money in politics. 
At the meeting, Sen. Gierau asked the group’s attorney, Drake Hill, about the organization’s makeup.
Hill is married to former Superintendent of Public Instruction Cindy Hill, and has previously served as chairman of the Wyoming Republican Party. 
“Can you tell me a little bit about Honor Wyoming? Like, who’s the board of directors? Who’s in charge of this outfit, Mr. Hill?” Gierau asked. 
“I know that’s been a question that has been directed, and I know you’ve been interested in that question through the press yourself,” Hill said. “Honestly, I’m not aware of who the board members are, but I do know that the scope of their mission is to bring awareness to issues.”
Meanwhile, Rep. Bear led the charge on a bill to require legislative staff to produce a list of emails received by legislators. That way, Bear said, constituents concerned that lawmakers were not receiving their emails could confirm with staff. 
“There’s another side to this story. And that is that our constituents would like to contact us via email, and I’d like to be an advocate for those constituents,” Bear told the council. 
Ultimately, the council voted 5-5 to sponsor the legislation. Without a majority, the bill failed, but an individual lawmaker is likely to sponsor it for the 2026 budget session.

Staff explanation
The Management Council’s discussion began with a presentation by Legislative Service Office staff members. 
“I think maybe just to start off with, it’s important for everyone to know that these emails in question were all being delivered to legislators,” LSO Director Matt Obrecht said. “It was just a question of whether they’re going to your inbox, your junk folder, or your quarantine folder, all of which legislators have access to.”
Since the subcommittee met in July, “LSO has done a tremendous amount of work,” Anthony Sara, deputy administrator of operations, told lawmakers. 
“We’ve done a deep dive into our legislative email system and probably spent more time on this than anything else this [legislative off-season,]” Sara said. “It’s something that we obviously take very seriously and understand that you have to have your legislative email for important communication with your constituents.” 
That work included extended discussions with Microsoft and education with lawmakers about how to check junk folders and how to release quarantined messages into their inboxes. Staff also updated the Legislature’s website to inform constituents of who to contact if they’re concerned their emails are not being delivered. 
While some changes were made to the system settings, Sara said LSO “also learned that a lot of this is out of our control.
“The scores that Microsoft gives each email for spam, what’s called the spam confidence level, cannot be adjusted by users and is 100% determined by Microsoft,” Sara said. 
Senate President Bo Biteman, R-Ranchester, asked LSO about Honor Wyoming’s accusations. 
“It’s been insinuated online and on billboards that our staff and certain legislators are purposely censoring emails and content thereof. Is that true?” Biteman said. 
“No, I can assure you that nobody within our IT section is selecting where emails go, nor do we have the resources to do that with the amount of emails that you all get,” Sara said. 
Lawmaker debate
Bear told the council that emails that land in a junk or quarantine folder are less likely to be seen. And as a lawmaker, he said he wants to “hear from everybody that I can.” 
A bill to require legislative staff to publish a partially redacted list of quarantined email addresses each working day of the legislative session and once a week otherwise, Bear said, would help solve that problem. 
“I’m here today to try to come up with a solution so that even though we have [security] risks that we live with, the First Amendment opportunity of our constituents to contact us and discuss things with us via email is continued,” Bear said. “There are people like the good Vice President of the Senate and myself who have fought, many have died, so that we would have a First Amendment, a right for the people to bring their grievances to their government.” 
Throughout his testimony, Bear referred to constituent emails as being “blocked” — a characterization that several members of the committee disputed.

“We’ve established the fact that no emails have been blocked. So you’re being disingenuous when you use the term ‘blocked,’” Biteman said. 
Bear said he would “attempt not to use the word,” but “I will tell you that’s my perception. That’s the perception of probably 99% of people out there.”
Whatever term the Legislature finds appropriate, Hill, Honor Wyoming’s attorney, said, the objective is “that we allow for constituents to be heard in whatever manner” the constituent uses to communicate.
“None is more important than another and none is less important than the other,” Hill said. 
Neiman also spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that the issue is much larger than Honor Wyoming. 
“As I’ve listened to this, I guess the thing that kind of resonates with me is, this really isn’t because of one organization’s issue,” Neiman said. “This wasn’t specific — I mean, we have one organization that came and spoke to us today, but there were multiple organizations that were discussed, [American Gun Owners Association], and others.” 
The bill “isn’t for one organization, it’s for the citizens of the state of Wyoming,” he said. 
But if the issue was one of importance to Wyoming residents, Biteman said, “this room would be full of people testifying. Nobody showed up. Not a single person other than the group who’s caused this whole thing to be before us today.”
Sen. Tara Nethercott, R-Cheyenne, took things further, arguing that the bill was about something else entirely. 
“The conversation we’re really having here today is about Wyoming being taken over by large political, well-funded organizations that have the ability to control your elected [officials] through fear and misinformation, wittingly or unwittingly, creating confusion and fractionalization of our great state,” Nethercott said. “It must come to an end.”
In the meantime, Nethercott encouraged residents “to keep communicating with your legislators directly” using the contact information provided on the Wyoming Legislature’s website. 
Sen. Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, and Reps. Bear, Neiman, Jeremy Haroldson, R-Wheatland and Scott Heiner, R-Green River, voted in favor of the bill, while Sens. Biteman, Crago, Gierau, and Nethercott and Rep. Mike Yin, D-Jackson, voted against it. 
The 2026 budget session convenes Feb. 9.

(Gerald Herbert/The Associated Press)Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham, who rolled back government vaccine distribution as the state’s top public health official, has been appointed to the second highest position at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 

Abraham, a 71-year-old medical doctor, lives in rural Richland Parish and served as a Republican congressman representing Northeast Louisiana from 2015-21. He could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
Abraham has espoused skepticism about vaccines for years. After becoming appointed surgeon general last year, he scuttled the Louisiana’s longstanding vaccine promotion program, shutting down its advertising campaign and eliminating mass vaccination events the state has conducted for decades for the flu and other diseases. 

Recently, Abraham also drew criticism from other public health experts for waiting several weeks to make a public statement and offer guidance on whooping cough after two babies in Louisiana died from the illness earlier this year. 
Gov. Jeff Landry, who has also expressed skepticism about vaccines, praised Abraham’s appointment to help lead the nation’s leading public health organization. 
“While we are certainly sad to lose Dr. Abraham here in Louisiana, we are thrilled to see the CDC gain a selfless leader,” Landry said in a prepared statement Tuesday. “There is no better advocate for health freedom than Ralph Abraham.”
Prior to his government roles, Abraham worked as a veterinarian treating animals for a decade and then returned to school and earned his medical degree in 1994 at age 40. He operated a general practice  and still treats patients on a part-time basis at a rural health clinic in Louisiana’s Mississippi Delta region, one of the poorest sections of the country. 
Gov. Jeff Landry tapped Abraham to be Louisiana’s health secretary for the first several months of Landry’s administration in 2024. The governor and state lawmakers then created the position of state surgeon general specifically for Abraham last year. In that job, the former congressman has been in charge of the state’s public health efforts and said he planned to focus on preventing diseases such as diabetes and obesity in Louisiana. 
In addition to casting doubt on the need for vaccines, Abraham has also promoted COVID-19 treatments that infectious disease experts have widely debunked. They include taking hydroxychloroquine, a medication used to prevent malaria, and ivermectin, a drug used for parasitic infections. 

As recently as last month, Abraham cited talking points promoted by anti-vaccine groups in a public appearance. At a press conference, he highlighted a Cleveland Clinic study that skeptics use to cast doubt on the usefulness of the flu vaccine. 
Staff at the Cleveland Clinic and other disease experts have pushed back on the interpretation of the study Abraham reiterated and emphasized the study doesn’t prove the flu vaccine is ineffective.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/surgeon-general.jpg,,,2025-11-25 19:57:14.864780

A federal employee who drove into two buildings in Waitsfield early Sunday morning was charged with drunken driving and negligent operation of a vehicle, according to Vermont State Police.
Eric McCarthy, 45, of Essex, was driving a 2016 3-series BMW that went off the road, hit the deck of a building and crossed through a yard before crashing into the side of yet another building, according to first responders.
“This person threaded the needle,” said David Darr, who owns one of the buildings. His son lives in an apartment on the top floor and heard the crash in the middle of the night, he said.
He said the crash took out a “substantial” Darrad Services business sign on a post, in addition to a 6-by-6 column that holds up the porch. The front stairs were “ripped to shreds,” he said.
The car then sped over the side of the building, missing a large elm tree, before launching into a second building, where the car remained, hanging off the first floor, Darr said.
A Vermont State Police report said troopers found McCarthy with “signs of impairment.” He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol and negligent driving, and later released with a notice to appear in Washington County Superior Court on Jan. 15, according to the police report.
A spokesperson from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, confirmed the person involved in the crash is a department employee but declined to comment further.
“DHS holds its employees to the highest standards of integrity and professionalism,” spokesperson Matthew J. Tragesser said in an emailed statement Tuesday. “USCIS is aware of an employee who was involved in a crash near Waitsfield. We are unable to comment further as the investigation is ongoing.”
According to McCarthy’s online profile, he works as an operations support specialist at USCIS and a management and program analyst at DHS. He did not respond to emails and phone calls requesting comment.

Emergency teams responded to the car crash on Main Street in the small Washington County town at about 12:42 a.m. on Nov. 23 and found a car embedded in the side of a red wooden building that houses three local businesses.
A passenger, identified as Katylyn Ruhl, 47, of Colchester was taken to Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin with serious injuries, said Sgt. Tylor Rancourt from the state police Berlin barracks. She has since been discharged.
Emergency personnel responding to the scene said they found two buildings damaged. 
Jared Young, chief of the Waitsfield-Fayston Fire Department, said the car first struck a building at 4457 Main Street and then crashed into the first floor of a  second building at 4429 Main Street. His department assisted the Mad River Valley Ambulance Service in securing the crashed vehicle and extricating the passenger. 
When the fire department left the scene around 2 a.m., the vehicle was still embedded in the building, Young said. State Police coordinated with a wrecker service to extract the vehicle from the structure later, he said.
The ambulance crew found the passenger in the car and the driver standing by the car in the building, which was stuck on the first floor, hanging over the lower level of the building, said Kevin Van Schaick, department head for rescue at the ambulance service, in an email.
“We had to gain access to the room below to support and stabilize the vehicle before it fell the rest of the way through the floor, as nearly all the joists were broken. The vehicle was kind of balanced on a stairwell wall. We installed some rescue struts to take the weight of the front of the car and forced the rear to rest on the foundation,” he added. The passenger was then safely removed from the car, he said.
Business owners said they were grateful there weren’t more injuries.
“Just the logic of that happening during the day or when there are people around, it would have been terrible,” said Darr, the owner of the first building that was struck, from where he runs Darrad Services, a 33-year-old computer service family business.
Jen Service, who rents a space in the second building for a massage service and a retail shop called Bridge &Main, said she learned about the car crashing into the building on Sunday morning when a friend texted her.
She and her husband headed over to check it out and initially thought somebody had just clipped the building. “But when we pulled around into the parking lot and saw the gaping hole in the side of the building, we were both just kind of struck,” she said.
While it’s not ideal to have to close for a few days right around the holidays, Service said she is glad the damage wasn’t worse. The retail shop and the massage room remain intact.
Kellee Mazer, who has owned the second building since 2022, has three tenants there. She said she is relieved no one was hurt and none of the merchandise was damaged despite the severity of the crash. She said she is waiting for insurance and engineering estimates and plans to “figure out what it takes” to fix the building.

(Courtesy image)University officials at Carroll College announced this week that Senior Vice President of Academic Affairs Jennifer Glowienka will become the college’s 20th president, beginning next July.
Glowienka has served as interim co-president of the college since June.
“I am deeply honored to be chosen as the 20th President of Carroll College, and I am humbled by the tremendous outpouring of support from the Carroll community,” Glowienka said in a statement. “I have dedicated my professional career to this remarkable institution, which prepares ethical leaders who engage the world with purpose and hope. I look forward to strengthening and expanding the ways Carroll fulfills its mission, serving learners across all stages of their educational journey. It has been a privilege to serve alongside Bishop Vetter over the past five months, and I look forward to continuing our strong partnership and shared leadership in the year ahead.”
Carroll’s last president, John Cech, retired at the end of the school year in May.
The university previously had announced that its seven-month national search for a new president had been successful with William Ruud, who had most recently served as president of Marietta College of Ohio from 2016-2023, named as the school’s 19th president.
However, less than a week before Ruud was scheduled to begin his tenure at Carroll, university officials announced that “due to unforeseen events,” he will not become the college’s next president.
The Carroll College Board of Trustees appointed Glowienka and Bishop Austin Vetter, Bishop of the Diocese of Helena, to serve as interim co-presidents for the 2025–26 academic year.
Glowienka’s elevation to college president makes her the first woman to hold a fully-appointed presidential role in the college’s 116-year history, according to the university.
Through a press release, the board of trustees stated her selection was unanimous, and drew broad support form the Presidential Search Committee comprising trustees, faculty, staff, alumni, students and community members.
“Dr. Glowienka embodies the values, mission, and future of Carroll College,” Joyce Stewart, Chair of the Board of Trustees and Co-Chair of the Presidential Search Committee, said. “Her deep understanding of higher education, her compassion, and her unwavering commitment to the people of Carroll have been evident throughout her more than twenty years of service. She leads with humility, wisdom, and purpose, and has earned the confidence and respect of the Carroll community.”
The university release said that during her brief tenure as co-president, Glowienka had “demonstrated strong, forward-looking leadership and a clear readiness to guide Carroll into its next chapter,” and that she understands the community and the school’s mission and potential.
“Dr. Glowienka has a real heart for Carroll College,” Bishop Vetter, said. “She’s wise, sincere, and faith-filled in how she leads. She listens well, brings people together, and always keeps what’s best for Carroll at the center. I truly believe the college’s future is bright with her guiding the way. Dr. Glowienka embodies what St. John Paul II hoped, that ‘Carroll College is meant to be a beacon to the Church in the Northwest.’”
Glowienka attended Boise State University for her undergraduate degree and holds a Ph.D. in evolutionary botany from the University of Colorado at Boulder.  She began her academic teaching career at Carroll in 2003 as an assistant professor of biology.
She was named the James J. Manion Endowed Professor in the Biological Sciences in 2018 and received Carroll’s Distinguished Scholar Award in 2008. Over her career, she has helped secure more than $1.5 million in external research grants and has played a key role in obtaining funding for infrastructure projects and programmatic start-up costs, strengthening Carroll’s academic offerings and long-term institutional capacity.
In 2018, Clowienka was named Assistant Dean of Instruction and she became Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs the following year.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JenniferGlowienka-top-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732

All three Teton County resorts have postponed their planned openings because of little snow and warm temperatures that have frustrated snowmaking.
The post Jackson Hole latest Wyoming ski area to delay opening for lack of snow appeared first on WyoFile .","All three Teton County ski resorts have delayed their season-opening dates due to a lack of snow and warm temperatures that have limited snowmaking.
The Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, the largest resort in Wyoming, announced Tuesday that it would not open its 60th anniversary season as scheduled on Friday. That followed news from Snow King Mountain and Grand Targhee Resort that they would postpone their season-opening dates because of limited snowmaking and little natural snowfall.
Ski runs across the county look sad, with only patches of man-made snow dotting the otherwise brown slopes. Grand Targhee above Alta delayed last Friday’s planned opening indefinitely and Snow King, the Jackson “Town Hill,” has backed off its commitment to a Dec. 5 start.
“Luckily, we have so many other assets that people can enjoy,” said Rick Howe, president of the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce. “I know a lot of the hospitality partners are talking about putting together some specials.”
At Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, officials painted a bleak picture.
“We have received 26 inches of snow mid-mountain through November, and warm conditions have affected snowmaking efforts, resulting in insufficient coverage to open terrain,” the resort posted on social media.
“It could still end up snowing, there just isn’t a whole lot of confidence right now.” Alan Smith
Workers will make snow when possible, monitor the snowpack as usual and announce an opening date “when conditions meet our standards for guest and staff safety,” officials stated. As the 60th anniversary year of the ski area, the resort anticipates the 2025-26 year to be a “milestone winter.”
At Grand Targhee, officials reminded old timers that they retired their tag-line “snow from heaven, not hoses” some time back. The resort turned to Open Snow forecaster Alan Smith last week to explain.
“November has been unseasonably warm with temperatures running 8-10°F above average through the first 16 days of the month,” he wrote. “This warmth combined with minimal natural snowfall since October has prevented an early season snowpack from building as is typical at this time of year.”
He predicted colder weather in the coming weeks, but perhaps still warmer temperatures than average, and some light snow. “It could still end up snowing,” he said of changing forecasts, “there just isn’t a whole lot of confidence [in that] right now.”
At Snow King, manager Ryan Stanley told the Jackson Hole News&Guide last week that it usually takes three weeks of snowmaking before the slopes are fit for skiing. None of the resorts have set a firm new opening date.
Across the rest of Wyoming, the Snowy Range Ski Area near Centennial has planned a Dec. 5 opening date, as has the White Pine ski area above Pinedale. Hogadon Basin Ski Area above Casper plans to open Dec. 6, according to its website.

About what’s known and who knows it. About why what’s known has never moved out of the realm of rumor and into the investigatory record.
Savannah Standing Bear’s family and friends have plenty of rumors, but not many answers. It’s been eight months since she disappeared from the Parmelee community on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, and the only thing that feels certain, they say, is the feeling that someone knows something.
 

 Telling their stories: MMIP in South Dakota

South Dakota Searchlight and ICT have partnered on a long-term project, funded in part by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism, that aims to provide a snapshot of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People cases by combining multiple sources of data.
The publications have also created a form for people to share a tip about their missing loved one, for possible inclusion in the project.



There’s also a nagging suspicion that something either won’t be shared with authorities, or won’t bring resolution if and when it’s reported.
“The feeling around here is you can murder a Native woman and get away with it,” said Hollis Flowers, a family friend who’s helped lead the push to keep Savannah’s story in the public eye as temperatures drop and another season of uncertainty begins.
There’s still hope, though, that an answer will emerge — especially after a celebration last week in Parmelee meant to mark Savannah’s 23rd birthday and keep her name on the tip of the community’s tongue. 
About a week before the event, Savannah’s mother, Gayla Smith, said the eldest of her two daughters has a heart for those who suffer. It’s a personality trait that’s been evident for as long as Smith can remember.
“She’d see people on the street, like when we would go to Rapid City,” Smith said, referring to the homeless population. “She’d see people like that, she would always want to go and help them.”
It’s Smith who’s suffered since March 24. That was the last day she heard from Savannah, setting off a police investigation and a series of searches that’s continued into the fall.
60% of missing South Dakotans are Native Americans
Savannah is one of an unclear number of Native Americans who’ve gone missing or been killed in the state of South Dakota. Nationally and internationally, the movement to draw attention to Indigenous people who disappear or die under violent circumstances is commonly called Missing and Murdered Indigenous People. 
South Dakota has taken some steps to track the cases in recent years. The South Dakota Missing Persons Clearinghouse, which launched in 2020, lists the names of those whose disappearances have been reported to law enforcement locally and passed along to the South Dakota Attorney General’s Office. On any given day, the list has at least 100 missing people, though the names shift in real time as people are found or go missing.
On Tuesday morning, Native Americans made up 60% of the 112 listed names. Of 59 missing females, 66% were Native American. The percentages, as compiled periodically by South Dakota Searchlight, typically fall in or near that range.
Around 8.5% of South Dakotans are Native American, according to census data.
Ten of the cases in the state missing persons clearinghouse as of Tuesday morning — Savannah’s among them — came from the Rosebud Sioux Tribal Police Department. That’s approximately 9% of current missing persons cases. Residents of the Rosebud Reservation represent less than 3% of South Dakota’s total population.
A mother’s warning
The last time she saw her daughter, Smith remembers warning her to stay at home and stay out of trouble. 
“But when I got up, she wasn’t in her room,” Smith said. 
In the days following, Smith said she heard different things from different family members. Some said that Savannah had ended up in the tribal jail and would be out later, but when Smith looked into it, her daughter hadn’t been in jail. 
So Smith went to check in with other relatives around the Rosebud Reservation. One relative in Parmelee said Savannah had “walked off” with a friend, Smith said, but it wasn’t a friend she recognized. 
‘Truly a homebody’
Smith and Standing Bear are close. They’ve always been.
One of Savannah’s distinguishing features, noted on the missing persons posters hung up around the Rosebud Reservation and posted to social media, is a tattoo of her mother’s first name under her right eye.
It’s now been eight months since Smith last heard from her daughter, since Savannah played with her nephew and since Savannah logged into the social media accounts where she loved to chat.

“She has a really big heart,” Smith said. “She’s my baby.”
She loves to listen to music, take photos and just hang out, Smith said. Her absence has left a void for her family. 
“She loved the sunset, taking pictures of it,” Smith said. “It’s really hard for me to see the sun go down without her.”
Tips don’t yield results
Tips have yet to aid in the search for Savannah, the family said.
Early this year, reports that Savannah was sighted at a Maverik gas station on the north side of Rapid City — two and a half hours from where she was last seen — led investigators to switch gears and focus on the Black Hills city. 
Police spent days combing over footage from the gas station, only to find the “sighting” was a different Native American woman, tribal officials said. 
“There’s no proof she ever left,” Flowers, the family friend, said in May. 
More frightening tips have emerged, as well. 
Once, the family heard that a body was found on the reservation. Family members jumped in to respond alongside law enforcement, but it turned out to be animal remains that had previously been reported and documented, according to officials with Rosebud Sioux Tribe Emergency Services.
Frustration grows
That all-for-naught excursion over animal bones was just one entry on a long list of disappointing searches for Savannah’s father, Severt Standing Bear, who was among those to accompany police when the alleged human remains were discovered. He told South Dakota Searchlight this month that he’s lost track of how many trips he’s made through the areas he thinks Savannah might be. It’s been that way since March.

“When I first heard it, my thought was, ‘Let’s go. We’ll go find her,’” he said.
He’s also passed along more tips than he can remember to the Rosebud Tribal Police and the detective assigned to Savannah’s case.
“I can’t say that I call them every day, but I bug the s— out of them,” Severt said. “To no avail.”
Rosebud Police Chief Waycee His Holy Horse did not reply to South Dakota Searchlight requests for an interview on Savannah’s case this month.
Having spent as much time searching as he has, Severt said, he’s come to understand the frustration felt by other families that go months, years or longer without knowing what happened to a missing loved one.
“These officials are always coming up and saying, ‘We’re doing these things,’” he said. “But I’ve learned and lived it now, and watched these other people that are missing their precious ones, too. They’re having the same darn problem.”
Communication, collaboration
Dolores “Totes” Waln, a Rosebud Sioux Tribal Council member, said her experience helping the family has exposed gaps in communication between emergency managers, police and the volunteers who’ve pitched in.
“When they were going to drain the dam, nobody knew about it until we heard it live on the air from the tribal president,” Waln said of a summer search effort from the tribe around a stock dam about 6 miles east of Parmelee, which was discussed on the radio. “And we’re all like, ‘What?’”
‘We can’t breathe until we know:’ One more search planned for missing member of Standing Rock Tribe

Shelby Lorenzo Homer, of the 4Corners K9 Search And Rescue nonprofit, said collaboration and communication has been a struggle for months. Recently, however, she worked with agents from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs on a search in October. 
“That’s when we really started seeing some communication and some collaboration,” Homer said.
In a statement, a BIA spokesperson said the agency is working closely with the FBI and Rosebud Sioux Department of Public Safety on Savannah’s case, coordinating search operations, offering a $5,000 reward through its Missing and Murdered Unit and “actively supporting Savanah’s family during this difficult time.”
After Savannah’s birthday celebration and candlelight vigil in Parmelee over the weekend, the hope is that extra attention can be combined with improved collaboration to yield results.
The hope goes all the way to the top in Rosebud. Tips sometimes land in the inbox of Rosebud Sioux Tribal President Kathleen Wooden Knife. When that happens, the president said, she passes them along to police.
Then, like everyone else, she waits.
“And my hope is that ‘OK, this time will be the time we’re going to find her,’” Wooden Knife said. “It hasn’t happened yet.”
The BIA’s $5,000 reward is open to anyone with information that can lead authorities to Savannah. The BIA can be reached at (833) 560-2065, by email at OJS_MMU@bia.gov, or by texting keyword BIAMMU and a tip to 847411.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled_Artwork-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732

(Getty Images)Idaho state and local health officials are investigating a recent increase in illnesses after people drank raw milk.
Since August, more than two dozen Idahoans have reported they’ve become ill after drinking raw milk, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare says.
At least 23 of those cases were from the bacteria Campylobacter, six of which were in kids under 12 years old. Three cases were from infections from the Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, also known as STEC.
Raw milk isn’t pasteurized, a process that involves heating the milk to kill bacteria — like Campylobacter, E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella — that can be present in raw milk. 
 What are the symptoms of infections linked to raw milk?

Symptoms of infections from bacteria that can be in raw milk include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever and dehydration. Complications can be severe, especially in people at higher risk such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems. 
Health officials encourage people who are feeling symptoms after recently drinking raw milk to seek medical care promptly. To report an illness or get more information, officials encourage people to contact their local public health district.

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)The State of Iowa is being sued by an attorney who claims she was fired from the Office of the State Public Defender for online comments made in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s murder in September.
Maria Ruhtenberg, an attorney for the State Public Defender, is suing the State of Iowa and State Public Defender Jeff Wright in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging violations of her First Amendment right to free speech.
According to the lawsuit, the state hired Ruhtenberg in October 2010 as a trial attorney for the Story County division of the Office of State Public Defender. In May 2013, Ruhtenberg became an assistant appellate defender based in Des Moines.
The lawsuit alleges that throughout her employment, Ruhtenberg’s performance reviews indicated she consistently met or exceeded expectations and that she was never subject to discipline until she was terminated.
The lawsuit alleges that on Sept. 15, 2025, she argued a case before the Iowa Supreme Court and later that day saw the news about the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

According to the lawsuit, Ruhtenberg, on her own time and using her own computer, posted a message on her private Facebook account about Kirk and engaged with other citizens on Facebook about Kirk’s political views.
In her posts, Ruhtenberg indicated her disagreement with the views Kirk had expressed about the Second Amendment and also indicated Kirk’s killer should go to prison.
On Sept. 15, according to the lawsuit, Ruhtenberg’s boss, Appellate Defender Martha Lucey, asked her to join a video conference with First Assistant Public Defender Kurt Swaim and Waterloo Public Defender Office Supervisor Aaron Hawbaker.
During the conference call, the lawsuit alleges, Swaim indicated someone had reported Ruhtenberg’s online comments and provided screenshots of some of her Facebook posts. About one hour after the conference call ended, according to the lawsuit, Lucey told Ruhtenberg she’d been fired and asked her to return all state-owned equipment to the office that afternoon.
According to the lawsuit, the letter Ruhtenberg was given notifying her of her termination stated that she weas being fired due to statements posted on social media — particularly the comments, “Live by the sword, die by the sword,” and, “You reap what you sow,” which were drawn from the Bible.
The state “did not fire Maria for any reason other than her statements posted to social media,” the lawsuit alleges, adding that the online comments “did not impede the performance of her job duties,” damage relations with her coworkers, or cause turmoil within the office.
According to the lawsuit, Ruhtenberg appealed her termination through the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, which later issued an order finding the state had failed to prove its interests in the efficient provision of public services outweighed Ruhtenberg’s interests in privately commenting on a matter of public concern.
According to the lawsuit, DIAL ordered the Office of State Public Defender to immediately reinstate Ruhtenberg.
The lawsuit claims the public defender’s “retaliation against Maria was part of a broader attempt by the state to suppress and punish free speech on the issues surrounding Charlie Kirk and his death.” It notes that several conservative Iowa legislators and Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds openly called for public employees to be fired for comments that were critical of Kirk or his views.
“Such deliberate and intentional actions are repugnant to the First Amendment and echo the political repression of the age of McCarthyism, when manufactured lists of ‘subversives’ were used to destroy the lives and reputations of people based on their political views,” the lawsuit alleges.
Ruhtenberg’s lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for violations of freedom of speech through retaliation.
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. The Iowa Attorney General’s Office said it does not comment on pending litigation.
In recent weeks, several other lawsuits have been filed by former Iowa public employees alleging they were fired for comments they made about Kirk.

After it was legalized in Vermont in 2015, natural burial remained encumbered by cemetery regulation — from grave depth to casket standards. Then in 2023, some advocates opened their own graveyard.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rewilding burial at the Vermont Forest Cemetery.","This story by Will Lindner was first published in The Bridge on Nov. 25, 2025.
She lies at the head of a path into the woods, deceased, supported by a low table and swathed in a white shroud adorned with images of nature. A homemade wreath of autumn leaves, ferns and flowers has been placed upon her. Loved ones gather under a gray October sky, their conversation subdued, but not darkened, by the task before them. They are resolute. In a moment they’ll shepherd her — their mother, grandmother, great-aunt, friend — deeper into the woods to her burial site. Her time upon the earth has ended; her time within the earth, and of the earth, will begin.
Paul Acciavatti, who serves as sexton, or cemetery manager, at the Vermont Forest Cemetery high above Roxbury village, provides instruction. They’ll use straps that pass beneath the body and the board she lies on, and will drape across the necks and shoulders of the bearers on either side. Four volunteers step forward — two young men and two young women. They prepare themselves, then lift. Someone quickly steps forward to support the rear, Paul withdraws the low table, and they set off, followed by the rest of the entourage — 15 or 20 people in quilted vests, sweaters and caps, jackets and jeans; clothing suitable for the season and the moment.
The path descends gradually, then bends to the left. They stop for a rest. Then soon they’re at the gravesite, which Paul has prepared. The mound of dirt beside it is covered with a tarp, and then by a dozen branches in golden foliage. 
“And look,” says someone, peering into the grave. “There are soft leaves on the bottom. It’s so pretty.”
The bearers set the board, and the shrouded figure whom they are honoring, across planks that span the opening. They step back. 
And there is silence. It lingers. … The moment has come. The forest is still.

Natural burial, legalized in Vermont in 2015, is a custom as old as the human race, but provisions have crept into cemetery regulations — such as a requirement to encase the deceased in concrete boxes to stabilize the ground surface — that thwarted the practice. Not that there was much demand for standard burial practices like embalming; and the use of formidable hardwood caskets reflected an entrenched revulsion at the thought of decomposition.
The 2015 law responded to more recent perceptions of our relationship with the environment. Through natural burial, those who wished could purposely merge with nature, helping sustain it as it sustains us. A summary of the law describes the practice as “the burial of unembalmed human remains . . . that rest in either no burial container or in a nontoxic, nonhazardous, plant-derived burial container or shroud [which thus] accelerates conversion of human remains to soil.”
But a problem remained: Vermont’s requirement that graves be at least five feet deep. The mycelial network — fungi that break down organic matter and convey the nutrients to surrounding organisms — operates closer to the surface. The five-foot depth defeated the purpose of legalizing natural burials.
Advocates rallied to amend the law. Among them was Michelle Hogle Acciavatti, a 2005 graduate of Bennington College who later worked in neuroscience and ethics at Boston Children’s Hospital. There, she developed an interest in aiding families facing the loss of a loved one. Over her career she has pursued both conventional and innovative paths to provide these services, working as a funeral director at Guare & Sons Funeral Home in Montpelier, and privately as a death doula.

“What I came to specialize in was less the dying,” she says, “and more what happens after people die, returning to people the skills for caring for their own dead instead of calling in a funeral director. And then I was really fascinated with natural burial and the ability to give our bodies back to the earth.”
When a bill emerged in 2017 to change Vermont’s minimum grave depth to three-and-a-half feet, Michelle (who is married to Paul Acciavatti) lobbied legislators and traveled around the state giving educational presentations on natural burial.
“I would say, like, ‘If you want this for yourself you have to contact your representative and say please pass this bill.’” she said. “We got it to the House floor, and to the Senate floor, and it passed overwhelmingly, because we had a ton of popular support.”
With natural burial now legal, and shallower mandatory depth consistent with its objectives, towns began offering this option in their municipal cemeteries. Calais, where resident Jennifer Whitman had championed the legislation, was one. In Montpelier, Green Mount Cemetery created a section for natural burials. It became a regional movement and now more than 70 cemeteries in New England permit it. 
Yet there’s a difference — irrelevant to some potential customers, but hugely significant to others — between a designated section in a town-maintained cemetery and an undeveloped setting where a body can merge with a robust natural environment. Nothing like that existed in Vermont. With the relevant laws changed, Michelle Acciavatti assumed someone would fill that void.
“I was off to mortuary school,” she says, “because I had this big idea that if I work in a funeral home I’ll be able to reach more people. I was working at Guare’s in Montpelier; we were the first funeral home in the state to have a natural-burial package, and Green Mount, right in our community, was adding a section. 
“Then COVID hit.”

People typically mourned together in funeral homes, but the pandemic quashed indoor gatherings. This dilemma for the aggrieved broadened Michelle’s thinking: natural burials, in safer outdoor spaces, could allow mourners to take upon themselves the ritual of burying the dead, personalizing the ceremony and meeting their own emotional needs.
“So,” she says, “in the summer of 2020, I left the funeral home to start a cemetery.” (As she speaks, with leafy graves near at hand, she sways her 10-month-old son, Nico, in the baby strap around her shoulders. He coos. The cycle of life vibrates like silver around us.)
The Acciavattis (returning to 2020) began looking for land. Real estate prices, besotted by the pandemic, careened wildly, but in the spring of 2021, a logging company that had planned to develop 56.7 acres on Beaver Meadow Road above Roxbury as a source for Norway spruce decided to sell it instead. 
“It had everything we needed,” Michelle recalls, “and it was reasonably priced.”
They used money that Paul’s late mother had left to him unexpectedly. They formed a nonprofit to own and operate the cemetery (headed by an active, participating board drawn largely from supporters whom Michelle had met while advocating for the legal reforms). There were some regulatory hurdles; neither the Act 250 district commission nor the Roxbury selectboard had encountered a land-use proposal like this before; Michelle recalls fielding a question about whether, if a tree blew down in a storm, it would catapult bodies out of the ground.

In the end, their applications were successful. Lots of work lay ahead of them (and still does): developing the gravel parking area at the entrance, the wooden shed there that serves as an office, the curvy dirt road down to another parking area that’s the main gathering spot, and trails that wind through the woods so that people can reach the places within that speak to them of solace and solitude, regeneration and kinship, soil and fungi and roots, and perhaps the spirits they perceive in the ecosphere. 
The Vermont Forest Cemetery opened on Oct. 7, 2023. Three days later, on Oct. 10, a person named Ron was buried there, the cemetery’s first permanent resident.

The cemetery’s property, which is proceeding toward conservation through Vermont Coverts, spans two hillsides that straddle the Third Branch of the White River. Its contours, and statutes applicable to all Vermont cemeteries, leave some areas unusable.
“We probably have about 20 burial acres,” Michelle estimates. 
But it’s all one forest. Michelle (now listed as its founder and head cemeterian), Paul (vice president and sexton), and Michelle’s father, Jim Hogle (formerly chair of Harvard’s biophysics program, but now the president and outreach coordinator for the forest cemetery) have noticed that a gravesite often becomes less central to returning visitors; they partake of the whole forest that has incorporated the person they loved. 
It’s also true that as seasons pass gravesites become less distinct. Conventional headstones are not permitted. People find ways to adorn graves, but the cemetery’s emphasis on natural materials means that eventually nature will take them over. Sometimes, Michelle acknowledges, “we have to compromise between the needs of the forest and the needs of the people.” 
A Marine veteran was buried recently, and the memorial coming from the Veterans Administration will not entirely conform to the cemetery’s standards. The forest will deal. 
Inevitably, then, there’s a degree of anonymity implicit in forest interments. But Paul Acciavatti or Treasurer and Cemeterian Bailey McLaughlin bury a detectable bronze marker, stamped with identifying information, in the center of each grave. 
“We keep track of everybody,” Michelle says. “It’s required. We maintain a map, which is duplicated in the town of Roxbury. Plus, it’s in the cloud.”
And the graves may not forever be distinguishable, but she doesn’t want people’s stories to disappear. There are plans to generate long-form obituaries to accompany the cloud map, recounting the lives of the people who have chosen an inconspicuous resting place.

This is a comparatively inexpensive form of burial, especially if the family conducts most aspects of it (cemetery staff prepares the gravesite). A current ballpark cost is about $2,700. Costs increase as the staff provides more labor, and winter burials cost more. The cemetery can connect people with artisans who offer appropriate wooden or wicker caskets if they prefer something more substantial than a shroud.
Buying in ahead of time — even when there’s no hint of mortality — helps the organization meet its expenses. It is not possible, however, to select a precise spot until death is nearing, for the forest is ever-changing and the cemetery must be able to respond to immediate, seasonal demand. But for family members who wish to lie close together, room can be left for a partner or partners once the first person is interred.
The VFC website also addresses questions about cremains, pet burial, and other concerns. Jim Hogle and Michelle Acciavatti are responsive to calls and emails.
In all, the VFC projects that there will be room for perhaps 2,000 burials in their woodland cemetery. As of mid-November, there were 37.
Most importantly, they hope they’re in the forefront of a movement.
“We’re not right for everybody,” Michelle acknowledges. “Some people tell us. ‘This is too rustic,’ or ‘It’s too far for us.’ Or, ‘I want to be buried where my friends are.’
“Also, I say that grief is a participatory emotion that demands action. We encourage you to come and help carry the body to the grave, to lower it down and to fill that grave. It’s healing. We have volunteers to support you if you can’t or don’t want to do that. But there are cemeteries, like Green Mount, where it’s more full service.
“My hope, though, is that every community will have a place dedicated to natural burial that responds to the need of the community. I hope we don’t remain the only site for long.”

The contemplative silence, and the soft weeping that accompanies it, ends as naturally as it had begun. Recognizing that it’s time, Paul says, “When you’re ready, and only when you’re ready, have folks lift on the straps and Bailey and I will pull the boards out from under, and then you can slowly let her down.”
He waits for a moment; then, “One, two, three, lift.”
They remove the planks, and her descendants ease her to the leaf-strewn bottom, three and a half feet below. Then Paul shows people how to take up the beech boughs from atop the dirt pile and place them down upon her. It’s almost festive, with the golden leaves flickering in the air.
Someone calls out, “We love you, Mom.” 
Then people take up the shovels and hoes the cemetery has provided, and begin filling the grave. The first shovelfuls weigh heavily, but as she fades from view the pace quickens, and within a few minutes the dirt has reached ground level. They finish by spreading the topsoil the staff had set aside when they prepared the grave, which has more nutrient value than the deeply subterranean dirt and will help reconnect the surface vegetation.
The burial is done. 
Now the decoration starts! They pile shimmering green spruce and pine boughs on the grave, and overspread the boughs with sunflowers, baby’s breath, and leaves of red, brown, and orange. They’ve brought lemon balm and lavender from her garden, small fragments of nature that ornamented her home. They build delicate stone spires. 
They have transformed the somber grave into an artistic creation, and they’ve done it together. They stand silently for a moment, regarding their work, then one of the daughters clasps her hands and says, “She really would have loved this.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Nearly half of likely Democratic voters still aren’t sure who they’d choose in Rhode Island’s 2026 gubernatorial primary, according to the latest Ocean State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center. 
A sizable 42% of Democratic primary voters considered themselves “undecided” in the survey released Monday. But former CVS executive Helena Buonanno Foulkes holds a slight, early lead in a hypothetical Democratic primary with Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and incumbent Gov. Dan McKee. 
Of the 359 respondents who are likely to hit the polls in the Democratic primary slated for September 2026, 29% said they would back Foulkes.
Shekarchi, who has not publicly committed to a run but has expressed interest in media interviews, secured 13% of support from the surveyed respondents.
Limping along with slightly lower polling numbers is McKee with support from only 11% of primary voters — his latest dismal showing in a string of polls, especially in concert with the poll’s other numbers for McKee, which demonstrate a broad and more diffuse dissatisfaction with his leadership both within and across party lines.
How low can McKee go? Poor polling numbers continue to dog governor

“McKee is very unpopular among likely Democratic primary voters and suffers from low job approval among Rhode Islanders overall,” the survey’s introduction notes.
McKee’s 11% share of potential voter support is a drop from the 19% he garnered in the survey center’s previous poll released in September. 
The current governor was also viewed less favorably by survey respondents than his two potential opponents, with only 15% of Democratic primary voters saying they approved of him as a gubernatorial candidate. Another 54% said they disapproved, while 22% of respondents were neutral about McKee.    
As for McKee’s current performance, only 21% of respondents expressed satisfaction, while another 72% disapproved. The report notes that McKee’s approval has gone “relatively unchanged” since the September poll. 
McKee’s net favorability — defined as the percentage of respondents with a favorable opinion minus those with an unfavorable opinion — was the lowest of all three potential candidates, at -39. 
Shekarchi’s net favorability was +5 and Foulkes’ was +2.
The poll also asks respondents to identify their ideological leanings. McKee saw the lowest amounts of favorability in the primary — 3% — from both “socialists” and “conservatives/libertarians,” as the poll labels them. His campaign’s highest level of support came from “moderate” primary voters, at 27%, followed by “progressive” voters at 11%. 
McKee’s campaign spokesperson Christina Freundlich said in an emailed statement Tuesday, “Rhode Islanders don’t govern by polls, and neither does Governor McKee.”
“While Donald Trump continues to tank our economy and gut Rhode Islanders’ healthcare, Governor McKee is doing the job — lowering school absences, reducing overdose deaths, and driving real economic growth,” Freundlich said. “Polls come and go, but Governor McKee is focused on delivering for Rhode Island families.”
Less in the thick of the fray was Shekarchi, who respondents viewed generously, as he had the lowest percentage — only 16% — of respondents who viewed him unfavorably. But the House speaker was also the least known to respondents, with 38% saying they don’t know enough about him. Another 21% of potential voters said they viewed Shekarchi favorably.    
Shekarchi, in an emailed statement Monday, did not explicitly affirm his candidacy but said that the race remains “wide open even though the two announced candidates have previously run statewide.” 
“In 2026, I will continue bringing people together to address affordability in health care, housing, cost of living, and attracting and retaining good jobs in Rhode Island,” Shekarchi wrote.
Foulkes attracted almost equal shares of like, dislike and disinterest: 23% viewed her favorably, 21% unfavorably, 28% were neutral, and 27% were unsure what to think of her.  
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for the Foulkes campaign, wrote in a Tuesday statement that the poll “confirms what Helena already knows from countless conversations across our state: people are hurting, they’re being priced out of the lives they’ve built, and our leaders aren’t stepping up.” 
The numbers didn’t change drastically when pollsters asked respondents to decide based on a race with only two of the three candidates. Without Foulkes in the running, 29% of potential voters said they would go for Shekarchi, while McKee would inch up to 15%. But most voters would remain undecided at 50% — numbers not dissimilar from scenarios in which either McKee or Shekarchi exited the race, with more than 40% undecided voters in both circumstances, according to the poll. 
Bridge and hospital concerns inform McKee numbers
Pollsters also revisited the Washington Bridge closure which continues to darken people’s perceptions of the McKee administration.  
Among respondents, 68% rated the McKee administration’s public communications about the bridge issue as “poor” or “very poor.” Another 21% rated the McKee administration’s performance as “fair” and only 6% called it “good” and 1% “very good.” 
‘Fish or cut bait,’ federal bankruptcy judge tells prospective buyers for Roger Williams and Fatima

Another ongoing issue examined by pollsters was the protracted sale process of two of the state’s safety net hospitals: Our Lady of Fatima Hospital in North Providence and Roger Williams Medical Center in Providence. Current owner Prospect Medical Holdings has not been able to finalize the sale process first approved in 2024 and is now threatening to close the two facilities.
While only about 7% of respondents reported that they or a family member used either hospital in the past year, respondents were still keen on the idea of state intervention, with 67% saying state officials should “definitely” or “probably” intervene to keep Roger Williams open. Another 25% were not in favor of state intervention, and said the state should “definitely” or “probably” not get involved.
Numbers were similar in the case of Fatima, with 67% in favor of state intervention and 27% opposed.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)On Monday night at Temple Emanu-El in Helena, more than a dozen volunteers packed boxes filled with a lesson plan called “Standing Up to Hate,” created by the Montana Jewish Project.
The 50-to-90-minute lesson includes a book based on a true 1993 incident in Billings where neo-Nazis threw a brick through a Jewish family’s window, which was displaying a menorah.
This came during a high level of violence and hate directed toward multiple minority groups in Billings. In response to the brick being thrown, many community members cut out paper menorahs and put them in their windows, regardless of whether they were celebrating Hanukkah or not.
The lesson plan also includes discussion questions, activities and links to other resources. Teachers request the boxes on their own, Montana Jewish Project executive director Rebecca Stanfel said. The organization makes 50 per year and the demand is high, she said, adding that cities and towns across Montana have requested their materials as well.
“It’s really important to our mission to not only anchor and build Jewish community life, but to do education and outreach,” Stanfel said. “The curriculum is not about anti-semitism, specifically, it’s about not bullying.”
The work is having a real impact, organizers said, with teachers expressing excitement about teaching the lesson. It also includes instructions for a Dreidel game, which volunteers packaged up in a small kit as well.
The age ranges for the classrooms are all over the place, they said, and the curriculum can be adapted to a variety of situations.
“It’s just really nice to see the sorts of curiosity in the comments from teachers that are requesting these boxes because they’re so excited about the opportunity,” said Kaelie Giffel, MJP’s event coordinator. “They’re writing these mini essays where they’re like, ‘I’m going to teach all of my students about these things.’ And I’m like, wow, that’s actually so cool.”
The event also drew volunteers from outside the Jewish community, including Kathy Chambers, a member of First Presbyterian Church in Helena.
She’s a former school teacher too, and pointed to how things like this can help out educators.
“It’s invaluable,” Chambers said. “As a teacher there’s so many things to do and if someone can make it easier for you, that’s great.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MJPBoxes1-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732
,DC,2025-11-25 23:01:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Suit to block Education Department closure expanded amid agency transfers plans,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/suit-block-education-department-closure-expanded-amid-agency-transfers-plans,,"WASHINGTON — A coalition suing to block President Donald Trump’s efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education expanded its lawsuit Tuesday to include objections to recent interagency agreements to shift the department’s responsibilities to other Cabinet-level agencies.The alliance of unions and school districts also added a major disability rights advocacy group to its ranks in the amended complaint that detailed how the department’s Nov. 18 announcement of six interagency agreements could harm students.The agreements to transfer several Education responsibilities to four other departments drew swift backlash from Democratic officials, labor unions and advocacy groups, who questioned the legality of the transfers and expressed concerns over the harms that would be imposed on students, families and schools as a result. “Scattering Department of Education programs among agencies with no expertise in education or lacking key agency infrastructure will reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of these programs and will prevent the type of synergy that Congress intended to achieve by consolidating federal education activities in one cabinet level agency,” the coalition, represented by the legal advocacy group Democracy Forward, wrote in the amended complaint. The expanded suit asks for declaratory and injunctive relief against what it describes as the administration’s “unlawful effort to dismantle the Department of Education,” pointing to the interagency agreements, mass layoffs at the department earlier this year and implementation of an executive order that called on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department.  The Education Department clarified in fact sheets related to the agreements  with the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services and State that it would “maintain all statutory responsibilities and will continue its oversight of these programs.”Axing the Education DepartmentTrump has sought to take an axe to the 46-year-old department, saying he wants to send education “back to the states.” Much of the funding and oversight of schools already occurs at the state and local levels.The original lawsuit, filed in March in Massachusetts federal court, was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts. The Tuesday filing adds The Arc of the United States, an advocacy group for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, as a plaintiff. Earlier this year, the case was consolidated with another March lawsuit from Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.  “It’s no surprise that blue states and unions care more about preserving the DC bureaucracy than about giving parents, students, and teachers more control over education and improving the efficient delivery of funds and services,” Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.Supreme Court temporarily greenlit Trump planIn May, a federal judge in Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction in the consolidated case, blocking the administration’s efforts, including a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and a directive to transfer some services to other federal agencies.A federal appeals court upheld that order in June, prompting the administration to ask the Supreme Court to intervene. The nation’s highest court in July temporarily suspended the lower courts’ orders, allowing the administration to proceed, for now, with those dismantling efforts.",,,,2025-11-25 18:59:04.102732

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, speaks to the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce on Monday. He said the sweeping budget bill known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" holds numerous benefits for Alaska. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, delivered a vigorous defense on Monday of the Trump administration’s controversial budget and tax bill and its resource development decisions.
The bill, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is a cornerstone of President Donald Trump’s policies. In a speech to the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce, Sullivan said it is so beneficial to Alaska that it could be called the “Alaska Opportunity Act.” 
“I think it’s going to turn out to be one of the most important pieces of legislation for our state in a very long time,” he said.
Congress passed the bill over the summer, and Trump signed it into law on July 4.
Sullivan, in his speech to the chamber, listed several funding commitments in the bill that he said will benefit Alaska, including commitments to the U.S. Coast Guard and its icebreaker fleet, to the military branches and to the Federal Aviation Administration.
But much of Sullivan’s speech was devoted to arguments trying to counter criticism of the bill’s impacts to federal health and public assistance programs.
Accusations that the bill cut Medicaid and other health care programs, in Alaska and elsewhere, are inaccurate, said Sullivan, who has already been the subject of political attack ads on the subject.
“This bill, we are very confident, is going to strengthen, not weaken, Alaska’s health care system,” he told the chamber audience.
Rather than cut benefits, the bill cuts waste, Sullivan said. There are several special provisions that protect Alaska from some of the biggest changes in the safety net, he added.
Those changes that do apply to Alaska, such as a 20-hour-per-week work requirement for benefits, are fair, he said. Alaska expanded eligibility to its Medicaid program under Gov. Bill Walker.

	“If you’re a young man and you’re able-bodied, you have no dependents and you’re 28 years old, and you’re on the Medicaid expansion population, and you’re told to go work or train or volunteer for 20 hours, and you don’t do it, you lose your Medicaid,” Sullivan said. “That’s not a cut. That is a choice.”
But several experts say the cumulative effects of the bill will force people off of health coverage through price increases and bureaucratic requirements.
“HR1 was designed to push Americans out of Medicaid in order to reach cost savings,” state Rep. Genevieve Mina, D-Anchorage, said by email, referring to the bill number. Mina, who chairs the House Health and Social Services Committee, listened to Sullivan’s speech.
The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 25,000 Alaskans will lose health insurance coverage through the combined provisions in the bill. That amounts to a 3% reduction in the insured population. Nationally, about 10 million people are expected to lose health insurance coverage, according to the foundation.
Mina said the state will face increased costs through a different provision: the requirement that eligibility redetermination decisions be made every six months instead of annually, as is the case now. Requiring the state Division of Public Assistance to make those determinations twice a year instead of annually will add to the administrative burden and potentially increase backlogs that are already a problem in the state, she said.
In an August presentation at a conference in Juneau, the head of the Alaska Hospital and Healthcare Association also warned of thousands of people losing health coverage simply because they will be priced out of it.
Jared Kosin, president of the association, and others speaking at the event said the failure of Congress to extend tax benefits for people insured under the Affordable Care Act will cause premiums to skyrocket and prompt people to drop coverage.
Those benefits, known as enhanced premium tax credits, are in addition to the original tax subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Pending expiration of those credits has already caused Affordable Care Act policy premiums to rise dramatically for small businesses and self-employed Alaskans. Without an extension of the credits, which expire at the end of the year, premiums for insurance obtained under the Affordable Care Act will more than double nationally, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The issue was a major factor in the recent record-long federal government shutdown. Congressional Democrats tried unsuccessfully to extend the enhanced credits.
‘Aggressive’ oil leasing schedule
Energy development was another theme of Sullivan’s pitch for the bill.
He touted its mandatory oil and gas lease sales for the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, on the western side of the North Slope, and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, on the eastern side of the North Slope, as well as in federal waters of Cook Inlet.

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, touted an “aggressive” lease sale schedule for federal waters of Cook Inlet and federal territory on the North Slope. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)
 

	Those lease sales will be held on a near-annual basis, Sullivan said, a schedule that he termed “very aggressive.” He said the bill will prevent future administrations from cutting back on leasing.
“The feds have to do it,” he added. “So if there’s another president coming along in three years saying, ‘Hey, I want to shut down Alaska in terms of executive orders,’ can’t do it, right? This is in the law for the next 10 years.”
That was a reference to former President Joe Biden, who Sullivan said “probably killed thousands of jobs on Day One” through environmental executive orders. The Biden policies were immediately reversed by President Donald Trump on the first day of his second term, notably in an executive order titled Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential.
“Whether you like President Trump, whether you don’t like President Trump, doesn’t matter. Read this executive order. This is an unmitigated good for our state,” Sullivan said.
He also touted the bill’s provisions providing incentives for natural gas infrastructure. That will help advance the pipeline project that has been long desired by generations of Alaska leaders and would take now-stranded natural gas from the North Slope to a tidewater terminal in Southcentral Alaska for shipment by tanker to Asian markets from there.
Sullivan credited Trump with pushing for the gas pipeline, a megaproject proposed and promoted since the 1970s but never deemed economic. The administration has “just been pedal to the metal” on pressing Asian governments to support the project, the senator said.
“And, I will tell you, I’ve never seen more momentum and us closer,” he said.
He acknowledged public skepticism about the gas pipeline’s prospects. “I know I get the eye roll here, again. We’ve been talking about this for half a century, true, but what’s the alternative?” he said. Imported natural gas, he said, will be much more costly than natural gas produced in-state.
But renewable energy development, long considered important for supporting Southcentral Alaska communities facing possible shortages in Cook Inlet natural gas supplies, fared poorly in the bill.
The bill gutted federal support for renewable energy development that is keenly desired in much of Alaska, especially rural areas where fossil fuel-based energy prices are high and supplies are precarious. The bill mandates a phase-out to tax credits that help make wind and solar energy projects affordable. And the bill’s provisions added to Trump administration actions that canceled $280 million in previously awarded Alaska environmental grants, about half of which was for renewable energy projects. Some of those projects had been destined for remote rural communities otherwise dependent on diesel fuel delivered by barge or airplane.
Sullivan’s colleague, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, negotiated a compromise that kept the renewable energy tax credits in place for 12 months rather than repealing them outright. However, shortly after President Trump signed the bill, he and members of his administration issued orders that reduced federal support for renewable energy projects. Murkowski later said she felt “cheated” because it undermined her compromise.
Environmentalists have been particularly critical of the energy provisions.
“This legislation is regarded as one of the most destructive environmental bills to date,” the Alaska Center, an Anchorage-based conservation group, says on its website. The bill “puts an end date on tax credits for wind and solar energy, and repeals millions in unspent funds for everything from pollution control to displacement assistance for those on the front lines of the climate crisis.”

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner says reforms are needed to fix what he describes as a “Biden-era slush fund.”
These clashing perspectives will soon be tested in federal court. 
Washington and other states on Tuesday sued the Trump administration, challenging changes it made this month to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care program.
The administration wants to shift funding away from permanent supportive housing to transitional housing assistance with work or service requirements. 
Permanent supportive housing assists people with disabilities in getting stable housing and resources, while transitional housing is temporary help before people move into something more permanent. 
Before the change, about 90% of Continuum of Care funding went to permanent housing. Now, it would make up 30% of the nearly $4 billion program.
The federal change risks sending 170,000 people across the country into homelessness, according to Politico, citing internal agency documents. Washington stands to lose tens of millions of dollars from the federal government.
The decision is also a blow to so-called housing first policies, which focus on getting vulnerable people into permanent housing before addressing their other needs, like mental health or substance use treatment and finding a job.
Washington, along with 19 other states and Washington, D.C., filed suit over the move in federal court in Rhode Island on Tuesday. The states are seeking a preliminary injunction to block it temporarily while litigation proceeds. They argue the Trump administration needed to get congressional authorization and that rulemaking was required to make such a policy change.
“These funds help people in Washington going through some of the most difficult situations that you can possibly imagine,” Brown, a Democrat, said in a press conference Tuesday. “But the changes that HUD is attempting to make will throw so many people into crisis.”
Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, also a Democrat, said in a statement it was “yet another cruel attack by the Trump administration on our most vulnerable Washingtonians.”
Turner, the Housing and Urban Development secretary, said in a statement earlier this month that the changes would “promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
About $120 million per year in these federal grants comes to Washington to provide permanent supportive housing. Most of the money goes to the state’s most populous counties: King, Pierce, Snohomish, Spokane and Clark. The remaining $25 million is spread across more rural counties.
Seattle and King County, for example, receive $67 million per year to house about 4,500 residents. City and county officials are making contingency plans. 
But “there is no possible way that the state of Washington or all of these organizations could fill the holes that are going to be created,” Brown said.
When news of the Trump administration’s plans leaked in late September, housing leaders in the state Legislature said the move would loom over next year’s short legislative session.
Turner’s agency also added requirements for accessing the competitive funding, including not awarding applicants that “use a definition of sex as other than binary in humans.” And locales will be dinged if they don’t enforce the Trump administration’s favored homelessness policies, like bans on public camping. 
Applications for the funding are due Jan. 14, with awards likely in the spring. The grants could arrive long after organizations have already seen their previous funding expire. 
Some congressional Republicans have also expressed concern.

In a letter late last month, nearly two dozen GOP lawmakers told Turner that major changes “should be implemented carefully to avoid destabilizing programs that serve individuals with severe disabilities related to mental illness, chronic health conditions, or substance use disorders, as well as seniors with disabilities.”
The money goes to state, local and tribal governments, as well as public housing authorities and nonprofits. Across the country, about 7,000 awards are expected to be issued.
Washington has now brought 45 lawsuits in the first 10 months of President Donald Trump’s second term.

Two months after the job offer, the former library director has not signed a contract due to an unresolved lawsuit against the town and a former Board of Trustees chair. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trouble in the stacks: Pawlet divided over rehiring of library director and resignation of staff.","Libraries are normally an oasis of calm but the Pawlet Public Library lately has been the center of a yearslong drama.
The community rift is centered around a former library director Lyndsi Barnes’ tenure,  which ended in 2023 after the Library Board of Trustees decisively voted to dismiss her. Two years later, the Pawlet Library Board of Trustees voted three to two on Sept. 16 to offer Barnes back her job, the Manchester Journal first reported.
At issue is whether Barnes was wrongfully terminated, with her supporters arguing she is an asset to the library after working in a previous job at the New York Public Library. Her detractors call for a new face in the post.
The kerfuffle left the library in a lurch after two staffers quit, leaving the library without leadership or paid staff, the Manchester Journal first reported. 
Barnes’ role as director highlights the crucial role libraries play in helping define a community’s identity. In Pawlet, Barnes became a lightning rod for complaints that she shirked her duties and created barriers for homeschooling and other community groups to use the library. 
The Pawlet Public Library Board of Trustees Chair Cory Rail wrote in a statement that the board voted to rehire Barnes due to her qualifications and vision for library services and programs.
Unresolved lawsuit
Now, two months after receiving the job offer, Barnes has not signed a contract and resumed leadership of the library due to an unresolved lawsuit she has against the town and a former Board of Trustees chair.

The slew of charges in the suit include wrongful termination, breach of an implied employment contract, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
Barnes’ lawyer Richard Bowen said they are working with the town to come to an agreement over her claims before Barnes would sign a contract and return to work.
“I think that the library would benefit from getting Lyndsi back to work as soon as possible,” Bowen said in an October interview. “Libraries are important anchors in our community, and I think that that’s something that we want to be able to support and make sure that they survive through some difficult times that they’re facing.”
The town of Pawlet’s lawyer James Carroll denied a request for comment due to the pending litigation. 
Community response
This past summer, the community began rallying around the issue. Letters to the board poured in from volunteers and donors during the interview process and after Barnes was rehired, voicing concern that bringing back the former library director during an active lawsuit would sow more division. Community members told the board they would halt volunteering efforts and monetary support for the library if Barnes took the helm of the library. 
A local petition started by Arena Heidi, of nearby Danby, has called for the library board or Pawlet selectboard to reverse the decision to rehire Barnes, as “the vast majority of the library community simply wants to leave division and difficulties behind and move forward with someone new.” 
The petition garnered 91 signatures as of Monday, of which 38 Pawlet residents signed and 53 residents of neighboring towns signed. 
In a statement, Board Treasurer Lauren Herbert acknowledged two difficult years.“While outside voices are always welcome, decisions about our public services — especially those funded and used by local residents — should be guided by the people who live here,” Herbert wrote.
Staff resign
Nina Dubois, the community resource coordinator, resigned on Sept. 20, citing two years of community conflict and concern for the future of the library given the former director’s appointment. 
“There are two sides, both of which feel as though they have made the right decision. In this case, that means rehiring an old director or choosing not to participate in the future of the library,” Dubois wrote in an email to VTDigger. “It is my hope that all parties involved look at the role they played.” 
Adele Santwire, the former assistant librarian of 10 years, resigned two days later on Sept. 22. Santwire said that issues with Barnes’ leadership started a year into her term as director, when she took extensive paid-time off, opened the library late, closed it early and asked the library staff to cover her shifts often.
Kat Zemmel, a homeschooling parent and group coordinator, said Barnes’ imposed onerous rules and restrictions on local groups meeting, including proposed charges for the use of the library space during open hours.
On the other hand, Judy Lake of Pawlet said the former library director was “railroaded” by the Board of Trustees in 2023, and Lake said she will support the direction of the library under Barnes.
“I think it’s going to be great,” Lake said. “I think the donations will grow. I think they’ll have events that can fundraise, and it just takes time in these small towns.”
One of the dissenting board members, Joni Lee, said she voted against rehiring Barnes’ because she worried it would not help mend Pawlet’s “fractured community.” But, ultimately, her hope is that “the library can once again return to being the heart of the community and that in this next chapter, that everyone who comes in the door feels welcome,” Lee said.

Laura Kelly this holiday season is collaboration to resolve Kansas’ water issues, she said Tuesday at the annual Christmas tree donation at Cedar Crest.
“Recognizing that that is not a political win or loss for anybody, but absolutely essential for the future in this state,” Kelly said. 
In August Kelly elevated water to her highest priority. She’s concerned with creating a long-term sustainable strategy that recognizes the falling levels in the Ogallala Aquifer. 
And the Democrats? 
“I hadn’t really thought about what the Democrats themselves could give me,” Kelly said. “There’s probably not a lot in this upcoming session. What they could do is get some really good candidates for November 2026, break that supermajority so that regardless of who the next governor is there will be an absolute need to work together to get anything done.” 
Republicans currently have a supermajority in both the House and Senate, enough to override the governor’s vetoes.

Charlotte Cooper, granddaughter of Dave Bruton — the Kansas Forest Service liaison with the Kansas Christmas Tree Growers Association — isn’t entirely sure what she wants this holiday season either. Lucky for Cooper, Santa’s elves encouraged him to make business cards, so her mom can e-mail Santa with her list. She even got the chance to talk to Santa at Tuesday’s event. 
“This is a good group,” Santa said. “Santa always likes to reward the good people, and tell the others they have time —”
“Do you live in the North Pole?” Cooper interjected. 
“Most of the time. When I’m not living down here, checking up on children,” Santa said. 
Santa, Cooper and others rode in a replica of a Wells Fargo stagecoach up to the governor’s mansion to deliver the donated Christmas decorations.

Two six-year-old Percheron horses carried the stagecoach. They replaced Bess and Betty, who carried the stagecoach for years before. The ceremony was the horses’ first large crowd, and they acted “about what you would guess,” according to Robin Dunn of Dunn’s Landing farm near Wellsville. 
When asked if the new horses would be able to replace Bess and Betty, Dunn responded with a swift “no.” Then she paused. 
“Well, I don’t know,” Dunn said. “It’ll take about 15 years. In 15 years ask me that question again.”

On top of the stagecoach was an 8½-foot tall Scotch pine grown on the Strawberry Hill Christmas Tree Farm in Lawrence. Each year one farm from the Kansas Christmas Tree Association donates the tree.
According to Mark Walther, part of the family who runs Strawberry Hill, his late brother Mitch volunteered.
“Well, it’s kind of a sad story,” Walther said. “So Mitch stepped up and unfortunately passed away. So then it’s like, well, shoot, because he didn’t tell me which tree it was.” 
Mitch died unexpectedly in July. When the time came, the family went to the field and chose the tree with the nicest height and shape.

This is the third year that Chris Seets from Chris’s Tree Lodge in Abilene presented a wreath. 
“Hopefully, this is the first time I get to actually meet the governor. I’ve always handed it to lieutenant governors in the past,” Seets said shortly before the presentation. 
Perhaps Santa overheard her comment, because Seets was called up to present her wreath to Kelly in front of the mansion.
“I was just so excited. I think I spoke to her. I don’t know, I’m not sure,” Seets said after. 
After the carriage rolled in and Seets presented her wreath, the group entered the mansion to watch the tree be placed in a corner. Kelly adorned it with an ornament that recognized Charles Robinson, Kansas’ first governor. 
Kelly thanked the farmers, volunteers, and families who made the event happen. Cooper responded with a toothless grin. 
“When did you lose that?” Kelly asked.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said his recent trade mission to southeast Asian countries revealed “exciting market” opportunities for a variety of agricultural products. 
Naig, speaking to reporters after the governor’s turkey pardoning Tuesday, said Thanksgiving is a “unique time” for Iowans to think about “what it takes” for farmers to feed the nation. 
He said there’s a lot of risk and variability in the farm economy, especially as producers face high input costs and low market prices. Some of this might be alleviated by soybean purchases with China or a federal assistance package for farmers, which the Trump administration said might come in the next couple of weeks.
“I still think that there’s a need to help farmers bridge the gap into next year,” Naig said. “This is a time where they’re paying bills for next year’s crop, they’re looking at financing for next year, so it’s a critically important time to get some certainty around that.”

Ag industry leaders have also pushed for strengthened trade relationships in countries outside of China, which is historically the largest buyer of soybeans. Naig led a trade mission to Vietnam in 2024 and the nation issued several memorandums of understanding this fall to purchase more U.S. commodities like corn and soybeans. 
Naig said Vietnamese ethanol representatives also visited the state in October and the nation plans to ramp up to a 10% ethanol blending rate in the new year. 
Considering the already-established relationships with Vietnam, Naig said the recent trip there was about “going to the next level.” 
According to a news release about the trade mission, Vietnam purchased more than $4.5 billion of agricultural products from the U.S. in 2024. Iowa exported about $223.4 million in ag products to Vietnam in 2024. 
In 2024, Indonesia purchased $3.8 billion of agricultural goods from the U.S. and Iowa exported about $297.6 million to the country. 
The trade delegation, which returned home Sunday, was organized by the Iowa Economic Development Authority and included representatives from grain and protein groups in Iowa. 
Naig said the recent trip to Indonesia was “more of an exploratory” trip, considering Iowa delegates had not visited the country in “many, many years.” 
Naig said both nations are growing at “significant” rates and offer “exciting markets” for corn, soybean, ethanol, beef and pork. 
According to the news release from the economic development authority, the delegation visited the capital cities of both countries for trade policy discussions, market briefings and business development meetings.
“Good markets, but a lot more that could come from having free trade agreements with both countries,” Naig said.

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Industrial Commission on Tuesday gave the state bank a green light to proceed with two loan programs aiming to provide relief to agricultural producers hit by a combination of tariffs, low commodity prices and high costs, as well as a series of summer storms. 
The state-owned Bank of North Dakota is setting aside $300 million for the 2026 Farm Financial Stability Loan Program, the larger of the two initiatives. Farmers and ranchers who experienced an operating shortfall in 2024 or 2025 will be eligible to apply for low-interest loans through their local banks and credit unions. 
“Ag is still the foundation of every single community in our entire economy in North Dakota,” said Gov. Kelly Armstrong, chair of the Industrial Commission, which oversees the Bank of North Dakota. “In these uncertain times, we need to help stabilize that foundation the best we can.”
Kaylen Hausauer, financial institutions market manager for the Bank of North Dakota, said the final interest rates available for the loans will likely be around 4.3% or 4.4%, below the bank’s current base rate of 7%. Up to 75% of the loan amount will be provided by the Bank of North Dakota, but ag producers will apply through their local lender. 
“This fits right in our mission,” said Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota. “It is a balanced help for our agricultural industry, and it is a time when the industry is extremely stressed.”
The loans will help agricultural producers restructure existing debts, convert recent operating losses into loans with extended repayment schedules and ensure they have money on hand going into the 2026 planting season. 
“We’re headed in the right direction, and I do believe that we as a state probably have the most to offer our farmers and ranchers by providing this type of backstop,” said Doug Goehring, agriculture commissioner and member of the Industrial Commission alongside Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley. 
Armstrong said there are farmers in the state who would be unable to continue farming next year because of their financial situation if this program were not implemented. 
Federal trade, health policies add to concerns for North Dakota farmers, state ag commissioner says

The Department of Agriculture’s mediation program is aware of a number of farmers who are having financial problems as a result of storm damage, market headwinds and other factors, Goehring said. 
“It’s all compounded,” Goehring said. 
The second program approved Tuesday, the 2026 Grain Inventory Loan Program, will help local farmers who are stuck with leftover inventories from the 2025 harvest. Farmers can apply for short-term financing of the leftover crop, allowing them to hold on to it until prices improve. 
“The short-term loans will benefit all producers, especially young and beginning farmers, who often lack the equity and working capital of older, more established producers,” Armstrong said.
The Bank of North Dakota has allocated $100 million for the program. The loan rates are slightly below market rate. 
“We don’t want to incentivize them to hold on to the grain longer than needed,” Hausauer said. “But it is a tool to use if needed.”

These programs are only possible because of North Dakota’s unique advantage of having a state-owned bank with the resources to provide relief to the agriculture industry in times of stress, the governor said. 
“We’re committed to deploying those tools as needed to provide a lifeline to the hard-working farmers and ranchers who grow the food we put on our tables at Thanksgiving and all year round,” Armstrong said.
Producers can begin applying for either program through their local bank or credit union beginning at noon Dec. 9. The application deadline will be June 30, 2026. 
“It might put our producers in a better position financially than other producers around the country,” Goehring said.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A staunch opponent of Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders’ plan to build a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County will be on the ballot as an independent candidate for the Senate District 26 special election.
Secretary of State Cole Jester’s office confirmed Tuesday that Adam Watson of Branch submitted 250 signatures from registered District 26 voters in advance of the noon Wednesday deadline. Watson needed 75 signatures to qualify and began collecting them Nov. 16. He previously circulated a petition for a legislative hearing about the prison.
As an independent, Watson will forgo the Jan. 6 primary and automatically advance to the general election. He told the Advocate it was “definitely encouraging” that he gathered more than three times the minimum number of signatures in the district.
Arkansas legislators skeptical of prison site selection, frustrated over absence of Sanders staff

“I think there’s a lot more voter attention and [people] paying attention than there usually is in a regular cycle,” he said.
The District 26 seat became vacant when Sen. Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, died in September. His successor will serve the rest of his term until January 2029.
Sanders scheduled the primary for Jan. 6 and the general election for March 3 after the state Supreme Court denied her request to delay implementation of a lower court order. The new senator will take office in time for the legislative fiscal session in April when state lawmakers are likely to consider funding for the proposed prison.
Sanders initially scheduled the general election for November 2026 and moved it to June after public pushback. District 26 voter Colt Shelby’s lawsuit led a judge to rule that the election needed to be earlier in the year.
House District 70 voters in Pulaski County will see the same scheduled special election in light of North Little Rock GOP Rep. Carlton Wing’s resignation in September to become CEO of Arkansas PBS. Two Democrats and one Republican are running in District 70.
No Democrats are running for the open Senate seat. Five Republicans will face off in the primary, including former Rep. Mark Berry, R-Ozark.
Berry is the only candidate who has not publicly expressed opposition to the planned Franklin County prison. Wade Dunn, Stacie Smith, Ted Tritt and Brad Simon have all said publicly since beginning their campaigns that they do not want the prison to be built on the 815-acre site the state purchased in the county last year.
Arkansas’ 2026 election cycle will feature several rematches, returning candidates

Stubblefield was one of the most vocal opponents of the prison, and his family has endorsed Dunn to succeed him.
Regardless of who his Republican opponent is, Watson said he believes voters in District 26 have “an appetite for the kind of campaign” he is running. The district includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties.
“All of the work that I’ve been doing in the district before a political opportunity presented itself is ringing true with the voters, because they see somebody that is really just interested in doing what’s best for the district and not serving political parties,” Watson said.
Anyone seeking to run as an independent in the regular elections will be able to start collecting signatures from registered voters in January.

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)The State Corporation Commission on Tuesday handed Dominion Energy two major approvals, after the board OK’d the controversial Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center as well as the utility’s new rates for customers and contract requirements for high load customers, including data centers.
 Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center (CERC) gets the green light

State regulators approved the CERC, a 944 megawatt gas peaker plant, which will be built on the site of the former coal fired plant at the Chesterfield Power Station near the Dutch Gap Conservation area south of Richmond. The SCC also gave approval to Dominion to add a CERC Rider to utility bills to recover the $1.47 billion it is anticipated to cost to build the project.
For months, community members and environmental advocates have railed against the proposed plant, citing environmental and health concerns for residents. With SCC approval, the construction, expected to start in 2026, is one step closer with the project slated for completion in 2029.
The most fervent opponents of the plant said that Tuesday’s final order was a blow that worsened, not alleviated, their concerns. Others said building a fossil fuel-reliant plant would counter the Virginia Clean Economy Act, which requires that gas power plants be retired by 2045, barring potential risks to reliability. 
“Under the Clean Economy Act there was a moratorium on new gas plants and Dominion was to phase out all existing gas and coal plants by 2045. In this first test of this law, the SCC has failed,” said Friends of Chesterfield board chair Glen Besa.
The surrounding community has been free of the former coal plant’s pollution since it was retired in 2023 after burning for 70 years. While the gas plant will pollute significantly less than the coal plant, neighbors with fresh memories of the old plant didn’t want the new one built in their community.
“To say we’re disappointed is an understatement,”  Chesterfield NAACP President Nicole Martin said. “Today’s decision puts Dominion’s profits over the health and wellbeing of those living in fenceline communities in Chesterfield and beyond.”
The SCC’s final order states that the decision is not about choosing the CERC over compliance with the VCEA.
“The evidence in this case clearly establishes that there is an imminent reliability threat for Dominion and its customers and that the CERC project addresses that threat in a manner that is in accordance with the public interest and the VCEA,” the order reads.
The plant is anticipated to only run 37% of the year to help meet demands during the hottest and coldest days. The regional transmission grid, PJM, has said that Virginia is the most energy constrained part of their region – in part due to the concentration of high load data centers in the commonwealth. Virginia also is one of the largest importers of energy in the country.
The final piece of the puzzle that Dominion needs to get shovels in the ground for the CERC project is approval of the air permit from the Department of Environmental Quality. A final hearing is scheduled in December before a final decision is made.
“This project will provide reliable power for hundreds of thousands of homes, businesses, schools and hospitals in Chesterfield and beyond. As part of our all of the above energy strategy, it will ensure our region has the reliable power we need to continue growing and thriving,” Dominion spokesperson Jeremy Slayton said.
 Dominion rate increase approved, new rate class created

Starting next year, utility bills will rise for Dominion Energy ratepayers, the SCC also determined Tuesday. In January 2026, the base rate will increase by $11.24 monthly for the average residential user, and in January 2027 an additional $2.36 would be added monthly. Those increases are at a lower rate than Dominion requested. 
The SCC allowed a return on equity to increase from 9.7% to 9.8%, which is lower than the 10.4% the utility requested.
“As the utility regulator, we are obligated by law to set a revenue requirement that affords the Company an opportunity to recover reasonable and prudent projected costs and earn a reasonable rate of return,” the SCC commissioners said in a statement after the order was announced. “ In this case, that has resulted in an increase in rates, but not to the extent requested by Dominion.”
Dominion initially requested a base rate increase of a total of $822 million in 2026 and $345 million for 2027. The SCC ultimately allowed a lower total amount of $565.7 million in 2026 and $209.9 million in 2027.
“We recognize the impact this will have on our customers. We are offering more energy-saving programs and assistance options than ever before. Every month, thousands of our customers benefit from programs that help lower their bills and get the support they need,” Slayton said. 
In December, Dominion plans to launch an online hub for all their programs that customers can use to try and save on their bills.
The newly-approved plan also creates a new rate class for high load customers that use over 25MW and a load factor of more than 75% monthly. That requirement captures most data centers, as well as industrial and commercial customers. These customers are also required to sign 14-year contracts that will ensure they will pay for their proposed energy costs, even if they use less or if the data centers aren’t built.
The minimum demand charges for these users would be 85% for transmission, 85% for distribution, and 60% for generation. They would be charged more if they exceed those minimums.
“Data centers and other large energy users create a special set of risks, and we are pleased to see the Commission engage with these emerging issues here. Residential customers should not be subsidizing these wealthy companies, and Virginians are relying on the Commission to address these fundamental questions of fairness.” said Peter Anderson, Director of State Energy Policy with Appalachian Voices, in a statement.
Dominion serves about 450 data centers in Virginia. A coalition of data center companies had proposed their own plan to the commission that was less stringent as the plan Dominion put forward, however the SCC did not accept it.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-25 22:20:00+00:00,CT Mirror,EPA moves to abandon rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/25/epa-soot-pollution-rollback-trump/,The action follows moves by the Trump administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.
The action follows moves by the administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live. In a separate action, the Interior Department proposed new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.
The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule last year that imposed strict standards for soot pollution, saying that reducing fine particle matter from motor vehicles and industrial sources could prevent thousands of premature deaths a year.
Twenty-five Republican-led states and a host of business groups filed lawsuits seeking to block the rule in court. A suit led by attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia argued that the EPA rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities and families and could block new manufacturing plants.
In a court filing this week, the EPA essentially took the side of the challengers, saying the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.
“EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule” before Feb. 7, the agency said in a brief filed with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Vacating the Biden-era rule would revert the soot standard to a level established a dozen years ago under the Obama administration. The Trump EPA is set to propose its own rule early next year.
Environmental groups said the agency’s action — which follows a pledge by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to roll back the soot rule and dozens of other environmental regulations — threatens public health and undermines its obligations under the Clean Air Act.
“EPA’s motion is a blatant attempt to avoid legal requirements for a rollback, in this case for one of the most impactful actions the agency has taken in recent years to protect public health,” said Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force.
The 2024 rule set maximum levels of 9 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established under former President Barack Obama. The rule sets an air quality level that states and counties must achieve in the coming years to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, industrial sites and wildfires.
“An abundance of scientific evidence shows that going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act,” Hashimoto said.
EPA said in creating the rule that the new standard would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits and 4,500 premature deaths, adding up to about $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the rule would especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, as well as those living near highways, factories and power plants.
“Walking away from these clean-air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of healthy communities at Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that represents environmental groups in the legal case.
President Donald Trump “has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money,” Simms said, adding under Zeldin, the EPA “has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives or serving children, families or communities.”
Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, can result in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources such as vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25329704118782-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 17:57:22.535889

(Photo courtesy of Sen. John Hoeven's Office)The scenic loop drive at Theodore Roosevelt National Park’s South Unit reopened to the public on Tuesday amid North Dakota’s first major snow of the winter.
The scenic loop was under construction for more than two years. About $51 million in federal funding was dedicated to the project through the Restore Our Parks Act, which became part of the Great American Outdoors Act that was signed into law by President Donald Trump in August 2020.
In 2019, sections of a 4-mile stretch of the scenic loop slid down the steep embankment causing the road to close. Upon further inspection, an additional 2 miles of the scenic loop were also deemed unsafe and forced drivers to turn around on the loop, limiting the scenic viewing along the roadway.
Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., a co-sponsor of the Restore Our Parks Act, said the park sees about 700,000 people each year and people want to drive through it, not just for the beauty of the Badlands, but the wildlife.
“You got the prairie dog towns that come right up to the road and you see all those little guys popping their heads out, and of course, the kids go crazy for that,” Hoeven said in an interview Tuesday.

He said the completed scenic loop has improved and expanded places for people to stop their vehicles and get out to look around. The reconstruction also improved the drainage and grading along the roadway.
Hoeven called the project an accomplishment for modern engineering because of the difficult terrain in the park.
“It’s almost like building a bridge,” he said. “You see the cost at $51 million for 6 miles and you realize you are building this stuff on the side of a butte, very steep, and it’s on sandstone, so the structural engineering that went into this is pretty remarkable.”
Hoeven said he was pleased the loop was completed ahead of the opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library.
Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library launches virtual event series

A grand opening of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library is planned for July in Medora. 
“I think it’s just going to be great for our visitors to circle all the way through that park again,” said Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer for the presidential library.
Briney also praised Hoeven’s efforts to preserve the wild horse herds at Theodore Roosevelt National Park.
Proposals to remove the horses or reduce the herd have been controversial. 
Some of the 200 horses in the South Unit of the park have been fitted with GPS collars to better monitor the herd’s range and use of the park’s environment.
In April, Hoeven introduced Theodore Roosevelt National Park Wild Horses Protection Act that would mandate the park to keep at least 150 wild horses and require the National Park Service to craft a management plan for the herd. Hoeven said he was optimistic the bill will protect the herd for future generations.
“The park is just going to keep getting better and it’s going to keep drawing more,” he said.

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)More than 200 online stores who do business using e-commerce platform Shopify illegally sold electronic cigarettes or other tobacco products, circumventing age and safety requirements, according to a letter sent by North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson and the attorneys general of 25 other states Monday.
“These web-sellers made e-cigarette sales in violation of nearly every applicable federal, state and local law regulating e-cigarettes, even after being repeatedly warned of their unlawful conduct,” the attorneys general wrote.
The attorneys general wrote that while Shopify has taken action against specific online vendors brought to their attention in previous letters, “the sheer scope of the conduct and the significant injury to public health accomplished through online e-cigarette sales necessitates a more comprehensive solution.”
At least 28 illegal e-cigarette online stores were hosted directly on Shopify’s platform, they alleged, while another 200 used the company’s services to illegally sell tobacco products.
Under federal law, only 39 FDA-approved e-cigarettes are legal to sell across state lines, and they can only be sold to customers aged 21 years or older. The age limit within North Carolina is 18.
In a press release, Jackson’s office noted that e-cigarette manufacturers are required to be certified by the state Department of Revenue to operate in North Carolina, and that state law mandates age verification for online retailers who sell them.
“If states and the federal government create laws to protect our residents, companies can’t sidestep those for their own profit,” Jackson said. “We have protections against selling e-cigarettes to children because we know how harmful it is for them, and we need Shopify to step up and keep those products off of its platforms.”
The North Carolina Child Fatality Task Force noted in its 2025 report that 37% of high schoolers in the state say they have vaped, including more than half of seniors. The task force urged the state to raise the minimum age for sale of tobacco products to 21 to align with federal law.
Jackson and the 25 other attorneys general are seeking a meeting with Shopify to ask the commerce giant to terminate service to all current and future sellers violating tobacco laws. They offered to “undertake some of the effort” needed to identify vendors who violate the law.
Shopify did not respond to a request for comment on the letter. Their legal page states that all retailers selling e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine products must “comply with the laws and regulations that apply to your business.”
North Carolina’s first legal bout with e-cigarette sales came under then-Attorney General Josh Stein, who in 2021 won the first settlement in the nation against e-cigarette manufacturer Juul.
Juul ultimately paid $47.8 million to North Carolina for marketing to underaged customers, and agreed to more stringent marketing requirements such as refraining from advertising on social media, not marketing to those under 21, and verifying the age of all customers.
“Vaping is dangerous to kids’ health, and we must continue to do everything in our power to keep them nicotine free,” Stein said after the approval of additional funds in 2023.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/PB124952-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 17:57:22.535889

(Photo by Amanda Watford/Stateline)Incarcerated people in New York state prisons face significant challenges in accessing healthy and affordable food, according to a new report from the Correctional Association of New York, or CANY, an independent oversight organization designated by state law.
This problem is not unique to New York: Researchers and advocacy groups have long documented that prison and jail meals nationwide are often insufficient in quantity, lacking in nutrients and of poor quality. Some correctional facilities also have outsourced their food operations to private companies.
The Correctional Association of New York found that meals served in prison mess halls across the state are often nutritionally imbalanced, with too few fruits, vegetables, proteins and whole grains, alongside high levels of refined grains and sodium. If consumed entirely, the meals provide too many calories for most incarcerated women and some men based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s guidelines, according to the report. 
US prison population rises for second straight year

During monitoring visits in 2023 and 2024, the correctional group interviewed more than 500 incarcerated people in general population housing units. About two-thirds of respondents said commissary shelves were inadequately stocked. 
At Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, prices for commissary items such as cereal and pasta rose an average of 45% between March 2020 and December 2024, while wages for incarcerated people declined when adjusted for inflation, according to the report.
Nearly half of those interviewed also reported delays in receiving packages containing food, with some items spoiling before reaching them.
The organization made several recommendations for the state’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision, including increasing transparency around meal nutrition, moving to a single commissary vendor to stabilize supply and prices and standardizing package delivery processes, particularly for perishable items. 
It also recommended allowing incarcerated people to grow and consume fruits and vegetables by expanding horticulture programs and partnerships with Harvest Now, a group that works with state prisons to grow produce and donate it to local food kitchens and pantries.
Some states, including Maine and Missouri, have implemented programs that let incarcerated people cultivate gardens or small farms and incorporate the produce into their meals.

(Photo and seal courtesy of the Iowa Judicial Branch)  The Iowa Supreme Court has ruled that governmental bodies can conduct closed-session job interviews without first attempting to determine whether an applicant’s claim of potential reputational damage has any merit.
The ruling vacates an Iowa Court of Appeals decision that stated governmental bodies are obligated to investigate, and not take at face value, claims of possible reputational damage resulting from an open interview.
In 2021, former federal prosecutor Robert Teig sued the City of City Rapids over its refusal to disclose job applications filed by people seeking employment as city clerk and city attorney. As part of his case, Teig  argued the council had violated Iowa’s Open Meetings Law in April 2021 when it interviewed, behind closed doors, Alissa Van Sloten for a job as city clerk.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Van Sloten was then a longtime city employee who was serving as interim city clerk and had asked for a closed meeting on the grounds that closure was necessary to prevent “needless and irreparable injury” to her reputation.
After a two-day bench trial, the district court concluded that the mayor and council members had not violated the Iowa Open Meetings Law when they held a closed session to interview Van Sloten. The court noted that “the fighting issue amongst the parties is whether a closed session was ‘necessary to prevent needless and irreparable injury’ to Van Sloten’s reputation.”
In dismissing the case, the district court held that a governmental body need not be aware of “specific, negative information” before deciding to close an interview at the interviewee’s request.
The Iowa Court of Appeals subsequently reversed the district court’s decision and said council members had, in fact, violated the law. The appeals court said it was “troublesome” that when the council was faced with a request to close a public meeting due to a claim of potential reputational damage, the members made no further inquiries to determine whether a closed session was actually “necessary” to prevent such damage and simply approved the request.
That approach — which is the same approach used by many public bodies throughout the state — allows councils, commissions and boards to close more meetings than the law contemplates, the court said.
“An applicant would simply need to invoke the magic words, ‘fear of needless and irreparable injury’ and could then have the governmental body close the entire interview without further inquiry as to why,” the court stated.
In the Cedar Rapids case, the appeals court pointed out, “the council failed to ask any questions as to why Van Sloten’s request was necessary. Not one.”
The mayor and council appealed that ruling, sending the matter to the Iowa Supreme Court.
In their decision Tuesday, the justices held that job applicants and governmental bodies can’t be expected to know, in advance, whether an interview could wind up damaging the reputation of the applicant. It’s enough that a request for a closed session be made by the applicant, the court ruled.
“As the district court recognized,” the Supreme Court stated, “it’s simply unrealistic to know in advance what will come up in a job interview that might harm the interviewee’s reputation. Generally, the interviewee won’t know what questions are going to be asked, and the interviewers won’t know what answers will be given or what follow-up questions will be asked. It’s also difficult for the interviewing entity to appreciate what might be harmful to the interviewee’s reputation, especially in this day and age of proliferating social media.”
The justices also noted that under the Iowa Court of Appeals’ interpretation of the law, “the fact that the governmental body closed part of a job interview would amount to a finding that there was ‘specific, damaging information that would justify continuing the interview outside the public’s view.’ This in itself could harm the interviewee’s reputation.”
In its ruling, the court noted that under Iowa law, a closed-session job interview “requires the agreement of both the governmental body and the individual being evaluated. An individual who prefers to be interviewed in open session will always have that choice. Likewise, a governmental body that prefers public interviews of job candidates will always have that option.”

A reelection filing is routine for anyone else in the House, and a dozen incumbents already have done so. But for Ritter it reflects a conclusion that he retains support to continue as speaker, even as his decision frustrates the ambitions of others.
“I’ve had a lot of conversations with with members, and obviously, I’m running again based upon having the support to do so,” Ritter said. “I’m humbled by it, and, you know, I am mindful that this is a unique situation.”
His decision is not a surprise: In a Connecticut Mirror profile published a year ago, when Ritter was poised to become the first three-term speaker in two decades, he publicly broached the idea of a fourth term.
Connecticut only has had three speakers to hold the position for more than two terms. The first was his father, Thomas D. Ritter, followed by his immediate successor, Moira K. Lyons. The third is Matt Ritter.
Ritter’s decision means that the aspirations of House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, who is Ritter’s heir apparent, and the three women vying to succeed Rojas as majority leader will be pushed back two years.
“No question, there’s got to be frustration, because this does create a log jam,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. 
But Candelora, who has a constructive working relationship with the speaker, offered the same assessment as Democrats who were hoping to move up: Ritter has been an attentive leader of a diverse caucus, providing little fuel for a challenge.
“I think he’s broadly respected in the House chamber,” Candelora said. “Obviously, if he didn’t think he had the votes, he wouldn’t have filed.”
The speaker is elected by the full House, and the last speaker denied another term was defeated by the Republican minority voting as a bloc with a group of Democratic dissidents in January 1989.
Democrats currently hold a 100-49 advantage in the House, with two vacancies created by the resignation of one Democrat and death of another.
Rojas said he and Ritter will continue as a team.
“I’m filing and running again, and running for majority leader again with Matt as the speaker,” Rojas said. “As I told him, there’s something’s more important than political goals for myself — other personal relationships and the health of our caucus. Matt’s done a good job, as I said last year.”
All six top leadership posts in the General Assembly are held by men: Ritter, Rojas and Candelora in the House; and President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney of New Haven, Majority Leader Bob Duff of Norwalk and Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield in the Senate.
Democratic Reps. Maria Horn of Salisbury, Cristin McCarthy-Vahey of Fairfield and Kate Farrar of West Hartford praised Ritter’s leadership while affirming a belief that periodic change was healthy for the institution.
“I think it’s not surprising news to a lot of us, and I also think that we as an institution have to be really careful about what that means for us,” McCarthy Vahey said. “And I say all that with deep respect and appreciation for the speaker and the leadership that he has brought to the chamber.”
“Ritter has been a good speaker,” Horn said. “He has been a good consensus builder, a good sort of calming of the waters. He’s built good bipartisan relationships with the minority. Those are all positive things, and I support his leadership on that front.”
Horn said it is important for the House to find other ways to amplify a diversity of voices if the leadership will not be changing. She believes Ritter is open to those conversations.
Horn, as co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee, is one of two women in the House overseeing the key money committees. Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, is the other, as Appropriations co-chair.
She said both were consulted at length as the leadership drafted legislation in a recent special session that added $500 million to the state’s budget reserves.
“Ritter has provided really valuable leadership for our caucus, through COVID, through this Trump chaos,” Farrar said. “And I also think there’s great value in regenerative and new leadership.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0605_SR_SessionLastDay_433-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 17:57:22.535889

(Photo by HUD Office of Public Affairs)Nineteen attorneys general and two governors filed suit in Rhode Island on Tuesday to stop the Trump administration from shifting nearly $4 billion in housing grants they say could place as many as 170,000 formerly homeless people back out on the streets.
The group co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha is accusing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development of violating “congressional intent” in its plan to dramatically reduce the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing, along with other conditions placed in its latest Notice of Funding Opportunity for Continuum of Care grants.
Enacted Nov. 13, HUD’s new policy instead shifts Continuum of Care funding toward transitional housing and other short-term interventions to the nation’s ongoing homelessness crisis. Only 30% of funds from the $3.9 billion grant program would be allowed to be used for permanent supportive housing — units that provide a subsidized, stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets.  
HUD has previously directed approximately 90% of Continuum of Care funding to support permanent supportive units as part of its “Housing First” philosophy, according to the 55-page lawsuit.
“Addressing the crisis requires urgent action from our communities, institutions, and government,” the lawsuit states. “But instead of investing in programs that help people stay safe and housed, the Trump Administration has embraced policies that risk trapping people in poverty and punishing them for being poor.”
HUD’s latest Continuum of Care grants opportunity is open though Jan. 14, 2026. Grant awards are expected to be made May 1.
The new grant rules also eliminate funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
“Individually, these conditions are unlawful and harmful,” the 55-page lawsuit states. “Together, they are a virtual death blow to the CoC Program as it has operated for decades and will lead to predictably disastrous results.”
If the policy isn’t blocked, Neronha warned the cuts would “further exacerbate already dire conditions for homeless Rhode Islanders.” Indeed, Rhode Island’s homeless care providers project a little over 1,000 formerly unhoused people across the state could wind up back on the streets under HUD’s new funding focus.
R.I. housing leaders warn HUD policy change could increase homelessness across the state

“This administration continues to punch down by targeting the most vulnerable Americans, and unfortunately this most recent attack on homeless individuals is consistent with their modus operandi,” Neronha said in a statement. “The president and his administration don’t care about making life easier or better for Americans; they only care about political capitulation, consolidating power, and further enriching the wealthy.”
A HUD spokesperson did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
In addition to Neronha, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown and New York Attorney General Letitia James are co-leading the lawsuit. 
Also joining the complaint are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont, Wisconsin, along with the governors of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.
The coalition is asking Judge Mary S. McElroy, who was appointed to the bench during Trump’s first term, to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices.
HUD framed its new funding policies as a way to promote “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans” and align with President Donald Trump’s July 24 Executive Order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.”
But the lawsuit filed Tuesday argues that Congress created the Continuum of Care program to ensure stability so providers can reliably serve people whose lives depend on it. The coalition says HUD’s changes are arbitrary and capricious because officials offered no explanation for abruptly reversing longstanding policies.
“HUD has failed to supply any rational explanation for these newly proposed conditions that are entirely unrelated to (and in some cases even inhibit) the statutory purpose of addressing homelessness,” the lawsuit states.

Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced changes to funding for what are called continuums of care, or the regional groups that organize to address homelessness. Those changes prioritize funding for programs that require people to meet pre-existing conditions such as sobriety, push people into stays at psychiatric facilities, ask about people’s immigration status before giving them services and only recognize two genders.
Continuums of care offer rental aid to nearly 6,000 households across the state. Many of those formerly homeless people are in permanent supportive housing, which means they have disabilities and get services at their homes.
Attorney General William Tong said the state signed on to the lawsuit to try to stop people from losing their homes under the new policy. The aid could end as soon as January for some households.
“They’re putting a bunch of nonsensical, ridiculous conditions on this funding,” Tong said during a Tuesday press conference. “They’re now saying that if you serve people who are transgender, and you acknowledge that they are not the gender of their birth, or if they won’t go into a program because they struggle with addiction, then they can’t be housed. They can’t have a roof over their heads.
“We are just trying to make sure that people are safe and that they don’t die out in the cold, and that’s why we’re suing.”
The lawsuit is the latest in a series of lawsuits Tong’s office has signed on to against the federal government since President Donald Trump came into office in January. It also comes as homelessness is rising in Connecticut and temperatures drop.
HUD formerly allowed service providers to put 90% of their federal funding through the continuums into these housing programs, and some people have been living in apartments with this aid for decades. Now, HUD has said only 30% of the money can go to these programs starting in 2026.
HUD did not respond to a request for comment by press time.
Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, said the funding is critical and she is glad to see Tong step up.
“These are people who have been housed for years, and their housing is just as important as every one of ours,” Fox said. “We need to keep these people housed. We need to ensure that they remain housed, and we appreciate the state for stepping up.”
Service providers have asked Gov. Ned Lamont to put $70 million of the $500 million flexible fund the legislature approved earlier this month to address federal cuts toward the continuums of care. Lamont last week said he was in conversation with agencies and other officials about the best way to spend the money.
“Now there’s some threats in terms of housing cuts,” Lamont said last week. “We do have a $500 million reserve there to take care of the most vulnerable in need, to make sure that nobody is sitting outside, can’t get a place to stay in January if it’s due to the fact that the feds have cut back on things.”
The Connecticut Mirror requested comment from the governor’s office at 2:30 p.m., which referred the CT Mirror to the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services. The department had not responded as of 5 p.m.
Lawmakers on Tuesday said in a press release that they were concerned about the cuts. Housing Committee co-chair Sen. Martha Marx, D-New London, said that the state needs to “fight these cuts with urgency and be unapologetic.”
Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, said the action “undoes decades of important work and we cannot allow that to happen.”
Chair of the End Homelessness Caucus Rep. Kadeem Roberts, D-Norwalk, said the actions amounted to “unwarranted cruelty.”
“These changes by this federal administration and HUD to the Continuum of Care program are not only cruel, but will have real consequences for thousands of residents experiencing housing instability,” Roberts said. “This is particularly concerning to me as temperatures begin to drop, and housing becomes even more vital.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TONG-LAWSUIT-0716-7-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-25 16:57:38.910000

“I want to thank every person who supported this campaign,” Strnad said in a statement. “I ran to give working class families a voice and to deliver results for communities that have long been overlooked.”
Strnad launched his campaign for the Democratic nomination in August, acknowledging  he was polarizing and a longshot for the position. He told the Examiner at the start of his campaign that his mother thought he should “run for something smaller.”
He launched his campaign saying that he would seek to improve conditions for workers by repealing Act 10 and getting rid of “right to work” — the law that lets workers who are represented by unions decline to pay union dues without giving up their right to the union’s representation. He said he supported police and allowing access to abortion in Wisconsin. 
Strnad said he is endorsing Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley in the crowded race and encouraged his supporters to support him as well. He said Crowley “is the candidate who can hit the ground running, fight for families, and begin delivering those results for Wisconsin starting on day one.”

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A federal judge in Denver on Tuesday found that federal immigration officers have “routinely” made warrantless arrests in Colorado in violation of federal statutes, ordering the Trump administration to halt the practice and take steps to prove that it’s complying with the law.
The partial injunction granted by Judge R. Brooke Jackson of the U.S. District Court of Colorado followed a lawsuit filed last month by the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado on behalf of four plaintiffs who alleged they were subjected to unlawful immigration arrests. Federal law requires immigration officers making a warrantless arrest to show probable cause that the individual “is likely to escape before a warrant can be obtained” for their arrest.
In a 66-page order, Jackson wrote that the plaintiffs had shown the defendants in the case — Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other top immigration officials — “likely have a policy, pattern, and/or practice of violating these sections by effecting warrantless arrests without individualized probable cause of flight risk.”

The four plaintiffs in the case are Caroline Dias Goncalves, a 19-year-old Utah nursing student who spent 15 days in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Aurora after a traffic stop in Mesa County; Refugio Ramirez Ovando, a 43-year-old man taken into custody in Grand Junction in an arrest that agents later admitted was a case of mistaken identity; and two other men identified only by their initials, J.S.T. and G.R.R.
Jackson’s injunction grants four of the six measures of relief sought by ACLU’s lawsuit, including the termination of ankle monitoring and other conditions of release for the plaintiffs. He ordered that officers making warrantless arrests must “consider the totality of the circumstances” when determining flight risk.
“Mere presence within the United States in violation of United States immigration law is not, by itself, sufficient to conclude that a person is likely to escape before a warrant for arrest can be obtained,” Jackson said.
The injunction further requires immigration officers to make extensive documentation for each warrantless arrest, including “the specific, particularized facts supporting the conclusion that the person was likely to escape before a warrant could be obtained,” and to make that documentation available for regular inspection by the plaintiffs and the court.
Jackson’s ruling also granted the plaintiffs’ request for provisional class-action status, extending protections to all individuals “who have been arrested or will be arrested” unlawfully in Colorado since Jan. 2o, 2025.
In his second term, President Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the “largest domestic deportation operation in American history,” aiming to remove all of the estimated 12 million immigrants in the country without permanent legal status, regardless of how long they have been in the country, the legal status of their family members or whether they have criminal records.
Jackson declined to order two other measures sought by the ACLU, which would have required immigration enforcement agencies to conduct training on warrantless arrest procedures and regularly provide documentation that the training was taking place.
“However, should compliance with the Order prove elusive, plaintiffs may renew this request,” he wrote.

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered a pair of three-judge panels to hear arguments in two lawsuits challenging the state’s congressional maps. 
The challenges to the maps come as fights play out all over the country over the dividing lines of congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections. After Texas legislators worked to draw Democratic seats out of existence at the behest of President Donald Trump and a number of other Republican-led states followed suit, California voters elected to temporarily undo their state’s independent redistricting commission and allow Democratic leaders to wipe out Republican-leaning seats. 
Similar efforts have followed to varying degrees of success in states including Arkansas, Indiana and Virginia. 
Wisconsin’s political maps have been at the center of its divided government for more than a decade, with the Supreme Court undoing the partisan gerrymander in the state Legislature two years ago. 
Since then, the focus has turned to Wisconsin’s congressional maps, where Republicans control six of the state’s eight districts. More than once, the Supreme Court has declined to hear cases that request the Court directly take up challenges to the congressional maps. 
A lobbying effort in the state is also ongoing to establish an independent, nonpartisan process for creating the state’s legislative and congressional maps. 
On Tuesday, the Court ruled that the challenges to the maps must follow a 2011 law, passed by the GOP-controlled Legislature and signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, which requires that challenges to the state’s congressional districts be heard by a panel of three circuit court judges. 
Republicans had argued that law shouldn’t apply in this case. In a 5-2 decision, in which the court’s four liberal justices were joined by conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn, the Court ruled the law applies and the panels should be created.
In the majority decision, the Court’s liberals also appointed the panels — of which all the members were appointed by Gov. Tony Evers or endorsed liberal Justice Susan Crawford in this spring’s election. 
Hagedorn dissented on the appointment of the panels, arguing the panel members should’ve been appointed randomly. 
“Given the nature of this case and the statute’s implicit call for geographic diversity and neutrality, a randomly-selected panel and venue would be a better way to fulfill the statutory mandate,” Hagedorn wrote. “To be clear, I am not suggesting the judicial panel will fail to do its job with integrity and impartiality. But this approach is an odd choice in the face of a statute so clearly designed to deter litigants from selecting their preferred venue and judge.” 
Justices Annette Ziegler and Rebecca Bradley dissented from the decision, arguing the majority chose the judges on the panel to further the goals of the Democratic party. 
In several previous lawsuits over political maps, Bradley and Ziegler have issued rulings that benefited the Republican party or further entrenched the partisan gerrymander that has allowed the Republican party to retain control of the Legislature for 15 years. 
“Hand picking circuit court judges to perform political maneuvering is unimaginable,” Ziegler wrote. “Yet, my colleagues persist and appear to do this, all in furtherance of delivering partisan, political advantage to the Democratic Party.” 
On Tuesday, Crawford and Justice Janet Protasiewicz also issued orders denying requests from Republican members of Congress and GOP voters that they recuse themselves from the redistricting cases. Since the two justices’ elections in recent years, the state’s Republicans have regularly accused the pair of making statements on the campaign trail that show pre-judgment of cases involving the state’s political maps. 
“The Congressmen’s recusal theories are overbroad, impracticable, and rife with unintended consequences,” Crawford wrote. “Individuals and organizations have the right to contribute to judicial campaigns and to express their beliefs about the effect judicial elections will have on issues of importance to them. Demanding that a justice recuse from a case because third parties who made campaign contributions have expressed their views on high-profile issues improperly implies that the judge had endorsed or adopted such views. This insinuation is inappropriate, particularly where the judge has expressly disclaimed such an endorsement, and undermines judicial impartiality. Further, it would chill protected speech and undermine this court’s central role of deciding cases of statewide importance.”

Credit: Related DigitalOne of the state’s largest energy companies is asking energy regulators to fast track approval of two contracts to provide power to a data center planned for construction in Saline Township, but environmental advocates and state officials have banded together to demand greater transparency into the details.
DTE Energy on Oct. 31 filed a request for ex parte approval seeking two contracts to supply 1.4 gigawatts of energy to a facility under development by ChatGPT creator Open AI, Oracle and Related Digital.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a request to intervene in the case, requesting the Michigan Public Service Commission. which oversees energy utilities in the state, view the matter as a contested case. That would allow different parties to intervene, request discovery and file testimony for the commission to review before making a decision on the contracts.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While DTE maintains that its contracts with the energy-intensive facility will not result in higher rates for its customers, Nessel said the plan lacks clarity on how consumers would be protected.
Though the commission has set a date for a virtual public hearing ahead of its next meeting, Nessel has argued that without a contested case declaration, the hearing amounts to “performative listening rather than thorough public scrutiny.”
“This is all highly unusual, to say the least,” Nessel said in a Zoom call on Tuesday. “DTE itself is anticipating it will spend half a billion dollars to service this new customer, making unverified promises nobody else will shoulder these costs, and urging the commission to fast track this application without any of the normally prescribed public scrutiny.”

While The Sierra Club, Michigan Environmental Council, Natural Resources Defense Council and Citizens Utility Board of Michigan have also requested a contested case hearing, Nessel said that there is no indication the commission will hear their requests for intervention. That’s raised concerns over the commission facing political pressure to move forward on the deal without public input.
Matt Helms, a public information officer for the commission, declined to comment.
In an email to Michigan Advance, DTE’s Director of Corporate Communications Jill Wilmot, said the state’s regulatory process allows companies to file for an uncontested approval of contracts if there is no cost of service increase to customers.
“To that end, DTE Electric is following the defined process for filing this regulatory request,” Wilmot said.
Wilmot added that the data center is also footing the cost of a battery storage project to help meet energy demand at the facility.

Nessel noted that the public does not have the option to read over the full contract because there is no public version available, or at least without heavy redactions.
“My call here today is not that data centers don’t belong in Michigan, that they can’t be managed responsibly and regulated fairly. It’s actually quite the opposite of that; that we can regulate these entities responsibly, and therefore we have an obligation to do so,” Nessel said. “These special contracts will control how hundreds of millions of utility dollars are spent. I don’t think we’re being alarmist here by saying that deserves even just the most basic process and access the commission typically affords our offices.”
State Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor), who represents the area where the data center is being sited, said there are tremendous concerns within the community about the resource demands from the data center.
Some of those concerns include whether the facility will dry up wells or bring skyrocketing energy rates with it; and how the data centers coming into the state will impact the state’s goal of meeting a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.
Charlotte Jameson, the chief policy officer for the Michigan Environmental Council, said that in order to meet the state’s clean energy goals, it must rely heavily on renewable energy and battery storage. However, when significant new loads are added to the energy grid, utilities often rush to build natural gas plants, Jameson added. DTE has already discussed plans to replace its Monroe Coal Plant with a gas plant, alongside other gas plants under consideration.
Although natural gas plants are included in the law’s definition of clean energy systems, and the plants must utilize 90% effective carbon capture and storage technology, the Institute for Energy Economic and Financial Analysis has questioned the effectiveness of the technology, warning that it could increase carbon dioxide emissions.
Michigan regulators to host public hearing on DTE contracts for Saline Township data center

DTE has submitted testimony in the case detailing how the Saline Township project would impact their ability to remain within Michigan’s clean energy goals, but the company’s plan is sparse on details, Jameson said. The lack of transparency has raised additional questions on whether the company will need to pursue an extension to comply with the state’s clean energy requirements.
State Rep. Morgan Foreman (D-Pittsfield Township) said the deal has implications beyond Saline Township. 

“This is a precedent setting decision for the future of data centers and AI development in Michigan,” Foreman said. “If we allow one utility to bypass public engagement, we open the door for it to happen again and again and again and again.”
For residents concerned about the data center, Nessel advised them to direct their energy toward DTE, the public service commission, and their local lawmakers, with Irwin saying the Legislature needs to develop better rules to ensure Michigan’s waters and energy consumers are protected from these resource-intensive facilities.

,Mississippi Today,2025-11-25 21:31:09+00:00,Mississippi Today,Domestic violence tracking tools could avert deadly outcomes,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/11/25/domestic-violence-tracking-could-avert-deadly-outcomes/,Two domestic violence tools the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office unveiled three years ago could save the lives of victims and law enforcement but need officers' buy-in.,"A system is only as good as the people who use it. 
Two domestic violence tools the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office unveiled three years ago provide the kind of information that could save the lives of victims and the officers who respond, law enforcement leaders say. 
But challenges remain. Adding an incident into the Mississippi Domestic Violence Registry is double the work: One report goes to  the law enforcement department and one goes to the system, said Luke Thompson, former chief of the Byram Police Department who trains officers about how to respond to domestic violence. 
Officers have used the system and the Mississippi Protective Order Registry, but the attorney general’s office is hoping for better participation. 
Thompson and Oxford Police Chief Jeff McCutchen recognize how situations can turn deadly for victims and law enforcement during domestic violence calls. The Officer Down Memorial, a nonprofit that tracks line-of-duty deaths, found that in nearly every state since 1992, officers have died while responding to domestic violence calls. 
Just this year, Missisisppi officers have been killed during domestic violence calls. 
In February, Hinds County Deputy Sgt. Martin Shields Jr. was shot and killed by a man who had shot his own wife and another woman in Terry. The man later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. McComb Police Sgt. Jason Blake died in August while responding to an off-duty request where a man shot and injured a woman before fatally shooting Blake and himself.  
When they are training officers within their department or around the state, leaders like McCutchen and Thompson are able to share how every piece of information they add to the registries can help keep them, other law enforcement officers and the public safer. 
“The more data that you have at your disposal in real time, the better decision you can make and the better outcomes that can come,” said McCutchen, whose department has been using the incident registry since its launch. 
Access to information about prior incidents at the same address, by the same abuser and active protective orders could be used to help corroborate a victim’s story in live time, he said. 
It’s also a chance to build trust by showing victims that officers have prior information, that they can add the current incident to the system, and that if abuse happens again there or somewhere else, someone can look it up, McCutchen said.
Domestic violence prevention through intervention
Mississippi’s law enforcement departments and agencies often have separate systems specific to their local, county or state jurisdictions. Law enforcement can access and submit to federal systems such as the National Incident-Based Reporting System, but that system has limits and data collection only began in 2019. 
Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office used the same electronic platform many officers were already using for motor vehicle crashes, believing that familiarity would lead to more input of information. Her office also has been training officers on how to use the systems. 
As of Jan. 1, officers have logged about 5,400 incidents into the system, according to the attorney general’s office. 
Officers are asked to fill in basics like location and a narrative, but they can also include additional details, including whether children were present at the time, whether the victim is pregnant and diagrams that show any injuries, according to a user guide for the Domestic Violence Registry. 
A way to help prevent domestic violence incidents from turning deadly is through intervention. 
Within the domestic violence registry, the attorney general’s office added a lethality assessment, which is a tool to help determine a person’s risk of being injured or killed by a partner. Officers ask a series of questions to learn about abusive behavior. From there, they connect victims with domestic violence services.

As chief, Thompson implemented domestic violence response training with domestic violence advocates and educators and used the lethality assessment. In 2018, the first full year of using the training and assessment, he said the department reduced the number of domestic response calls by over 30%. An additional 25% reduction happened the next year. 
The numbers made Thompson curious about what changed. What he found were fewer calls to the same addresses. He said that earlier intervention and referral of victims to service groups helped reduce calls in the future. 
To save additional time for officers, Thompson started an app that streamlines the lethality assessment and automates data sharing between law enforcement and their area domestic violence service provider. It’s currently used by several Mississippi law enforcement agencies, he said. 
Tracking protective orders
Another domestic violence-related system by the attorney general’s office is the Mississippi Protective Order Registry, which is among several statewide systems across the country. 
Through a federal system, the National Crime Information Center Protection Order File, law enforcement agencies and the military submit protection orders. 
Mississippi’s registry contains court-issued civil and criminal protective orders. These can be temporary or long-term orders a person  sought and a judge approved, or from a court-ordered protection in a criminal case. 
So far for this year, nearly 600 domestic abuse protection orders have been entered into the registry, according to the attorney general’s office. 
Clerks add full protective orders to the system. A number of players from the justice system, including judges, law enforcement and prosecutors, have access to the registry and can use it to tell if protective orders are being followed. 
Clerks fill in basic information such as conditions of the protective order and which judge approved it, according to a user guide for the order registry. Additionally, once law enforcement gives access, clerks can add updated bond conditions and case disposition information to incidents logged in the domestic violence registry. 
The domestic violence incident and protective order systems are not accessible to the public because they contain investigative law enforcement material and may involve an open investigation or ongoing litigation, according to the attorney general’s office.   
McCutchen, the Oxford chief, said the protective order registry is similarly helpful because it gives officers information. In some cases, that may be entire copies of protective orders detailing who is protected and the terms of the order to be followed. 
If someone is found to have violated the protection order – broken conditions of no abuse, no contact and distance from the protected person – police then could call the judge who issued the order, who may ask for the person to be brought to court. Violation of a protection order is a misdemeanor that can lead to up to six months in jail and/or a fine. 
A protective order database can be helpful in a community like Oxford, where people from Mississippi and other states attend school and visitors come for games and other events, McCutchen said. 
Thompson said if service providers or advocates know someone has a protective order, they can help the person make plans to stay safe. That could mean crafting an exit strategy, saving money for when they leave an abusive partner or getting a new cellphone. 
“How are we going to make this piece of paper effective for you?” he said about protective orders and assistance from a domestic violence organization. 
“You don’t just run,” Thompson said. “You have resources.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/18170127/MT-DomesticViolence-ProtectiveOrder-FeatImage-02.jpg,,,2025-11-25 16:57:38.910000

Harold Pope Jr., left, and Rep. Matthew McQueen, right, asked state utility regulators for greater transparency regarding the proposed New Mexico Gas Company sale. (Photos: Danielle Prokop/Source NM and courtesy of Matthew McQueen) A pair of New Mexico lawmakers joined a small group of clean energy advocates and residents Tuesday morning in urging state utility regulators to demand greater transparency in the pending sale of New Mexico Gas Company.
The gas company in late 2024 filed an application to be sold to Bernhard Capital Partners, a New Orleans-based private equity firm, for nearly $1.3 billion. The companies initially had an early November deadline to finalize a sale agreement, but they recently agreed to extend that into early 2026.
A half-dozen people spoke Tuesday morning at a Public Regulation Commission meeting to urge greater transparency surrounding the deal. One, a Santa Fe psychologist named Patricia Brown, said she was alarmed to learn that Bernhard Capital’s founder previously ran a firm named the Shaw Group that FEMA awarded no-bid disaster response contracts 20 years ago in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. 
A 2008 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General determined that FEMA wasted millions of dollars by awarding the no-bid contracts to Shaw and others. A 2011 report commissioned by the state of Louisiana alleged that Shaw appeared to overbill the state by nearly $500,000 for constructing sand berms along the coastline to prevent oil from the BP oil spill from washing onto land.
Brown and others who spoke said it’s troubling that details like these, which the news media reported years ago, had not been introduced into the official record regarding New Mexico Gas Company’s proposed sale.
“We cannot protect the public interest without full transparency,” Sen. Harold Pope Jr. (D-Albuquerque), a 2026 candidate for lieutenant governor, told commissioners Tuesday morning. “That is impossible when critical information is hidden from view. Right now, central evidence about Bernhard Capital Partners’ regulatory compliance history including violations, fines, audits and settlements involving their affiliates and formerly owned companies has been withheld from the record. You can not reliably weigh benefits against risk when the most relevant facts are kept from the public.”
Similarly, state Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo), who chairs the House Energy, Environment and Natural Resources Committee and is running to be state land commissioner, told commissioners that they should implement a “robust discovery process” and a record that details all of the concerns surrounding companies related to Bernhard Capital.
New Mexico Gas Company referred comment to Bernhard Capital, which did not immediately respond.
Energy advocates have characterized Bernhard Capital’s response to the scrutiny as “a hand in the face.” 
New Energy Economy, a Santa Fe nonprofit that advocates for clean energy legislation, in a statement called Bernhard Capital’s track record cast doubt on whether it “can be trusted to provide reliable, safe and cost effective service.” Among other elements, the group noted that companies owned by the private equity firm have faced allegations of failing “to properly operate and maintain” a Louisiana water treatment facility where inspectors found bloodworms in sludge; mishandling hazardous waste such as asbestos; and failing to pay dozens of workers overtime wages.
“You want to come in and buy our essential utility service and we’re not allowed to know about your background?” Mariel Nanasi, New Energy Economy’s executive director, said in an interview Tuesday. “It’s like applying to be a school bus driver and the public school would say, ‘Let me see your accident history,’ and the bus driver says, ‘Oh, no, that’s irrelevant.’ What are you talking about?”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/popemcqueen-1024x683.png,,,2025-11-25 16:57:38.910000

The Department of Defense announced Monday it’s investigating U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, for his participation in the video. Others in the video include U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, U.S. Rep. Chris DeLuzio of Pennsylvania, U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, and U.S. Rep. Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, all Democrats. 
“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution,” Crow, Deluzio, Goodlander and Houlahan said in a joint statement following the FBI’s request for interviews. “We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.”
U.S. Rep. Jeff Crank, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement to Newsline that while the video Crow participated in is “shameful, inappropriate, and a threat to our national security,” he does not think his words warrant capital punishment. 
“Members of Congress should never be telling our troops to disobey orders from their commanding officers,” Crank said. “However, I do not believe that these actions are punishable by death.”
Crow and the others in the video specified that troops have the right to refuse illegal orders — not any order — under the U.S. Constitution and other legal provisions.

Jim Justice and his wife Cathy Justice immediately settled a new lawsuit seeking more than $5.1 million in unpaid federal income taxes spanning 15 years.
U.S. attorneys with the tax division of the U.S. Department of Justice filed a complaint Monday seeking to collect the unpaid liabilities dating back to 2009.
The filing in the district court for the Southern District of West Virginia said that both husband and wife had received notices about the unpaid amount, and, “Defendants James C. Justice, II, and Cathy L. Justice have neglected or refused to make full payment of those assessments to the United States.”
A short time after the federal filing, the Justices filed a motion Monday agreeing to pay the  $5,164,739.75 owed as of Aug. 4, 2025, along with the “other additions to tax accruing thereafter according to law until paid in full.” 
Justice’s Senate office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Justice, a Republican, was easily elected to the U.S. Senate last year while financial obligations mounted. In 2023, he faced a potential garnishment of his governor’s salary to pay back loans related to purchased coal equipment. 
Ahead of last year’s election, the state of West Virginia’s Tax Division placed a series of liens on The Greenbrier resort — which the Justice family operates — more than $4 million because of sales taxes that were collected but not remitted to the state, MetroNews reported. 
In October, Politico reported that the Internal Revenue Service had filed a notice of a federal tax lien against Justice and his wife for more than $8 million in unpaid assessments for tax years 2009, 2017 and 2022.
Justice brushed off the financial issues, saying it was “politically motivated” and that the IRS owed him money. He connected the lien to his family’s coal business ties, saying they were complicated and complex. 
Justice sold the family coal company, Bluestone Coal, to Russian-based Mechel in 2009 for about $436 million in cash and stock. Justice said his tax issues began in 2009 with audits by the IRS under the administration of former Democratic President Barack Obama.
“The timetable is running out on the claim that they have, that back in 2009 I should have paid a few dollars more than what I paid,” Justice said Oct. 23 in response to a question from reporter Steven Allen Adams with Ogden Newspapers. “What they just did is they said we’ll go back to 2009 and we’re going to assess your interest and penalties on that all the way through and that’s how they come to the ($8 million).”
Cathy Justice serves on the state school board after being appointed by her husband in 2024.

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita on Tuesday released the state’s new Consumer Data Protection Bill of Rights, saying the document is intended to help Hoosiers understand and exercise their rights under the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act before it takes effect in January.
“Every click, every purchase, every search, every doctor visit, every dollar you spend, is tracked, packaged and sold, often without you even knowing,” Rokita said at a news conference in Indianapolis. “Your personal data is your personal property, and for years now, decades now, it’s been taken from you.”
Indiana’s General Assembly passed the privacy law unanimously in 2023. Rokita said it is “a huge first step, not a complete solution by any means,” but marks the first time Hoosiers will be able to force companies to show what data they hold, correct inaccuracies or “most importantly, delete the data.”
The new bill of rights outlines 15 protections for Indiana consumers, including rights to delete personal data held by companies; opt out of targeted advertising and data sales; and request a copy of their information in a portable format.
It also prohibits companies from discriminating against consumers who use those rights. 
Sensitive information — like health, biometric, immigration, religious, or precise location data, as well as all children’s data — also can’t be processed without explicit consent.
The Republican attorney general said companies must place a clearly marked privacy notice or data-rights link “in a prominent spot on their website,” and once a request is filed, the companies will have 45 days from the date of your request to comply.
Still, Rokita criticized exemptions in the law for nonprofits, utilities, banks and entities covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA.
“Some have no sense whatsoever,” he said. “Some of our nonprofits are the biggest takers of our private, personal data … They’re exempted from this law. Why? Who knows.” 
Rokita said he expects to make recommendations to lawmakers during the upcoming 2026 session but will begin enforcing the statute as written, for now.
Consumer Protection Division Chief Scott Barnhart called the law “a good first step” that lets consumers “recapture some of their privacy” and gain “transparency into the system.” 
Doug Swetnam, data privacy and identity theft section chief, added that the law provides a long-sought remedy for inaccurate information, noting that, previously, “there was no means for a consumer to make sure the data was accurate or to ask companies to delete the data they’ve been accumulating.”
Swetnam said the office will enforce requirements for “simple-to-understand” privacy notices and will rely on consumer complaints as well as staff reviews of company practices. 
Rokita emphasized that violators could face injunctions and fines of $7,500 an incident.
“Where we had no power to control our property rights, our data right before as consumers,” Rokita said, “now we do.”

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)Everywhere, abundance.
That is the theme of the American Thanksgiving. Family and friends crowded around tables overflowing with food, thick moments of conversation, laughter, remembrance. It is a day meant to drip and swirl with excess. 
But regardless of its design, a holiday is just a point in time. There will be hunger on Thursday, as always, and the day grants no respite from the weight of absence, of hurt, of emptiness. Everybody knows Thanksgiving’s opposite, whether directly or obliquely. To be human, to live humanly, is to understand scarcity — if not of food than of friendship, of hope and connection. Only by category and degree are we separated in our understanding.
To know that is to grasp the roots of empathy. To abide there is the very practice of grace.
Still, even on a day set aside for gratitude, thanks applied more broadly does not come easily. The choices our world has made, continues to make, disqualify us as an advanced civilization, or even an aspiring one. A society consumed by the dream of sentient machines, as now, while sentient people go unfed, unsheltered, and untreated, all while the natural world suffers permanently under the weight of temporary industry, is a society that doesn’t understand the mission.
In that failure, we stand unsteadily at a crumbling edge.
There are few options in a position such as ours. Resignation is one, disengagement another. You can submit to fear, embrace the resulting cruelty. Or flail against the current of time, in the delusion that what has passed is preferable to progress.
Each is a variation of retreat. 
There is only one way forward at the edge, and that is forward. With eyes open and panning — unafraid and engaged. Aware not only of all that is broken but all that is worth preserving, worth celebrating, worth passing on even in its imperfection.  
To live fully is to understand that what we perceive as opposites are inextricably intertwined, and dependent. We know that the experience of joy requires the echo of sorrow, just as sorrow presupposes joy. And so it is with the waves of bounty and lack, degradation and ascent, acquisition and loss. Our greatest enemy, then, is despair — gratitude’s opposite — which negates the truth of experience, of existence. It deprives us of seeing what surrounds us, today and always.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The Trump administration wants access to state driver’s license data on millions of U.S. residents as it builds a powerful citizenship verification program amid its clampdown on voter fraud and illegal immigration.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security seeks access to an obscure computer network used by law enforcement agencies, according to a federal notice, potentially allowing officials to bypass negotiating with states for the records.
The information would then be plugged into a Homeland Security program known as SAVE that Trump officials have deployed to search for rare instances of alleged noncitizen voters and to verify citizenship. The plan comes as the Trump administration demands states share copies of their voter files that include sensitive personal data that also is being plugged into SAVE; it is suing some states that refuse.
Trump officials tout the SAVE program as a boost for election integrity. But critics of the program warn the federal government is constructing a massive, centralized information source on Americans. They fear President Donald Trump or a future president could use the tool to surveil residents or target political enemies.
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

“What this SAVE database expansion will do is serve as a central pillar to build dossiers on all of us,” said Cody Venzke, a senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union.
At the same time, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, conducted nearly 900,000 searches for state driver’s license and other motor vehicle data over the past year using the same data-sharing network that Homeland Security wants to link to SAVE, according to information provided to Congress. The network is called Nlets — formerly the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, now known as the International Justice and Public Safety Network.
Dozens of congressional Democrats in mid-November warned Democratic governors that Nlets makes driver’s license data available to ICE, including from states that restrict cooperation with the agency. While ICE, a Homeland Security agency, has long had access to Nlets, some Democrats are voicing renewed alarm amid Trump’s sweeping deportation campaign.
At least five states — Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington — have blocked Nlets’ ability to share their driver’s license records with ICE, according to the Nov. 12 letter from 40 Democratic lawmakers. Oregon also is taking steps to block access.
In Colorado, state Sen. Julie Gonzales said she is willing to advance bills to block the Nlets data sharing. Gonzales, a Democrat who chairs the Colorado Senate Judiciary Committee, has previously sponsored legislation to limit what personal information is shared with the federal government for immigration enforcement.
“It is like playing Whac-A-Mole, but the Constitution applies to ICE, too,” Gonzales said.
The recent developments underscore the ongoing struggle between Democratic states and the Trump administration over how much access Homeland Security should have to their residents’ personal data. For their part, some Republican state officials have voiced support for the administration’s moves and want to aid the search for noncitizen voters and individuals in the country illegally.
Data and privacy experts told Stateline the current moment could lead to more centralization of personal data by the federal government and an eroding expectation of privacy when it comes to driver’s license information. The federal government is for the first time essentially building a U.S. citizenship database, they said.
Some Republican states resist DOJ demand for private voter data

Homeland Security is proposing to take Nlets outside its intended use, said John Davisson, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group that argues privacy is a fundamental right.
Nlets is a nonprofit organization that facilitates data sharing among law enforcement agencies across state lines. At a basic level, Nlets is the system that allows police officers to quickly look up the driver’s license information of out-of-state motorists they pull over.
States decide what information to make available through Nlets, and which agencies can access it. Each state has an Nlets member, typically that state’s highway patrol or equivalent agency. Several federal law enforcement agencies also are members.
“It appears that DHS is eyeing it for something quite different, for mass extraction of driver’s license information that would be far beyond the sort of targeted enforcement purposes of a system like Nlets,” Davisson said.
Driver data idea floated in May
Homeland Security’s SAVE program — Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements — was originally intended to help state and local officials verify the immigration status of individual noncitizens seeking government benefits. But it can now scan state voter rolls for alleged noncitizen voters.
In the past, SAVE could search only one name at a time. Now it can conduct bulk searches, allowing officials to potentially scan through information on millions of registered voters. Federal officials in May connected the program to Social Security data; linking driver’s license data through Nlets would provide an additional mountain of data on U.S. residents.
The League of Women Voters, a nonpartisan group that advocates for voting rights, filed a federal lawsuit in September against Homeland Security over the transformation of SAVE. In its complaint, the organization accused the department of ignoring federal law to create comprehensive databases of American citizens’ data.
U.S. District Court Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan, a Biden appointee, last week declined to temporarily block SAVE’s overhaul while the lawsuit proceeds. But Sooknanan wrote in an opinion that based on the current record, “the Court is troubled by the recent changes to SAVE and doubts the lawfulness of the Government’s actions.”
Homeland Security publicly confirmed it wants to connect Nlets to SAVE in an Oct. 31 Federal Register notice. The notice said driver’s licenses are the most widely used form of identification, and by working with states and national agencies, including Nlets, “SAVE will use driver’s license and state identification card numbers to check and confirm identity information.”
Trump’s DOJ wants states to turn over voter lists, election info

The agency also privately floated its interest in Nlets months earlier.
According to minutes of a May virtual meeting of the National Association of Secretaries of State Elections Committee, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) official Brian Broderick told the group that his agency — the Homeland Security agency that administers SAVE — was seeking “to avoid having to connect to 50 state databases” and wanted a “simpler solution,” such as Nlets.
The minutes were contained in records from the Texas Secretary of State’s Office obtained by American Oversight, a nonpartisan transparency group that frequently files records requests. Mother Jones magazine first reported on the records.
Nlets and the Texas Secretary of State’s Office didn’t respond to requests for comment.
On Friday, National Association of Secretaries of State spokesperson Brittany Hamilton wrote in an email to Stateline that at that time, “we have not received specific updates from USCIS on this aspect of driver’s license data potential usage.”
In a statement, USCIS spokesperson Matthew Tragesser encouraged all federal, state and local agencies to use SAVE.
“USCIS remains dedicated to eliminating barriers to securing the nation’s electoral process. By allowing states to efficiently verify voter eligibility, we are reinforcing the principle that America’s elections are reserved exclusively for American citizens,” Tragesser wrote.
State restrictions flawed, lawmakers say
Some Democrats are separately pushing to limit ICE’s access to driver’s license data through Nlets. The Nov. 12 congressional letter warned that while some states have restrictions on data sharing with immigration authorities, the limits are often ineffective because of major flaws.
State limits sometimes apply only to state motor vehicle agencies, which don’t connect to Nlets — and often don’t apply to state police agencies that do connect, the letter said. And even though state restrictions target data-sharing for immigration enforcement, Nlets doesn’t indicate the purpose of a request.
“Because of the technical complexity of Nlets’ system, few state government officials understand how their state is sharing their residents’ data with federal and out-of-state agencies,” wrote U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, U.S. Rep. Adriano Espaillat of New York and 38 other Democrats.
Homeland Security didn’t address Stateline’s questions about ICE’s access to state driver’s license data through Nlets.










I think that for many years, folks around the country that are concerned about privacy, that are concerned about immigrants, have been trying to sound the alarm about this issue.


– Matthew Lopas of the National Immigration Law Center


Advocates for immigrants have long raised concerns about ICE access to state driver’s license data through Nlets. Nineteen states allow residents to obtain driver’s licenses regardless of immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center, an immigrant advocacy group. Those driver’s license records represent a wealth of information on noncitizens.
While ICE can’t use Nlets to obtain records of all noncitizens issued licenses, the agency can use the search tool to obtain a variety of information on individuals, such as date of birth, sex, address and Social Security number, according to the law center. Sometimes a photo is also available — a particular concern for immigrants and their advocates amid reports that ICE has deployed facial recognition tools in the field.
“I think that for many years, folks around the country that are concerned about privacy, that are concerned about immigrants, have been trying to sound the alarm about this issue,” said Matthew Lopas, director of state advocacy and technical assistance at the National Immigration Law Center.
Stateline contacted all 50 state governors to ask about Nlets. Forty-one offices didn’t respond and most others provided high-level statements or referred questions to other agencies.
But Maryland indicated it was taking “proactive measures” to ensure that federal agencies’ access to its data through Nlets complies with state and federal law. A 2021 state law limits the sharing of driver’s license data with federal immigration authorities.
Maryland “is working with Nlets to ensure that Marylanders’ data is not misused for civil immigration enforcement absent a valid judicial warrant, and we intend to share more information on that effort as we are able,” Rhyan Lake, a spokesperson for Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore, said in a statement to Stateline.
The South Dakota Department of Public Safety, which is overseen by Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, cautioned against limiting data-sharing among law enforcement. Records obtained through Nlets include data on wanted individuals and other information that can help identify potential threats to officers and agents, the department said in a statement provided by Director of Communications Brad Reiners.
“We reject the concerns outlined in the [Democratic lawmakers’] letter and remain deeply concerned about the potentially dangerous consequences of limiting access to this information,” the statement says.
In Oregon, state officials plan to cut off ICE’s Nlets access to its driver’s license data, but no date has been set, Oregon State Police Capt. Kyle Kennedy, an agency spokesperson, wrote in an email.
“We are working with other states to assist in considering a path forward,” Kennedy wrote.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Ten months of waiting for the prospective buyer of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital to close the deal is enough for Chief Judge Stacey Jernigan of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas.
“It’s very upsetting, but eventually — I hate to say something so callous — but fish or cut bait,” Jernigan said during a hearing in Dallas federal bankruptcy court Tuesday morning. “We’re sort of in that position.”
Bankrupt hospital owner Prospect Medical Holdings thought it caught a solid buyer in The Centurion Foundation, an Atlanta nonprofit. The Rhode Island Office of Attorney General and the Department of Health conditionally approved the deal in June 2024. Then, Prospect filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January, but the sale was back on, with Jernigan’s permission, by February.
Tentative deal to keep Roger Williams and Fatima open through December in the works

“I didn’t think there was anything remaining required at that point,” Jernigan said. “We know that a sale of a health care business can take a very long time, but usually what I hear in this court is ‘we’re still waiting on regulatory approval.’ We entered this case with regulatory approval. That’s one reason I’m so frustrated.”
Yet Centurion remains unable to finance its purchase, blaming its difficulty securing investor-backed bonds on Prospect’s mismanagement and, more recently, the state’s courtship of an alternative buyer.
Prime Healthcare, which owns Landmark Medical Center in Woonsocket among 50 other hospitals nationwide, has been considering a purchase for months at the behest of Gov. Dan McKee’s administration. 
There’s still no offer from Prime, though the California company was identified by name in court for the first time Tuesday. Attorneys used indirect references to Prime in previous hearings. 
Califano said he was “cautiously optimistic” that Prime would come through with something concrete by Dec. 5 — one week before the confirmation hearing on a bankruptcy restructuring agreement, and less than one month before hospital funding runs dry. 
Noel True, a Prime spokesperson, had no additional information to share Tuesday regarding the company’s interest in buying the hospitals.  
“We remain honored by the trust placed in the Prime Healthcare Foundation to explore how we may help ensure these essential hospitals continue serving their communities despite significant challenges that have developed over many years,” True said in an email.
‘These resolutions take time’
Verbal promises can no longer satisfy the 100,000-plus Prospect creditors waiting to cut the Rhode Island hospitals loose and move on. The bankruptcy estate is scheduled to present a formal restructuring plan at a Dec. 12 court hearing.
“The one issue that would prevent confirmation is a resolution for Rhode Island,” Thomas Califano, an attorney with Sidney Austin LLP representing Prospect, told Jernigan on Tuesday. “We need a line of sight to a resolution. Even though we have funding through December, these resolutions take time.”
In other words, sell now, or close the hospitals. 
Prospect laid its cards on the table in October, signaling intent to close the facilities by the end of the year. A short-term cost-sharing agreement with Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office offered a temporary lifeline.
Andrew Troop, a New York attorney representing Neronha’s office in bankruptcy court, assured Jernigan that state regulators were in talks with Prime, while also keeping open the conditional approval already granted to Centurion. 
Not welcome news to Centurion CEO Ben Mingle, who in a series of private emails earlier this month asked state regulators to cease negotiations with Prime. Mingle argued the state’s overtures to Prime undermined Centurion’s ability to close the sale, while simultaneously asking for more time and more flexibility on the deal. 
A spokesperson for Centurion did not immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.
David Wender, an attorney representing Centurion, did not address Mingle’s request in court Tuesday. Instead, Wender focused on the nonprofit’s continued commitment to reviving the two Rhode Island hospitals under its ownership.
“We are still here in pursuit,” Wender said. “We have pressed, and they’re still pressing.”
Wender concluded with an open-ended promise for an update, either through investor-backed bonds or, alternatively, a short-term bank loan that could let it close the deal by early or mid-December.
Troop maintained a neutral stance on the competing buyers on Tuesday.
“We are committed, as we’ve always been, to try and get this done,” Troop said. 
While he acknowledged that selling the hospitals does not put money back in Prospect creditors’ pockets, Troop pointed out that there are indirect benefits, such as releasing the bankruptcy estate from the administrative expenses and liabilities of running the health care facilities. 
For Rhode Island, the benefits are obvious: keeping critical emergency rooms, mental health care and specialty surgical treatments available for patients and jobs for 2,500 employees.
Closing the hospitals, with 500 beds between them and 50,000 emergency room visits in 2024, could send Rhode Island’s fragile health care system over the edge, advocates and state officials warn.
Jernigan empathized.
“I am still steaming over what happened in Pennsylvania,” she said, referring to the closure of two Prospect-owned hospitals in Delaware County earlier this year. 
Of the Rhode Island hospitals she said, “Is it worth it? Of course, for the community, it’s worth it. Of course, for the employees, it’s worth it. But, you know, we’ve run out of estate money. I have a duty, if you will, to make sure the pre-petitioned creditors aren’t worse off at the end of the day than they were before the bankruptcy was filed. At some point, I’ve got to stop that.”
Jernigan punctuated the brief conference with attorneys Tuesday with a warning.
“If we show up on Dec. 5 and there is any desire to go another day, or much longer, waiting for this to maybe play out, we’re going to need witnesses at that point to convince me that this is worth waiting it out a little longer,” she said. “I need reasonable assurances that this is going to happen, and it’s going to happen in December.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderA nearly decade-old tax credit program has directed hundreds of millions of dollars to struggling rural hospitals in Georgia over the years, helping to stabilize their finances.
But critics of the program, including those who advocate for full Medicaid expansion, say the program continues to fall short of giving Georgia’s hospitals the support they need to survive long term.
Georgia’s Rural Hospital Tax Credit program allows taxpayers to receive a 100% tax credit for donations made to eligible rural hospitals. A recently released state audit, conducted by the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University, found that the program was effective in supporting vulnerable hospitals, but it also found limitations regarding economic growth and its ability to increase the sources of new donations. 
While uptake of the tax credit lagged in the beginning, the report states that donations have nearly reached their statutory cap in recent years. Lawmakers capped the program at $100 million starting in 2025.
Jimmy Lewis, CEO of Hometown Health, which represents rural hospitals, said that the cost to the state is minimal compared to the economic benefit of supporting the state’s rural health care infrastructure.
“If we don’t provide vehicles like this to preserve economic development in rural Georgia, we’re going to accelerate to a third-world nation beyond anything we can imagine … we’ve got very problematic situations where we don’t have the money,” Lewis said. “Again, these hospitals were built in the mid-50s and haven’t been totally upgraded since then, and as a result, we’ve got a real infrastructure problem.”
Since its start in 2017, the program has generated more than $432 million in support for rural hospitals statewide, according to the audit.

The audit also noted a shift in the main source of donations, which previously came from individuals but has increasingly rolled in from businesses and corporations.
“This program was able to let millions of dollars flow directly to rural hospitals, and in return, they could serve the needs of their community the way they needed to, whether it was to buy more equipment, be able to pay doctors and nurses and technicians more, to be competitive,” former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, who sponsored the bill that created the program nearly a decade ago as a Republican state representative, said in an interview. Duncan is a 2026 candidate for governor who is now running for the Democratic ticket.
Despite the program’s cost, Duncan said it is essential and should be expanded. If elected governor, Duncan said he would support doubling the cap on the amount of state funding set aside for the program, raising it from $100 million to $200 million.
“Many of these huge contributions from companies are coming from the largest employer in that community or in that region,” Duncan said. “No business wants to ask hundreds of people to show up to work every day without a rural hospital being viable within a short ambulance ride if something unforeseen happens.”
Past critics of the program said that despite the program’s success as a lifeline for cash-strapped hospitals, it is not enough to address the lack of health care access, particularly in rural Georgia.
Leah Chan, director of health justice at Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, said that while the tax credit helps, it “comes nowhere near to solving the scale of the problem.” She pointed to looming challenges posed by the new federal law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will reduce federal funding for health services over the next decade.
“I think what this audit shows is that it has generated more than $432 million in support for rural hospitals statewide,” Chan said. “So that is certainly a benefit. Again, no one solution is going to fix all our problems, and we need to access additional levers that allow us to draw down additional federal funds and to ensure we can cover more eligible Georgians.”
These federal cuts will “gut Georgia’s rural providers and communities,” said Natalie Crawford, the executive director of Georgia First and a former Republican commissioner in Habersham County. She said that with $626 million in federal financing cuts for rural hospitals and nearly 100,000 rural Georgians losing their insurance, referencing a recent study from Georgia Health Initiative, the state needs to consider more permanent solutions, such as full Medicaid expansion. Duncan, who was previously opposed to Medicaid expansion as a Republican, also pointed to the federal program as a potential solution.
“Band-Aids like this program aren’t going to save our rural health system from the coming pressures that, if not addressed, will generate a full-blown crisis for our state,” Crawford said.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hospital-sign.jpg,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

‘Funding did not follow the child’: State audit displays school choice woes

Little Wings of Prayer, a daycare and private school in Hernando County since 2018, is subject of an investigation opened in 2024 into a mass transfer of students (and their state-funded scholarships) from a separate school two hours away, according to administrative law Judge Robert Telfer III.
“It would be difficult for the undersigned to discern a more obvious and brazen fraudulent scheme than the one undertaken by [Little Wings of Prayer operator] Ms. [Crystal] Harris. This violation, in and of itself, is sufficient to revoke the eligibility of Little Wings to receive scholarship funds,” Telfer wrote in his recommendation to strip the school’s scholarship qualification. 
According to the decision, during the 2023-2024 school year, Little Wings submitted invoices to Step Up for Students, an organization administering state vouchers, for students previously enrolled at Touched by an Angel school, 130 miles away in Lake City.
The transfer of about 80 students raised a concern to Step Up, which tipped off investigators.
The Department of Education under then-Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. alleged fraud.
Harris told the judge that about 80 students previously enrolled at the Lake City school enrolled in her school because the Lake City school owner was in bankruptcy and her school was at risk of closing.
Harris testified that during the 2023-2024 school year, her school received state scholarship funds for students that did not physically attend the school and that she did not know it was illegal to do so. Additionally, Harris said she “never took the time out go down there and verify” the Lake City school was in operation.
According to court documents, Harris said she received about 30% of scholarship funds for the Lake City students. After sending those funds to Lake City, she in return received about $70,000 from the Lake City school “that should take care of the taxes for her money, and for audit and all those things.”
The state additionally suggested that Little Wings students were also enrolled in the Columbia County School District, but that evidence was redacted.
The recommendation from the judge leaves the decision about how to proceed up to the Department of Education.
Court documents do not specify the value of the scholarships in question.
The complaint filed by the department includes that Harris has previously pleaded no contest to child abuse charges. The state attempted to use that information to disqualify her from working at a private school. Ultimately, evidence on that front was deemed “inconclusive.”
The Department of Education alleged, too, that Little Wings did not maintain or submit fire safety and health inspections and failed to notify the state of a change in its physical location within 15 days after moving.

Lawmakers working on it
State legislators last week reviewed a state audit that found the school choice scholarship program in Florida exhibited “a myriad of accountability problems.”
The 22-page audit found that in 2024-2025, the Department of Education paid $655 million to middleman scholarship funding organizations, as statutes prescribe, before school started.
“Any improper payments, any ineligible amounts, you’re paying and chasing those amounts, because the dollar’s already gone out the door,” the auditor said.
Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Crestview, said that at any given moment the state does not know where 30,000 students are in terms of school categories — traditional public or voucher-supported private or home schools — together worth $270 million in education support.
Gaetz is sponsor of a lengthy bill that looks to address some of the accounting problems in the voucher program, which became universally accessible in 2023.
Gaetz’s bill would require the Department of Education to investigate written complaints from parents, students, and schools regarding school choice laws and investigate fradulent activity and overpayment, and refer them to the Department of Financial Services for potential criminal investigation.
Private schools that do not properly attest that a child attends could be investigated for fraud and would have to repay the money, according to the bill.
However, the House does not seem to be fully on board with the Senate proposal. The legislative session begins in January.

Due to revenue shortfalls, Idaho is already facing a projected state budget deficit of $58.3 million for the current fiscal year 2026 budget, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
The projected state budget deficit could increase by more than 10 times that amount for the next budget year, fiscal year 2027 — depending on how state revenues come in and whether the Idaho Legislature chooses to conform with all of the tax changes from the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law this summer.
In an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun on Monday, Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff confirmed that Idaho may need to come up with somewhere in the range of $600 million to $1 billion for the fiscal year 2027 state budget.
“We try to keep $200 million on the bottom line when we budget, so you can quickly get to a billion dollars in terms of what we need to do to account for revenue projections coming in for FY 27,” Wolff said Monday.
 Challenges the Idaho state budget may face

That total includes a couple of assumptions and layers to get to the $600 million to $1 billion range. Here’s the breakdown Wolff provided using the latest state numbers and projections:

$555.2 million: the projected fiscal year 2027 budget deficit that the nonpartisan Legislative Services Office presented to the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee on Nov. 4. That projected deficit includes the 3% holdbacks Gov. Brad Little implemented this summer and then permanently extended. All state agencies, aside from the K-12 public school system, are subject to the holdbacks. 
$200 million to $284.4 million: the estimated cost of complying with all of the tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act championed by Trump. The Idaho Legislature still has to decide whether to comply with Trump’s tax changes, some of which include no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on workers’ overtime pay, no tax on borrower’s car loan interest and an expanded deduction for senior citizens. 
$200 million: the estimated goal state officials have to leave a positive cash balance, or budget cushion, on the bottom line at the end of the fiscal year 2027 budget to guard against additional budget uncertainty. 

State budget officials said they expect to release a new revenue projection when the 2026 legislative session begins in January. 
“We will get updated revenue projections right before we submit the governor’s budget, so that will be included in his State of the State address, and we’ll be publishing those in January,” Wolff said. “So we’ll have a little bit better idea of what we’re expecting, but we’re probably looking at anywhere between probably $600 million and $1 billion that we have to account for, and that’s going to include what’s been submitted in budgets, and that’s going to include revenue and revenue projections.”
For context, the total fiscal year 2026 general fund portion of the state budget passed by the Idaho Legislature during the 2025 legislative session was about $5.6 billion, according to the Sine Die report published by the Idaho Legislative Services Office. 
 Why is Idaho facing a projected budget deficit?

There are many factors and layers that affect systems as complicated as the state budget. 
In simple terms, Idaho is facing projected budget deficits because expenses are forecasted to exceed revenues. Revenue is the amount of money the state takes in. The largest sources of state revenues are taxes — specifically the individual income tax, the corporate income tax and the sales tax.
The projected budget deficits are occurring after the Idaho Legislature and Little have passed a series of income tax cuts over the past five years. The tax cuts reduce the amount of money Idahoans and Idaho businesses pay in taxes. But to pay for the tax cuts, the state has reduced its revenue. 
A new report released this month by the nonpartisan, nonprofit Boise-based Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy indicates that the Idaho Legislature has reduced state revenue by a total of $4 billion over the past five years, the Sun previously reported. The Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy reported that those income tax cuts have benefitted the wealthiest 1% of Idahoans making more than $738,300 annually the most and benefited the lowest-income families the least.
Wolff, the administrator for the Idaho Division of Financial Management, told the Sun on Monday her division’s calculations show the tax cuts accounted for about $900 million in revenue per year and about $3.2 billion cumulatively since 2019. 
During the 2025 legislative session alone, the Idaho Legislature reduced state revenue by more than $450 million to pay for this year’s tax cuts and a new refundable tax credit that reimburses Idaho families for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools, the Sun previously reported. 
Lobbyist Patrick Sullivan told the Greater Boise Auditorium District’s board on Thursday several times that part of the problem is the revenue projections set by the Idaho Legislature were way too high. 
“The Legislature projected too much, too high,” Sullivan said. 
In an interview Monday, Wolff said Idaho’s economy remains healthy, the state is not in a recession and unemployment remains low. 
 Idaho Legislature’s top budget writer says there will be no budget deficit

Rep. Wendy Horman, the Idaho Falls Republican who co-chairs the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, emphasized that the budget deficit is only a projection at this point and the Idaho Legislature has options. 
In an interview Tuesday, Horman said the Idaho Legislature’s decision on whether and how to comply with the tax changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill is a huge variable in the overall budget picture.
“This year conformity could have a very high price tag,” Horman told the Sun on Tuesday. 
“Normally we just conform with the federal policies. This year will be different because of the Big Beautiful Bill — there is no tax on tips, there is no tax on overtime, but there are also substantial tax cuts for business. In my opinion, it makes no sense to set a revenue number (for the budget) until we know what the conformity policy is going to look like. As you know, JFAC does not set revenue policy – the tax committees set the policies that will determine the amount of eligible revenue to appropriate. So this is a unique year in that conformity could have a price tag in the hundreds of millions of dollars and there will be important policy decisions that need to be made outside of JFAC before we will really know how much revenue will be on the table for appropriation.”

Earlier this month Horman vowed that the Idaho Legislature will intervene, and Idaho’s state budget will not end in a deficit.
“We will set a balanced budget,” Horman told the Sun in an interview earlier this month. “The constitution requires it. I am personally committed to it. And I anticipate we will leave as large of a cash balance as we can to carry over into next year to guard against unforeseen circumstances.”
It is possible that state revenues could rebound and come in higher than expected before either the fiscal year 2026 or fiscal year 2027 end. 
Even if revenues do not rebound, the state has other options to avoid a budget shortfall. Because the Republican supermajority in the Idaho Legislature has been committed to cutting taxes, not increasing taxes, the most likely options to address the projected state budget shortfall include additional cuts to state programs and/or dipping into some of the $1.7 billion in state savings accounts and cash reserves Idaho has accumulated. 
JFAC is a powerful legislative committee that sets all of the state budgets for every state agency and department. 
During meetings earlier this month at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise, Horman said JFAC is preparing to enter a new era of budgeting where the budget committee will focus less on approving spending requests and more on cutting budgets, the Sun previously reported. 
 Why does Idaho’s project budget deficit matter?

The budget situation is important for several reasons.

The state budget is how Idaho pays for all the programs and services the state provides — from paying for the statewide K-12 public school system, to providing public safety through Idaho State Police, addressing infrastructure needs like aging bridges and water supply issues, to fighting wildfires through the Idaho Department of Lands to funding Medicaid programs to providing pay and benefits for thousands of state employees. 
If there is less money available for the budget or additional budget cuts are needed, there will be less money for programs. 
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, told the Idaho Capital Sun this month the budget situation keeps her up at night and she is bracing for “catastrophic” budget cuts, on top of the 3% holdbacks that she said are already having a negative impact on Idaho’s most financially vulnerable families, seniors and people facing serious medical conditions. 
Additionally, the Idaho Constitution requires the state to pass a balanced budget where expenses do not exceed revenues. 
Sullivan, a legislative lobbyist, told the Greater Boise Auditorium District’s board of directors on Thursday that Idaho could be facing a $1 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2027. 
“They’re going to have to look really hard at fiscal (year) 2027, because the budget director told me this morning that she believes it’s going to be a billion dollar shortfall – a billion dollars in a $5.9 billion budget,” Sullivan said.
During the briefing, Sullivan told Greater Boise Auditorium District board members that the budget situation and the 2026 election (when all statewide elected officials and all 105 legislators are up for election) will be the dominant issues next year.  
“I guess to put it very concisely, it’s going to be all about the budget,” Sullivan added. “It’s going to be all about cuts, and at the end of the day, they’re going to reach into that rainy day fund and pull it out for this year. But as they start looking into next year, they’re going to have to make some really draconian cuts, I think, to be able to meet the constitutional mandate that they have.”
Sullivan said he is concerned about budget cuts because there are only four members out of 70 from the Idaho House of Representatives who were serving in the Idaho Legislature when the last major state budget cuts were approved in response to the 2008 Great Recession. 
“So we have a brand new Legislature that’s never cut (funding) and I don’t think they understand what that all means – I really don’t,” Sullivan said during Thursday’s meeting. “That’s going to be very difficult for them to kind of transform themselves into budget cutters.”
“Now there’ll be that hard-right group of the Legislature (that will) say, ‘Oh, fine, we cut it down to zero and go home,’” Sullivan continued. “But there’s still government services that need to be performed, and so there’s going to be that rift going on.”
Sullivan is the founder and owner partner of the Boise-based firm Sullivan & Reberger. Sullivan has amassed more than 35 years of experience providing strategic counseling to elected officials and businesses, according to the firm’s website. 
 Idaho’s recent financial history

A recent report from the Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy noted that it has been difficult for the state to bounce back from budget cuts approved in response to budget hardships. The report found that although funding has recovered from the 2008 recession, per-pupil K-12 public school spending levels have still not caught up with levels reached prior to the 2001 recession, once inflation is factored in.
New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion

Any projected budget deficit is a huge change for Idaho. A little over three years ago, Idaho ended fiscal year 2022 with a record budget surplus estimated at $2 billion. 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. That means fiscal year 2027 does not end until June 30, 2027, and there is still time for revenues to rebound or the Idaho Legislature or Gov. Brad Little to take steps to avoid a budget deficit.
Although fiscal year 2027 does not begin until July 1, 2026, the Idaho Legislature will set the fiscal year 2027 budget during the upcoming 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 12 — in less than two months. 
It is also important to note that Idaho is not alone in facing state revenue shortfalls. The Colorado Legislature called a special legislative session in August to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget, Colorado Newsline reported.  
In a report published Monday, Pew Charitable Trusts reported the states of Arizona and New Mexico are projecting at least $100 million in general fund reductions across multiple fiscal years due to federal tax changes that reduce revenue for states.
In September, the Maryland Comptroller’s Office estimated the changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would reduce state revenues there by an $189.3 million between fiscal year 2026 and fiscal year 2027.",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Capitol-240123r1-2250-med-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

Hayle Johnson, president of the Colorado County Clerks Association and a five-term Republican clerk and recorder in Jackson County, appeared to hold back tears as she described the oath that she and other clerks had taken to uphold the Constitution and state and federal laws, calling on Polis to ensure they “had not done so in vain.”
“If you transfer Tina Peters to federal custody, you are making a statement that elected officials are above the law,” Johnson said during an online press conference with other clerks from around the state. “This is a very dangerous precedent. I urge you, Gov. Polis — stand with Colorado county clerks. Stand with democracy.”

Amid mounting pressure from Trump and other far-right figures in the election conspiracy theory movement, the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections earlier this month, requesting that the state “initiate the transfer” of Peters, the former Republican Mesa County clerk who is serving a nine-year sentence in a state prison in Pueblo for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems during a 2021 software update. Trump called again for Peters’ release in a social media post Sunday, describing her actions as “attempting to expose voter fraud in the rigged 2020 presidential election.”
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Tuesday’s press conference followed a letter that the clerks association sent to Polis, a Democrat, last week, urging him to reject the BOP’s request and asking him to meet personally with county clerks, the local officials who oversee elections in the state’s 64 counties, before making any decision. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser and and Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein, who prosecuted the Peters case, sent a similar letter last week.
Clerks said they had not received a response from the governor to their letter or their request for a meeting. A brief statement from a Polis spokesperson on Friday said only that he and the Department of Corrections were “reviewing the letter” from the Trump administration.
Amid the governor’s silence on the issue, Democratic Boulder County Clerk and Recorder Molly Fitzpatrick told reporters there had been an “immediate uptick in concerns about safety” over the weekend. Weld County Clerk and Recorder Carly Koppes, a Republican, spoke about dealing with threats and harassment from election conspiracy theorists in the years since Peters was first charged, including her decision to hide her pregnancy because of “disgusting remarks” targeting her online.
“I’ve had to have multiple conversations since 2021 with my family, including this weekend, about credible threats. That conversation, Gov. Polis, never gets easier,” Koppes said. “Ms. Peters’ decisions, that she made all on her own, have had a massive impact on me and my fellow clerk and recorders, and the families that love and support us.”
‘Deafening’ silence
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. The Colorado DOC on Monday provided Newsline with a partially redacted copy of the one-page letter sent by the BOP on Nov. 12 to Moses “Andre” Stancil, the DOC’s executive director. The letter requests Peters’ transfer “for the purpose of serving a state-imposed sentence within a federal correctional institution.” The DOC has not responded to Newsline’s request for a written explanation of the redactions in the released record.
“Thank you for your attention and cooperation in this matter,” reads the letter, signed by BOP director William Marshall.
Peters has separately filed a petition for release in the form of a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, a case that has been pending since February. In a series of filings in that case following the BOP request, Peters’ attorneys have stated that she is in “declining health” and alleged that she had been placed in solitary confinement after objecting to a corrections officer’s treatment of her. A social media account that frequently posts updates about Peters’ case claimed on Sunday that she had been “moved out of solitary (confinement)” after an investigation.
Earlier this month, DOC spokesperson Alondra Gonzalez described transfers to federal custody as “typically reserved for complex cases involving significant, long-term safety and security needs.” In a brief statement Monday, Gonzalez reiterated that under the department’s regulations, such a move “is an action initiated by the Colorado Department of Corrections, not an outside entity.”
Fitzpatrick said Polis’ refusal, nearly two weeks after the state’s receipt of the Trump administration’s request, to clearly and publicly rule out such a move is “already causing harm to clerks across Colorado.”
“His silence is deafening, and it’s also offensive,” said Fitzpatrick. “It’s deeply offensive to county clerks, it’s deeply offensive to the Republicans and Democrats who serve as election judges and actually implement these elections, and it’s deeply offensive to voters.”

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-11-25 20:19:59+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Controversial curriculum swept up in literacy reform debate,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/education/controversial-curriculum-swept-up-in-literacy-reform-debate/,"Science-of-reading advocates describe the activity as a ""back-door effort""","A HOUSE-APPROVED early literacy reform bill has intensified debate over whether some school districts and the creators of a controversial reading curriculum are seeking alternative routes to state approval.
Science-of-reading advocates describe the activity as a “back-door effort,” while supporters of the curriculum reject that and say the program is being scapegoated amid statewide declines in reading scores.
Rep. Ken Gordon, the House’s point person on education policy, said the curriculum would face an uphill battle under early literacy legislation passed unanimously in the House last month. The bill requires all districts to adopt state-approved, phonics-based materials.
At the center of the dispute is Lucy Calkins’s Units of Study, a workshop approach that encourages children to use context and sentence patterns to interpret unfamiliar words. Critics say these strategies conflict with decades of research supporting explicit, systematic phonics instruction — the foundation of the “science of reading” research base. Supporters of Calkins’s approach say it fosters student engagement, respects teacher expertise and has been wrongly blamed for falling scores.
Asked whether Units of Study could qualify as an approved curriculum under the House bill (H 4672), Gordon said the bill defines evidence-based reading as instruction supported by peer-reviewed research. Units of Study, he said, has not been submitted to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education for review, and its use of “three-cueing,” (an instruction method that includes teaching kids to guess unfamiliar words) would not meet the bill’s definition of evidence-based learning. Supporters dispute that the curriculum uses three-cueing.
The House approved the bill in late October and Senate President Karen Spilka has said the Senate expects to take up a literacy bill “in the near future.”  Formal Senate sessions are not scheduled to resume until January.
The statewide debate has been especially intense in Lexington, where parents for years have urged the district to abandon Units of Study, citing declining MCAS performance among vulnerable subgroups and increased reliance on private tutoring. Parents say district leaders have not acted with sufficient urgency. Jennifer Elverum, co-founder of Lex for Literacy, said she learned Lexington used Units of Study after listening to the “Sold a Story” podcast chronicling national criticism of its methods.
“You talk to parents and everybody has tutors. They’re paying a ton of money to make sure their kids can read and do math. It all just felt like something was wrong,” Elverum said. 
She later acknowledged, “We have very wealthy families… we have wealthy parents that step in and pay for tutors.” Still, she said, 73 percent of students are reading at grade level. 
When Lexington Superintendent Julie Hackett publicly opposed restrictive literacy legislation last session, arguing there’s no one-size-fits-all approach to literacy instruction, the parent group launched an opposition campaign. Parents later obtained roughly 60,000 pages of district emails and documents through a public-records request. 
In those exchanges, Hackett discussed a meeting with Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler and then-interim Commissioner Russell Johnston about broadening the state’s definitions of “high-quality instructional materials.”
A December 2024 letter to administration officials — signed by Hackett, Lesley University professor emerita Nancy Carlsson-Paige and others — questioned why DESE was adhering so closely to a narrow list of approved curricula and argued for widening the state’s definition of HQIMs.
“Massachusetts has a healthy independent streak that has served us well in the past, as well as a strong track record of doing things right when it comes to public education. Is there a reason that we can’t expand what we believe is a narrow definition of HWIM to be more inclusive?” the letter says.
Elverum also pointed to emails from 2022 that suggest districts had been “working with Lucy to create that waiver document,” modeled on a process used in Connecticut, if the state ultimately excluded the program from its approved list. 
Calkins’s team disputes the notion of a coordinated “workaround” strategy.
Amy Baker, vice president of operations at the Reading & Writing Project at Mossflower — the professional development organization associated with the curriculum —  said talk of a “back-door” strategy misrepresents educators’ opposition to state-mandated curriculum. 
“When there’s a push for something new, you have to demonize the old,” she said. “But there are educators in Massachusetts – and all over the world – who still use Units of Study because it works best for their students; there’s not a concerted, organized ‘backdoor’ effort like is being implied.”
DESE spokesperson Jackie Reis declined to comment on the meeting with district officials or whether the department would classify Units of Study as evidence-based under the proposed law.
“We don’t comment on bills that are still in progress,” she said.
Calkins herself framed the debate as an attack on educator judgment. 
“Local educators are in the best position to make informed, thoughtful decisions,” she said. 
She argued that on average, districts using Units of Study outperform the 3rd-grade averages on state tests and that many state-endorsed science-of-reading curricula lack strong peer-reviewed evidence, rely on scripted lessons or have been described as “culturally destructive” in recent research.
She also said many state-preferred programs limit student access to real books, instead having all students read the same passages and complete workbook-style questions, sometimes online. Lessons are “scripted down to the word,” she said, making it difficult for teachers to adjust instruction for students who are struggling or excelling.
“Educators, not legislators, should be making decisions about curriculum,” she said.
For many Lexington families, the debate is grounded in lived experience. 
Kyle York, whose daughter has dyslexia, described years of evaluations, denials and legal fees while trying to secure an Individualized Education Plan because his daughter was struggling to learn to read under Lexington’s Units of Study model. The family ultimately hired an advocate and then an attorney, spending more than $10,000 before receiving services.
York said Units of Study’s emphasis on recognizing whole words allowed his daughter to “cover up” her underlying difficulties. 
“[During] her dyslexia assessment… She could read the word ‘believe’ because it’s written all over classroom walls, she knew ‘imagine.’… She knew those words without ever actually understanding how to sound out the word,” he said.
Watching her struggle with reading homework was difficult, he added. “It breaks your heart.”
“I was so disgusted with how the school treated us,” York said. Administrators, he added, insisted “everything is fine, we’re using [Units of Study] and everything is great.” 
Education Reform Now President Mary Tamer, part of the MassReads coalition supporting the legislation, said efforts to broaden definitions or create alternative approval paths undercut the bill’s intent. 
“If this law is not implemented with fidelity, if educators are not willing to do right by children by getting on board and by following the science that goes back 50 years, we are doing an incredible disservice to children,” she said. With only four in ten Massachusetts students reading at grade level — and far fewer in high-poverty districts — she said district-by-district flexibility “is not working.”
Calkins’s team connected the News Service with Dr. Maurice Cunningham, a retired UMass political science professor who wrote “Dark Money and the Politics of School Privatization.” Cunningham said MassReads is a “coalition of billionaires masquerading as a grassroots effort,” citing funding ties from groups such as the Barr Foundation and Walton Family Foundation.
“Letting every district do what they choose is not working,” Tamer said. “This is not about adult preferences. This is about following the science.”
Hackett has defended Lexington’s reading program and argued against government interference. 
“Teachers, not politicians, should decide what works best for their students,” she told Lexington families in a Nov. 6 message about changes to the district’s K–5 literacy pilot. She said she and other educators had “written op-eds, met with legislators, spoken at events, and held meetings with the Commissioner, the Secretary of Education, the Governor, and others” to advocate for flexibility.
But with the House bill advancing and Senate action expected, Hackett said “despite our efforts” the district must “be realistic about what’s ahead.” 
Lexington had planned to pilot three programs this year, including a revised version of Units of Study. She said that portion of the pilot would end immediately because it “won’t appear on the state’s approved list.”
Hackett said Lexington’s educators have “seen results” over more than a decade using the curriculum and highlighted “bright spots,” including new decodable chapter books and a fifth-grade journalism unit that “turned classrooms into newsrooms.”
As the Senate prepares its own literacy bill, questions remain about how DESE will implement new requirements — and whether the department will revisit its definitions of high-quality instructional materials. While the legislation is unfinished, Gordon said its guardrails are clear: curricula must be supported by peer-reviewed evidence and cannot rely on guessing-based strategies.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/books-1204029_1920.jpg?fit=1024%2C681&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

(Getty Images) The latest effort to legalize marijuana in Florida encountered a legal setback but those behind a new amendment insist they still can qualify for the 2026 ballot.
Florida election officials have told local election supervisors to toss out 200,000 petition signatures that they say are invalid. Smart & Safe Florida, the group pushing the initiative, and which has relied on millions from the state’s largest medical marijuana provider, Trulieve, challenged the decision in court. But in a ruling from the bench last week by Leon County Circuit Judge John Cooper sided with the state.
Smart & Safe announced Tuesday that it would not appeal Cooper’s ruling.
“We are confident in the ability to submit enough petitions to make ballot position so long as the state does its job in good faith to process the submitted petitions and accurately report the verification totals,” the organization said in a prepared statement.
To place an initiative on the ballot, the group must gather more than 880,000 signatures from Florida voters. Smart & Safe says it still has more than 1 million signatures even without the ones disqualified by the state.
The deadline to have the petition signatures validated is Feb. 1.
In its statement, the organization urged Secretary of State Cord Byrd to “timely process the petitions and update its reporting of the verified petitions as required by law. The public deserves to have their petitions counted.”

Those backing the legalization effort tried and failed to get a measure passed in the 2024 election. Gov. Ron DeSantis sharply criticized the amendment and his then chief-of-staff James Uthmeier (now Florida attorney general) led the political committee that urged voters to turn it down. The amendment fell short of the 60% threshold needed to pass.
In early 2025, Smart & Safe renewed its push and mailed a copy of a reworked initiative to millions of voters. But instead of providing a complete text of the amendment, it listed a website address on the back of the petition form that had been approved by state officials. That website address took voters to a page on Smart & Safe website that included the entire amendment.
Byrd, however, sent Smart & Safe a “cease and desist” letter in which he questioned the legality of the forms and said they had been altered without permission. State officials also demanded the organization hand over names and addresses of those who received the forms. In early October, the Division of Elections instructed supervisors to invalidate roughly 200,000 signed forms.
Smart & Safe challenged the state’s directive to local election supervisors but after a one-day hearing last week Cooper ruled with the state.
Republican Party of Florida chair Evan Power applauded Cooper’s ruling.
“Gov. DeSantis did the right thing by enforcing the law and protecting the integrity of our ballot,” Power said. “Floridians will not be misled. If you want to change our constitution, you follow the rules — period.”

Kim Reynolds speaks with reporters outside of Terrace Hill in Des Moines Nov. 25, 2025. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Gov. Kim Reynolds said Tuesday that a property tax freeze for seniors is “one of the things” her campaign is looking at as it devises how to reduce property taxes in the state. 
Reynolds also spoke about the state’s request for a unified allocation of education funding and decision not to privatize health care for the Iowa Department of Corrections. 
Speaking to reporters outside of Terrace Hill in Des Moines following a ceremony pardoning Thanksgiving turkeys, Reynolds said she has heard from older Iowans across the state that are “having a hard time” making ends meet between ballooning property taxes and increases to health care premiums.

Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, who is running for governor in 2026, have pitched the idea of a property tax freeze for seniors. 
Reynolds said this is one strategy she is considering. 
“We have to see what the numbers look like,” Reynolds said. “We can’t shift it to the state, that’s not property tax relief … it has to be sustainable. We have to think differently about how we’re delivering services to Iowans and there’s a lot of opportunity out there to do that.” 
Reynolds, approaching her final year as governor, has said reducing property taxes in the state is her focus for the 2026 legislative session. 
“I’ve done a lot of hard things, but there’s a reason that it’s last,” Reynolds said about her planned task. “There’s a reason that it hasn’t been done.” 
Unified allocation
Iowa was the first state in the nation to file a unified allocation plan, which the state said seeks to “align” federal education programs and resources with state and local priorities.
 Reynolds said the plan would help to “eliminate some of the bureaucracy” between federal resources and state education programming. 
The plan aligns with President Donald Trump’s and U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon’s plans to dismantle the federal education department and instead send funding to the states. 
Reynolds said Tuesday she is “really excited” about the unified allocation plan. She said it will help reduce some of the “manpower” required for programs at the state and local levels to apply for and receive federal funding. 
“We really have realigned and strengthened our accountability system, the assessment system, and so we are in a really good place to be one of the first states to be able to do this,” Reynolds said. 
Department of Corrections to continue its own health care system 
In July, the Iowa Department of Corrections issued a request for proposals to contract a private company for health care services at state prisons. The department announced in late November it was not planning to move forward with plans to privatize. 
Reynolds said Tuesday the exploration was part of a process to verify that the current system made the most sense financially. 
“We’re always looking at just making sure that we’re using taxpayer dollars wisely, and that we’re being the most effective and efficient at providing these services,” Reynolds said.
Reynolds said she feels “good” about the decision to stay with the DOC rather than privatize, because the state explored its options. 
“People shouldn’t think that just because we are looking that it means it’s going to stop, or we’re going to eliminate or we’re going to change course,” Reynolds said. “We should constantly be looking at how we can do things better, and never be afraid of being better at what we’re doing, because these are taxpayer dollars that we’re utilizing.”

Mark Kelly and Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin wrote the inquiry will not deter them from publicly stating their concerns about the Trump administration. “Last night, the FBI's Counterterrorism Division appeared to open an inquiry into me in response to a video President Trump did not like,” Slotkin wrote in a statement published on social media. “The President directing the FBI to target us is exactly why we made this video in the first place,” Slotkin added. “He believes in weaponizing the federal government against his perceived enemies and does not believe laws apply to him or his Cabinet. He uses legal harassment as an intimidation tactic to scare people out of speaking up.”  Kelly’s office said it had “received this inquiry via the Sergeant at Arms.”  The House members said the FBI has contacted the House Sergeant at Arms office requesting interviews.“Senator Kelly won’t be silenced by President Trump and Secretary Hegseth’s attempt to intimidate him and keep him from doing his job as a U.S. Senator,” the spokesperson said. Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire separately issued a joint statement alleging that “Trump is using the FBI as a tool to intimidate and harass Members of Congress.”“No amount of intimidation or harassment will ever stop us from doing our jobs and honoring our Constitution,” they wrote. “We swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. That oath lasts a lifetime, and we intend to keep it. We will not be bullied. We will never give up the ship.”President Donald Trump after learning of the video posted on social media that he believed the statement from six Democratic lawmakers represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH.”The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Illegal ordersThose six lawmakers posted a video on social media on Nov. 18 telling members of the military and intelligence community that they “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”The Defense Department announced Monday that it was looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Kelly, a former Navy captain and NASA astronaut, for his participation in the video. The statement said defense officials may recall Kelly “to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” Kelly wrote in a statement responding to the investigation that he had “given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”“If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly wrote.Members of Congress’ official actions are generally protected under the speech and debate clause of the Constitution. A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states the judiciary’s “immunity principle protects Members from ‘intimidation by the executive’ or a ‘hostile judiciary’ by prohibiting both the executive and judicial powers from being used to improperly influence or harass legislators.”",,,,2025-11-25 15:59:55.869505

(Michelle Liu/Verite) Louisiana lawmakers signed off last week on one-year extensions to the state’s six biggest government contracts, collectively worth more than $17 billion. The agreements are with the six health care companies that manage health insurance for Louisiana Medicaid recipients. 
“These are the largest contracts that the state of Louisiana has in history,” state health secretary Bruce Greenstein told Louisiana’s Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget Thursday. “They are [the largest] every year because they only go up.” 
The managed care organizations receiving the contracts are Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, AmeriHealth Caritas Louisiana, Healthy Blue, Humana Healthy Horizons in Louisiana, Louisiana Healthcare Connections and UnitedHealthcare Community Plan. 
Medicaid provides government-backed health insurance for low-income residents, including children, and people who are disabled, blind and pregnant. Louisiana has a little over 1.5 million Medicaid enrollees, including 479,000 people insured through Medicaid expansion, according to health department projections from October. 
Overall, Louisiana’s Medicaid budget is approximately $22 billion in the current fiscal year, including$16.6 billion provided by the federal government. The rest of funding comes from a mixture of fees, dedicated taxes that medical providers pay and state tax revenue collected from other citizens and businesses. 
The new Medicaid contracts take effect in January and are worth approximately $2.2 billion more than the companies received last year.  The average amount the state pays the managed care organizations to insure Medicaid members will go up from $514 to $563 per patient per month. 
Much of that increase can be attributed to Louisiana’s decision to pay more money to hospitals, doctors, nurse practitioners and other health care providers who treat Medicaid patients, according to Greenstein and other members of his staff. 
Louisiana significantly boosted the amount of money Medicaid pays to hospitals and medical professionals in order to expand the network of providers who take Medicaid patients. Several doctors and hospitals were refusing to see people with Medicaid coverage because they considered Medicaid reimbursement rates too low to cover their costs.  
Even though payments to the Medicaid health care organizations are going up significantly, Greenstein said the growth in the Louisiana program’s spending per patient is lower than national health care inflation. 
Legislators expressed frustration last week that the six companies offering Medicaid plans have fallen short of adequate services in the past. For example, they hear complaints from constituents about the plans listing doctors and medical facilities as being available to Medicaid enrollees when they aren’t taking new Medicaid patients. 
There’s also an ongoing frustration with non-emergency medical transportation services, which help get Medicaid enrollees who can’t drive or take public transportation to and from their appointments. Legislators said constituents relying on this transportation, including those with disabilities, miss crucial treatments and doctors’ visits because their rides never pick them up. 

Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, questioned whether there were enough incentives to improve non-emergency medical transportation in the new Medicaid contracts. 
Greenstein responded that the health department was setting up a group to study the transportation issue, and that other states have similar challenges to the ones seen in Louisiana. 

“No one has a system that is superior to ours” when it comes to non-emergency medical transportation, Greenstein said. 
More generally, the state health secretary said Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration intends to raise standards for the private health insurance companies receiving the giant Medicaid contracts. They will no longer be rewarded with “participation trophies” for carrying out their services, Greenstein said. 
“This is a hard reset on our side,” he said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The state health department is withholding 3% of the money paid out on a per patient basis to the Medicaid contract holders until the end of the year when it can be determined whether they provided adequate services. Last year, the agency withheld less, only 2%, until a similar end-of-year review was conducted, according to a fact sheet the health department provided.  
The Landry administration initially showed interest in reducing the number of health insurance companies with Medicaid plans from the current six when the governor took office in 2024. Lawmakers in both parties have questioned whether the state is paying too much for overhead and administrative costs with so many companies involved. 
But Greenstein, a Landry appointee, didn’t seem enthusiastic when lawmakers asked about those efforts last week. The six companies meet different people’s health care needs, and very few Medicaid enrollees change their plan from year to year, he said, indicating they prefer to stay where they are.

Reducing the number of contracts could also prove difficult because of the political pressure that would ensue from national health care companies losing out on the business, although Greenstein didn’t mention that as a reason to avoid doing so. 

Still, a legislative resolution Senate President Pro Tempore Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, sponsored earlier this year requires the state health department to submit a report in January outlining the department’s plans for addressing oversight of Medicaid managed care organizations and how many companies currently have contracts.

Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake), at center in black shirt, helps volunteers fill boxes at the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina in Raleigh on Wednesday, Aug. 13, 2025. (Photo: Greg Childress/NC Newsline) As the holidays approach, food banks are feeling the effects of funding cuts, but striving to keep North Carolinians from going hungry.
The recent federal government shutdown, which lasted 43 days and became the longest shutdown in U.S. history, sent more people than usual to food banks. These included federal workers who weren’t getting paid and people who lost access to food assistance programs like SNAP.
But while food insecurity has become more evident in recent weeks, it isn’t new, according to Jason Kanawati Stephany, vice president of communications and public policy at the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina.
“Our communities were already facing the worst hunger crisis in a generation before the shutdown,” he said.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture cancelled $1 billion in funding for two programs that allowed food banks and schools to buy food from local farms and ranchers.
Along with restricting purchasing power for those groups, the cuts also meant less income for local farmers. In turn, some of them turned to food pantries for help.
The budget cuts continued through the spring. In April, the federal government scaled back on The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP), which works to stabilize the agricultural market by buying produce from farmers and distributing it to food banks.
That cut cost food banks in North Carolina over 80 truckloads of food, Kanawati Stephany said.
According to Kanawati Stephany, the combination of cuts meant less food and more need for assistance, even before the shutdown and loss of SNAP benefits drove demand even higher.
“It has really created a perfect storm in the worst possible way,” he said. “Hunger is a policy choice.”
Despite these setbacks, local communities have stepped up.
The Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina saw a record number of donated products in October. There are more than 700 local food assistance sites across the network, and Kanawati Stephany stressed that food is available to all who need it.
“We are depending on that community generosity more than ever because the federal support that we have long drawn on is just no longer there,” Kanawati Stephany said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCN0397-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Molly Jenkins, R-Coyle, listens to a bill presentation during the House session on May 22, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A House lawmaker has formally requested that the Oklahoma Attorney General weigh in on the legality of a state board’s decision to meet behind closed doors to discuss legislative salaries and stipends. 
Rep. Molly Jenkins, R-Coyle, sent a letter to Attorney General Gentner Drummond Monday asking him to issue an opinion on whether the Board on Legislative Compensation was legally allowed to hold an executive session during its Nov. 18 meeting to discuss pay raises for elected officials she contends the board doesn’t employ. 
The seven voting members of the board conferred behind closed doors about setting new salaries and stipends for legislative leadership, but voted publicly to approve the changes. During two previous meetings this year the same conversations were held publicly. 
Just ahead of the Nov. 18 meeting, legislative leaders and the governor replaced four members of the board. 
Jenkins said the executive session doesn’t pass the “smell test” and if it was permitted through a “loophole” in state law, it needs to be corrected immediately. 
The board voted Nov. 18 to raise lawmaker salaries by $7,400, up to $54,900. In addition to the 15% raise, the panel doled out increased stipends for over a dozen leaders in the House and Senate. Combined, the increases, which are the first since 2019, total $1.3 million annually. 
The board’s actions rescinded previous votes to keep lawmaker pay stagnant while increasing stipends for some legislative leaders. 
The board chair, David “Chip” Carter, said after the meeting that the executive session allowed members to discuss salary changes more freely.
Shauna Peters, a spokesperson for the attorney general’s office, said state law was followed. 
“State law plainly authorizes a public body to convene in executive session to discuss the salary of ‘any individual salaried public officer or employee.’ Further discussion and all votes occurred in open session, in full compliance with the Open Meeting Act,” she said in a statement. “Although some may disagree with the outcome or decision, the law was followed. If a lawmaker wishes to change the current law, or undo the votes of the two bodies, we trust that they will introduce a bill to do so.” 
The Attorney General’s Office was present at the Nov. 18 meeting and represents the compensation board. 
Jenkins said while state law allows executive sessions for boards to discuss salaries of their own employees, lawmakers are not the employees of the legislative compensation board. 
“I was heartbroken to hear that the Legislative Compensation Board entered an executive session, which I do not believe is authorized by Oklahoma law, before voting to award these massive raises,” she said in a statement. “This is not transparency, and this is not the Oklahoma way.”
Jenkins said she is considering options to amend state statute to prevent pay raises from happening in this manner again, including proposing an amendment to “abolish” the board and freeze salaries, pending voter approval for future increases. She said if the raises were legal, she plans to donate her salary increase to an organization in her district. 
She also said she plans to propose legislation to block pay raises for statewide elected officials and freeze their salaries. 
“Public service should never be about the money; it should be about sacrifice,” Jenkins said in a statement. “You can never pay a true public servant enough. But you can absolutely overpay a worthless politician.”
The agenda for the Nov. 18 meeting cited state statute and an attorney general opinion as justification for the executive session. 
The agenda cited a part of state statute that allows for executive sessions “discussing the employment, hiring, appointment, promotion, demotion, disciplining or resignation of any individual salaried public officer or employee.” The attorney general opinion cites similar language. 
The members of the legislative compensation board also make up the Statewide Official Compensation Commission. 
The Commission also met Nov. 18 and reversed course on previous salary decisions, but still raised the salaries of every Oklahoma statewide official between 18% to 40%.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Disability Rights Center-NH has launched an investigation into New Hampshire’s disability care system following a series of articles published by the Bulletin earlier this month, the agency said Monday.
The Bulletin’s reporting uncovered systemic abuse and neglect, sometimes fatal, within the state’s intellectual and developmental disability care system. From January 2023 through June 2025, there were 467 credible reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation against people in this system investigated by the state, according to records obtained by the Bulletin. The records also show 119 people died in the system during this time period. As part of its investigation into the tragedies, the Bulletin spoke with lawyers, advocates, and family members of victims.
In New Hampshire, people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are entitled to care that is funded and overseen by the state. The Department of Health and Human Services contracts with 10 private area agencies, each responsible for a region of the state, to coordinate the care. The agencies either provide that care themselves or subcontract with another vendor agency.
The Disability Rights Center-NH, or DRC, is a federally designated protection and advocacy agency. That means it has statutory legal authority to conduct investigations into suspected abuse and neglect against people with disabilities, access records that aren’t normally releasable under open records laws, and pursue litigation on behalf of people with disabilities. In order to launch an investigation into malpractice, the agency needs to establish “probable cause.” (Though the standard for probable cause is lower for an agency like theirs than it is for law enforcement.)
Francesca Broderick, the organization’s senior staff attorney and investigations coordinator, said the Bulletin’s series earlier this month gave the agency probable cause.
“Under federal statute, media reports are actually enumerated as a source that could form the basis of a probable cause finding,” Broderick said. “Media reports are obviously a way that a lot of things come to light.”
Broderick said the DRC is looking at the system broadly. She said her team is pulling documents the Bulletin made public — specifically the state’s mortality report — and using them as launching points for its investigation.
“Our goal for the investigation is to see if there are patterns,” she said. “To see if there’s anything that we can point to in terms of systems failing. Is there a lack of appropriate reporting? Is there lack of an information infrastructure to actually capture this data? Is there concern about who’s reviewing the data?”
Broderick said the center hopes to release a public report at the end of their investigation in early summer with specific recommendations for changes to strengthen the system.
Broderick said the DRC already had concerns about oversight, supervision, and training, but investigators want to learn more specifics. She said the agencies involved have so far been cooperating.
“The purpose isn’t to point the finger or to only assign blame,” she said. “We want it to be constructive, we want there to be the opportunity for changes, because that’s how we can ensure that people with disabilities are not going to face the same circumstances in this system and aren’t going to be subject to abuse or neglect or even death.”
She also said anyone who wants to share their experiences with the system should email mail@drcnh.org or call 603-228-0432.
Broderick said in the DRC’s discussions with lawmakers following the Bulletin’s reporting, there appears to be “an appetite to look at legislation in this area.”
“I’m hopeful that that does happen,” she said.
Lawmakers and officials react
After the Bulletin released its investigation earlier this month, Gov. Kelly Ayotte said she reached out to Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver and Attorney General John Formella.
“These are very serious allegations,” Ayotte, a Republican, said. “They need to be examined, and we need to make sure that the system is serving the people that have disabilities in our communities, and also any of the contractors, the area agencies that contract with the state to serve people with disabilities, make sure that they are performing and that they are treating people well, so I take this very seriously.”
She promised to “continue to make sure that these are investigated, that we follow through with any changes that need to be made to the system.”
Republican state Senate President Sharon Carson and House Speaker Sherman Packard didn’t respond to the Bulletin’s requests for comment. However, their Democratic counterparts in the Legislature lambasted Republicans, who control both chambers and the governorship, for cuts to DHHS.
“The allegations revealed in this reporting are horrifying, and there is simply no justification for abuse or neglect by the State,” House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson said in a statement. “Former Gov. (Chris) Sununu and Gov. Ayotte owe the public a clear explanation for how this was allowed to persist despite DHHS reportedly receiving hundreds of complaints.”
Simpson pointed to a $51 million budget cut to the DHHS Republicans instituted in this year’s budget, layoffs at that agency, and mostly stagnant Medicaid provider rates. “These decisions only further strain a clearly overburdened system,” she said.
 While she’s not aware of any legislation filed on this issue, Simpson said “it is difficult to imagine that reforms will not be necessary. Lawmakers may need to strengthen oversight of third-party vendors, tighten certification and licensing requirements, and expand auditing practices to ensure this kind of tragedy never happens again.”
State Sen. Cindy Rosenwald called the abuses and deaths “shameful and unacceptable” and said Democrats “fully intend on working to address this matter.”
“There needs to be enhanced oversight for these systems of care, so this never occurs again,” state Sen. Suzanne Prentiss added. “Gaps in mandatory reporting and prevention must be addressed.”
The two said in a statement that Senate Democrats “commit to working to reform and address the system of care provided to our fellow citizens so this may never happen again.” They specifically cited making in-person check-ins on constituents more frequent and improving communication and publicity.
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, who has a son with cerebral palsy and has frequently cited disability rights as a top issue, said in a statement: “My heart goes out to the victims and families of those who suffered in these horrific instances of abuse and neglect, and I hope that justice is served. While this is primarily a state law enforcement and regulatory issue, I support investigations into such cases and attention being given to the systemic questions they raise about the quality of care for people with disabilities in New Hampshire.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/drcinvestigation-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Javokhir Rahimov-Akobirovich, a native of Uzbekistan who is seeking asylum in the United States, is suing Hardin County Jail Administrator Nick Whitmore and Hardin County Sheriff Dave McDaniel in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
Also named as defendants are Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Acting Director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Todd Lyons, St. Paul ICE Field Office Director Peter Berg, and Acting Director for the Executive Office for Immigration Review Sirce Owen.

In his lawsuit, Rahimov-Akobirovich argues he has lived in the United States for the last five years and first came into contact with ICE when deportation proceedings were initiated in October 2020.
Court records indicate that in December 2020, Rahimov-Akobirovich was released from custody under a $5,000 bond that was approved by an immigration judge in San Diego, California. On Nov. 20, 2025, Rahimov-Akobirovich, who lives in Calexico, California, was traveling through Iowa when he was apprehended by ICE agents and placed in the Hardin County Jail.
The lawsuit alleges Rahimov-Akobirovich is the victim of the Trump administration’s new policy suggesting that every individual held for possible deportation is subject to mandatory detention regardless of how long they’ve lived in the United States.
“ICE and the DOJ have adopted this position even with the weight of almost every federal district court against them,” the lawsuit asserts, adding that without relief from U.S. District Court, Rahimov-Akobirovich faces “the prospect of months, or even years, in immigration custody, separated from his family and community.”
The lawsuit, which alleges due-process violations and unlawful denial of release on bond, seeks a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order preventing federal officials from moving Rahimov-Akobirovich out of Hardin County until a decision can be reached in the matter. It alleges ICE is “ignoring” the fact that Rahimov-Akobirovich was free on bond, as approved by an immigration judge, when agents had him jailed in Hardin County.
The Department of Justice and the other defendants in the case have yet to respond to the lawsuit.
The lawsuit is one of hundreds filed throughout the United States challenging the Trump administration’s new interpretation of longstanding immigration laws. Dozens of cases have been filed in Iowa, with many of them naming as defendants the counties in which DHS and ICE are holding people in jail.
For close to 30 years, the DOJ and the courts held that individuals who were living in the United States and were then subject to deportation proceedings were entitled to a hearing on whether they should be released on bond while their deportation case was pending.
In July of this year, the Trump administration, through DHS, ICE and the Department of Justice, announced new “guidance” regarding the detention of applicants for admission to the United States. The guidance, which has since been declared to be DOJ policy, states that all persons who have entered the United States without inspection are deemed subject to mandatory detention without the possibility of a bond hearing.
On Sept. 5, 2025, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a decision consistent with the administration’s new policy, holding that immigration judges lack the authority to hear bond requests in such cases.
That shift in policy upends the longstanding interpretation of federal law that said individuals already living in the United States while seeking lawful admission — as opposed to individuals apprehended at the border — were entitled to due process and could argue for pretrial release on bond.
Lawyers for people rounded up and jailed under the administration’s new interpretation of the law argue the new policy was crafted in response to Congress’ appropriation of billions of dollars to expand the immigration system, which will soon enable ICE to double its capacity to jail individuals on any given day.
Since July, immigration judges around the nation have embraced the administration’s new interpretation of the law, stating they lack the jurisdiction to determine bond for any person who has entered the United States without inspection, even if that person has resided in the United States for decades.
That, in turn, has led to hundreds of detainees across the country suing DHS, ICE and their local jailers in U.S. District Court, which is entirely separate from Immigration Court. In the overwhelming majority of those cases, federal judges have ruled in favor of the detainees and said those individuals are entitled to bond hearings.
Despite those rulings, immigration judges continue to deny detainees’ requests for bond hearings, leading to additional lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)If you live in the Rio Grande Valley, you have probably heard heard the strange croaks of the sandhill crane or the honk of the Ross’s goose overhead when out for a walk along the river.
That’s because, in the fall and winter, tens of thousands of large migratory geese, cranes, and other water fowl nesting in Alaska, Canada, and the northern United States fly south to roost and forage for food.
“It just gets cold up there,” said Tucker Davidson, who primarily works with Audubon Southwest on expanding riparian restoration projects with the aim of improving water availability for birds. “They need soft soil that they can probe their bills into to find invertebrates that aren’t totally frozen over.”
Davidson said that migratory birds look for a combination of wetlands or flooded fields with nearby sources of food to tide them over until they ultimately head back north to nest in the spring.
As it happens, Albuquerque lies in the middle of one of the four major migratory bird corridors in the United States. Beginning in North Dakota, the so-called central flyway pushes birds from north to south – utilizing portions of the Rio Grande as a sky highway that naturally funnels birds down to New Mexico.

It’s pathways like these that are much more preferable than the seemingly indistinguishable prairies and grasslands in other parts of the country. By using the Rio Grande, birds can use unique visual clues like the mountains and the river’s winding ribbons as a guide. There are also other benefits that attract birds.
“Everything needs water on their way south,” Davidson said. “Some of these trips are really, really long. Especially for large migratory birds, they are cuing in on the wetlands along the river.”
Currently, New Mexico is experiencing its driest 20-year period in the last 1200 years, often referred to as a “megadrought” by scientists.
Drought has consequential effects that directly impact birds by causing bouts of dehydration or hypothermia, and reducing the availability of insects, vegetation, and fruits that birds rely on for nutrients.
And conditions for the future are not looking any better. Climate modeling estimates that New Mexico will have significantly less snowfall and, therefore, runoff to fill the Rio Grande – one of the main travel corridors for these birds.

Snowpack is a crucial piece of the climate puzzle for understanding how much water will be in the state’s rivers and streams. For example, models run by KUNM show a decline of 67% to 80% in the average amount of water in New Mexico’s January snowpack, depending on future emissions scenarios.
In addition, state of New Mexico reports estimate that flows into the Rio Grande above Elephant Butte Reservoir will decrease by up to 25% in the next 50 years as annual average temperatures increase from anywhere between 3 to 7 degrees. Other models estimate that the climate could warm even more.
While it is true that the state has made significant strides to reduce its water use since historic peaks in municipal/agricultural use in the 1980s and 90s, a disproportionate amount of the state’s water is used for agriculture.
A recent report estimates that New Mexico uses an eye-popping 80% of its fresh water for agricultural uses – including for dairies, alfalfa, pecans, and chile farming. Within those irrigated acres, most are irrigated with sprinkler systems or flooding.
The widespread technique of flooding fields for crops is a big reason why birds continue to visit New Mexico, even during times of extreme drought.
“Attracting the cranes and geese really is a manufactured thing at this point,” Davidson said. “We have to flood up fields, and if we don’t provide corn or supplemental food, then they would probably start to find other places to overwinter.”
But in an increasingly arid Southwest, water policy experts are wary of using scarce water resources to flood fields in the face of a drier future. Instead, they’re endorsing more climate-friendly solutions like drip-irrigation to balance the West’s increasing water appetite and the needs of wildlife.
Without water in the Bosque ecosystem, scientific evidence suggests birds might decide to reroute their migratory path elsewhere in the decades to come, maybe avoiding New Mexico entirely.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/unnamed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

(File/Getty Images)Resources are available for anyone in crisis or concerned about someone else: Call or text 988 to reach the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline.
Few South Carolinians may know the name of Dr. Nolan Williams, who died last month, but to many people suffering with depression, Williams was something of a miracle worker.
Williams, born and educated in South Carolina, died from the devastating illness he had helped alleviate in perhaps hundreds of others.
Only 43 years old, Williams took his own life at his northern California home Oct. 8.
Those close to him said he had long struggled with depression.
Two of his former professors and colleagues at the Medical University of South Carolina called Williams “bold and visionary,” a “brilliant neuropsychiatrist” whose groundbreaking experiments “impacted multiple fields.”
The neuropsychiatrist “changed the landscape of mental health treatment” by developing a noninvasive brain-stimulation technique for people with treatment-resistant depression, friend Thomas Reiner wrote in a fundraising page he created for the family.
Williams’ story began modestly in the small town of Bamberg (population about 2,900 today) on June 25, 1982.
His father, a baseball fan, named him Nolan Ryan Williams after Hall of Fame pitcher Nolan Ryan.
Williams’ father was a fisherman and carpenter; his mother ran a day care and later worked as a caterer.
His family later moved to Charleston, where Williams grew up.
His passion for excellence emerged early: Williams attained a black belt in Taekwondo at 18, becoming a world-class champion in high school. He also developed a lifelong love of kitesurfing.
“He kitesurfed all over the globe and never missed a chance to spend a day kiting before or after scientific meetings,” said Dr. Mark S. George and Dr. Harold A. Sackeim in a recent tribute to Williams, detailing his important research accomplishments.
Williams earned his bachelor’s degree in molecular biology from the College of Charleston in 2003. It was later while earning his medical degree at the Medical University of South Carolina that Williams became fascinated with the practice of stimulating the brain to relieve severe depression that is resistant to therapy and drugs.
Hired in 2014 by the Stanford University School of Medicine, Williams founded the school’s Brain Stimulation Lab, focusing on treating psychiatric illnesses such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
It was there that Williams developed a fast-acting high-tech therapy called SAINT (Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy) that targets the area of the brain where depression originates.
In a clinical study of SAINT, 80% of patients suffering from depression experienced remission. Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2022, SAINT is now being used in several clinics across the country.
Kyle Williams wrote that his brother “Nolan was far more than a brilliant doctor — he was a loving husband, devoted father, cherished son, and the pillar of our family. His bond with his mother, Ann, was unbreakable, and his kindness, laughter, and heart touched everyone he met.”
A light in darkness
Williams also led studies of veterans in special operations forces struggling with PTSD and traumatic brain injury, with symptoms including anger, depression, anxiety and insomnia. He collaborated with a nonprofit organization, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS), to investigate the effectiveness of the drug ibogaine, which some veterans had used in Mexico because it’s not legal in the U.S.
VETS honored Williams in a statement: “His research demonstrated what these veterans courageously believed: That healing was possible, that their suffering mattered, and that science could meet them in their darkest hour.”
In addition to his brother and mother, Williams is survived by his wife, Dr. Kristin Raj, and their two children, Autumn and Hendrix.
He leaves behind a legacy of caring for some of society’s most vulnerable citizens.
Reiner, the family friend, said Williams “had a deep compassion for patients” and “gave everything he had to help others heal.”
The loss of a brilliant native son of South Carolina is especially poignant at a time when suicide is on the rise in our state. The suicide rate in South Carolina, higher than the national average, increased by 44% over the past 20 years.
That hits close to home.
My own community of Anderson County in 2025 is experiencing the highest number of suicide deaths in its recorded history.
Suicide prevention and other mental health concerns should be top state priorities.
South Carolina’s gubernatorial candidates, already fiercely campaigning for next year’s election, have had little or nothing to say about suicide prevention and mental health as they clamor for slashing taxes while ignoring vulnerable South Carolinians who’ll be impacted by federal cuts to Medicaid, mental health and addiction treatment.
And yet there’s always hope.
Here in Anderson County, for instance, some public-spirited residents recently announced a campaign to establish the AOP (Anderson, Oconee, and Pickens) Clubhouse, offering comprehensive help for people living with mental illness.
There’s always a light shining in darkness, thanks to supportive communities and the legacy of brilliant doctors like Nolan Williams.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mental-health.jpg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

Phil Murphy issued 55 pardons and commutations Tuesday in his latest round of post-conviction relief and said more would come before he leaves office in January.
Most of the clemencies granted Monday went to people with non-violent drug convictions. The charges others faced varied widely and included 13 serving sentences for murder.
“Each one of them has owned up to their actions. They have made amends, and they are ready to reenter society and start giving back to the great Garden State,” Murphy said during a ceremony at the Santa Isabel Lutheran Church in Elizabeth. “To all of the families who will soon be reunited as a result of these commutations, let me say: Your days of separation and longing are finally coming to an end.”
Attorney asks court to weigh wrongful conviction claim in Newark slaying

The latest pardons and commutations, made in line with recommendations from an advisory board convened in June 2024, bring total clemencies under Murphy to 283. That’s more than double the 105 clemencies issued total by every governor since Christine Todd Whitman took office in 1994.
The advisory board recommends clemency for certain classes of offenders, chiefly those convicted of non-violent crimes who have remained offense-free for at least a decade, though those serving excessive sentences or who were victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, or sex trafficking are also eligible.
The governor’s actions Tuesday included 36 pardons, which are granted to individuals who have completed their sentences, and 19 commutations, which reduce sentences for those who are currently incarcerated or on parole.
The clemencies would help reunite families ahead of Thanksgiving, Murphy said, though it’s not clear whether the 17 imprisoned people granted commutations Tuesday will be released by Thursday.
“For families with loved ones living behind bars, the holiday season can be painful. It’s a time of the year that puts an even brighter spotlight on that empty seat at the dinner table and the heartbreak of distance and lost time can weigh heavily on the heart,” Murphy said. “Let me say unequivocally that also goes for the families of victims.
The governor said the commutations would reunite families “in the coming weeks.”
Murphy’s grants of clemency to individuals convicted of serious violent crimes — including murder, robbery, and arson — have incensed some Republican lawmakers. State Sen. Tony Bucco (R-Morris), the Senate’s minority leader, called the wave of clemencies Murphy issued earlier this month an insult to law-abiding New Jerseyans.
“These aren’t petty offenses. These are the worst of the worst, and now, thanks to Governor Murphy, these people will be walking free under the false banner of ‘reform,’” Bucco said in early November.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Saying the issue is now moot, Oklahoma’s highest court dismissed a lawsuit challenging a requirement that public schools keep Bibles in classrooms and teach from them.
In a 6-2 decision, the Oklahoma Supreme Court wrote Monday that newly appointed state Superintendent Lindel Fields and the six new members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education said they planned to nullify a 2024 mandate requiring Bible usage in schools. The new education leaders also told the justices that they were not pursuing other mandates issued by former state Superintendent Ryan Walters that would use taxpayer money to purchase classroom Bibles or “biblically-based character education materials.”
Over 30 Oklahomans of various faiths or no religious affiliation had sued State Department of Education leaders in October 2024, arguing that the Bible mandates issued by Walters in June and July 2024 violated the state Constitution’s prohibition on state-established religion. They asked the court to block the use of taxpayer dollars to purchase Bibles and declare the overall mandate unenforceable.
They argued the Education Department did not follow state requirements when implementing the Bible teaching requirements, and that state academic standards hadn’t been changed to justify Walters’ order. Many of those plaintiffs had children in public schools and said required school-based biblical instruction could interfere with their ability to teach their own religious or moral beliefs at home.
Walters resigned in September to become CEO of the Teacher Freedom Alliance. Gov. Kevin Stitt tapped Fields in October to finish the remaining 15 months of Walters’ term. He will lead the state agency and State Board of Education until January 2027. Oklahomans will elect the next state superintendent during statewide general elections in November 2026.
Attorneys with American Civil Liberties Union, the Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, the Freedom from Religion Foundation and Americans United for Separation of Church and State represented the Oklahoma residents.
In a joint statement, the attorneys said they were pleased that Fields had “abandoned former Superintendent Walters’ attempts to incorporate the Bible into the public-school curriculum and classrooms, and to buy Bibles and biblical-instructional materials with state tax dollars.
They also said in a statement that they were pleased that Fields had rescinded and nullified Walters’ biblical policies.
“Fields’ actions and the Supreme Court’s order mean that Oklahoma families and students – not politicians – will get to decide if, when and how to engage with the Bible,” the attorneys said.
The State Department of Education didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.

On Oct. 24, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued a new “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order to the Atlantic Alumina Co. facility that refines bauxite mineral into a feedstock chemical used to make aluminum. The facility is the only one of its kind in the United States. 
The notice serves to warn the company of potential penalties for alleged violations state inspectors documented during a recent file review and field visits conducted Aug. 8 and Oct. 17 following a citizen’s complaint. The document, which the Department of Environmental Quality published earlier this month, notes the Atalco refinery failed an effluent toxicity test of the discharges sampled from its Mississippi River drainage outlet. Performed every three months as a matter of routine, the toxicity test involves exposing minnows and crustaceans to various concentrations of the sampled effluent over a 48-hour period. 
According to the test conducted Sept. 4, Atalco’s sampled discharges were significantly more toxic than what the state allows in the Mississippi River. Even at the lowest concentration tested, the sampled effluent began killing significant numbers of crustaceans. When tested at the 1.5% standard concentration at which the animals should still be able to survive, the effluent killed 64% of the Daphnia pulex crustaceans, better known as water fleas.
Atalco did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Ahmed Harhara is a chemical engineer who runs a neighborhood-level environmental data website in the Houston area and is familiar with the toxicity tests used in refinery operations. He reviewed the Atalco lab results and said they are a strong signal of a serious problem at the facility. 
“These tests are basically an early warning system,” Harhara said. “If fish or small aquatic animals don’t survive in the sample water, it means the effluent is too toxic — even after it’s been treated — and could harm life in nearby streams if released.” 
Harhara pointed out that the method for toxicity testing is tailored to the specific water stream  receiving the discharges. The test conducted for Atalco uses a dilution or concentration factor that takes into account the Mississippi River’s current and massive volume of water, meaning it would take high levels of toxicity to fail the test.
Nicholas Fisher, an environmental scientist who studies aquatic pollution at Stony Brook University and also reviewed the lab results, said effluent toxicity tests often understate the danger of the pollution.
“I would say they’re overlooking a lot of the toxicity,” Fisher said. “The stuff that’s in the effluent is probably far more toxic than they realize.”
LDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks. Fines to be determined.

When tested on minnows, the sampled effluent had no significant effect, but both Harhara and Fisher said that’s not surprising as the crustaceans are generally far more sensitive to many industrial contaminants. Also, fish are more mobile than small crustaceans and can swim away from areas of poor water quality, Harhara said. 
It’s unclear how often facilities such as Atalco fail effluent toxicity tests. LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said only it happens occasionally, but had no relevant data available. The agency doesn’t track the test results in a global way, she added. 
Harhara said toxicity test failures are infrequent at facilities with properly working treatment systems. 
“In my view, it is newsworthy precisely because these failures are rare and measurable. They show where the treatment system may have slipped, even briefly,” he said. “It’s the kind of data point regulators and the public should pay attention to.”
On Oct. 21, just days before the Department of Environmental Quality issued the notice of potential penalty, aerial photos of the Atalco site showed plumes of discoloration in the river coming from the facility’s drainage pipe. 
Aside from the toxicity test results, LDEQ’s notice cited large volumes of discharges with high pH levels that Atalco drained into the river at over 20 times the rate allowed under its permit. 
When state inspectors visited the area on Aug. 8 and Oct. 17, they discovered public stormwater ditches and waterways filled with reddish-orange water. This included the Hope Canal, which flows to the Maurepas Swamp, according to the notice.  
An Atalco representative told the inspectors the facility’s runoff containment system failed after it was inundated with sediment, and the runoff became contaminated with Atalco’s “red mud” waste, the notice states. 
“The inspection revealed that the Respondent failed to maintain waters of the state in an aesthetically attractive condition and meet the generally accepted aesthetic qualifications,” the LDEQ notice said.
Atalco received a similar notice from the Department of Environmental Quality in August for separate violations stemming from erosion channels in the giant levees of Atalco’s red mud waste lakes. The fissures allowed waste slurry to escape from the facility and contaminate state waters. 
Records the Illuminator reviewed indicate the facility’s waste byproduct contains toxic heavy metals and other hazardous chemicals. 
The latest infractions continue a pattern spanning more than a year during which the company has struggled to contain toxic releases from its facility despite heightened public scrutiny over previous violations of environmental laws and workplace safety regulations.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy is now considering who may fill two legislative seats vacated by state senators seeking higher office.
Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned Nov. 3 to run for lieutenant governor, and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned Nov. 14 to run for governor. 
On Sunday, Republicans in Hughes’ district proposed three local residents to fill her seat: Rep. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, Matanuska-Susitna school board member Tom Bergey, and Gerrie Deal of Palmer.
Under state law, Dunleavy does not have to pick any of the three, but Republican Party rules state that local party officials will propose nominees to the governor in the event of a vacancy.
Dunleavy has until Dec. 14 — 30 days after Hughes’ resignation — to fill the seat.
The deadline to fill Shower’s vacant seat is coming up sooner: Republicans in his district have nominated Reps. Kevin McCabe, R-Big Lake, and George Rauscher, R-Sutton, for the vacancy, as well as Ryan Sheldon, a former aide to Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage.
Any person picked for the Senate must be confirmed with a majority vote by the Senate’s Republican members, which includes four remaining members of the all-Republican Senate minority as well as the five Republicans who are in the Senate’s majority caucus. 
If Dunleavy picks a current member of the state House for either seat, he will create a vacancy that he must fill within 30 days. 
That person — or those people — will almost certainly join the House’s 19-person all-Republican minority caucus, whose leadership is in flux.
On Saturday, House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage, said she would resign immediately as minority leader.
The resignation came after two members of the minority met with her and said there were enough votes to remove her as leader. That meeting was first described by Jeff Landfield of the Alaska Landmine. 
Her resignation, which had not been requested, leaves the minority’s position uncertain ahead of the legislative session. The minority leader is traditionally in charge of opposition messaging and is the main negotiator between the House majority and minority caucuses.
This past year, members of the House minority repeatedly diverged on key topics, including a vote on whether or not to override Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s education funding vetoes. 
The Alaska House is currently controlled by a 21-person majority that includes Republicans, Democrats and independents.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251029-Capitol2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 14:58:02.668201

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Susan Stuebner has been named the 26th president of Simpson College after serving as its interim leader during the fall semester.
The private university, located in Indianola, announced in a news release Tuesday its board of trustees unanimously selected Stuebner to officially take on the role after the completion of a performance review by higher education search firm Academic Search.
Stuebner joined Simpson as its interim president in late July after the death of president Jay Byers in April. When she was first introduced to campus, college board Chair Terry Handley said Stuebner and the board would decide together if she wanted to stay, in consultation with the Simpson community and subject to a review of her work during the fall semester.

He said in the release it was an “easy” decision to make in the end, looking at her past successes as a university president and hearing positive things about her from community members.
“Faculty, staff and student leaders were enthusiastic in their praise for President Stuebner and the many leadership strengths she brings to Simpson College,” Handley said in the release. “Sue’s authenticity and transparency in engaging with the campus community have already gone a long way in building early trust and confidence. The board is eager to partner with her in designing and realizing a promising future for Simpson.”
Before coming to Simpson, Stuebner served as president of Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire for eight years, spending her last year before coming to Simpson as an adviser for the institution’s interim president.
In her first speech to the Simpson College community, Stuebner said Colby-Sawyer and Simpson were facing similar challenges, and she planned to bring the same model to Indianola of finding new revenue streams and building partnerships from popular programs.
Stuebner said in the release she is both “honored and humbled” by the board’s decision to keep her leading Simpson.
“From the moment I arrived on campus, I have resonated with the values and approach of this incredible learning community. Seeing our exceptional faculty and staff in action as they create a transformational educational experience for our students is truly inspiring,” Stuebner said in the release. “Simpson students and alumni exhibit so much passion about their time on campus and are making a difference in their professions and communities.
“I look forward to partnering with the Simpson community in pursuing new avenues of innovative excellence to further distinguish Simpson as a national leader in liberal arts education.”

In the 11th District, the seat will be without an incumbent, as U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, who is in her fourth term representing the district, is running for the U.S. Senate. 
Barrett’s seat a top target to flip in 2026, James’ gubernatorial bid opens opportunity

She’s one of two congressional representatives in the state vying for statewide office: John James, who represents Michigan’s 10th District, is leaving the lower chamber to run for governor. James’ decision to leave his seat behind has been controversial, as some thought it could lead to a Democrat flip, but Stevens’ seat is considered a solid Democratic stronghold, meaning the primary will be a key race to watch in 2026.
The other, the 13th District, still has its incumbent in the race, but he does face a unique challenge in his district. U.S. Rep. Shri Thanedar of Detroit is seeking his third term in the seat, but since taking office, he has been the center of a number of controversies, not least of which is his staunch support for Israel. 
His main primary competitor, State Rep. Donavan McKinney, has been endorsed by the more progressive wing of Michigan’s Democratic Party, including neighboring U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib. McKinney has also criticized Thanedar, a multi-millionaire business owner, for being out of touch with his constituents in one of the lowest-income districts nationwide.
Here’s Michigan Advance’s breakdown of the races thus far, the support each candidate has received and fundraising totals as of the last filing deadline on Sept. 30.

The turkeys, both toms this year, came from the farm of Josh and Kelli Berg, first-generation farmers near Early who raise close to a million turkeys each year. 
Josh Berg is also president of the Iowa Turkey Federation, which Reynolds highlighted in her proclamation pardoning the turkeys. 
“In Iowa, we’re proud to be one of the nation’s top turkey-producing states,” Reynolds said.

She noted the state has over 130 turkey farms in the state. According to the federation, Iowa raises about 12 million turkeys annually. 
“These are mostly family farms continuing multigenerational operations, hard-working farm families who care deeply about animal health, quality of the product, and really, most importantly, keeping this proud tradition strong and rural Iowa vibrant,” Reynolds said speaking over the gobbles of the roaming turkeys.

According to the federation, the turkey industry in Iowa supports 38,000 jobs in Iowa annually and is responsible for $10.64 billion in total economic activity. 
Turkey pardoning began in the late 1940s with President Harry Truman and has continued in Iowa since the 1970s. Last year, Reynolds pardoned turkeys “Caitlin” and “Clark,” presumably named after Iowa’s famed basketball player.
President Donald Trump pardoned turkeys “Waddle” and “Gobble” Tuesday morning in front of the White House.
Reynolds said the Thanksgiving holiday is a “great time to pause and to thank our farmers for the impact that they have” in the state and beyond. 
Reynolds said she plans to host her extensive family for Thanksgiving at Terrace Hill this year and expects a crowd of about 25 people. 
“It’s about bringing family together, and it’s about just spending time together and creating memories,” Reynolds said.  “We have some incredible memories that we’ve created here at Terrace Hill.” 
This is the second to last Thanksgiving the governor will spend at Terrace Hill, as she does not plan to run for reelection.

(Photo by Marco Lozzi for Utah News Dispatch)Calling Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map that creates a Democratic-leaning district the “most gerrymandered map in the history of the state of Utah,” Utah’s Republican legislators are digging in their fight against the judge’s ruling. 
House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, held a news conference at the Utah Capitol on Tuesday — with dozens of GOP legislators from both the House and Senate at their backs — to announce they plan to appeal 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s decision to the Utah Supreme Court. 
Additionally, the legislative leaders announced they are gearing up for a special session expected to be held Dec. 9 to consider their legislative options to ensure the state’s election system has “clarity” ahead of the 2026 election. 
The agenda for that special session is still being decided, legislative leaders said. But lawmakers may consider putting a constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot to ask voters whether to “clarify” when lawmakers can make changes to laws enacted by ballot initiatives. 
Lawmakers may also weigh delaying candidate filing deadlines in order to allow more time for a different congressional map to be enacted for the 2026 election — but the special session’s agenda hasn’t yet been finalized, according to Gov. Spencer Cox, who will be issuing the call. 
“It’s deeply concerning that an unelected judge overrode the Utah Constitution … and silenced Utahns by imposing a map without public input,” Adams said, arguing that the map she picked, drawn by the plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit against the state, didn’t follow a public process. 
Democrats in the Utah House and Senate issued a joint statement after Tuesday’s press conference condemning the call for a special session next month, saying “we continue to believe that Judge Gibson’s ruling should be respected.”
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

“The Legislature’s map failed to comply with Proposition 4, and the court selected the map that did meet the law’s requirements,” House and Senate Democrats said. “It is fiscally irresponsible to use tax payer dollars to fight this legal battle, which undermines the will of Utah voters. Utahns deserve to know their voices matter and their representatives do not choose their voters.” 
Utah’s Republican lawmakers continue to argue that Gibson violated the Utah Constitution when she picked a map that wasn’t adopted by the Utah Legislature, which GOP lawmakers continue to argue — despite multiple court rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting court battle — has the sole authority to redistrict. 
Plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit have pointed to court proceedings in other states and  argued the courts have a duty to intervene and select “remedial” maps when they determine lawmakers have failed to follow the law. But Republican lawmakers contend the judge should have gone another route, like asking the Legislature to vote on an alternative, rather than picking a map and sidelining the Legislature. 
Now, Adams and Schultz said county clerks and candidates are facing “chaos” and confusion over the new map’s boundaries. 
“Utahns deserve a process that’s stable, transparent and accountable. One in which decisions are made with respect to the constitutional roles of each branch of government,” Adams said. “Unfortunately, the courts have created confusion for our communities, candidates and for Utahns across the state.”

The lawsuit’s plaintiffs and Utah Democrats have celebrated the map selected by Gibson as one that most closely follows Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria and reflects Utah’s “political geography” with a district that best represents Utah’s urban core in Salt Lake County. But the map’s critics argue it created four uncompetitive districts that lead to skewed partisan results in a state that’s dominated by a statewide majority of Republican voters.
“By design or by default, Judge Gibson has authorized the most partisan and thus the most gerrymandered map in the history of the state,” Adams said. “I assume she didn’t intend or set out to gerrymander herself. But anyone who looks at the donut hole map sees very clearly it’s gerrymandered. Yes, Judge Gibson gave us a gerrymandered map.” 
“That’s why,” Adams continued, “we’re appealing to the Utah Supreme Court and preparing the appeal right now.” 
As of Tuesday morning, Gibson hadn’t yet issued her final legal analysis and ruling on a request from the Legislature’s attorneys to push pause on the map she selected earlier this month. Adams said attorneys are waiting for that final ruling to be issued before submitting their appeal to the Utah Supreme Court. 
Judge orders tweak to clean up Utah’s congressional map while lawmakers argue for stay

“We urge the district court to issue its final ruling quickly so we can use all the options and tools available to us as we appeal that decision to the Supreme Court,” Adams said. 
Thursday’s press conference was the latest show of force from Utah’s Republican-controlled Legislature as conservative lawmakers continue to protest the court-ordered redistricting process meant to “remedy” the state’s 2021 congressional map, which Gibson in an August ruling determined was the result of an unconstitutional process.
That year, the Utah Legislature adopted a map with four safe Republican congressional districts after it undid a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, which was meant to implement an independent redistricting process. That prompted pro-democracy groups including the League of Women Voters of Utah and Mormon Women for Ethical Government to sue, alleging the map was a “blatant gerrymander” and that lawmakers violated Utahns’ right to alter and reform their form of government through a ballot initiative. 
Gibson initially dismissed that lawsuit, but in a ruling last summer, the Utah Supreme Court sent the case back to her courtroom, determining in a unanimous opinion that she “erred.” That opinion made clear that the Utah Legislature’s power to change “government reform” ballot initiatives has limits.

Researchers first discovered the bones in September 2024 while searching for crocodile fossils in Bowman County, according to State Paleontologist Clint Boyd. Tuesday was the first time the find was publicly announced.
Since work at the site was about to close for the year, they couldn’t start excavating it until this year. 
They’ve since unearthed nine or 10 bones, Boyd said, including vertebrae, part of the tail, a tooth and an ankle. Boyd said to his knowledge this is the third partial T. rex skeleton found in North Dakota.

“Any T. rex specimen that you find that’s got more than five or six bones is a significant discovery because the animal’s so rare,” Boyd said Tuesday morning at a North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting.
The agency on Tuesday also shared updates about two mammoths it’s excavating: one underneath a residential garage in northwest North Dakota and another discovered at a coal mine near Beulah.
Boyd said the specimen under the garage has deep grooves in its vertebrae — an indicator of severe malnutrition or bone disease.
“It was probably very sick toward the end of its life,” he said.

According to Boyd, those deformities are not common in mammoth fossils. To date, researchers have only documented it in mammoths found in Asia and Europe, he said. 
“So it’s going to be not just a nice, beautiful specimen eventually coming into the state fossil collection, but actually a significant specimen that’s going to teach us more about these animals,” he said.
Boyd said the agency has also found the bones of small mammals there.
“We may end up getting a whole ecology story out of this one site,” he said.
The other mammoth fossil was discovered Memorial Day weekend of 2023 when coal miners unearthed a 7-foot tusk.
The tusk just finished a nearly yearlong cleaning and preservation process, Boyd said.
In addition to the tusk, the agency has identified other bones including a hip, one shoulder blade and some ribs.
Based on the tusk’s shape, the animal is likely a Columbian mammoth, not a woolly mammoth, he said.
Boyd indicated the fossils will eventually be on display for the public.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Fairfax County Public Schools is one of just three districts nationwide facing a federal investigation by the U.S. House Committee on Education and Workforce, which alleges Jewish students are being harassed and subjected to open antisemitism.
The scrutiny follows the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 people and resulted in more than 250 hostages, and Israel’s subsequent war campaign in Gaza that has left over 60,000 Palestinians dead. Tensions over the conflict have spilled into U.S. schools.
Republican U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the committee, wrote a letter to the school district saying the panel  is “deeply concerned that FCPS is failing to uphold its obligations under Title VI.”
Youngkin signs executive order to combat antisemitism in Va. schools

Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, school districts that receive federal funds must maintain a safe learning environment and promptly address discrimination, including harassment that creates a hostile environment.
Fairfax County Public Schools said it received a letter from the committee chair requesting information on potential antisemitic incidents since 2022 and intends to cooperate. Separate letters also went to Berkeley Unified School District in California and the School District of Philadelphia in Pennsylvania. 
“FCPS intends to fully cooperate with Congressman Walberg’s inquiry,” the district said in a statement. “FCPS continues to partner with all families to provide a safe, supportive, and inclusive school environment for all students and staff members.”
According to the committee’s letter, investigators claim they have evidence of a hostile environment both before and after the Gaza war began on Oct. 7, 2023, alleging that Jewish students were bullied by peers making the “Heil Hitler” salute and throwing coins at them.
The committee also says  an unnamed school refused to remove a hallway display featuring swastikas and Nazi flags. A school board member is accused of repeatedly posting antisemitic messages online, including statements such as “Israel doesn’t exist.” 
In another instance, the Muslim Students Association chapter at an unidentified high school allegedly hosted a speaker who made “grotesque antisemitic statements,” including, “I have never met a Jew who didn’t have a huge nose.”
As evidence that incidents are worsening, the committee claims one high school approved an anti-Israel walkout, and an MSA chapter reenacted the Oct. 7 kidnappings in a promotional video.
In May, Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order directing Virginia leaders to develop tools to track incidents of antisemitism and anti-religious bigotry at schools. Surveys conducted by the Combat Antisemitism Movement, a commission established by the governor in 2022, recently identified 554 incidents in Virginia — most occurring in K-12 schools.
The committee has asked FCPS to respond by Dec. 8 with specific documents to assess the district’s compliance with Title VI and to determine whether new legislation addressing anti-semitic discrimination is needed.
Requested records include an anonymized chart of antisemitism complaints since Oct. 7, 2023, and corresponding FCPS actions; all FCPS communications since Oct. 7 related to Jews, Judaism, Israel, Palestine or Zionism; and all contracts or agreements since Jan. 1, 2022 that reference those subjects.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-25 18:26:43+00:00,CT Mirror,"Kinneytown Dam, a major impediment to fish, could soon be removed",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/25/kinneytown-dam-ct/,"The sale to Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank is the latest progress in the removal, which officials say would provide 'significant' benefits.","For well over a century, fish making spawning runs up the Naugatuck River have had their journey cut short just 16 miles inland at the Kinneytown Dam in Ansonia.
Above the dam, the river flows relatively unencumbered from Thomaston 30 miles to the north, where it draws from dozens of tributaries that serve as vital habitats for spawning shad, lampreys, eels and Atlantic salmon.
Efforts to ease their path from Long Island Sound — including the installation of a fish ladder alongside the dam in the 1990s — have largely failed, officials say, and Kinneytown Dam remains a major migratory roadblock on the Naugatuck’s watershed.
“Without the removal of this dam, it can never be a river,” said Kevin Zak, a local advocate who has led efforts for years to restore the Naugatuck River, which he says behaves more like a “landlocked lake.” 
“It looks like a river, and you would think that it acts like a river, but it doesn’t,” Zak  said. “You can’t put a price tag on a free-flowing river, the economic and quality of life benefits are just astounding. You don’t have to build it, it’s already there.” 
Earlier this month, the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank announced that it had closed a deal to purchase the dam and surrounding property from a private company in Washington state for $1, a critical step forward in what officials expect will be a $60 million effort to remove the dam and restore the river to its natural course.
The project is the largest active dam removal effort currently underway in Connecticut, which has one of the largest concentrations of dams in the United States.
Many of the dams being removed date back to Connecticut’s industrial past, when rivers powered mills across the state.
“We have more than 4,000 dams in the state, and they’re being removed on a regular basis because they’re no longer functional,” said Alicea Charamut, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. “They’re deteriorating, and it’s important that they are removed before they cause too much damage.”
James Fowler, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said that removing the Kinneytown Dam will “provide significant ecological, recreational, and community benefits, including for nearby environmental justice communities.” The agency has contributed $1.6 million toward the removal effort.
The dam, which was built in 1840s, continued to operate as a hydroelectric facility until 2020 when its generators were turned off by its former owners, Enel North America.
Enel sold the dam later that year to a firm called HydroLand Inc., which stated its intent to repair and modernize the dam in order to continue producing electricity. But that plan never came to fruition, leaving the dam to languish while local officials began exploring ways to purchase the dam to tear it down. (In the meantime, Hydroland transferred ownership of the dam to a related entity based out of Washington state, Trimaran Energy.)
“That went from a long period of time of these guys still trying to squeeze some dollars out of us in this acquisition to acquiring it for dollar,” said Rick Dunne, the president of the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank. 
Timothy Carlsen, who is listed in official documents as a point-of-contact for both HydroLand and Trimaran, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.
The Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank is based in Waterbury and has worked on over a dozen environmental assessment and remediation projects throughout the state. Dunne, its leader, is also executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments.
Concerns with the dam aren’t limited to the obstruction of migratory fish. Advocates and local officials have also worried that the dam’s deteriorating condition could result in a failure that would send millions of gallons of water rushing downstream.
When the region was hit with devastating floods in 2023, the torrent of water flowing over the dam washed away much of an earthen berm carrying Metro-North’s Waterbury branch line, resulting in millions of dollars of damage. 
The berm also separates the river from a canal that flows into an artificial pond containing contaminated sediments leftover from the days when Ansonia was a center of brass manufacturing. Flooding could spread that contamination.
“It was only a matter of a few more inches of rain, or another hour or two of heavy rain, it could have completely breached,” Dunne said. “So we’re really worried about catastrophic release at this point because we found out things about the integrity of this dam since we’ve been in there that are really scary.”
Zak, the advocate who now serves as president of Naugatuck River Revival, said the dam has also suffered from a series of longstanding flaws related to the design of the fish ladder that was built in 1999 at the behest of the the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in order to allow the dam to continue operating as a hydroelectric facility.
Videos filmed by Zak and posted online show fish struggling to make their way up river past the dam, while whole sections of the ladder are filled with debris.
“It was a terrible design,” Zak said. “Fish ladders, if they’re short and straight, are moderately okay. This is neither. This is extremely long… and it has a zigzag entrance, so the fish have to find it and navigate to it. Then they have to go up, down, back. It’s stupid.”
A 2010 fire in one of the dam’s two generation units caused further damage to the passageway, according to a complaint submitted to FERC in 2021 by the NVCOG and Naugatuck River Revival. By 2020, a report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the numbers of some fish species using the ladder — including alewife, shad and brown trout — had fallen by over 90%.
Enel North America, the company that owned the dam at the time the fish ladder was installed, did not respond to a request for comment last week.

Dunne said that more than $50 million has already been committed to the project from state and federal sources. More than half of that, $25 million, is state bonding approved by lawmakers earlier this year that’s awaiting final approval from the State Bond Commission.
The project has also been awarded a $15 million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association as well as $4 million in federal Clean Water Act funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is also spending $1.5 million to test the sediment behind the dam for contaminants.
As part of the effort to remove the dam, Dunne said the land bank also plans to ask officials in Ansonia and Seymour to waive any taxes that went unpaid by the dam’s previous owners.
So far, Dunne said none of the money for the dam removal has been affeccted by President Donald Trump’s budget cutbacks. (Earlier this year, NVCOG had a $5.7 million federal grant to complete portions of the Naugatuck River Greenway Trail rescinded by the Trump administration.)
The land bank must also receive formal approval from FERC, which regulates hydroelectric projects, to remove the dam. A spokesperson for the federal agency said Monday that it has yet to receive a removal application related to the Kinneytown Dam.
Absent any delays in the delivery of federal funding or regulatory approvals, Dunne said he expects crews to begin work next year on relocating a series of sewer mains that will be affected by the project.
From there, Dunne said removal of the dam structure could take place as soon as 2027, with final work on the project wrapping up the following year.
“Demolishing the dam is a relatively simple, straightforward and short process,” Dunne said. “It’s dealing with the sediments, dealing with the flows and dealing with the reconstruction, the rehabilitation and restoration of all the river features… that’s where the work is.”
If successful, the demolition of the Kinneytown Dam would follow similar dam removal projects along Connecticut’s Scantic and Farmington Rivers, as well as a string of other projects along the Naugatuck River.
A decade ago, DEEP completed work on a $6.3 million fish bypass on the Tingue Dam less than 2 miles upstream from Kinneytown.
The bypass, which is surrounded by a park, is wider than a traditional fish ladder and features a more gradual incline to mimic the natural flow of the river. But despite praise for its design, advocates like Zak say it is of little use to fish if they never make it past Kinneytown.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1121_SR_KinneytownDam_017-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 13:58:33.737463

(Photo by Tom Davies/Indiana Capital Chronicle) Minutes after the Indiana House confirmed it will return to the Statehouse next week to redistrict, Senate Republicans reversed course and will show up Dec. 8 to “make a final decision on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”
House Speaker Todd Huston said in a statement released Tuesday that “House Republicans will gavel in on Monday, Dec. 1, reconvening the 2026 regular session. All legislative business will be considered beginning next week, including redrawing the state’s congressional map.
No proposed maps have been released as of midday Tuesday by legislative leaders showing how the General Assembly might accede to Trump’s wish for Republican-led states to draw more GOP-friendly U.S. House districts ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
The move presents an intra-Republican Party challenge to the state Senate, where Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has declared too few senators are in support for redistricting to pass.
But Bray confirmed Tuesday, the chamber will convene: “The issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state. To resolve this issue, the Senate intends to reconvene.”
Trump and Gov. Mike Braun have made political threats against recalcitrant Republican senators — and a House vote in favor of new Indiana maps could ratchet up the pressure on those senators.
Last week, the House and Senate both set Jan. 5 as the date lawmakers would start the new legislative session — not on Dec. 1, as previously planned, to take up the redistricting debate.
But Huston instructed House members to remain prepared for a possible return to the Statehouse during the first two weeks of December. He told reporters the House had enough support to pass redistricting and that it was “prepared” to act.
Redistricting supporters want Indiana lawmakers to craft a map with all nine of the state’s congressional districts favoring Republicans. Those would be based on 2020 census data, like the current maps. 
Those were drawn by Republicans in 2021 and maintained a 7-2 GOP majority — with Democrat Frank Mrvan holding the 1st District in northwestern Indiana and Democrat André Carson holding the 7th District, which covers much of Indianapolis.
Trump started the national redistricting fight by pushing Texas Republicans to redraw its congressional map this summer. The pressure on Indiana Republicans has included trips in August and October by Vice President JD Vance to Indianapolis.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/8CE1D194-DCB3-4DCE-8EDD-94EB926C78AE_1_201_a-1024x655.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 13:58:33.737463

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)A University of Kentucky law professor is challenging a widespread but controversial definition of antisemitism as he seeks reinstatement to his UK teaching duties in a lawsuit that could reach beyond Kentucky.
Ramsi Woodcock was promoted to assistant professor in June, but then removed the next month from teaching and banned from the law school’s building as UK opened an investigation into allegations of antisemitism against him.
Woodcock sued the university in federal court earlier this month seeking to be returned to his duties as a full-time tenured professor.
His suit also seeks to block UK from using the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism in disciplinary proceedings.
Harvard University adopted the definition earlier this year as part of a settlement with the Trump administration, which uses it to enforce anti-discrimination laws.

Kentucky’s public universities and colleges must employ the IHRA definition by January in policies “to combat antisemitism” under a resolution enacted by the legislature and signed by Gov. Andy Beshear earlier this year.
But critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say the definition conflates antisemitism with criticism of Israel, leading to unconstitutional violations of free speech rights. The definition’s author has said it should not be used to “sacrifice free speech.”
Woodcock is asking a federal court in Kentucky’s Eastern District to block UK’s use of the definition in disciplinary proceedings and to declare the state’s mandated use of the definition in university policies a violation of the First Amendment. He’s also asking the court to order U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon “to refrain from requiring or using the IHRA definition of antisemitism in enforcing Title VI.” Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin as a condition of receiving federal funding. 
Lexington attorney Joe Childers is representing Woodcock whose case is supported by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression’s (FIRE) Faculty Legal Defense Fund. Also representing Woodcock are the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and Chicago-based law firm Kapitan Gomaa Law.
UK administrators said they reassigned Woodcock from his teaching duties over the summer after learning of an online petition Woodcock circulated that called for military action against Israel.
In a statement to the Lantern, Woodcock said, “Israel is a colonization project that practices apartheid and is currently committing genocide. The normal response of the international community to colonization, repeated more than 80 times in the 20th century, is to bring the colony to an end. It’s a scandal that the university has been willing to torch our nation’s Constitution to punish me for pointing out that inconvenient fact. Every American scholar has a First Amendment right to oppose Israel. I look forward to continuing to exercise that right and to holding the university to account for violating it.”
Investigation begins
UK President Eli Capilouto in July shared a public message to campus regarding the decision to reassign Woodcock. Capilouto wrote the petition “can be interpreted as antisemitic in accordance with state and federal guidance,” and linked to a definition that cited the IHRA working definition.
UK President Eli Capilouto
Woodcock received notice in a July 22 letter that said the university opened the investigation because of the online petition and after being told he spoke about genocide in Gaza at an academic conference and during another university’s panel discussion. The letter also alleges Woodcock “spammed and are spamming listserves (sic) … with your personal viewpoints concerning the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.” The letter says four professors who said they heard him speak at academic conferences or were on the Listservs reported the statements. 
An amended letter sent in September said four students “some of whom are Jewish” also notified UK that Woodcock in his official capacity was calling “for violence against Israel, the genocide of Israeli people who are predominantly Jewish, and the ultimate destruction of Israel.” One report alleged Woodcock made “anti-Semitic and anti-Israeli remarks during an optional lecture,” while another said he shouted “Free Palestine” while in a car with UK law students. 
Woodcock’s complaint says he does not talk about his conclusions regarding Palestine and Israel “in his classes because he did not want to cause students to face persecution for speaking about Palestine.” The complaint did say that Woodcock began sharing his views in early 2024 “in all of the ways in which a scholar would be expected to share research conclusions about how to stop a genocide,” such as presenting conclusions during a faculty research seminar, sending emails to the faculty Listserv and speaking at conferences. 
UK records requested by the Lantern also show that several of Woodcock’s colleagues within the College of Law, including former acting Dean Paul Salamanca, recommended him for tenure as an assistant professor and wrote letters on his behalf in early 2025. The UK Board of Trustees approved Woodcock for promotion in June. 
Woodcock was hired by UK in 2018. His academic research focuses on law and economics from a wealth-distributive perspective, including how it relates to antitrust law. In addition to his professorship in the law college, he has a secondary appointment to UK’s Gatton College of Business and Economics. 
UK hired an outside attorney to lead the investigation in Woodcock’s conduct. Farnaz Farkish Thompson, a partner of McGuire Woods based in Richmond, Virginia, is listed as a contributor to Project 2025, which was created as a guiding document for the Trump administration leading up to the 2024 presidential election. Among its goals for the U.S. presidency, the document calls for supporting Israel. 
In an August 22 letter to Thompson, one of Woodcock’s attorneys questioned whether she can “be an unbiased neutral’ in conducting the investigation, citing her political partisanship and a profile of her by the Christian Broadcasting Network in which she talks about her decision to go to Regent University Law School, founded by the late evangelist Pat Robertson, who taught that Christians have a divine responsibility to support Israel.
The Trump administration has taken a hard line on alleged antisemitism on college campuses, investigating and penalizing numerous universities, including for incidents stemming from pro-Palestinian protests as Israel, with U.S. support, waged war on Gaza to eradicate Hamas after its deadly surprise attack on Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023.
University response
UK spokesman Jay Blanton said in a statement to the Lantern that Woodcock had been reassigned duties pending an ongoing investigation. 
“First, people in this country have the right to express themselves. That is not in question,” Blanton said. “But the university has the right to express itself as well. We have. What was expressed is repugnant and President Capilouto, on behalf of UK, said so.” 
Blanton then added that, under federal law, “if someone’s views as stated threaten the safety and well-being of the university’s students and staff, we are obligated to act to protect our community and our people.” The ongoing investigation is “entirely appropriate and consistent with institutional norms and past practices.” 
UK’s view of academic freedom “is that our faculty have a right to speak about their research and scholarship within their area of expertise,” Blanton said. 
“That right, however, doesn’t extend to creating a hostile environment for people,” he continued. “That is the question that has been raised. And that is what an investigation, from an expert, outside counsel, will help the university determine.”

(Getty Images)A day after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier said that his office is investigating allegations that the Campbell’s Soup Co. uses bioengineered meat in their soups, the company is strongly denying that claim.
Uthmeier weighed in Monday following the release of comments made in a secret audio recording of a vice president of the company criticizing Campbell’s “bioengineered meat” and “chicken from a 3-D printer.”
“We have s*** for f***** poor people,” part of the recording said, as reported by WDIV Local 4 in Detroit. “Who buys our s***? I don’t buy Campbell’s products barely anymore. It’s not healthy now that I know what the f*******‘s in it. Bioengineered meat — I don’t wanna eat a piece of chicken that came from a 3-D printer.” (Elisions by Florida Phoenix)
Uthmeier seized on the media report.
“Florida bans lab-grown meat,” the attorney general posted on X Monday. “Our Consumer Protection division is launching an investigation and will demand answers from Campbell’s.”
When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Campbell’s directed the Phoenix to a newly created page on the company’s website that says: “The chicken meat used in Campbell’s soups come from long-trusted, USDA approved U.S. suppliers and meets our high-quality standards. Campbell’s does not use 3D-printed chicken, lab-grown chicken, or any form of artificial or bioengineered meat in our soups.”
Florida banned lab-grown meat in 2024
Florida became the first state in the country to ban the selling, manufacturing, or distribution of lab-grown or “cultivated meat” in 2024. Since then, six states have followed suit, according to the National Agricultural Law Center. The bill was sponsored by now-Florida Lt. Gov. Jay Collins in conjunction with the Florida Department of Agriculture.
“There are many concerns right here and, until we have those studies and there’s proof positive that this process is going to work, we want to ban this in the state of Florida because it’s just not there quite yet,” Collins told a Senate committee about the legislation.
The label on Campbell’s soups says that the company uses “bioengineered food ingredients,” but the company says that “[b]ioengineered food ingredients refers to genetically modified crops — canola, corn, soybean, sugar beets, etc. that are grown by the vast majority of American farmers. This language on our labels refers to ingredients derived from those crops, not chicken.”
Cultivated meat is animal meat (including seafood and organ meats) produced by growing animal cells directly. According to the Good Food Institute, cultivated meat is made of the same cell types that can be arranged in the same or similar structure as animal tissues, thus replicating the sensory and nutritional profiles of conventional meat.
While it’s been hailed by its supporters as better for the environment, a 2023 report from the University of California at Davis found that lab-grown or “cultivated” meat’s environmental impact is likely to be “orders of magnitude” higher than retail beef based on existing and near-term production methods.
Lawsuit
Upside Foods, one of two companies in the country authorized to sell cultivated meat, filed a lawsuit against the state after it banned its product, raising claims under the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution.
In April of this year, Federal Judge Mark Walker threw out four parts of that lawsuit, but did not dismiss the suit outright, according to the Associated Press. Upside Foods argued the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit earlier this month.
WDIV-TV in Detroit was the first station to report about the audio recording, which surfaced in a story about a former employee at Campbell’s, Robert Garza, who filed a lawsuit in Michigan. Garza claims he was fired after he complained about Campbell’s VP for Information Technology Martin Bally, who can be heard in a video released by the TV station blasting the quality of Campbell’s Soup and the people who buy it.


Regarding the audio recording, Campbell’s said this in a statement:


“We are proud of the food we make, the people who make it and the high-quality ingredients we use to provide consumers with good food at a good value. We know that millions of people use Campbell’s products, and we’re honored by the trust they put in us. The comments heard on the recording about our food are not only inaccurate — they are patently absurd.”

(Photo courtesy of Jared Golden for Congress)U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is asking for heating assistance that was delayed during the government shutdown to be released as soon as Sunday. 
Golden, a Democrat who represents Maine’s 2nd Congressional District, is among dozens of bipartisan lawmakers asking Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to distribute funds from the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, also known as LIHEAP, now that the government has reopened and temperatures are dropping. 
“Given that the heating season has already started in many parts of the country, we agree that there is no time to waste,” the lawmakers wrote.
The letter was sent to Kennedy on Monday, asking him to disperse the funds by Nov. 30.
States usually receive LIHEAP allocations in early November to help roughly 6 million Americans, including 45,000 Mainers, heat their homes, but this year’s money was delayed because of the government shutdown that proved to be the longest in history. 
In early November, when it was clear states would not receive LIHEAP funding on the usual timeline, the Maine State Housing Authority came up with a temporary solution to use leftover funds from two other programs to avoid heating emergencies. However, they knew it wouldn’t be a long-term fix. 
Golden has pushed back on Kennedy’s management of LIHEAP multiple times this year, particularly taking issue with the secretary’s decision to fire the program’s entire staff this past spring. In response to that decision, Golden helped lead another letter signed by more than 80 colleagues calling for LIHEAP to be protected and its staff to be rehired.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/IMG_1615-scaled-e1730834031719-1024x737.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 13:58:33.737463

Jeff Hurd, then a candidate in Colorado's 3rd Congressional District, speaks to the audience at a Republican event at the Grizzly Rose in Denver in 2024. (Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd introduced a bipartisan bill that would extend for two years enhanced premium tax credits for people who buy health insurance on the individual market. 
The Bipartisan Healthcare Optimization, Protection, and Extension Act, or the HOPE Act, also adds an income cap for the tax credits, so enrollees who make less than $200,000 a year for a family of four would be eligible for the credits. The credits would be phased out for families of four that make between $200,000 and $300,000.
The enhanced premium tax credits implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic were initially set to expire in 2022, but Congress extended and expanded them with the Inflation Reduction Act. In the absence of those enhanced federal subsidies, the average cost to purchase health insurance through Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace, will more than double next year.
Extending the credits was a key point of contention between Democrats, who argued for an extension, and Republicans in Congress while they tried to pass a funding bill to reopen the federal government during the recent shutdown.

“I joined this bipartisan effort because doing nothing would leave too many families in rural communities facing unaffordable increases that they cannot absorb,” Hurd, a Republican, said in a statement. “The HOPE Act provides a temporary, responsible extension of the current premium tax credits so families do not see sudden cost spikes through no fault of their own.”
Hurd, of Grand Junction, represents Colorado’s 3rd Congressional District, which encompasses Colorado’s Western Slope and the southwest corner of the state, sweeping east to include Pueblo, Otero and Las Animas counties. 
Hurd sponsored the HOPE Act alongside U.S. Reps. Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat, Don Bacon, a Nebraska Republican, and Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat. The bill was introduced Friday.
The measure also intends to add guardrails against fraud, including penalties for agents and brokers who provide false information and a requirement for individual marketplaces to confirm enrollee eligibility with the Social Security Administration death records.
“The HOPE Act is a practical, bipartisan solution that maintains affordability, enhances transparency, and improves accountability while Congress works toward long-term reforms that will make our health-care system more stable and more affordable,” Hurd said. 
Senate Majority Leader John Thune promised Democrats that a floor vote on an extension of the tax credits will occur in December, part of a deal struck with seven Democrats and one independent to advance a spending bill to reopen the federal government, despite it not including an extension of enhanced premium tax credits.

(Photos by Anna Kaminski and Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A pair of state senators from Johnson County competing for the Kansas Democratic Party’s nomination for governor are eager to demonstrate political connections to Republican and independent voters who have a dominant presence in rural Kansas.
Sens. Ethan Corson and Cindy Holscher were asked Monday night during an online forum whether they can draw enough support from voters outside the Democratic Party to be competitive in a statewide race for governor. Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly won back-to-back elections, sweeping urban counties and outperforming her predecessors in rural areas of Kansas.
Both of the 2026 Democratic candidates for governor highlighted their ability to influence policy in the Kansas Legislature despite two-thirds Republican majorities in the House and Senate.
Corson, who broke campaign donation records by raising $625,000 since announcing in July, is prone to talking about his time playing collegiate baseball in western Kansas. He says he’s running because he believes it is important to have a governor who will ensure the next generation of Kansans stays in Kansas.
He is promising a campaign different than any other run by a Democrat because of “a deep moral obligation to do right by western Kansas.”
“I think one of the big mistakes our party has made is that we wait until three weeks before the election, and then we go out to western Kansas and ask people for their votes,” Corson said. “I think it’s wrong and it’s disrespectful.”
Holscher is committing to a grassroots campaign that is “with and for the people.” She speaks frequently about her rural upbringing and her family’s work ethic.
Holscher said she is running for governor because “Kansans deserve a better deal and a lower cost of living.” She promises to be “a fighter” who stands up to President Donald Trump and extremism.
“The question isn’t whether the Democratic candidates share values. We do,” Holscher said. “The question is, who has the proven ability to deliver results and win tough races?”
 
Shared values, different approaches
Corson, of Fairway, earned current Gov. Laura Kelly’s endorsement. She called him a “true middle-of-the-road” politician. He said he was born and raised in Kansas, attending public schools up until his graduation from Garden City Community College. He later became an attorney, worked in Washington, D.C. and returned to Kansas, where he served as director of the state party and was elected to the Kansas Senate in 2020.
Holscher, of Overland Park, has spent the past 26 years in Kansas, and she has been involved in politics for nearly a decade, beginning during the administration of GOP Gov. Sam Brownback. She has served two terms each in the House and Senate. She was born in Missouri and said she grew up on a farm and she is a first-generation college graduate.
Democrat Marty Tuley of Lawrence also declared his candidacy for governor, but he was not a participant in the forum with Corson and Holscher. The state party’s chairwoman said 500 people registered for the virtual event.
In 2026, the campaign for Kansas governor includes a dense field of Republican candidates, including former Gov. Jeff Colyer, Senate President Ty Masterson, Secretary of State Scott Schwab, Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt, former Johnson County Commissioner Charlotte O’Hara and former Wichita school board member Joy Eakins.
Johnson County, the Kansas City suburb where Corson and Holscher both reside, is the wealthiest county in Kansas and among the richest counties in the country, according to Census data.
The forum for Democratic candidates explored a range of political issues, including rising consumer prices, public education and legislative efficacy.
Holscher said Kansans “can’t afford an extremist” as the next governor. She called out Masterson multiple times for failing to pass property tax relief during his time as Senate president and for his conservative politics.
“I’m not like Ty Masterson. I’m a workhorse and I get things done,” Holscher said. She also referred to Masterson as “Brownback on steroids.”
Masterson’s campaign could not immediately be reached Tuesday for comment.
Corson criticized Kansas Republicans for passing laws they know will solicit lawsuits. He also said, if governor, he would veto Republicans’ costly special-interest earmark projects.
He said housing is a major barrier to job growth in Kansas. Businesses want to expand, and others want to move to Kansas but don’t because they often think workers won’t be able to find housing, Corson said.
He proposed expanding the state’s property tax freeze for seniors to encompass a wider range of people and strengthening renter protections. He also vowed to sign into law, if elected, a child care tax credit.
Corson advocated for full funding of special education and renewing or strengthening the state’s K-12 public school finance formula. The process to rework the formula, which has been the subject of past lawsuits, is currently underway.
Holscher said she opposes school voucher efforts that benefit private schools and vowed, if elected, to implement a statewide plan to improve teacher retention.
She underscored issues Kansas’ next governor must address, including groundwater scarcity for ranchers, rural hospitals at risk of closure, infrastructure and economic development needs, such as broadband access and stronger public schools.
She also expressed support for legalizing medicinal marijuana and investing in labor apprenticeship programs across the state.
Both Corson and Holscher said they would pledge their full support to whoever wins the Democratic primary.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CorsonHolscher-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-25 12:57:36.707204
,DC,2025-11-25 17:26:36+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump shedding support among Latino voters, survey finds",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-shedding-support-among-latino-voters-survey-finds,,"WASHINGTON — A majority of U.S. Latinos have grown pessimistic since the 2024 presidential election and increasingly disapprove of the immigration and economic policies of the second Trump administration, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center.About 70% of Latinos in the U.S. disapprove of President Donald Trump’s record, with 65% disapproving of his handling on immigration and 61% say his policies have worsened the economy, according to the report.The report found Latinos’ views are still divided by how they voted in the last presidential election, though even Trump voters’ opinion of the president have also declined.“Those who voted for Trump express strong support for the president and his policies, while those who voted for Kamala Harris hold deeply negative views,” according to the report. Latinos were among the groups with the largest shifts toward Trump. In his first campaign in 2016, 28% backed him. In 2020, about 36% of Latinos voted for Trump and that support again grew in 2024, when nearly 48% supported him. Latinos are among the fastest growing demographic groups in the U.S., and are the second largest racial group in the country. The Nov. 24 Pew Research Center report analyzed survey responses from more than 5,500 Hispanic adults conducted from Sept. 22-28 and Oct. 6-16. The study used the terms Latino and Hispanic people interchangeably.Disapproval on immigration

The study found deep disapproval of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, amid aggressive immigration enforcement operations in areas with large Latino immigrant populations.More than half of Latino adults reported that they worry that they, a family member or a close friend could be deported. Almost 59% of Latinos said they have seen or heard of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids or arrests in their community in the past six months. “About seven-in-ten (71%) say (the Trump administration) is doing too much when it comes to deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, up from 56% in March,” according to the study.In his 2024 campaign, Trump promised to conduct mass deportations and end temporary legal statues given to newly arrived migrants under the Biden administration.Economic outlook worryingTwo-thirds of Latinos said their overall situation has worsened since last year.“This is the first time that most Hispanics say their situation has worsened in nearly two decades of Pew Research Center Hispanic surveys,” according to the report. Inflation and the economy were major policy concerns for Latinos, like most voters, in the 2024 presidential election.The Pew Research Center study found that in the last year, one-in-three Latinos struggled to pay for groceries, medical care and rent or a mortgage.“Many Latinos also have a negative outlook on the economy’s future,” according to the study. “About half (49%) say the nation’s economy will worsen over the next year, up substantially from 2024. Another 23% say economic conditions will be about the same as now.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-11-25 12:57:36.707204

This story was originally reported by Sara Luterman of The 19th.  Meet Sara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
As The 19th makes plans for 2026, we want to hear from you. Complete our annual survey to let us know your thoughts.
Three years after the release of the first comprehensive roadmap to address difficulties faced by family caregivers of older adults and people with disabilities, the Trump administration has quietly erased transgender caregivers and caregivers of color from a list of underserved or hard-to-reach populations, The 19th has exclusively learned. 
Dozens of changes were quietly made this year to the National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers, which was first released in 2022 after years of work by government officials and community stakeholders. An objective to “prioritize efforts to advance equity for unserved and underserved populations of caregivers” was removed entirely, as was a section noting that the challenges of family caregiving are not equally distributed.
These changes distort reality, according to Jason Resendez, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Family Caregiving. The alliance represents the interests of family caregivers, or about 59 million Americans. A recent report from the alliance and the AARP showed that not all family caregivers face the same amount or intensity of challenge. 
“[Our research] shows that family caregivers span the full spectrum… Yet people of color, women and LGBTQ Americans experience greater negative impacts from caregiving, from financial hardships to worse health outcomes,” Resendez told The 19th in a statement. He also condemned the changes to the report. “Weakening the equity provisions in the National Strategy to Support Family Caregiving ignores this stark reality,” he said. 
The changes were made “earlier this year,” according to the Department of Health and Human Services, which did not answer questions about the specific timing of the changes, who made them or why they were made.
But the why is clear: On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order stating that the government recognizes only two sexes, male and female. That order signaled his administration’s opposition to gender diversity and tasked federal agencies with excluding transgender people from laws that protect against sex discrimination. The order also equates being transgender to an ideology, or belief system, instead of an identity that is protected by state and federal law. That executive order is cited on the first page of the edited version of the report, along with a reference to a second executive order against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
The Recognize, Assist, Include, Support and Engage Family Caregivers Act, or RAISE Family Caregivers Act, was first signed into law by President Trump in 2018. In 2022, the initial report was delivered to Congress. The report consisted of “over 300 specific commitments from federal agencies about what they could do within their existing authorities and programs to better support family caregivers. It also included recommendations for Congress about key legislation that would make a difference for family caregivers,” said Alison Barkoff, the former head of the Administration for Community Living. 
The recommendations were developed by the advisory councils created by the law and extensive input from the public, including family caregivers and the people they support. 
“One thing that was really important to us was that all caregivers be able to see themselves in the report,” Barkoff said. “By taking out caregivers from certain communities, from taking out the acknowledgement of the unique barriers that people face in different communities face — I think it’s going to create challenges in really meaningfully engaging some types of caregivers that actually face the most barriers and are maybe the least likely to see themselves as caregivers and to seek support.”
This is far from the first time that a federal agency has removed trans people from government-funded health research or a government website. This year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention deleted terms like “transgender” and “pregnant person” from agency websites, and the State Department purged references to queer and transgender people from its online resource for LGBTQ+ travelers. The Social Security Administration scrubbed all mentions of trans and intersex people from its resource page about Social Security benefits for LGBTQ+ people. Some webpages were quickly restored, following public outcry and a federal judge’s order. 
Early this year, employees at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were warned to reject grants that mention “women,” “trans” or “diversity.” Another federal judge intervened, ordering the agency that oversees public health research to restore grants that had been cut based on references to gender or racial diversity. However, the Supreme Court ultimately allowed the agency to terminate over $780 million in grants linked to diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. 
Making changes to a report delivered to Congress three years ago is still fairly unusual, however, and no one who The 19th spoke with could recall a similar situation in recent history. 
Jace Flatt, an associate professor of health and behavioral sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was among many researchers whose grants were cancelled earlier this year. Their research focuses on the needs of LGBTQ older adults and LGBTQ caregivers. They were not surprised by the changes. 
“Taking people out doesn’t take away the need,” they told The 19th, adding: “It doesn’t just make this disappear that there are unique concerns and needs for groups of caregivers.” 
Flatt said they are concerned about how erasing certain populations and the idea of inequality from government documents and research will impact policy and funding. 
“If a certain group isn’t listed as a priority, they don’t just go away,” Flatt said. “It just means we will not have data or information on them, which will create knowledge gaps and limit how we move forward and provide care to all caregivers.”

As part of the Broadband, Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, Arkansas has been allocated $1.024 billion in funding to deliver broadband access to more than 79,000 homes and businesses across the state, according to the release. The Arkansas State Broadband Office (ARConnect) is responsible for administering the BEAD program and funding process at the state level.
“Arkansas is proud to continue serving as one of the states leading this program nationally and be in the first wave of approvals for provisional grant selections,” State Broadband Director Glen Howie said. “This approval gets us one step closer to putting shovels in the ground to connect Arkansans who remain unconnected.”
Arkansas officials outline next steps in federal broadband grant program

Eighteen states and U.S. territories received approval this week for their final proposals, which are expected to save taxpayers approximately $6 billion, according to the release. 
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) will now review Arkansas’ BEAD program budget. Pending NIST review and subsequent appropriation approval by the Arkansas General Assembly, ARConnect anticipates construction on these projects to begin during the second quarter of 2026, according to the release. 
“After stripping away burdensome rules and regulations and wasteful requirements, taxpayers will save billions in unnecessary costs while connecting those in need to high-speed broadband through the full spectrum of broadband technologies,” U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said.
The BEAD program, a $42.45 billion initiative created under the Biden administration’s Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021, aims to close the digital divide by expanding broadband access, particularly in rural communities. 
However, the Trump administration made changes to the program that disqualified hundreds of thousands of locations from receiving internet access, according to Stateline. The program’s new technology-neutral approach will also shift a large portion of the funding toward satellite internet companies, which cost less to build, but have more uneven service than underground fiber optic cable. 
Participation in the BEAD program is one of the latest efforts to expand broadband access in Arkansas, especially in rural areas. In 2019, former Gov. Asa Hutchinson created the state’s broadband office, which is “tasked with eliminating the digital divide within the state by 2028,” according to its website. 


Let us know what you think...


 

Although millions of dollars have been poured into the goal, some lawmakers like Rep. Frances Cavenaugh, R-Walnut Ridge, are not pleased with the results. During the Arkansas Legislative Council’s Review subcommittee meeting last Tuesday, Cavenaugh, the committee’s co-chair, questioned a request to amend an existing contract with the Boston Consulting Group to execute the BEAD Program and support ARConnect. Extending the contract term from 2026 to 2029 would add $29.7 million to the contract, which would be completely covered by federal funds, according to documents provided to the committee.
Cavenaugh expressed frustration that she has repeatedly asked, but not received a straight answer about how much of Arkansas is covered by broadband because the state has “been throwing money at this now forever.” The Northeast Arkansas Republican said parts of her district are still not covered by broadband.
To date, the state has spent more than $500 million on broadband, not counting the BEAD program, Howie said. More than 79,000 locations are expected to be covered under the BEAD program. The question of how much of the state is covered by broadband is nuanced, Howie said, because more than 200,000 locations have been awarded a grant that’s not administered by his team and therefore they don’t have insight into the exact progress of those projects. 
Additionally, Cavenaugh said she’s heard reports of issues with providers that have led to broadband projects stalling. She asked Howie for more clarity about how the state is dealing with providers who aren’t fulfilling their contracts and what it will cost to fix this problem. 
“There’s a lot of issues going on in the broadband, and we’re not getting the full picture of what’s happening with that,” Cavenaugh said. “So I guess I’m asking for transparency because there is none, and we’re spending $30 million with someone to help us with that. It’s mindboggling.”
The subcommittee approved Cavenaugh’s motion to hold the broadband contract so she could receive additional information about her questions. Her co-chair, Corning Republican Sen. Blake Johnson, announced the hold was released during Friday’s Arkansas Legislative Council meeting, and lawmakers approved the contract.

It became the island’s greatest national symbol on August 6,1962, when Jamaicans at home and abroad celebrated independence from Great Britain. 
Being one of the few flags in the world that does not have red, white or blue in it, the flag of Jamaica always stands tall as it tells the story of the Jamaican people – my people.
Jamaica has been through many adversities in the past, whether it be socially, economically, politically or any other sector that affects societal affairs.

In recent weeks, our country has been through Hurricane Melissa. This was a category five hurricane that devastated much of our island especially in western parishes. Many schools, churches, businesses and homes were affected or destroyed, yet the Jamaican spirit remains strong as our people seek to rebuild again with hope. 
All over the world, people have been chipping in as well to help with Jamaica’s rebuilding process,  The non-profit organization that I’m a part of here in Connecticut, BlessBackJamdown Missions, Inc, and various churches and other social clubs have all banded together to assist with the recovery and rebuilding efforts of our nation. 
It serves as a reminder that Jamaica, my homeland, is well loved. As we have poured out our talents and gifts to the world over the years, we are certainly feeling and seeing the love reciprocated. The unity we see in the world in response to Jamaica’s need for help at this time, serves as a reminder of what our national flag symbolizes.  
The color black in our flag symbolizes the strength and creativity of our people, green represents the hope that the Jamaican people have as well as the  rich agricultural resources of our land. Gold — gold represents the natural beauty of the Caribbean sun and the wealth of our nation. In my eyes, the colors of our flag do not only carry deep symbolic meaning to Jamaican nationals, but it is certainly an inspiration to anyone who strives to become all that God created them to be, even if everything may not be perfect in their lives. They can overcome whatever the challenge is if they only put their minds to it with God’s help. 
Our Jamaican flag will always be a source of hope as it serves as a reminder that we can bounce back and rebuild even amid the destruction caused by Hurricane Melissa. Together,  we’ll build back stronger. Out of many, we are one!

(Getty Images) While Michigan lawmakers were able to avert a government shutdown and eventually reach a state budget agreement in October, the final agreement left out critical early childhood funding that has upended a nearly two-decade-long commitment to supporting Great Start Collaboratives and Family Coalitions (GSC/FCs) across the state.
The unexpected elimination of their funding has thrown the 54 collaboratives and family coalitions in Michigan into limbo. Many have already abruptly ended and others are relying on organizational and philanthropic support to remain temporarily operational. Only a few will be able to continue in a scaled-back capacity through the end of the school year in June.
Since the early 2000s, the collaboratives and family coalitions have connected families with vital early childhood and family supports, convened partners to improve outcomes and reduce duplication, and implemented programming that supports healthy development for our youngest children. While each collaborative and family coalition operates slightly differently depending on community needs, they all work toward ensuring that all children are born healthy, thriving, and developmentally on track from birth to third grade, are developmentally ready for school entry, and are prepared to succeed in fourth grade and beyond by being proficient readers by the end of third grade.

Using these outcomes as their guideposts, the collaboratives and family coalitions bring together parents and professionals to address these issues however they manifest in their communities. In this model, parents also have a voice in shaping the programs and services that help them give their children a great start. Parent leaders help with strategic planning, program implementation and serve as hosts for Parent Cafe support groups. They also serve as trusted messengers for school enrollment and early childhood initiatives such as Talking is Teaching and Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library.
Many of Michigan’s collaboratives and family coalitions also offer home visiting programs, free parent and child kindergarten readiness programs, playgroups, parent education and support groups, community-based events and outreach, support for child care providers, professional development for service providers and educators, connections to other early childhood resources, help for at-risk moms and pregnant teens, advocacy, and much more. The collaboratives and family coalitions are a lifeline to getting help and give parents and caregivers in Michigan a voice.
A parent who participated in the collaboratives serving Clare and Gladwin counties gets to the heart of why they are essential for communities: “The Great Start Collaborative doesn’t just offer programs; it nurtures dreams, bridges gaps and holds our community together. Losing this support would dim the light in our children’s eyes and silence the laughter that echoes through our parks and homes. Their work is the heartbeat of our early childhood system — irreplaceable, essential and a call to action for decision-makers to preserve this vital legacy.”
Nearly 700 other providers and parents have expressed similar sentiments about the importance of the collaboratives and family coalitions in a statewide survey that was sent out following the news that funding had been eliminated.
In addition to the devastating blow to families across Michigan who have relied on the collaboratives and family coalitions to ensure their children are thriving no matter what barriers they face, the elimination of their funding has also meant that many full-time and part-time Great Start workers in our state have either already lost their jobs or are facing uncertainty about whether their job will exist in the months ahead. 
Many have already moved on to new jobs, leaving behind a void that will not easily be filled, given that these are talented early childhood development professionals with a wealth of experience in the work that they do and years, if not decades, of connections and relationships built in the communities in which they have served.
In response to this setback to early childhood coordination, advocates are actively seeking a new way to frame the work of the collaboratives and family coalitions and restore funding for their critical systems work and programming. 
Financial support for early childhood services has the greatest return on investment in terms of educational and health outcomes for kids. The elimination of this funding is not only disheartening for families now, but it will come with long-term costs for Michigan. Michigan children, families and the staff members who have dedicated years of their lives to these organizations deserve better.

The mother was just arriving to pick up her girls at their elementary school in Chicago when someone with a bullhorn at the nearby shopping center let everyone know: ICE is here.
The white van screeched to a halt right next to where she was parked, and three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents piled out. They said something in English that she couldn’t decipher, then arrested her on the spot. Her family later said they never asked about her documentation.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

She was only able to get one phone call out before she was taken away.
“The girls,” was all she said to her sister. Her daughters, a third grader and a fourth grader, were still waiting for her inside the school.
Luckily, the girls’ child care provider had prepared for this very moment.
Sandra had been taking care of the girls since they were babies, and now watched them after school. She’d been encouraging the family to get American passports for the kids and signed documents detailing their wishes should the mother be detained.
When Sandra got the call that day in September, she headed straight to the school to pick up the girls.
Since President Donald Trump won a second term, Sandra has been prepping the 10 families at her home-based day care, including some who lack permanent legal status, for the possibility that they may be detained. (The 19th is only using Sandra’s first name and not naming the mother to protect their identities.)
She’s worked with families to get temporary guardianship papers sorted and put a plan in place in case they were detained and their kids were left behind. She even had a psychologist come and speak to the families about the events that had been unfolding across the country to help the children understand that there are certain situations their parents can’t control, and give them the opportunity to talk through their fears that, one day, mamá and papá might not be there to pick them up.
And for two elementary school kids, that day did come. Sandra met them outside the school.
“When they saw me, they knew something wasn’t right,” Sandra said in Spanish. “Are we never going to see our mom again?” they asked.

For all her planning, she was speechless.
“One prepares for these things, but still doesn’t have the words on what to say,” Sandra said.
After that day, Sandra worked with the mother’s sister to get the girls situated to fly to Texas, where their mother, who had full custody of them, was being detained, and then eventually to Mexico. She hasn’t heard from them in over a month. The girls were born in the United States and know nothing of Mexico.
“I think about them in a strange country,” Sandra said. “‘Who is going to care for them like I do?’ Now with this situation I get sad because I think they are the ones who are going to suffer.”
In this year of immigration raids, child care providers have stepped up to keep families unified amid incredible uncertainty. Some are agreeing to be temporary guardians for kids should something happen to their parents. The workers themselves are also under threat — 1 in 5 child care workers are immigrant women, most of them Latinas, who are also having to prepare in case they are detained, particularly while children are in their care. Already, child care workers across the country have been detained and deported.
“The immigration and the child care movements, they are one in the same now,” said Anali Alegria, the director of federal advocacy and media relations at the Child Care for Every Family Network, a national child care advocacy group. “Child care is not just something that keeps the economy going, while it does. It’s also really integral to people’s community and family lives. And so when you’re destabilizing it, you’re also destabilizing something much more fundamental and very tender to that child and that family’s life.”
A loose network of resistance has emerged, with detailed protection plans, ICE lookout patrols, and Signal or Whatsapp chats. Home-based providers like Sandra have been especially involved in that effort because their work often means their lives are even more intertwined with the families they care for.
“All the families we have in our program, I consider them family. We arrive in this country and we don’t have family, and when we get support, advice or the simple act of caring for kids, as child care providers we are essential in many of these families — even more in these times,” said Sandra, who has been caring for children in the United States for 25 years. All the families she cares for are Latinx, 70 percent without permanent legal status.

According to advocacy groups, child care providers are increasingly being asked to look after kids in case they are detained, typically because they are the only trusted person the family knows with U.S. citizenship or legal permanent residence. Parents are asking child care workers to be emergency contacts, short-term guardians and, in some cases, even long-term guardians.
“We heard this under the first Trump administration, and we’re hearing it much more now. It’s not so much a matter of if, but when, right now, and it used to be the other way around,” said Wendy Cervantes, the director of immigration and immigrant families at the Center for Law and Social Policy, an anti-poverty nonprofit. “It adds just additional stress and trauma because they deeply care about these kids. Many of them have kids of their own and obviously have modest incomes, so as much as they want to say, ‘yes’, they can’t in some cases.”
The question was posed to Claudia Pellecer a couple weeks ago. A home-based child care provider in Chicago for 17 years, Pellecer cares for numerous Latinx families, at least one of whom doesn’t have permanent legal status.
In October, one of those moms was due to appear before ICE for a regular check-in as part of her ongoing asylum case. But she knew that many have been detained at those appointments this year.
The mother asked Pellecer to be her 1-year-old son’s legal guardian should she be taken away.
“I couldn’t say no because I am human, I am a mother,” Pellecer said.
They got to work getting the baby a passport and filling out the necessary guardianship paperwork. Pellecer kept the originals and copies. The mother closed her bank account, cleaned out her apartment and prepped two bags, one for her and one for the baby. If the mother was deported, Pellecer would fly with him to meet her in Ecuador, they agreed.
The day of the appointment, she dropped the baby off with Pellecer and set the final plan. Her appointment was at 1 p.m. “If at 6 p.m. you haven’t heard from me, that means I was detained,” she told Pellecer, who cried and wished her luck.
At the appointment, the judge asked her three sets of questions:
“Why are you here?”
“Are you working? Do you have a family?”
“Do you have proof of what happened to you in your country?”
The judge agreed to let her stay and told her to continue working. The mother won’t have a court date again until 2027.
“We learned our lesson,” Pellecer said. “We had to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.”
But their relief was short-lived. Recent events in Chicago have sent child care workers and families into panic, as the people who have tried to keep families together are now being targeted.

Resistance networks have sprung up rapidly in Chicago in recent weeks after a child care worker was followed to Spanish immersion day care Rayito de Sol on the city’s North Side and arrested in front of children and other teachers. The arrest was caught on camera and has sparked demonstrations across the city.
Erin Horetski, whose son, Harrison, was cared for by the worker who was arrested at Rayito de Sol in early November, said parents there had been worried ICE might one day target them because the center specifically hired Spanish-speaking staff.
The morning of the arrest, parents were texting each other once they heard ICE was in the shopping center where the day care is located.
Her husband was just arriving to drop off their boys as ICE was leaving. The first thing out of his mouth when he called her: “They took Miss Diana.”
Agents entered the school without a warrant to arrest infant class teacher Diana Patricia Santillana Galeano, an immigrant from Colombia. DHS said part of the reason for her arrest was because she helped bring her two teenage children across the southern U.S. border this year. “Facilitating human smuggling is a crime,” DHS said. Santillana Galeano fled Colombia fearing for her safety in 2023, filed for asylum and was given a work permit through November 2029, according to court documents. She has no known criminal record. After her arrest, a federal judge ruled that her detention without access to a bond hearing was illegal and she was released November 12.
Horetski said the incident, the first known ICE arrest inside a day care, has spurred the community to action. A GoFundMe account set up by Horetski to support Santillana Galeano, has raised more than $150,000.
Horetski said what’s been lost in the story of what happened at Rayito is the humanity of the person at the center of it, someone she said was “like a second mother” to her son.
“At the end of the day, she was a person and a friend and a mother and provider to our kids — I think we need to remember that,” Horetski said.
Now, the parents are the ones coming together to put in place a safety plan for the teachers, most of whom have continued to come to the school and care for their children.
They are working on establishing a safe passage patrol, setting up parents with whistles at the front of the school to stand guard during arrival and dismissal time to ensure teachers can come and go to their cars or to public transit safely. Parents are also establishing escorts for teachers who may need a ride to work or someone to accompany them on the bus or the train. A meal train set up by the parents is helping to send food to the teachers through Thanksgiving, and two local restaurants have pitched in with discounts. Some of the parents are also lawyers who are considering setting up a legal clinic to ensure workers know their rights, Horetski said.

Figuring out how to come together to support teachers and the children who now have questions about safety is something that “continues to circle in all of our minds and brains,” Horeski said. “It’s hard to not have the answers or know how to best move forward. We’re in such uncharted territory that you’re like, ‘Where do you go from here?’ So we’re kind of paving that because this is the first time that something like this has happened.”
Prep is top of mind now for organizers including at the Service Employees International Union, where Sandra and Pellecer are members, who are convening emergency child care worker trainings to set up procedures, such as posted signs that say ICE cannot enter without a warrant, showing them what the warrants must include to be binding, helping them set a designated person to speak to ICE should they enter and talking to their families to offer support.
Cervantes has been doing this work since Trump’s first term, when it was clear immigration was going to be a key focus for the president. This year has been different, though. Child care centers were previously protected under a “sensitive locations” directive that advised ICE to not conduct enforcement in places like schools and day cares. But Trump removed that protection on his first day in office this year, signaling a more aggressive approach to ICE enforcement was coming.
Cervantes and her team are currently in the midst of a research project about child care workers across the country, conversations that are also illuminating for them just how dire the situation has become for providers.
“We are asking providers to make protocols for what is basically a man-made disaster,” she said. “They shouldn’t have to worry about protecting children and staff from the government.”

State rolls out multi-step handgun permit process as Sportsmen’s leader Jeff Hague questions costs, agency power, and how the rules were implemented
WILMINGTON, Del. — Delaware handgun buyers now must clear a new, multi-step state process before they can purchase a firearm, under a permit-to-purchase law that took effect Nov. 16.
The law, passed by the General Assembly in 2023, requires most residents to obtain a state-issued permit before buying a handgun. During a recent “A Better Discussion” webcast, longtime Delaware regulator and Second Amendment advocate Jeff Hague walked viewers through how the system is designed to work and what applicants should expect.
Hague is president of the Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association and previously served 18 years as the state’s first Registrar of Regulations.
Step 1: Mandatory handgun training
Under the law, most first-time handgun buyers must complete an approved safety and proficiency course before they can apply for a permit.
Hague told viewers the classes are typically one to two days long and are offered by private instructors who must be certified by the state.
“You have to have a class, a training class that can take up to two days,” he said, noting that course fees he has seen generally range from about $150 to $300, depending on the instructor and location.
State police have issued written guidance for instructors on how to qualify to teach permit-eligible courses and what topics must be covered. Those guidelines spell out the steps instructors must take to be listed as certified and to have their classes accepted for permit purposes.
Step 2: Fingerprinting and background checks
After completing the required training, applicants must be fingerprinted and undergo a background check conducted by the State Bureau of Identification (SBI), part of the Delaware State Police.
“Fingerprinting is $85,” Hague said on the webcast.
The fingerprints are used to run state and federal criminal history checks. Hague emphasized that while the law does not impose a fee for the application itself, the training and fingerprinting costs together represent the primary out-of-pocket expense for would-be handgun buyers.
Step 3: Applying for the permit
Once training and fingerprinting are complete, applicants may submit a permit application through SBI. That application and the background information are then forwarded to the Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security for review.
Hague said the law gives the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to deny a permit if there is probable cause that an applicant poses a danger to themselves or others. The statute also contains certain exemptions, he noted, such as for some current and former law enforcement officers and other limited categories, though most civilian buyers must follow the full process.
The permit, once issued, is then presented to a federally licensed firearms dealer as part of the purchase, in addition to the standard federal background check form already required under federal law.
“You still have to go through the standard background check with the dealer,” Hague said. “This is an additional state step on the front end before you can even get to that point.”
Delaware Attorney General praises the law as “Common Sense Measure,” claiming the State is ready.
Since Nov. 16, AG Kathy Jennings has publicly defended the handgun permit law, stressing its enforceability, its role in promoting safe gun ownership, and its evidence-based effectiveness in reducing gun violence.  On November 17, 2025, Jennings told Delaware Public Media that she looks forward to seeing the law’s effects statewide. She emphasized that the law is a “common sense measure” requiring buyers to know how to use, store, and understand the laws around handguns before purchase. Jennings noted that permits have already been successfully issued since the law took effect, showing that the system is enforceable and functional.
The System is still evolving, and the State may not be ready!
Because the law’s effective date was set for mid-November, Hague said much of the infrastructure has been built quickly in recent weeks.
“Our sources tell us that the state didn’t do a thing until about five weeks, six weeks before implementation, when they figured out that, ‘uh-oh, we gotta do something,’” he said.
He told viewers the process, forms and online information have been updated repeatedly since the November launch as state agencies refine procedures and adjust instructor and applicant guidance.
Guidelines and regulations
A key piece of Hague’s explanation focused on the difference between informal guidance and formal regulations.
Before the law took effect, the Delaware State Police published detailed guidelines for instructors who want to teach qualifying permit classes. Those guidelines describe application procedures, record-keeping expectations and course content standards instructors must meet to be approved.
Drawing on his 18 years overseeing the Administrative Procedures Act, Hague said that when state rules impose mandatory requirements and consequences, they typically must go through the formal regulatory process: public notice, publication in the Register of Regulations and a public comment period.
“Anything regulatory has got to go through the Administrative Procedures Act,” he said.
He said the question of whether some of the instructor “guidelines” should instead have been adopted as formal regulations was one of the issues raised in court as the law approached its launch date.
Legal challenge continues
Hague also updated viewers on the ongoing court case challenging the law.
He said the Delaware State Sportsmen’s Association and other plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in federal court within hours of Gov. John Carney signing the bill last year. Earlier this month, a federal judge denied their request for an emergency injunction that would have temporarily blocked the law before the Nov. 16 start date.
“We immediately appealed by midnight to the Third Circuit,” Hague said.
According to Hague, the plaintiffs have filed an initial brief, the state has filed its response, and the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has requested additional written arguments on specific issues. A three-judge panel will decide how to handle the emergency appeal while the broader constitutional challenge to the law continues.
“We’re still challenging the constitutionality on the federal level and the state level,” he said. “That case will continue, even if the statute stays in effect.”
Hague questions burden and legality
While much of Hague’s presentation focused on explaining the new process, he also made clear he believes the system is overly burdensome and on shaky legal ground.
He noted that between training fees and fingerprinting costs, “you’re talking hundreds of dollars” before a law-abiding citizen can attempt to buy a handgun, and said the law effectively gives an appointed official broad power over a constitutional right.
“An unelected bureaucrat appointed by the governor makes the final determination as to whether or not you get to exercise your right to keep and bear arms,” Hague said, referring to the Secretary of Homeland Security’s role.
Hague argued that key elements of how the law is being implemented — including fast-changing instructions and the use of instructor guidelines he views as de facto regulations — should have been fully spelled out and vetted before the statute took effect.
“It should be transparent — the processes you have to go through to get the permit,” he said. “There’s regulations all through this that needed to be done prior to the implementation of this statute, and they just… they never did it.”
In his view, the dispute over the permit-to-purchase law is as much about regulatory power as it is about firearms policy.
“This is an example of an agency playing games with regulations,” Hague said. “They’ve been changing the requirements daily since the 16th,” even as the law remains in force while the courts decide its fate.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/545b5e72-0779-40c0-bf5e-c5bc79da71ab-1.png,,,2025-11-25 11:58:01.223546

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse on Tuesday admonished the former leader of a Kansas foster care charity for dragging his feet on plans to enter a guilty plea.
Crouse ordered Robert Smith to stand trial for bilking millions of dollars from Saint Francis Ministries, which Smith led from 2014 to 2020.
Smith, who faces federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, 15 counts of wire fraud, and one count of money laundering, told the court in May that he planned to enter a guilty plea. Smith subsequently asked the court three times to delay his change of plea hearing.
Crouse rejected the most recent request for a delay and ordered Smith to travel from his home in Tennessee to attend Tuesday’s hearing in person.
But when Smith showed up at the federal courthouse in Topeka, his attorney, Sarah Hess, told the court he still wasn’t ready to change his plea. Hess and the prosecutor have yet to settle on a proposed plea deal that could include dropping some charges.
“I’ve given you all the time I’m going to give you,” Crouse said. “So if you’re not ready to enter a plea, I’m going to set it for trial.”
Hess told the judge, “We do intend to plead guilty,” possibly as early as January. Crouse responded by scheduling a 10-day trial for May 5.
“Is there anything else the government can do for you today?” Crouse asked.
“No, your honor,” Hess replied.
Smith, an Episcopal priest, was known to friends and colleagues as Father Bobby. As president and CEO of Saint Francis Ministries, he allegedly used the company credit card to live a lavish lifestyle. He and his co-defendant, former Saint Francis IT director William Whymark, also schemed to steal at least $4.7 million from the organization, according to court documents.
Whymark, who was indicted on 14 crimes, pleaded guilty on Nov. 18 to two charges of wire fraud totaling more than $2 million. As part of the agreement, he admitted to submitting fraudulent invoices for inflated costs of IT services, and that Smith knowingly approved the inflated invoices.
Whymark also told the court he has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. He faces up to 10 years in federal prison for each of the two charges.
Smith asked the court last week to delay his hearing by 45 days, and noted that it would be inconvenient for him to make the road trip two days before Thanksgiving.
“Mr. Smith has zero savings,” his attorney wrote in a court filing. “He is not able to afford airfare, and the costs of last-minute gas, tolls, food, and uncertain lodging for the required road trip would completely deplete his available funds.”
Crouse told Smith, “The delays must end,” and ordered him to appear in court.
“The hardships, if any, are the product of Mr. Smith’s choices, as the November hearing has been set for nearly two months,” Crouse wrote in a Friday response. “And any alleged complications seem to be capable of resolution, as his co-defendant has already entered his plea and is awaiting sentencing. The Speedy Trial Act certainly protects an accused’s right to proceed expeditiously, but it also provides the public with an expectation that matters will not languish because an accused seeks to delay justice.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Topeka-federal-court-house-4--1024x576.jpg,,,2025-11-25 11:58:01.223546

(File photo by Spenser Heaps/ Utah News Dispatch)South Carolina farmers impacted by Hurricane Helene, as well as tornados, floods and droughts that hit the state in the last two years, can apply for a second round of federal aid.
The application period opened Monday for 2023 and 2024 natural disaster-related crop losses for which farmers did not have crop insurance.
The aid can also help insured farmers recuperate any minor losses that were not enough to trigger an insurance payout, as well as damage to crops that reduced the sale value of those crops.
The U.S. Farm Service Agency has a total of $16 billion it can award nationwide for what’s known as the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program.
From the first funding round, about 2,120 South Carolina farmers received a total of $42.6 million in aid, mostly for losses to corn, peaches, soybean and cotton crops.
About $10.3 billion still remains available in the national program, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Farmers have through April 30, 2026, to apply for these dollars.
When it comes to drought relief, eligible counties in 2023 include Anderson, Cherokee, Chester, Fairfield, Greenville, Laurens, Newberry, Oconee, Pickens, Spartanburg, Union and York. In 2024, those counties are Clarendon, Darlington, Dillon, Florence, Horry, Lee, Marion, Sumter and Williamsburg.
Applications also opened Monday for dairy farmers who had milk spoil or farmers whose crops were ruined while stored in grain bins on the farm.
The Milk Loss Program provides up to $1.65 million in payments to eligible dairies. The on-farm stored crop program provides for up to $5 million.
Farmers have until Jan. 23, 2026, to apply for these two disaster programs.
All of this aid applies nationwide and is separate from a South Carolina-specific grant, which the federal agriculture agency awarded to the state in September.
That $38 million grant applied to farmers and timber companies across 33 of South Carolina’s 46 counties.
That grant covers damage to trees and crops that can take multiple years to mature, such as pecan trees. It also covered farm buildings, irrigation equipment, on-farm roads and fish hatchery equipment, as well as losses for farmers who couldn’t get their crops to market because of storm damage, according to the state Department of Agriculture.

Ron DeSantis with Ohio state Rep. Heidi Workman. (Photo by Nick Evans/Ohio Capital Journal)Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed new penalties against certain dog breeders and animal abusers on Tuesday, hoping to pass more anti-animal cruelty legislation before his term is through.
He spoke at Big Dog Ranch Rescue in Loxahatchee early Tuesday, the same site where he signed two other anti-animal cruelty measures into law earlier this year. For the 2026 session, DeSantis wants the Legislature to impose a statewide dog breeder license, target unethical dog breeding, and tighten penalties for Floridians who abuse animals in front of children.
According to its website, Big Dog Ranch Rescue is the largest cage-free, no-kill animal rescue organization in the nation.
“There are some bad actors who keep these animals in inhumane conditions and we want to put an end to that type of practice in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said, joined by Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson and a host of Republican lawmakers eager to sponsor the proposed legislation.
“It’s been a long-time coming,” he added.
According to the governor, the measure would require the Department of Business and Professional Regulation to issue statewide dog breeder licenses to better “hold them accountable” for abusive conditions. This could include overbreeding female dogs, overcrowding breeding areas, a lack of veterinary care, or exposure to harsh environments.
The proposal asks pet stores to offer local shelters spaces to put dogs up for adoption before the space is used to sell dogs from “puppy mills,” which are large, for-profit centers designed for quick breeding under poor conditions. In 2023, the Humane Society of the U.S. ranked Miami-Dade County as the highest area in the country for pet stores peddling puppy-mill dogs.
Other suggestions include establishing a hotline to crack down on unethical breeding practices, ensuring veterinarians give consumers accurate information about dogs, and increased penalties for those who abuse animals in front of a minor.
Not the first animal legislation…
Republican Rep. Meg Weinberger, a leading animal-rights activist representing Palm Beach, sponsored similar legislation in the 2025 session. Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin filed the companion bill in the Senate. Their bills required breeders to register with the state, undergo inspections, and be listed in a public database.
Violators would face hefty fines. However, neither bill was ever voted in either a House nor a Senate committee.
This isn’t DeSantis’ first venture to Big Dog Ranch Rescue. At the end of the 2025 legislative session, he signed “Trooper’s Law” and “Dexter’s Law” at the South Florida venue. On Tuesday, he vowed to do so with his new proposals if the Legislature agrees.
“The mission is, you legislators, churn this out and then we’ll set a date to come back here and … then we’ll do an even bigger celebration,” he said.
Trooper’s Law, named after a Bull Terrier nicknamed “Trooper” by Florida Highway Patrol, makes it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon a dog outside during a natural disaster. Trooper was found tied to a Tampa fence ahead of Hurricane Milton as floods rushed in. Animal cruelty charges were dropped against his former owner for lack of evidence of intent.
Dexter’s Law lengthens prison sentences for Floridians who torture, mutilate, or kill pets. This came after Dexter, a bulldog mix, was found decapitated and dumped in St. Petersburg.
The 2026 legislative session begins Jan. 13.

The surrounding land was scorched by a wildfire in December 2021 (Allison Kite/Missouri Independent).In the first 10 months of 2025, almost 110,000 acres across Missouri were burned by more than 2,700 wildfires.
More than 9,300 of those acres were burned by wildfires caused by power lines.
In May 2025, the Missouri Public Service Commission — which regulates the state’s utility companies — asked utilities to detail their wildfire mitigation plans.
The commission hopes to develop best practices for utilities to reduce the risk of wildfires and protect the communities they serve.

The request reflects Missouri’s changing environment, with drought and other factors driving an increase in wildfire risk statewide. Utilities’ responses highlight a patchwork approach, with some providers well into implementing plans and others still drafting them.
 No stranger to fire

In the United States, wildfire is often considered a mostly western phenomenon. But Missouri is no stranger to fire — historically, nearly all of the state burned on a regular basis, according to LandFire, a federal fire management data program.
Before Europeans arrived, some parts of the state burned as often as every two years, and almost all parts of the state burned at least every 20 years, according to federal data.
That means the plants and animals in Missouri’s ecosystems evolved around wildfire, with some becoming dependent on it for renewal and survival, according to Andrew Dressel, vice president of energy practice at Charles River Associates, a consulting firm that works with utilities on risk mitigation.
Today, wildfires primarily burn in the state’s southern forests, while its northern grasslands burn far less than they did historically.
Firefighting and suppression have kept much of Missouri from burning as often as it once did. The FEMA National Risk Index characterizes most of Missouri as being at “relatively low” or “very low” risk of wildfire, a point that Ameren and Evergy — the state’s largest utilities — noted in their responses to the Public Service Commission.

Wildfire Risk

But Missouri State Climatologist Zach Leasor said changing climate conditions are providing more fuel for fire.
“All of the trends we’re seeing with drought point to an increased wildfire risk here in Missouri,” Leasor said. “We might not see longer droughts … but we’re going to see short, intense droughts that are then punctuated by these extreme precipitation events.”
Leasor said these conditions exacerbate fire risk because they dry out new growth, creating more fuel.
“Usually, what we see as the best mix for a fire year would be healthy vegetation early so you build up a lot of biological mass, and then it dries down, and now you’ve got all these fuels here,” Leasor said. “That’s the worst-case scenario when you think about fire risk, especially in a state like Missouri.”
Other climate conditions, like temperature, can also play a role, he said, because warmer overnight lows have extended the growing season, pushing back winter conditions that suppress fires. That is particularly problematic because fall is Missouri’s peak fire season, when lower humidity and higher winds increase fire risk.
While Missouri hasn’t yet seen the massive blazes affecting nearby states, the potential is there, according to Michael Stambaugh, a professor at the University of Missouri-Columbia and the chair of the Oak Woodlands & Forests Fire Consortium.
“There have been half-a-million-acre fires recently in Kansas and Oklahoma. … We haven’t seen the big fires yet, but I think it’s just a matter of time,” Stambaugh said.
“The conditions are more or less the same (in Missouri) as you see in Kansas and Oklahoma,” he added. “We have the same fuels, we have the same kinds of landscapes, more or less very similar weather patterns. A lot of those ignitions are accidental, so I think it’s just a matter of time.”
Stambaugh said there is precedent for these kinds of fires in Missouri, with fires several hundred years ago burning up to 1 million acres.
“Even though we’re not seeing a significant increase in the number of fires and area burned, it doesn’t mean the potential hasn’t changed, or isn’t there, for large events to happen,” he said, adding that even if conditions make fire risk worse, the scope of that risk can be hard to fully understand until fires actually start.
The fact that Missouri hasn’t yet seen a significant increase in wildfires makes the PSC’s inquiry all the more “proactive,” according to Andrew Dressel, a consultant who works with utilities on risk mitigation.
“Missouri is not immune from wildfire risk, so it’s good to be out ahead of this,” he said, adding that states across the country have seen an increase in the risk of wildfires, including utility-related fires.
 A national challenge

“This became a big issue really in the 2010s, when it stopped being a southern California problem — then it was all of California. There were a number of fires … culminating in the 2018 Camp fire,” Dressel said. “That fire started from a transmission line … that broke in a remote section of northeastern California and, hours later, burned down much of the town of Paradise and subsequently led to the bankruptcy of PG&E.”
Similar disasters followed, including Oregon’s Labor Day fires in 2020, the 2021-2022 Marshall fire in Colorado and the Lahaina fire in Maui in 2023.
Dressel said the Marshall and Lahaina fires catalyzed conversations about the role of utilities in preventing wildfires, as “that’s when people really started focusing in on why the power was even still on in those situations.”
The 2018 Camp fire and others have shown the potential for utility-related wildfires to destroy entire towns and claim lives. They’ve also demonstrated that when utility infrastructure causes or exacerbates a wildfire, the cost can be high enough to destabilize — if not bankrupt — a company, Dressel said.
That means higher costs for customers, but also higher costs for the insurance companies that work with utilities. The increase in utility-related wildfires has “skyrocketed” insurance costs for utility companies, Dressel said, which puts pressure on companies to develop wildfire mitigation plans.
 Utilities’ plans

In its response to the commission, Ameren said it has wildfire liability insurance. While a wildfire mitigation plan was not required to access coverage, it said “it is helpful in securing coverage and explaining to underwriters what mitigations are being taken.”
Evergy also reported that its excess liability policy — which includes wildfire coverage — did not require it to have a plan in place.
The Association of Missouri Electric Cooperatives, which represents co-op utilities across the state, told the commission that “a well-structured plan helps reduce liability exposure” but did not elaborate further.
Wildfire mitigation plans outline strategies for reducing the risk of wildfire. They include plans for preventing equipment from starting fires and plans for protecting customers and equipment if a wildfire is already burning through an area, Dressel said.
Most electric utilities told the commission they “have some semblance of a plan,” but a few had no plan, Dressel said, adding that he had not reviewed any utilities’ full plans, only their responses to the PSC.
Ameren told the commission it had a plan in place but later described it as being “in its early development stage.” Evergy is developing its wildfire mitigation plans, but told the commission it expects to have a draft complete by the end of 2025.
Meanwhile, electric cooperatives across the state are in different stages of developing and implementing their plans, according to the cooperative association’s responses.
In addition to asking whether utilities had plans in place, the commission requested information about aspects of those plans, including infrastructure maintenance, risk assessment, forecasting and emergency communication.
Ameren, Evergy and the cooperatives all reported regularly inspecting and managing equipment and nearby vegetation. Asked about efforts to upgrade infrastructure, Ameren and Evergy told the commission they were working on replacing old conductors and installing new, more fire-resistant poles.
Dressel said “system hardening” — upgrades to infrastructure to improve resilience — is often considered after other mitigation strategies “because you want to see what you can do at a lower cost first.”
Other, cheaper approaches could be prioritized, like changing how the grid itself responds to potential problems. But Dressel said that section “was a little light on a lot of the responses.”
Power lines have sensors that detect when a tree branch has fallen on a line, prompting the system to shut off power to that line temporarily. Evergy spokesperson Courtney Lewis told The Beacon in an email that Evergy makes those sensors more sensitive during Red Flag Warning days “so the grid is faster to react to potential problems.”
But Dressel said that approach has its limitations if the power starts flowing again moments later. If there’s a branch sitting on the line when that happens, “then you have a fire,” Dressel said.
To prevent this, during high fire conditions, utilities could disable the technology that automatically reopens the line. But that further impacts reliability, as power would be shut off until a crew could come in person to turn it back on, Dressel said.
In its request, the commission also asked utilities about their ability to model different weather scenarios to help with planning and disaster preparedness.
Ameren told the commission it relies on the National Weather Service’s fire risk alerts but doesn’t model weather conditions. Evergy reported it currently “accesses state resources for this type of work.” Both said they are reviewing available products.
While utilities’ answers covered much of what would be needed for effective mitigation plans, Dressel said “there were several that don’t have great elements regarding coordination with public safety agencies and other utilities. They don’t necessarily have a plan to reach out to other critical infrastructure operators.”
Ameren told the commission it has not integrated its mitigation plan into state or local emergency plans, but it has instructed employees to call 911 in the event of a wildfire. Evergy, meanwhile, reported that although the focus hasn’t been on wildfires, it has built “strong working relationships” with state and local officials and first responders regarding emergency planning and communications.
Both Ameren and Evergy told the commission they participate in mutual assistance plans and work with other utilities to share best practices and provide support in the event of an emergency. However, Ameren added that it does not have “a specific procedure for information sharing” beyond planned work outage notifications.
The commission also asked utilities about their plans for public safety power shutoffs, or PSPS, which involves preemptively cutting off power during an emergency to prevent energized power lines from exacerbating a fire.
Neither Evergy nor Ameren currently has a PSPS policy in place, but both told the commission they are exploring developing one. In its report, Ameren described such a policy as a “mitigation measure of last resort.”
“Most seem to not want to do this. That’s common,” Dressel said. “But our view is that everyone should have PSPS in their plan somewhere. When conditions devolve to some really raging windstorm in very dry conditions, no one wants to shut the power off — because the primary objective of power companies is to deliver power — but sometimes, it’s the best decision you can make.”
Having a PSPS plan in place is necessary to ensure that, in the event of an emergency, utilities understand how cutting power will impact the community, he said.
“Is there critical infrastructure on that line? Is it going to affect your ability to pump water? Are you going to cut off the emergency response dispatch center? Are there medical needs customers there? Have you communicated with them?” Dressel said. “There has to be a really detailed communication strategy that involves all the stakeholders.”
Asked whether there were constraints on its ability to develop and implement mitigation plans, Evergy said it is considering potential constraints, including “stakeholder recognition of this as a risk.”
Asked by The Beacon what stakeholder feedback has looked like thus far, Lewis wrote in an email: “We have found broad support among policymakers in Missouri and Kansas for assessing wildfire risk and creating a mitigation plan through a collaborative effort.”
 What’s next?

With regulators in Missouri and across the country taking notice of growing wildfire risk, regulations could very well be coming, Dressel said.
Missouri “had done some homework before asking about wildfire mitigation plans,” he said. “It looks like they did look at what other states are doing that have dealt with this more. … It seems like they weren’t just doing this on a whim.”
“With what we’ve seen elsewhere, I would not be surprised if they move forward with a requirement that Missouri utilities have a wildfire mitigation plan,” he added. “Because most of (the utilities) have something in flight, it shouldn’t be a major lift.”
Dressel said the PSC’s detailed request — covering aspects of wildfire mitigation and preparedness — could suggest that, beyond requiring a mitigation plan, the commission could require utilities to have plans for individual pieces, such as emergency communications or PSPS.
Even if the commission opts to recommend best practices rather than require them, progress has been made, Dressel said.
“Whether the PSC moves forward or not, I think just asking these questions has probably spurred most of the utilities to action,” he said.

Despite the cranes and construction fencing, airport leaders say Wilmington is well-positioned for one of its busiest holiday periods yet!
WILMINGTON, Del. — Wilmington Airport is promising a “hometown, hassle-free” experience for Thanksgiving travelers this week even as a multi-million-dollar terminal expansion and curbside changes reshape Delaware’s only commercial airport.
Airport officials say ILG remains fully open and staffed for the holiday rush, with Avelo Airlines operating nonstop flights to 14 destinations and a growing share of Delaware Valley passengers choosing the smaller airport over crowded big-city hubs.
$9.8 million expansion nearing completion
The Delaware River and Bay Authority, which operates the airport, is in the final stages of a $9.8 million terminal expansion funded in part by a $5.6 million federal infrastructure grant.
The project adds roughly 6,000 square feet to the gate area, making room for an additional boarding gate, a larger passenger holding room and space for more concessions. It also allows for another security lane, including ILG’s first dedicated TSA PreCheck line, and upgrades terminal utilities.
As of now, the renovated restrooms — including the airport’s first-ever family restroom — and a new baggage claim carousel are completed.
The expansion is designed to help Wilmington handle record passenger levels — more than 155,000 travelers in the first half of 2025 alone — and to attract a third Avelo aircraft to the airport in the coming year.
“We’re investing now to give customers a better experience and lay the groundwork for additional service,”  Jennifer Oberle-Howard, Deptuy Director of Communications for the DBRA.
New and future routes for Delaware flyers
Avelo, which opened a base at Wilmington in 2023, now flies from ILG to popular sun destinations including Orlando, Tampa, Fort Myers, Fort Lauderdale, and San Juan, Puerto Rico, among others.
Looking ahead, Avelo has announced new nonstop service from Wilmington to Atlanta beginning in February 2026, with service to Chicago starting March 12, 2026. Other major cities may also be announced later that year. Those routes will not be in operation this Thanksgiving, but airport leaders say they show ILG’s growing role in the region’s air service.
Construction impacts: curbside and parking tweaks
Holiday travelers will see signs of construction but should find all core services available. The terminal, gates and security checkpoints are operating, and most expansion work is happening behind construction walls.
To handle heavier holiday traffic and ongoing growth, the airport has expanded its cell phone waiting spaces, located directly adjacent to the terminal to make it easier for drivers picking up holiday visitors.
Parking has been expanded in recent years, with ILG now offering more than 1,320 spaces across lots A, B and C, plus an overflow Lot D that opens as needed. For added convenience, real-time parking space counts are available on the airport’s website.
The airport increased its daily parking rate to $11.50 on Nov. 1 but says prices remain below many larger regional airports and help fund ongoing terminal improvements and the gate expansion scheduled to open later this year.
Extra accommodations for Delaware travelers
In addition to Avelo’s flights, Wilmington continues to offer an option for travelers headed beyond ILG’s nonstop map through a partnership with the Landline motorcoach service and American Airlines. Passengers can check in, clear security and check bags at ILG, then board a coach directly to Philadelphia International Airport to connect with American flights and earn frequent-flier miles.
Inside the terminal, recent projects have already delivered renovated restrooms, a new baggage carousel and added parking capacity. The expansion will ultimately bring more food and beverage choices, including a grab-and-go concept with seating, and additional customer amenities as new concession space comes online.
What travelers should do this week
For Thanksgiving week, airport officials and travel experts are urging Delaware flyers to:


Arrive early. Even though ILG is smaller than major hubs, passengers are advised to arrive at least 90 minutes before departure to allow time for check-in, security and any construction-related detours.


Build in time for parking and curbside changes. Families should plan for a short walk from parking or the temporary curbside area and look for updated signage directing them to the correct entrance.


Check flight status before leaving home. With peak demand and potential weather issues, ILG recommends monitoring airline apps or the airport website for any schedule changes.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture from the Democratic Party's livestream)TOPEKA — Democratic U.S. Senate candidates Christy Davis, Sandy Spidel Neumann and Anne Parelkar blamed Kansas GOP incumbent Roger Marshall for cost-of-living increases and promoted demands for affordable health care, better treatment of farmers, quality schools and a higher minimum wage.
The trio indicated during an online forum Monday night hosted by the Kansas Democratic Party the centerpiece of their 2026 campaigns would place responsibility for the country’s economic woes on Republicans, including Marshall. The Republican senator said he would seek reelection next year.
The Democratic candidates argued President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” supported by Marshall, exacerbated kitchen-table worries across the red state of Kansas that elected Marshall by 11.5 percentage points in 2020. Democrats said voters shouldn’t forget Trump signed the legislation in July with Marshall standing directly behind the president.
Parelkar, Spidel Neumann and Davis — Senate candidates Michael Soetaert and Chase LaPorte didn’t take part — reminded the audience Marshall walked out of an Oakley town hall in March rather than listen to criticism. Town-hall attendees were boisterously complaining about federal job cuts, especially those tied to veterans’ programs, that were part of Trump’s DOGE initiative with billionaire Elon Musk.
“I’m here to be everything Roger Marshall isn’t,” said Davis, a Cottonwood Falls resident and former rural development director at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. “Kansans deserve a senator who will honor the Constitution, hold the executive branch to account and use the power of the purse to help everyday Kansans.”
 
‘Time we stand up’
Parelkar, an Overland Park immigration attorney, picked up the anti-Marshall thread: “He hides, he avoids and he performs on TV for ‘Daddy’ Trump’s approval. That’s not leadership. It’s fear of having to explain what he’s actually done to working families and the people who trusted him.”
She said Kansans scraping by day after day were frustrated with escalating costs, loss of health care and corporate consolidation of agriculture.
“It’s time we stand up and say, ‘We’re mad as hell, and we’re not going to take it anymore,'” Parelkar said.
Spidel Neumann, a former financial services executive who grew up in Overland Park, said she would represent all Kansans in the U.S. Senate. She asserted Marshall was “dodging constituents,” and that she wouldn’t be that kind of politician.
“I will go to every county, every city, talk to Kansans, find out what’s concerning them and work across the aisle to deliver,” she said. “From what I’ve seen, Marshall just parrots (Trump) administration talking points. He shows up on occasion for a photo op in Kansas, and then he touts policies, like the Big Beautiful Bill, that really harmed Kansans, be it seniors, children, veterans, farmers. I mean, who takes food from kids to give billionaires a tax break?”
Spidel Neumann said a person didn’t need her degree in economics to grasp the “chaos created by Marshall and the Republican-controlled government is hurting everyone.”
The Democratic candidates said they would consider an adjustment to the federal minimum wage, which has stood at $7.25 per hour since 2009.
“We’re losing workers to other states,” Spidel Neumann said. “From an economic perspective, it needs to go up. It needs to go up to a living wage, up to $15.”
Davis said it was unrealistic to expect a person to live off minimum wage because it amounted to $15,000 in annual salary. Housing costs in Kansas were too high and parents were struggling to afford child care, she said. It didn’t make sense for Trump, Marshall and other Republicans to work toward elimination of the U.S. Department of Education, she said.
“Right now the top 1% has more wealth than the entire middle class combined,” Parelkar said. “A full-time job no longer guarantees a middle-class lifestyle. The next generation has little, if any, hope of owning a home.”
 
Marshall’s agenda
A spokesperson for Marshall didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about remarks of the Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate.
Last week, Marshall reintroduced a bill to expand a federal tax credit intended to help people with statistically higher barriers to employment. The credit would be extended to 2030 and could be relied on by employers to invest in training, wages and benefits for military spouses, veterans and recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or Supplemental Security Income benefits.
“For hardworking Americans who’ve faced real obstacles entering the workforce and pursuing their American dream, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit has long been a vital lifeline,” Marshall said. “We’re giving more people a fair chance at meaningful work and the independence that comes with it.”
Marshall said the bill reflected his commitment to the U.S. working class. His advocacy for them included a measure providing tax relief on overtime wages, which was incorporated into the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Another piece of that bill set aside $50 billion to support rural hospitals nationwide, Marshall said.
He’s been a critic of the Affordable Care Act and of proposals by Democrats to extend tax credits relied on to hold down the cost of ACA premiums. The ACA tax credit expires at the end of the year, but Republican lawmakers in Washington plan to outline a health care bill in December, Marshall said.
“For 15 years, Obamacare has been the law of the land. This is an opportunity for Republicans to fix it and jump to solutions,” Marshall said.
He said the GOP bill should redirect to consumers about $150 billion the federal government was “giving insurance companies” under the ACA. He said legislation requiring hospitals and surgery centers to share with patients in advance the cost of procedures would help curtail expenditures.
“We think those two things alone will drive down the cost of premiums and the true cost of health care,” Marshall said.
 
Kansas’ health
During the forum, Parelkar alleged Marshall, who is a physician, was “violating his Hippocratic oath” as a doctor by endorsing federal policies that placed Kansas hospitals at greater threat of closure. She said about 30 hospitals in Kansas were at “imminent risk” of being shut down.
“Moms already can’t get maternity care out there and people are having to be helicoptered to urban centers for heart attacks,” she said. “If you survive that, well, how are you ever going to pay for that? Nursing homes are going to close and we’re going to see people end up on the streets.”
Parelkar recommended granting federal health coverage to all U.S. children from birth through age 18. She proposed the cost of the initiative could be covered by a repeal of tax breaks earmarked for wealthy people.
Spidel Neumann, the former business executive, said the government should extend tax credits linked to ACA premiums. If not, she said, families would certainly choose to go without health care. In addition, she said, the federal government should place caps on prescription drug prices.
Davis, the former USDA official in Kansas, said her sister, who was a physician, died while advocating for better health care access for patients. Meanwhile, Davis said, provisions of the ACA saved her own life.
“No one knows better than me that we’re in a crisis and we need to address health care. People can’t afford premiums and deductibles. We are short on health care providers, especially in rural Kansas,” she said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Senate-democratic-candidates-1024x585.png,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

Downtown Christmas pop-up becomes a natural stop after the Wilmington Jaycees parade
WILMINGTON — In downtown Wilmington, many people know the holidays have officially arrived when Blitzen opens its doors on West 9th Street.
The Christmas-themed pop-up bar, styled as “The Den,” returns for the 2025 season on Thursday, Nov. 20, opening at 4 p.m. at 220 W. 9th St. The immersive bar is decked out in lights, trees and reindeer-inspired décor, and will operate Wednesday through Saturday with evening hours that make it a natural follow-up stop after the Wilmington Jaycees Christmas Parade.
This year’s parade steps off at 11 a.m. Saturday, Nov. 29, running along Market Street from Second to 11th streets in the heart of downtown. City officials and parade organizers have framed the 61st annual event as both a family tradition and a way to support nearby small businesses on Small Business Saturday.
With Blitzen just a short walk from the parade route, organizers and downtown boosters are encouraging families and visitors to make a full day of it — parade in the morning, shopping and dining in the afternoon, and a festive stop at Blitzen in the evening.
From fast build to holiday fixture
Blitzen first opened in November 2019, transforming the former Pochi restaurant space on 9th Street into what its creator, Delaware-based fashion illustrator and creative director Dallas Shaw, described as a whimsical reindeer’s den. The pop-up was designed and decorated in just a few weeks, with an early menu crafted in partnership with Stitch House Brewery.
Shaw’s concept quickly stood out from a typical holiday bar. Local coverage at the time highlighted Blitzen’s wall-to-wall décor, custom artwork and storytelling touches that gave guests the sense they had stepped directly into a reindeer’s off-season lair.
Since that first season, Blitzen has returned each year with refreshed décor, new cocktail lists and an expanding following. It is now regularly included on regional lists of must-visit holiday pop-ups and is considered one of downtown Wilmington’s signature seasonal attractions.
A cozy “den” after the bands pass by
Inside, Blitzen offers an intimate, photo-ready setting, with holiday lighting, themed vignettes, and a cocktail-forward menu served in the evenings. Guests can expect inventive seasonal drinks, sparkling wines, and winter-style beers, alongside a small selection of bar snacks during early evening hours. The experience is designed more as a festive lounge than a full-service restaurant, catering to groups of friends, coworkers, and parade-goers looking to keep the holiday momentum going.
On parade day, once the last marching band and float clear 11th and Market, families and adults can head a few blocks west toward 9th Street, where Blitzen’s evening hours give downtown visitors a place to warm up, take photos and continue celebrating under twinkling lights.
Boost for downtown holidays
City leaders have pointed to events like the Jaycees parade and seasonal pop-ups such as Blitzen as key pieces of Wilmington’s holiday economy, drawing visitors into the urban core to shop, dine and explore. The parade is timed to coincide with Small Business Saturday, and nearby restaurants, bars and retailers often report some of their busiest foot traffic of the year.
For many Wilmington residents, that combination — a morning on Market Street, an afternoon of shopping and an evening at Blitzen — has become its own tradition.
Blitzen is scheduled to operate through the holiday season with limited days and evening hours, and past years have seen lines form on peak weekends. Visitors are encouraged to check the bar’s website and social media for updated hours, special events and private-party availability before it “dashes away” again until next year.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-25-101954.jpg,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

Adamson worked as a science communicator at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Earth Resources Observation and Science Center for 18 years before walking away in July. 
He was responsible for translating scientific research and accomplishments for the EROS website, producing and leading a podcast showcasing EROS work, and leading several tours a week through the facility.


From insiders to ousted
This is the second of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


EROS, located northeast of Sioux Falls, archives satellite images to monitor land use and changes — including helping with emergency disaster responses, such as wildfires, or analyzing the impact of drought, disease and flooding across the world. 
Amid widespread federal workforce and spending reductions by the Trump administration, Adamson and his team of a dozen people were instructed that they’d be laid off in July. But their funding was restored a week or so before the date arrived.
By the time Adamson’s job was no longer in jeopardy, the 55-year-old was convinced it was time for a change. It felt too fragile to trust.
“Even without being political, just being objective about it, the uncertainty feels different now,” Adamson said. “It’s a lot more extreme.”
About 154,000 federal employees took buyouts — officially known as deferred resignations — offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal government. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
Adamson is not included in that number, because he was a contracted employee. He joined EROS when he and his wife moved to Sioux Falls in 2007. He enjoyed scientific writing, found it rewarding to work with scientists and was fascinated by the work accomplished at the site.
Now, Adamson teaches English in the Sioux Falls School District. He was an educator before joining EROS.
During the recent federal government shutdown, he vacillated between empathy for his former coworkers — recalling the stress thrust upon him in prior shutdowns and leading up to potential shutdowns — and relief at not enduring shutdowns anymore.
Adamson is worried that the Trump administration’s propensity to cut government spending could jeopardize the EROS mission.
“If they don’t understand the value of the work at EROS, they might see it as a great place to cut costs,” Adamson said. “There’s a lot of cost to cutting science, and there’s a lot of science going on at EROS.”

(Getty Images)A third unvaccinated infant in Kentucky has died of pertussis as public health officials urge Kentuckians to get vaccinated against the highly contagious disease also known as whooping cough.
Kentucky’s three infant deaths from whooping cough over the past 12 months are the state’s first reported since 2018. None of the infants or their mothers had been vaccinated against the respiratory disease, the Kentucky Department of Public Health confirmed.
Kentucky is in the midst of its largest pertussis spike since 2012, says a Monday state news release that says the disease has increased nationwide as vaccination rates decline.
As of Nov. 19, there have been 566 cases of whooping cough identified in Kentucky, with health officials anticipating more cases as the year ends. Babies younger than 1 year old are at the greatest risk for whooping cough. 
The best way to prevent whooping cough is by receiving the Tdap or DTaP vaccine, which protects against three bacterial infections — diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, say public health experts, says the release. 
Infants can receive the DTaP vaccine beginning at 2 months. The Tdap vaccine is recommended for women during pregnancy to help provide early protection for the baby.  
“We are deeply saddened to learn of another infant death in Kentucky due to pertussis and are concerned by the volume of cases we are seeing throughout the commonwealth,” said Dr. Steven Stack, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services. “We continue to urge Kentuckians to get their whooping cough vaccine and to make sure they are up to date on all other recommended immunizations. Many illnesses can be prevented through vaccination, which helps protect not only the individual but also those around them.”  
The cabinet’s news release says:
Whooping cough vaccination is required for Kentucky school children. Data from the 2024-2025 Kentucky school immunization survey indicate, however, that only 86% of kindergarteners and 85% of seventh-graders are up to date on their required whooping cough vaccines. Health officials encourage everyone to remain up to date with pertussis immunizations. This means: 

All pregnant women should be immunized with each pregnancy to protect their babies. 


Infants should be immunized when they are 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 12-to-15 months old. 


Children should be immunized before starting kindergarten. 


Pre-teens should be immunized between the ages of 11 and 12 years old. 


Teens and adults should be immunized at least every 10 years, or sooner if an injury occurs or to protect a newborn. 

Other ways to prevent the spread of whooping cough and other infectious illnesses include washing hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when sick. 
Symptoms of whooping cough can vary based on age and vaccination status but typically begin with a runny or congested nose and mild coughing. After one to two weeks, the cough can progress to rapid, violent coughing fits that may cause the characteristic “whooping” sound, vomiting or labored breathing.

The nonpartisan committee announced the updated projections for the state’s general fund after meeting on Monday and credited the forecast to expected increases in sales and income tax revenue, as well as additional capital gains due to the stock market’s strong performance since the last revenue forecast in May.
“With these projected revenues, the State of Maine continues to remain on solid fiscal footing,” said Gov. Janet Mills in a statement. After the Maine Legislature reconvenes in January, the governor will work with lawmakers to craft a supplemental budget that takes into account these changes.
However, even with these adjustments, the Mills administration cautioned that year over year growth “is forecasted to remain relatively slow,” just under 1% for the 2026 fiscal year and 1.4% for 2027. 
Last legislative session, lawmakers faced a projected $450 million deficit, as well as an immediate funding gap to cover the cost of MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, when they crafted the two-year budget.
“The Mills Administration has anticipated revenues to stabilize and has budgeted accordingly to maintain key obligations to the people of Maine,” said Elaine Clark, acting commissioner of the Department of Administrative and Financial Services. “We will continue to prioritize prudent fiscal decisions that serve Maine people.”",,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

WILMINGTON, Del. — Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware, is inviting the community to help brighten the season for young patients through its second annual Holiday Joy Drive, adding a $20,000 matching gift challenge to boost support for hospitalized children and their families.
The 2025 Holiday Joy Drive will be held from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 6, at Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware. Community members can drop off new toys and monetary donations to support children spending the holidays in the hospital.
Visitors that day will also find plenty of festive activities on site, including a hot chocolate station, cookie decorating, live holiday music and photos with Santa Claus.
An anonymous donor has pledged to match every dollar given during the event, up to $20,000, effectively doubling the impact of each contribution.

“The Holiday Joy Drive is a cornerstone of our efforts to bring smiles and comfort to our patients and families, especially during the holidays,” said Hilary Bruno, director of Child Life at Nemours Children’s Hospital, Delaware. “With our $20,000 matching gift challenge this year, the community has a chance to amplify their generosity and make an even greater difference in the lives of these children.”

Money raised through the drive will benefit the hospital’s Child Life programs, which provide therapeutic play, educational activities and emotional support to help children cope with illness, treatment and hospital stays.
Nemours officials say the programs are a vital piece of a child’s healing journey, helping young patients maintain a sense of normalcy and reduce fear and anxiety during medical care.
Donations to the Holiday Joy Drive can be made in person on Dec. 6 or online to take advantage of the matching challenge. Monetary gifts may be made at the campaign site: secure.qgiv.com/event/2025childlifeholidayjoydrivede/donate.

The closure, which UMass Memorial attributed to workforce shortages and declining births, has since left maternity patients farther from a labor and delivery unit – resulting in a number of ambulance and emergency room births – and has strained the region’s emergency medical services, CommonWealth Beacon reported in September.  
The state auditor’s office reviewed UMass Memorial’s activities between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2023, and found that the private, nonprofit health care network in Central Massachusetts could not provide evidence of how it spent $6.2 million in COVID-related grants it received from the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS) during the investigation period.  
The hospital system says the money was used on bonuses for frontline health care workers.  
The issue appears to be a spat about accounting records, but it highlights the struggles health providers had during the height of the first COVID waves, when frontline medical personnel were stretched thin, and how the business of health care has made it increasingly difficult to deliver services like maternity care across the state. 
UMass Memorial has pushed back on the audit’s findings, arguing that DiZoglio’s office overstepped by attempting to dictate how the hospital network should manage its funds. 
Despite UMass Memorial’s claims that the funding was used for bonus payments authorized under the grant agreement, the auditor has maintained that the health care system did not provide accounting records as evidence of those expenditures.  
Although UMass Memorial likely will not face consequences, the audit makes several recommendations and encourages the hospital to adopt procedural changes and reassess maternity care in the region.  
“By not investing this money in its maternity center workforce, [UMass Memorial] has created a health disparity for its patients, of whom 20 percent are MassHealth members, because of a lack of access to maternity care in the Central Massachusetts region,” the auditor’s report said. 
After the investigation concluded, lawyers for UMass Memorial told DiZoglio’s office the funds were used to reimburse itself for employee appreciation bonuses it allocated to thousands of front-line workers during the height of the pandemic, when hospitals around the country struggled to retain medical staff. UMass Memorial added that the bonuses fell under the “increased cost of workforce” category of allowable uses of COVID funds. 
“While reimbursement for bonuses may be permitted, the general public, whose tax dollars were spent, would likely have been better served had this money been used to ensure community access to critical healthcare services, such as maternity care,” the auditor’s report noted.

UMass Memorial provided the auditors with a spreadsheet detailing $10.6 million in bonuses, but DiZoglio’s office said that didn’t constitute proof of payments made to the employees, nor was it proof the bonuses were funded by the $6.2 million grant. Payroll records would have been an acceptable form of documentation. The report also pointed out that the spreadsheet was created on December 3, 2024, well after both the date the information was requested and the audit period.  
UMass Memorial countered in its formal response that the auditor “never submitted requests to UMMH for such ‘accounting records’ and it is unclear what those would be other than the previously provided materials.”  
Steve Lisuaskas, the deputy auditor under DiZoglio, said in an interview that a spreadsheet generated after-the-fact and provided by UMass Memorial’s lawyers was insufficient evidence.  
“I am highly confident that … UMass Memorial knew exactly what we were looking for, and chose not to provide, or more worryingly, never had payroll records they are required to keep for their grants,” he said. “Providing an Excel spreadsheet, which you and I could develop on our own, and purporting it to be a payroll record is not how audits work.”  
In response to the auditor, UMass Memorial said it had not prepared any documents related to the use of the funds initially because the Executive Office of Health and Human Services never provided specific guidance on how to keep track of the expenditures.  
The hospital system also argued in its formal response that the closure of the maternity ward at UMass Memorial HealthAlliance-Clinton Hospital in Leominster was not due to COVID, and directing pandemic relief funds to keep it open would not have been permissible under the grant agreement.  
But EOHHS clarified, in response to the audit, that supporting maternity care “would likely have been a permissible use of the funds,” and said maintaining accounting records was a requirement of the grant agreement.  
The auditor’s office added that the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act, which funded the state grant in question, authorized “premium pay” and “grants to employers with essential workers,” which could have applied to maternity care workers UMass Memorial struggled to recruit before the closure.  
Regional leaders like Fitchburg mayor Sam Squailia took to social media to share the audit and lament the maternity unit closure.  
“The closure of UMass Leominster’s maternity unit was a terrible hit to Fitchburg families and families across North Central Massachusetts,” Squailia wrote on Facebook. “When public money is involved, communities deserve a clear paper trail and a plan that protects access first. Families should not be driving farther to deliver a baby.” 
UMass Memorial argued that there was a public benefit to the bonuses, which rewarded and retained more than 13,000 frontline workers – including nurses – during the pandemic. 
The auditor’s office said it does not question the validity of the bonus payments, but rather “how UMMH chose to reimburse itself for them rather than preserving services for the public.” 
The audit states that the maternity unit closure was “just one example of a loss of a service that may have been prevented if grant funds were used in a different way.” In its response to the audit, UMass Memorial wrote that the auditor “provides absolutely no basis for this vague assertion.” 
In addition to the 2023 maternity unit closure, UMass Memorial shuttered its pediatric unit at the Leominster campus in 2018. Community Healthlink, an affiliate of UMass Memorial, shut down a program in October that provided mental health services for adults in Fitchburg. Additionally, UMass recently closed two primary care programs – one in Leominster in September 2024 and another in Worcester in March, citing financial strains. 
UMass Memorial’s response to the auditor stated that it was “inappropriate and an abuse of [the auditor’s] authority to attempt to dictate how a private entity should manage its funds and operations.” In response, DiZoglio’s office emphasized that UMass Memorial’s use of state funding is subject to audit. 
DiZoglio’s office made multiple recommendations for UMass Memorial, including maintaining detailed accounting records and audit trails when state or federal funding is received, using those types of grants to invest in the operations of essential services, and reassessing the need for maternity care in the region.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/leominster-hospital-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 09:57:46.317282

The review is likely to sow confusion and fear among the nearly 200,000 refugees who came to the United States during that period. It is likely to face legal challenges from advocates, some of whom said the move was part of the administration’s “cold-hearted treatment” of people trying to build new lives in the U.S.
The memo, signed by the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Joseph Edlow, and dated Friday, said that during the Biden years “expediency” and “quantity” were prioritized over “detailed screening and vetting.” The memo said that warranted a comprehensive review and “re-interview of all refugees admitted from January 20, 2021, to February 20, 2025.”
The memo indicated that there will be a list of people to re-interview within three months.
Advocates of the refugee program say that refugees are generally some of the most vetted of all people coming to the United States and that they often wait years to be able to come.
The memo also immediately suspended green card approvals for refugees who came to the U.S. during the stated time period.
If the agency determines that a person shouldn’t have qualified for entry as a refugee, the person “has no right to appeal,” according to the memo, although if they are put in removal proceedings and sent to immigration court, they can then plead their case there. The memo also stated that even those who have already received their green card would be reviewed.
“USCIS is ready to uphold the law and ensure the refugee program is not abused,” Edlow wrote.
People admitted to the U.S. as refugees are required to apply for a green card one year after they arrive in the country and usually five years after that can apply for citizenship.
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the Department of Homeland Security and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The moves described in the memo are the latest to take aim at the refugee program, which the administration suspended earlier this year and later set a limit for entries to 7,500 mostly white South Africans — a historic low of refugees to be admitted to the U.S. since the program’s inception in 1980. The Trump administration more broadly has ramped up immigration enforcement as part of its promise to increase deportations of illegal immigrants.
The Biden administration admitted 185,640 refugees from October 2021 through September 2024. Refugee admissions topped 100,000 last year, with the largest numbers coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela and Syria.
Refugee advocates slammed news of the review, saying that it will traumatize people who have already gone through extensive vetting to make it to the U.S. in the first place.
“This plan is shockingly ill-conceived,” said Naomi Steinberg, vice president of U.S. policy and advocacy at HIAS, a refugee resettlement agency. “This is a new low in the administration’s consistently cold-hearted treatment of people who are already building new lives and enriching the communities where they have made their homes.”
USCIS expects to have a priority list for re-interviews within 90 days, Edlow wrote. His language points to a rigorous revisiting of why refugee status was granted in the first place.
“Testimony will include, but is not limited to, the circumstances establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear for principal refugees, the persecutor bar, and any other potential inadmissibilities,” he wrote.
Sharif Aly, President of the International Refugee Assistance Project, an advocacy group, criticized the administration’s actions in a statement late Monday, saying that refugees are “already the most highly vetted immigrants in the United States.”
“Besides the enormous cruelty of this undertaking, it would also be a tremendous waste of government resources to review and re-interview 200,000 people who have been living peacefully in our communities for years,” Aly said.

Supreme Court eases 24-hour notice rule for local officials, angering transparency advocates","Tom Riese, WESA",,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pa-supreme-court-eases-24-hour-notice-rule-for-local-officials-angering-transparency-advocates/,"The decision angered supporters of government transparency who argue that it weakens the state’s Sunshine Act, which sets requirements for conducting official business in public view.","The Pennsylvania Supreme Court July, 2024 (Jen Barker Worley/ Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts)In a 4-3 decision, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Monday that local agencies do not need to give 24-hour notice when making changes to public meeting agendas — as long as a majority of the body votes to do so.
The decision angered supporters of government transparency who argue that it weakens the state’s Sunshine Act, which sets requirements for conducting official business in public view.
Under the ruling, said Melissa Melewsky, in-house counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association,  “[Local agencies] can add anything they want as long as they vote to add something to the agenda, and then post it the day after the meeting. “How does the public ascertain what will be discussed and acted upon with any kind of certainty when an agency can add virtually anything at the last minute?”
Under amendments signed in 2021 by Gov. Tom Wolf, the Sunshine Act generally requires officials to post meeting agendas at least 24 hours in advance. The agenda is usually required to identify any votes officials plan to take.
But in her majority opinion, Justice Christine Donohue, noted that the law also lists some exemptions to that requirement. They include votes on emergency business where there is a “clear and present danger” to the community, or situations involving late-developing matters that involve either trifling decisions or cases in which the agency takes administrative action short of a policy discussion or vote.
But as written, Donohue wrote, the law also identifies an additional exception: “An agency may add a matter of agency business to the agenda” if a majority of voting members approve doing so.
That last category of exemption arose in the case before the court, which involved an October 2021 vote by a Lehigh Valley school board to approve a teachers’ union contract. Earlier that day, the union agreed to a contact that included a 3% pay raise for nearly 700 teachers: While there was no mention of the contract on the agenda for the meeting, a board majority voted to add it during the meeting, and then voted to approve the contract.
The board argued the agreement with the union was reached within the same day, so the body didn’t have time to notify the public of the change. But a state Senator representing the area, Republican Jarett Coleman, took the board to court.
Coleman argued that all four of the exceptions in the law must be in play to allow a last-minute agenda change, and the state Commonwealth Court ruled in his favor. Advocacy groups from across the ideological spectrum — including the ACLU of Pennsylvania, the conservative Commonwealth Foundation, and the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association — urged the Supreme Court justices to uphold that ruling.
But Monday’s ruling turned on a single word: “or.”
Donohue noted that when the Sunshine Act identified four categories of exception to the 24-hour rule, it separated them with the word “or.” That, she wrote, was “unambiguous and creates four freestanding exceptions,” with any one of them sufficient to waive the notification requirement.
Donohue acknowledged that the majority-vote exception was “the broadest exception” of the four, since it didn’t require that matters be of either minor or life-and-death importance. But she said requiring officials to put themselves on record by voting to add an agenda item provided accountability.
”If the [legislature] intended something different from hat is expressed in that plain text, it is free [to] amend the statute,” she added.






Not everyone agreed, and the ruling provided an unusual ideological split. Donohue’s opinion was joined by Justice Kevin Dougherty, who like her was elected as a Democrat, but it also by Sallie Updyke Mundy and Kevin Brobson, who were both elected as Republicans.
Chief Justice Debra Todd and justices Daniel McCaffery and David Wecht — all elected as Democrats — dissented. Todd argued that allowing a majority of officials to circumvent the 24-hour notice at will would “effectively over[ride] narrow exceptions to the agenda requirement.”
“While I agree with the majority that the plain and common meaning of the term ‘or’ should be taken at face value … the application of that plain meaning would lead to an interpretation of the Sunshine Law that is inconsistent with the manifest intent of the General Assembly,” Todd wrote.
Coleman agreed. In a statement, his office said the court majority “has opened Pandora’s Box. Although a split decision, today is a dark day for transparency in Pennsylvania. This ruling negates the need for governments to publish accurate agendas twenty-four hours before public meetings and essentially allows them to operate with no public notice.”
Melewsky predicted that lawmakers will react by amending the Sunshine Act again.
“If there’s a decision that cries out for legislative change, this is one of them,” she said. “The General Assembly made clear what they intended to do in 2021 when they passed this agenda requirement, and this decision really renders that meaningless.”

(U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Daniel Robles)Officials with the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management announced a reduction of some state emergency response operations on Friday, and a transition from a response to a recovery phase following the Western Alaska storms as winter sets in. 
Emergency personnel with the Alaska Organized Militia, the Alaska Division of Forestry and Fire Prevention and veteran-led volunteer organization Team Rubicon are ending their missions and departing the region this week. Their work for the season should be complete by Nov. 26, according to a division update. 
“Some aspects of the recovery operation might look different, but the support for impacted individuals and communities will continue,” said Bryan Fisher, director of the Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management in a prepared statement.

He thanked the disaster crews for their service. “The work to get emergency repair personnel, supplies, and equipment to communities and repair homes has been nothing short of amazing,” he said. 
The reduction in personnel was expected as winter weather and freezing temperatures set in, said Jeremy Zidek, spokesperson for the State Emergency Operations Center, which is coordinating state, federal, tribal and local partners in the storm disaster response effort.
“We knew when this disaster happened, back on October 8, that we didn’t have a lot of time before winter was going to set in,” Zidek said on Monday. “Here in Alaska, we have two seasons: we have winter and we have construction season. And the ability to work during the winter in these far flung areas that are experiencing below freezing temperatures is very challenging.” 
“So we knew this time would come where we would have to kind of cease some of this emergency response work,” he added. “And really focus on supporting the people that couldn’t return home, and making a plan, longer term, to make repairs when conditions are more favorable.”
The Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities will continue to work on critical infrastructure projects, Zidek said, as well as coordinate with local residents in impacted communities and regional partners like the Association of Village Council Presidents, the tribal coalition leading storm response efforts on the west coast, to continue work in villages as weather allows. 
“A lot of work is still going to continue, particularly on infrastructure,” he said. “And there are going to be local crews that can take better advantage of weather windows, both within communities and out of Bethel. But for the most part, we’re going to focus on repairing critical infrastructure and providing services to people that have been displaced.”
The devastating October storms in Western Alaska prompted the largest emergency disaster response in state history. The remnants of Typhoon Halong killed one person, impacted more than 50 communities, destroyed over 200 homes, damaged thousands of structures, and displaced an estimated 1,600 residents across the state, according to local reporting from KYUK. 
Zidek emphasized that communities were impacted at different degrees, and the coordinated response from a wide variety of federal, state, tribal and community organization partners will continue to support communities as needed.
Since the Trump administration approved a federal disaster declaration on Oct 22, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has distributed $17.9 million in assistance, under its individual and household assistance programs, as of Sunday, an agency spokesperson, Alberto Pilot said by email on Monday. 
Pilot said the federal agency has dispersed over $172,000 in housing assistance funds and $17.7 million in “other needs” assistance, which can include disaster unemployment assistance, legal services and crisis counseling. FEMA has also dispersed over $1 million to the state for “expedited public assistance,” he said. 
The Dunleavy administration has requested a 100 percent cost share covered by FEMA for the storm disaster, but that request is “currently under review,” a FEMA spokesperson confirmed on Monday. 
Zidek noted that the state has paused its distribution of disaster assistance to allow FEMA disaster funds to be dispersed first. He said while the programs provide different kinds of support — for example, the state will cover funding repairs to subsistence fishing camps — the relief funding cannot be duplicated on the same projects, like for home repair work. If that occurs, the state will seek repayment from residents or disqualify them from future benefits, according to a division update.
Storm survivors are still encouraged to apply for state disaster assistance and FEMA disaster assistance to cover different costs as the recovery effort continues. Additional assistance is offered by the American Red Cross.  
There are currently 600 storm evacuees staying in non-congregate shelters, like hotels, and the process of transitioning to longer term housing is ongoing, Zidek said. 
“Our goal is to get as many people as possible into some type of temporary housing by Christmas,” he said. “It’s kind of a lofty goal. We might not be able to get everyone in there, but we want to move a large number of people in non-congregate shelters to something that will be more longer term and more comfortable.”

The Alaska National Guard will largely depart the region and return home by Tuesday, a spokesperson said, except for one UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter air crew stationed in Bethel, which will remain ready to respond at the request of state emergency officials.
As of Monday, the Alaska National Guard reported its service members have assisted 18 communities in the storm disaster relief effort in what officials say is the largest off-the-road-system mobilization in Alaska history. 
National Guard service members evacuated 1,160 residents from the region and assisted with resupply efforts, delivering 350,000 pounds of cargo and supplies to coastal villages and logging 364 flight hours. They transported emergency personnel throughout the region, and service members also cleared miles of boardwalks, removed tons of debris, assessed almost 500 homes and secured or moved 94 caskets displaced by the storm.

Students pursuing graduate degrees in nursing, physical therapy, public health and some other fields would face tighter federal student loan limits under the plan because it doesn’t consider them professional programs.
The revamp is part of Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress.
While graduate students could previously borrow loans up to the cost of their degree, the new rules would set caps depending on whether the degree is considered a graduate or professional program.
The Education Department is defining the following fields as professional programs: pharmacy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, chiropractic, law, medicine, optometry, osteopathic medicine, podiatry and theology.
Left out are nursing, physical therapy, dental hygiene, occupational therapy and social work as well as fields outside of health care such as architecture, education, and accounting.
While the plan is still being finalized, the new student loan caps would take effect next July.
Why this is happening now
The Trump administration says limits on graduate loans are needed to reduce tuition costs. It believes that capping student loans will push universities charging higher-than-average tuition to look at lowering rates.
To define what counts as a professional program, the Education Department is turning to a 1965 law governing student financial aid. The law includes several examples of professional degrees but says it isn’t an exhaustive list. The Trump administration’s proposal, by contrast, says only the degrees spelled out in the new regulation can count as professional programs.
One in 6 of the nation’s registered nurses held a master’s degree as of 2022, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.
The details of the plan were recently hashed out in a federal rulemaking process.
What this means for students
Some future students could find it more costly or difficult to pursue a specialized degree. Under the new plan, students in professional programs would be able to borrow $50,000 a year and up to $200,000 in total.
Other graduate students, such as those pursuing nursing and physical therapy, would be limited to $20,500 a year and up to $100,000 total.
Trump administration says impact will be minimal
The Education Department says its data show 95% of nursing students, for example, are in graduate programs that won’t be affected by the new caps. The department says the vast majority of students are in programs that cost less than the $100,000 cap being proposed for federal student loans.
Students already enrolled in graduate programs would be grandfathered into current lending limits.
Health groups say change will worsen nursing shortage
A coalition of health care organizations has urged the Education Department to change course, arguing that post-bachelor’s health care degrees that are needed for licensure or certification should be considered a professional degree.
They also say that fields being excluded are largely filled by women and in high-demand. According to a U.S. Census Bureau report in 2019, women made up about three-fourths of the full-time, year-round health care workers in the U.S. and accounted for a much higher share in jobs such as dental and medical assistants.
The organizations contend that capping federal student loans will make the ongoing nursing shortage even worse, force students to seek more expensive private loans and threaten patient care.
The American Association of Colleges of Nursing says if the proposal is finalized, “the impact on our already-challenged nursing workforce would be devastating.”
Giving nurses a chance to further their education and advance their careers has attracted young people to the profession, said Susan Pratt, a nurse who is also president of a union representing nurses in Toledo, Ohio.
But making that harder could push away future nurses, she said.
“It’s just a smack in the face,” Pratt said. “When we were during the pandemic, the nurses showed up, and this is the thanks we get.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP25328684315940-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 10:57:33.664154

This year California lawmakers passed a handful of measures regulating artificial intelligence. But President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are reigniting efforts to block states from regulating the technology — potentially upending these recent laws and prompting outcry from California officials. 
The Trump administration last week floated a draft of an executive order calling for a task force “whose sole responsibility” is to challenge state AI laws. Citing recent legislation passed by California and Colorado, the proposed order says the current regulatory framework allows “the most restrictive states to dictate national AI policy.” States found in violation of the order would have their federal funding withheld. 
The draft circulated as Trump took to social media to slam state AI “overregulation” and advocate for “one federal standard.”
Meanwhile, Republican members of Congress are considering a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual legislation to fund the military, that would preempt state authority to regulate AI. The proposal prompted more than 200 state legislators, including six Democrats from California, to fire off a letter Monday opposing the idea.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta also urged congressional leaders to reject the proposed language, arguing that preemption would undermine states’ abilities to respond “swiftly and effectively to emerging technologies” and allow AI companies to “evade commonsense state law protections.” Thirty-two of the world’s top 50 AI companies reside in California, according to Bonta’s office.

The letter: “Any federal AI law should serve as a floor, not a ceiling, preserving flexibility for states to go further where necessary to protect their residents.”

The proposed executive order and bill language are the latest in a series of federal actions to prohibit states from regulating AI, following a failed effort earlier this year. In May Republicans from the U.S. House of Representatives advanced legislation that would have enacted a 10-year ban for states to enforce their AI laws, putting 20 state laws California passed in 2024 at risk. The U.S. Senate ultimately rejected that measure in July, after Democrats and a handful of Republicans arguing for state rights denounced the bill.

California utility regulators next month will vote on a proposal to lower the payout shareholders can receive from three major power companies — a potential decision that critics say won’t do enough to lower utility bills for millions of Californians, writes CalMatters’ Malena Carollo.
Known as a “return on equity,” this baked-in cost in utility bills goes toward shareholders for the risk of investing in utility companies. The California Public Utilities Commission is responsible for determining the state’s rates of return, and is proposing to drop this rate by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.
If approved, the profit margins for all three companies would lower and shareholders would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. But critics also say that while the change can save millions of dollars for ratepayers across the state, it would make little difference for individuals.

It’s the lowest profit margin in 20 years for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but will be hard to notice in your payments.","In summary
California utilities regulators are bringing down “return on equity” payments to power company shareholders. It’s the lowest profit margin in 20 years for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but will be hard to notice in your payments.




With California electric rates stuck at nearly the highest in the nation, the state’s utility regulator is poised to lower the payout shareholders can receive from California’s three large investor-owned power companies. 
In a proposed decision, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended dropping the “return on equity” by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. If approved, shareholders of all three companies would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. Such returns for PG&E and Edison haven’t dipped below double digits in at least 20 years.
Utilities said the decline would affect their ability to bring in needed investment for their work. Critics of the decision said that the decline is too small to meaningfully impact ratepayers’ bills, even if it’s a step in the right direction. 
“California and other [public utility commissions] authorize rates of return that are far in excess of the statutory requirement,” said Mark Ellis, former chief economist at Sempra, which owns San Diego Gas & Electric. 
The California Public Utility Commission is expected to vote on the decision in December.
Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.   
Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees. 
A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive. 
PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.
“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”
PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”
Anthony Wagner, spokesperson at San Diego Gas & Electric, said, “A decision that accurately reflects these realities is essential to enabling investments that reduce wildfire risk, strengthen reliability, replace aging infrastructure and advance California’s clean energy transition for the benefit of the communities we serve.” 
Utilities routinely request these rates be pushed higher because they are a key part of what goes into utilities’ credit rating, affecting the interest they pay on loans for infrastructure investments. But in recent years, experts and consumer advocates point to a mismatch – the utility industry is typically considered low-risk, but critics say the shareholder return rates don’t reflect that. Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates. And it’s costing utility ratepayers across the country as much as $7 billion annually, according to academics.
Ellis, the former Sempra economist, said there is a way to lower shareholder returns while keeping customer bills in check and maintaining credit ratings that the commission has not yet explored – changing the balance of debt and equity each utility has. 
“You really need to understand credit,” he said. “This is where they’re going to get you.”
The commission is allowed to set the debt-equity balance when it determines shareholder returns, but it left this unchanged for all three utilities in its proposed decision for 2026. Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111023_Angelica-Vasquez_MO_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 08:59:40.667564

A new law will end the practice.","Guest Commentary written by

Jon England
Jon England is the education policy analyst at Libertas Institute, a Utah-based free-market think tank.


Gov. Gavin Newsom and I don’t have much in common politically. He’s the Democratic governor of California; I work for a think tank in Utah that supports limited government. Newsom opposes school choice and issued a moratorium on some new charter schools in California. I’m a former public school principal who has become a school choice advocate, and I support alternatives like charter schools.
On one thing, Newsom and I agree — criminalizing chronically absent students and their families is a bad idea. 
The attendance crisis in schools is real. Nearly one in four students nationwide is chronically absent. Absences put pressure on students, who fall behind, and on teachers, who are left to fill the gaps. 
Some lawmakers believe that solving chronic absenteeism, also known as truancy, can be achieved through courtrooms and criminal codes. They say that if parents are threatened with fines or jail, students will start showing up. 
It sounds harsh. It’s also wrong. Punitive truancy laws don’t address the real reasons kids miss school. Instead, these laws turn frustration with a complex problem into a blunt legal hammer.
As a public school principal, I was always concerned about chronic absenteeism. I spent many hours with parents and students trying to understand why school wasn’t working for them. 
Some teachers wanted me to turn to the courts. But legal action never fixed the problem. It was simply a way to hand off a problem schools didn’t feel equipped to solve. The sentiment was understandable. The solution was not.
Truancy isn’t a politically partisan issue. Timmy Truett, a Republican representative in Kentucky, and Kamala Harris, the former Democratic vice president, senator and attorney general from California, both pushed for stricter truancy penalties.
In Kentucky, a 2024 law requiring court referrals for truant students led to a surge of families pulling their children out of public schools to homeschool, rather than face legal consequences.

And in California, Harris’ policy of arresting and charging parents with misdemeanors produced equally troubling results. One California mother was arrested after her daughter, who has sickle-cell anemia, missed school due to hospitalizations.
Harris, while running for president, said she regrets criminalizing truancy in California. And Newsom in early October signed a bill ending California’s policy of punishing parents with a fine or a year in jail for their children’s chronic truancy. 
Truancy laws all share a fatal flaw: they ignore why students are absent in the first place.
Health struggles, bullying, economic hardship, and weak school connections are often the real barriers. Threatening parents does nothing to resolve them. It only deepens the divide between families and schools.
Beneath the statistics lives an uncomfortable truth that few want to say aloud: Public schools do not work well for every student. 
Some face unsafe or hostile environments. Others encounter ideological conflicts or simply feel lost in the system. Families often disengage because their schools aren’t meeting their needs.
There is a better solution. Schools must shift from punishment to prevention. Over the past 15 years, many states have made tremendous strides towards this goal. 
Iowa built a data system to catch absentee patterns early. Georgia required attendance teams and school climate committees. These efforts share one trait — they treat absenteeism as a problem to solve with families, not a crime to prosecute against them.
Schools that intervene early see results by building trust and addressing practical obstacles, such as transportation, bullying, health and engagement issues. These strategies rarely make headlines, but they work. 
Lawmakers should follow these examples. Address safety and climate concerns directly. Help schools build stronger relationships with families. And expand educational options for those who are not thriving in traditional settings.
Attendance improves when families trust their schools, not when they fear them.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102924_BILINGUAL-RECOVERY_LV_CM_22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 08:59:40.667564

Here’s how,Ellie Cohen,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/11/electricity-affordable-virtual-power-plants/,"Gov. Newsom vetoed bills on virtual power plants, which deliver energy to the grid from such home devices as smart thermostats, solar panels, electric vehicle batteries and heat pumps.","Guest Commentary written by

Ellie Cohen is CEO of The Climate Center, a California-based climate and energy policy nonprofit.


Governor Gavin Newsom stood before global leaders in Brazil recently at COP30, the annual United Nations climate conference, and introduced himself to the world as the new face of U.S. climate ambition. 
The scene raised a question back home in California: Why did Newsom recently veto climate solutions that would have made electricity cleaner and more affordable for Californians?
For decades, California has shown the world that states and regions can drive climate and economic progress, even when national governments lag. 
Now the world’s fourth-largest economy, our state has paired consistent cuts in emissions with sustained economic growth and set a standard for clean car rules that is copied worldwide. It also built the nation’s first economy-wide “Cap and Invest” program, the cap-and-trade energy credit program recently reformed and extended under Newsom’s watch.
Yet as the climate crisis escalates, even that legacy faces scrutiny. While Newsom was preparing for COP30, his administration was delaying or diluting key domestic reforms and quietly expanding in-state oil and gas drilling.In Brazil, Newsom urged fellow Democrats to start framing climate as an affordability issue — of course, it is. This rhetoric earned him praise abroad. 
But Newsom has balked at several recent opportunities to address climate and cost-of-living challenges together. 
Just weeks ago, the governor vetoed three bipartisan bills that would have advanced virtual power plants, which are systems that deliver clean power back to the electrical grid during peak hours by aggregating power from devices many of us already have in our homes — such as smart thermostats, rooftop solar panels, home and electric vehicle batteries and electric heat pumps. 
Managing strain on the grid with virtual power plants helps avoid blackouts, reduces reliance on gas powered plants and saves electricity customers money on their utility bills, including those not participating in a virtual power plant program. 
One recent study predicted virtual power plants could save Californians up to $13.7 billion on electricity over the next five years. That is the kind of climate-forward and affordability-focused policy that California voters and global climate champions want. 
But all three bills were doomed because investor-owned utilities like PG&E continue to work against local-scale electricity solutions like virtual power plants, and they know they can count on Newsom as an ally.
It’s time for Newsom to start treating climate like a winning issue here in California — not just on the international stage in the lead-up to the 2028 presidential race. Investing in solutions like virtual power plants creates jobs, lowers electricity bills and builds resilience to wildfires and floods. 
Californians pay twice the national average for electricity and yet still endure frequent planned blackouts. We want solutions that work, protect our families and save money, and we want our governor to champion them.
Newsom is right to emphasize affordability as a pillar of climate progress, creating further contrast between himself and President Donald Trump. That’s good politics and good policy — but it’s also puzzling when his administration vetoes the most cost-effective clean energy solutions available today.
After his time in Brazil, Newsom needs more than rhetoric to cement his legacy as a true climate champion. In his final months as governor, he should advance policies that combat the climate crisis and economic relief to hardworking Californians. Here are two ways he can show the world how to tackle climate change while lowering the cost of living.
First, knock down state barriers to local, clean, affordable energy. Newsom must stop deferring to corporate utilities like PG&E and mobilize the state to support rooftop solar, virtual power plants and other clean, decentralized electricity solutions. 
Second, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and make corporate polluters pay for climate disasters. California hands billions to the oil and gas industry while communities bear the costs of extreme weather and fossil fuel pollution. Making polluters pay their fair share would help finance the transition to a cleaner economy, improve public health and take the burden off taxpayers. 
These solutions can be replicated around the world. And, thanks to Newsom’s strong showing in Brazil, the world will be watching.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/021820_Solar-Panels_AW_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-25 08:59:40.667564

In New Mexico, Mexican gray wolves are required to stay within a  designated area, the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area. (Robin Silver/Center for Biological Diversity)The wandering male Mexican gray wolf “Taylor” was spotted west of Albuquerque this week, the third time this particular wolf has traveled outside of the protected zone and north of Interstate 40 since July.
According to the Center for Biological Diversity, a nonprofit conservation organization, Taylor was living on Mount Taylor in the Cibola National Forest before the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish found and relocated him to a protected zone in the Gila National Forest in May. He returned north in mid-July, then was spotted again on Nov. 7 and Nov. 22. The department relocated him to the protected zone after each of his previous trips north of Interstate 40.
Darren Vaughan, spokesperson for the Department of Game and Fish, told Source New Mexico in a written statement that the department “will continue to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regarding [Taylor’s] movements.” It is unclear at this time whether Taylor will be relocated to the Gila National Forest once again.
New Mexico wolf relocation prompts outcry from advocates

 
Due to federal endangered species regulations, Mexican gray wolves are required to stay within the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, which in New Mexico, encompasses most of the state below I-40.
“Wolves like Taylor can’t read maps, even those with lines drawn by politicians,” Michael Robinson, senior conservation advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement. “Government officials disregarded science when they drew this arbitrary boundary. Wildlife agencies need to let Taylor roam free. I’ll be celebrating if he finds a female northern wolf to raise pups with who will boost the genetic diversity of Mexican wolves.”
Wildlife advocates have previously criticized the state wildlife department for removing Mexican gray wolves like Taylor from areas they are naturally drawn to. According to a joint news release from conservation and wildlife organizations, Taylor is likely searching for a mate. If he were to reproduce with a northern gray wolf from the southern Colorado area, it would help the species’ genetic diversity, advocates state.
The joint release also notes that scientists have suggested that allowing Mexican wolves to expand into northern New Mexico, southern Colorado and the Grand Canyon region would assist in the recovery of the endangered species.
“Instead of spending the time and money to relocate this amazing lobo again, wildlife officials should take a step back and let him roam — maybe learn from where he wanders,” Chris Smith, wildlife program director for WildEarth Guardians, said in a statement. “Mexican wolves belong in the northern part of our state. Biologists and the wolves themselves seem to agree on that.”

An Indiana judge last week dismissed a lawsuit filed by Elephants R Us, the company seeking to build the quarry, which alleged that local opposition to the quarry amounted to interference and cost the firm money. (Southern Environmental Law Center)An Indiana judge last week threw out a lawsuit filed by an Indiana company against Limestone County residents that alleged their attempts to stop quarry construction in Belle Mina amounted to interference.
Hamilton County Superior Court Judge Michael A. Casati said that Elephants R Us, listed as an Indiana LLC but with a location in Huntsville, could not pursue its lawsuit in Hamilton County, Indiana because the issues surrounding the quarry are all in Alabama.
“Now our clients can breathe a sigh of relief and go back to focusing on the case at hand, which is a nuisance case against the quarry,” said Sarah Stokes, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, representing the defendants, in an interview on Friday.
A message seeking comment was left with attorneys representing Elephants R Us on Monday.
Belle Mina residents have filed a separate lawsuit in Limestone County Circuit Court, alleging explosives used to get limestone from the quarry create noise and dust. It also cites noise from trucks and the equipment that grind the minerals for 11 hours per day, five days a week.
According to the lawsuit filed by the residents, the company plans to harvest 400 tons of limestone from the site, roughly one million tons of sediment each year, for the next 30 years.
Elephants R Us sought $1.6 million from two churches, a farm and pastor, alleging they had interfered with the company’s attempts to secure for the quarry from the Alabama Department of Environmental Management.
The company said in the lawsuit it applied for the permit in June 2023, but that the agency did not issue a permit granting permission for the quarry until November 2024. It alleged the delay was due to“various published media reports and court actions taken by the defendants,” including social media postings that the company claimed “spread false information” about the project.
“The purpose of the Defendants’ court actions and public comments disseminated through social media through the country against issuance of Stoned’s mining permit were an attempt to intentionally interfere with the Lease and prevent mining on the Leased Premises and thereby harmed an Indiana company,” the lawsuit said.
The company alleged the delays cost the company money.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Nevada lawmakers concluded a week-long special session that saw the demise of a Democratic-sponsored plan to publicly subsidize the film industry and passage of Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s crime bill, but with a Democratic amendment designed to rein in Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
But underlying those and other issues that comprised the session was frustration, anger, and confusion caused by a legislative process where lawmakers and rules sometimes seemed to alternate between capricious and optional.
Rank-and-file lawmakers, lobbyists, and issue advocates repeatedly criticized the chaotic nature of the special session that at times shelved transparency in a swirl of abbreviated timelines, stifled public input, and fewer opportunities for deliberation or review of legislation.
And all for what several legislators characterized as bills that did not warrant a special session.
Assemblymember Jill Dickman (R-Sparks) summed up that sentiment during a hearing when she explained lawmakers were speeding through the film industry subsidy bill during a special session “not because it’s urgent, but because someone wants it rushed.”
Michele Rindels, the president of Nevada Open Government Coalition and co-editor of the Nevada Independent, said the sheer volume of different topics and bills covered during the special session was unusual compared to previous special sessions which were more limited in scope.
“We were surprised by the length of the agenda. There were about 20 different items they were considering and several surprise additional items came on after the fact,” Rindels said. “This had multiple committees going on at the same time, which just makes it hard for anyone to follow, unless you have a large team.”
Transparency shortage
The Nevada Legislature is exempt from open meeting laws, making transparency issues common, but that can be exacerbated during special sessions.
Everyday Nevadans were also cut out of the process when Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager (D-Las Vegas) made the decision not to permit telephonic testimony for Assembly hearings. Two of the most contentious bills during the special session, the film subsidy and crime bills, were both Assembly bills, meaning they were heard in that chamber first. Both bills attracted hours of public comment when they were first introduced during the regular session.
During a committee hearing, Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May (D-Las Vegas) explained the decision was made due to a staffing shortage in the Assembly. It was a major departure from public comment processes established over the last several sessions, a deviation which advocates argued harshly excluded the public’s access and inclusion as lawmakers considered large, and in the case of the film bill, extremely costly policy issues.
The Nevada Assembly Democratic Caucus did not respond to emailed questions about why telephonic testimony was not permitted in Assembly hearings.
Other lawmakers, like Assemblymember Selena La Rue Hatch (D-Reno), said they weren’t convinced the decision to limit telephonic testimony was due to a staffing shortage. The state Senate, which shares a lot of the same staff as the Assembly, did allow testimony over the phone despite working with similar limitations.
“The fact that the Senate was able to have phones shows that we had that ability. This was a deliberate decision by leadership on the Assembly side to not allow phone testimony,” La Rue Hatch said.
“It was a way to silence some of the dissent that would be coming from the public, and I think there was an attempt to try to slide things through quickly during a special session when people weren’t paying attention,” she said.
Advocates and lawmakers also criticized the lack of accommodation and transparency for Spanish speakers, who were not provided translation services as they typically are during a regular session.
After voting against the crime bill, Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore (D-Las Vegas) said “directly impacted community members were not able to speak in opposition of this bill because they didn’t have any translation provided to them.” Moore, who sat on the Assembly Committee on Public Safety and Security where the bill was first heard, said she was also frustrated by the time limit for  public testimony.
Advocates echoed those concerns. John Piro, representing Nevada Attorneys for Criminal Justice, told lawmakers during a hearing on the crime bill that “last session we had hours of opposition, and cutting the phones off has now cut off hours of opposition for this bill.”
“Don’t let the limited amount of working class people that could make it here today be an example of everybody else that opposes this bill,” he continued. 
Situational rules
Disagreements over how the special session was handled by Assembly leadership also extended to the manner and content of legislation leadership decided to introduce. Yeager and Assembly Majority Leader Sandra Jauregui (D-Las Vegas) introduced a resolution calling for a study of immigration enforcement operations in the state without consulting the Latino Legislative Caucus, which blasted it as a bill “that’s gonna do nothing.”
Details for nearly all the bills being considered during the special session weren’t available until the day before the session, when Lombardo released his official proclamation, which he announced less than 24 hours before lawmakers were scheduled to convene.
Lack of transparency intensified as the session progressed. In the final days of hearings, committees rarely notified the public of planned action on significant legislation. Instead, agendas were filled with references to “Possible committee Bill Hearings” and “Possible committee Bill introductions.”
“We didn’t see any of the bills before we got to session, which meant as soon as they got introduced, that’s the first time we saw them, and then we would be given an hour or two notice at most that a bill was coming up for a hearing,” La Rue Hatch said.
In the final hours of the special session, Democrats introduced a resolution to enshrine universal mail-in ballots in the Nevada State Constitution.
Also on the final day, a bipartisan supermajority of state lawmakers petitioned to add their own topic to an ongoing special session: a bill that would limit cash-rich corporate investors from bulk buying housing. 
Conflicts between rank-and-file Assembly lawmakers and leadership heightened when Yeager allowed Assemblymembers. Brian Hibbetts (R-Las Vegas) and Heidi Kasama (R-Las Vegas) to vote remotely on the  contentious film subsidy bill. The two Republican lawmakers’ votes were critical to the Assembly’s narrow passage of the bill, 22-20.
The chamber’s procedural rules permit remote voting under “exceptional circumstances.” 
On the Assembly floor, Selena Torres-Fossett (D-Las Vegas) questioned whether Hibbetts and Kasama “preparing for vacation” was truly an exceptional circumstance.
Torres-Fossett and others attempted to override Yeager’s decision but failed on a 19- 21 vote. 
La Rue Hatch, who voted to appeal Yeager’s decision, called it hypocritical.
“The fact that we are allowing lawmakers to participate remotely, but not allowing the ordinary public is an unacceptable double standard. You are either letting everybody call in or you’re letting nobody call in, but the fact that we are going to bend the rules when it is convenient for a vote is not appropriate,” she said.
“I think those allowances were made because the speaker wanted the film bill to pass, and he was willing to break the rules of the Assembly to make it happen,” she continued.
‘No sit down conversations’
Several attorneys in Nevada also raised concerns about ramming complex legislation, like the crime bill, through during a shortened special session.
Paloma Guerrero, Deputy Public Defender at Clark County Public Defender’s Office, said they had major concerns about language surrounding social media in the crime bill, but weren’t able to work with the governor’s office on an amendment that addressed their concerns.
“They said that there was an amendment coming. We didn’t see the language until it was presented to the committee. So there’s just been no sit down conversations, which is how any sort of big change in law should be done,” Paloma said. “There was just none of that with the governor’s office bills.”
Tim Robb, the governor’s homeland security adviser, said during an Assembly hearing that “with the timeframes we were working under” during the special session Lombardo’s team was not able to “get this language in front of them through approval processes we have on our end.”
Paloma suggested the legislative failure to consult public defenders analysis of the social media amendment to the bill probably rendered that portion of the legislation vulnerable to a legal challenge.
“The language ended up being worse than what we had first issues with, with the like, the first version of it,” Paloma said. “They just want to push the language through without any sort of input. And that’s just not how the legislative process should work.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC08028-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 07:56:39.564245

The settlement, which must be reviewed by a court, would require RealPage to “cease having its software use competitors’ nonpublic, competitively sensitive information to determine rental prices,” among other mandates.
Abigail Slater, head of the DOJ’s Antitrust Division, cast the agreement as a win for competition and for renters. But RealPage downplayed the settlement’s impact on its business model, saying the deal’s terms “bless the legality of RealPage’s prior and planned product changes”—alluding to the company’s voluntary decision last year to let its customers remove nonpublic data when using the software to calculate recommended rents.
The company emphasized that the settlement does not include any financial penalties or admissions of guilt.
“What a total farce,” Lee Hepner, senior legal counsel for the American Economic Liberties Project, said in response to the DOJ announcement. “This sham settlement violates the first thing we tell every lawmaker: Fixing prices based on public data sets is still price fixing!”
“This is lipstick on a pig and terrible for renters,” Hepner added.
The Justice Department initially sued RealPage last year under the Biden administration, accusing the company of running an “unlawful scheme to decrease competition among landlords in apartment pricing and to monopolize the market for commercial revenue management software that landlords use to price apartments.”
“RealPage contracts with competing landlords who agree to share with RealPage nonpublic, competitively sensitive information about their apartment rental rates and other lease terms to train and run RealPage’s algorithmic pricing software,” the Biden DOJ said. “This software then generates recommendations, including on apartment rental pricing and other terms, for participating landlords based on their and their rivals’ competitively sensitive information.”
The DOJ complaint used RealPage’s own words against it, citing the company’s description of its products as “driving every possible opportunity to increase price.”
NV’s RealPage case may signal step toward reining in private equity rental practices, watchdog says

A White House report released late last year estimated that the kind of algorithmic pricing that RealPage enables cost renters across the US a total of nearly $4 billion in 2023 alone. The report characterized that estimate as conservative.
Basel Musharbash, managing attorney at Antimonopoly Counsel, warned following Monday’s settlement announcement that “far from stopping illegal practices, it gives a green light to algorithmic price-fixing across the economy.”
The states that joined the DOJ lawsuit were not listed on the settlement. (Nevada reached its own settlement with RealPage in September.)
Last week, California, North Carolina, and other states announced a separate settlement with the apartment management giant Greystar, one of the companies that used RealPage software to set rents.
Under the state deal, Greystar agreed to pay $7 million in penalties and stop using RealPage’s software or similar products for pricing.
“Whether it’s through smoke-filled backroom deals or through an algorithm on your computer screen, colluding to drive up prices is illegal,” said California Attorney General Rob Bonta. “Families across the country are staring down an affordability crisis. Companies that intentionally fuel this unaffordability by raising prices to line their own pockets can be sure I will use the full force of my office to hold them accountable.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale: Vermont’s return to office order hurts working families.","This commentary is by Sen. Kesha Ram Hinsdale, D-Chittenden Southeast, the Vermont Senate majority leader.


As a mom of a two-and-a-half-year-old and a one-year-old, I’ve learned the universe laughs at your best-laid plans.
When I was pregnant with my first child, Mira, my due date coincided with the last day of session. I imagined triumphantly passing a child care bill on that final day and then being rushed to the hospital.
Instead, my water broke seven weeks early. I spent a month in the hospital, voting remotely and helping pass major housing and labor bills between contractions and rounds of medication.

No one questioned my commitment to Vermont then. And yet now, as state employees prepare to comply with the governor’s return to office order for Dec. 1, caregivers like me — and the many parents and workers who keep Vermont running — are being treated as though flexibility and commitment can’t coexist.
The order was announced weeks ago, but its true impact is only now coming into focus. At the same time that federal cuts and uncertainty are rippling through state budgets and programs, the governor is adding another layer of chaos to the lives of public servants. Families who depend on those workers — to process benefits, issue permits, and answer calls — will feel it first.
This is no small shift. Dec.1 falls squarely between Thanksgiving and Christmas, one of the hardest times of year to find child care or rearrange family schedules. Workers are being told to drive back to leased office spaces the state has not budgeted or prepared for, even as they juggle school closures and rising costs.
The Wall Street Journal recently reported that women’s turnover rates are three times higher than men’s following return-to-office mandates. The gender pay gap, which had finally begun to narrow, is widening again as mothers are pushed to the margins.
Meanwhile, a New York Times podcast (later retitled) actually asked, “Are women ruining the workplace?” It’s a revealing question in this moment of backlash — a time when women’s gains at the ballot box and in the workforce are being met with old, tired attempts to set us back.
This isn’t just a national trend. Here in Vermont, I’ve heard Republican male colleagues joke that “if women weren’t allowed to work, we wouldn’t have a child care problem.” That kind of thinking — casual, nostalgic and wrong — is exactly what this order echoes. It imagines a workplace frozen in time, where workers’ value is measured by their presence, not their performance, and women’s labor is invalidated.
Meanwhile, Vermont’s government is struggling to meet its basic obligations. The Tax Department routinely has no one available to answer calls on Wednesdays because of staffing gaps.
Developers complain it can take months to get a permit turned around from the Agency of Natural Resources, sometimes because one overworked staffer is on vacation. Agencies can’t fill vacancies fast enough to process benefits, issue licenses, or review applications.
How does forcing more commutes and rigid office schedules solve that? Why not focus instead on pay, retention and modern management practices that actually attract talent?
During the pandemic, we proved that a flexible, digital government could serve people more efficiently. To reverse course now — just to prove a political point — is wasteful and self-defeating.
In the Legislature, we see the dedication of state employees firsthand. Our own staff — policy analysts, attorneys, committee assistants — work year-round to keep government running while we float in and out of the Statehouse with the seasons. They show up early, stay late, and adapt around our unpredictable schedules, just as other state employees do for Vermonters in every corner of the state.
To treat them as expendable now, or to frame flexibility as a luxury rather than a proven management tool, is short-sighted and cruel. It sends a message that loyalty and performance don’t matter — only control does.
This would be a bad idea in the best of times. But in this moment — with Washington in disarray, federal funds in limbo and families already bracing for economic uncertainty — it is indefensible. The people of Vermont need their government focused on stability, service and common sense.
I urge the governor to pause the return to office order and give state employees the breathing room they deserve. There is nothing to gain from forcing an arbitrary December 1 deadline that will only deepen vacancies, disrupt services and demoralize workers.
Vermont’s state workforce has been there for us through crisis after crisis — through floods, fires and pandemics. They showed up when it mattered most, often from their kitchen tables and home offices, balancing family life and public duty. We should meet their loyalty with trust, not suspicion.
It may feel like we’re far from the chaos in Washington or the cruelty of national politics, but make no mistake: the backlash against working women and families has reached us, too. Cruelty doesn’t always shout. Sometimes it hides behind the language of “equity,” the timing of the holidays and the assumption that we’ll quietly manage.
Vermont’s strength has always been compassion and common sense. The governor still has time to show both — by pressing pause.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)A small group of Alabama clergy gathered in front of the federal courthouse in Montgomery Monday to protest the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and to call on Alabama U.S. Sens. Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville to restore funding cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Over 1 million Alabamians were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, mostly children, the elderly and those with disabilities. 
The protest, part of Repairers of the Breach “Moral Mondays” movement, was organized by clergy and pastors from across the South, and led by Rev. Carolyn Foster of Greater Birmingham Ministries. Foster said the group has tried to schedule meetings with Tuberville and Britt for weeks to discuss policy and to pray with the senators.
“Policy violence is a political decision, a legislative neglect when you vote to hurt your own people,” Foster said.

Messages seeking comment from Britt and Tuberville’s Montgomery and D.C. offices were left Monday afternoon. The Alabama Department of Human Resources says approximately 726,000 Alabamians receive SNAP, which provides funds for low-income households to purchase food. 
The group held a similar protest in September ahead of the federal government shutdown, which lasted 43 days. Pamela Payne-Foster, another organizer and preventative care physician in western Alabama, said that even though the shutdown is over, the supplemental nutrition assistance program (SNAP) benefits are still at risk.
“We know that the government is back in session, but the SNAP benefits are still at risk for our people in our state and are taking food out of the mouths of hungry people,” Payne-Foster said. “It’s a shame.”
 The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that 137,000 Alabamians will lose SNAP benefits due to the work requirements added by OBBBA. It requires able-bodied adults without dependents to work 80 hours per month to qualify for food assistance. 
Foster said that, like many churches, Greater Birmingham Ministries has a food assistance program. But, she said, it’s not enough. Michelle Hodges, direct services coordinator at the ministry, said it had to turn away about 70 people at the Oct. 28 distribution, before SNAP benefits were suspended earlier this month.

Ryan Thorpe and Christopher Rufo’s article asserts that al-Shabaab, a terrorist organization based in Somalia, is being funded through the remittances sent by Somali Minnesotans who have defrauded taxpayer-funded programs.
I say this as an American of Somali ancestry who has investigated fraudsters and as someone who has written about it for the Reformer: I can’t prove a negative, but the story, especially in all its sensationalism, appears to be little more than an effort by the right-wing propaganda machine to whip up hatred against Somali Americans. 
Over the past three years, federal prosecutors in Minnesota have charged 78 people in what they have called the largest pandemic relief fraud in the country. The overwhelming majority of the defendants involved in this fraud — named after a nonprofit at the center of the scandal, Feeding Our Future — are from the Somali community but are American citizens. 
Federal prosecutors have seized just a fraction of the money stolen — more than $50 million so far — because fraudsters spent their proceeds on lavish purchases, including real estate abroad. But not in Somalia. 
If federal prosecutors had any inkling that the ill-gotten gains were going to a terrorist organization, don’t you think they’d have brought charges? The U.S. Attorney in Minnesota is no stranger to charging Somalis for ties to al-Shabaab and ISIS. Why on earth would they hold off in this instance?
Those of us who have actually followed the Minnesota fraud cases closely know that time and time again, prosecutors have stated the fraudsters were motivated by greed, not ideology.
That’s why the money that’s gone overseas went to Kenya, which is not surprising to me as someone who has investigated Medicaid fraud cases for the Minnesota Attorney General’s Office. 
Fraudsters invest their proceeds in Kenya because it is profitable and isn’t easy for the U.S. government to retrieve. Kenya, which has a significant Somali population, has a stable and functioning government unlike neighboring Somalia. 
Thorpe and Rufo cite retired Seattle Police Detective Glenn Kerns, who ominously states that Somalis were “routing significant amounts of cash on commercial flights” to Somalia. 
Thorpe and Rufo cite two anonymous sources to imply that the money collected by hawala networks is being sent to al-Shabaab in Somalia. After the story was published, Rufo took to X to write, “Somalis in Minneapolis are stealing billions from Americans taxpayers, loading bags of cash onto commercial flights, and funding terrorism back in Mogadishu.”
These statements are meant to alarm, but the actual situation is that Somalia does not have a formal banking system, and Somalis rely upon hawala networks — a kind of informal banking system developed after the civil war broke out in the 90s — to send money back home. Which they are legally allowed to do: The Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control states that individuals “can send remittances to Somalia, as long as the transactions do not involve parties listed on the OFAC’s Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.” 
The hawala couriers are by law required to report the money they are carrying and its destination. 
Al-Shabaab is a sanctioned entity by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. In March 2024, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 16 entities and individuals that were known to launder money for al-Shabaab, which was just the latest round of sanctions imposed by the U.S., EU and UN. 
In short: Gathering large amounts of cash and delivering it to al-Shabaab would require avoiding the feds at several steps. 
Al-Shabaab, which formed two decades ago, has myriad ways of generating revenue inside Somalia, and it’s true they are known to tax businesses — including hawala businesses — in the rural areas under their control, but the impression given by both the article and Rufo’s social media posts are a gross distortion. 
Somalis in Minnesota number approximately 87,000, which is a fraction of the millions of Somalis who live in the diaspora, many of whom send money back home. The remittances we send keeps afloat the local economy and is a lifeline to millions in Somalia. 
If you lived in Minnesota in 2018, all this may sound familiar. That’s because a similar claim was made about millions of dollars in cash flying out of MSP to Somalia. That claim, which was reported by Fox9, implied that child care fraud was funding Al-Shabaab. (Bizarrely, Rufo and Thorpe claim “Our investigation reveals, for the first time, that some of this money has been directed to an even more troubling destination: the al-Qaida-linked Islamic terror group Al-Shabaab” even though they cite the same retired Seattle police detective as the Fox9 story from seven years ago.)  
The Office of Legislative Auditor conducted an assessment in 2018 and submitted a report stating:“Despite the serious nature of the allegations, neither (former state Department of Human Services employee Scott) Stillman nor Fox9 presented specific evidence to substantiate the allegation.” 
Again, federal prosecutors never charged anyone with terrorism financing. 
Unfortunately, that reporting by Fox9 in 2018 gave fraudsters cover — it allowed for the dismissal of allegations of fraud as just bad faith, racism and Islamophobia. Feckless Democratic-Farmer-Labor politicians were given license to ignore warnings about fraud in public programs, and the rest is history. 
Rufo’s actual intentions became all too clear hours after the piece ran, when he unleashed a torrent of anti-Somali posts on X, while pleading for the attention of President Donald Trump.
Rufo took to X to write, “Somalis are stealing billions of dollars from American taxpayers and sending cash to terrorists back home. It’s time for @realDonaldTrump to revoke Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for all Somali nationals in the United States. It’s time for them to go home.”
The Somali-Al-Shabaab piece made its way through the right-wing propaganda machine, amplified by Benny Johnson and Matt Walsh. Somali-Americans were described as undesirables, who are a drain on society. 

“Minnesota nice” works within a homogenous, high-trust society. It’s doesn’t work when you import an entire population of Somali welfare pirates.

Hours later, Trump announced he was ending Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota, citing “fraudulent money laundering activity.”

Kennedy Jr. has intensified his attacks on aluminum vaccine components used in many shots to boost the body’s immune response.
Kennedy, a longtime anti-vaccine activist before seeking public office, claims that aluminum adjuvants are neurotoxic and tied to autism, asthma, autoimmune disease, and food allergies.
But science and medicine advances a different view. Strong recommendations that parents introduce peanut-containing foods to infants early, for instance, have led to a drop in the incidence rate of peanut allergies.
Since taking office, Kennedy has ordered reviews of vaccine ingredients, citing aluminum as a top concern. A discussion of “adjuvants and contaminants” is on the vaccine advisory panel’s draft agenda.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention webpage that for years has assured the public vaccines do not cause autism was updated Nov. 19 with new language stating that studies have not definitively ruled out a link between vaccines and autism.
He has also targeted scientists who have published studies showing aluminum adjuvants are safe. In August, Kennedy denounced a large Danish study finding no link between aluminum in vaccines and childhood disease, calling it a “deceitful propaganda stunt” and demanding its retraction. The Annals of Internal Medicine rejected the claim and refused to retract the study.
And, regarding the upcoming advisory panel meeting, HHS spokesperson Emily HIlliard said ACIP “is independently reviewing the full body of evidence on adjuvants and other vaccine components to ensure the highest safety standards.”
The stakes are high because Kennedy’s push to cast doubt on aluminum isn’t just about the ingredient itself. It’s part of a broader strategy to foster uncertainty about vaccine safety and lay the groundwork to challenge the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which drug manufacturers say is essential to ensure a stable market for shots.
But researchers across infectious diseases, immunology, pediatrics, and epidemiology say the data is clear: Aluminum adjuvants are safe.
“Aluminum is the third most common element on the Earth’s surface,” said Paul Offit, a pediatrician and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “So we’re all exposed to aluminum all the time. The water that we drink has aluminum in it. The food that we eat has aluminum in it.”
Vaccines add only a tiny amount of aluminum to the body — a combined total of about 8 milligrams — after the schedule of childhood vaccines is complete. Offit said that over the first 18 years of life, people naturally take in about 400 milligrams of aluminum from everyday sources.
“I don’t know why there is so much concern,” said Rajesh Gupta, a former FDA vaccine scientist. “Aluminum gets distributed in the body everywhere. It is ultimately excreted by the kidneys in the urine. So, it is not that aluminum stays in the body.”
How they work
The aluminum in vaccines isn’t foil or metal. It’s a compound of aluminum salts, such as aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, that help the vaccine work better.
It’s a bit like zinc in cold tablets: Patients don’t swallow chunks of metal, instead ingesting a zinc salt that dissolves safely in the body.
In vaccines, these aluminum salts give the immune system an extra nudge so it learns to recognize the target germ more effectively.
When injected, the vaccine stays near the injection site and causes mild, short-lived inflammation that summons immune cells. Those cells pick up the vaccine antigen, a harmless piece of a virus or bacterium, and carry it to nearby lymph nodes. There, the adjuvants show it around like a wanted poster so the body can identify and destroy the germ quickly.
Harm HogenEsch, a professor of immunopathology at the Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, said that aluminum adjuvants work only when they’re injected in the same spot as the vaccine ingredient they’re meant to boost, to help nearby immune cells learn to recognize the germ. If the two shots are given in different places, he said, “you don’t see that effect.”
In response to Kennedy’s claims, scientists say that anything that acts as an adjuvant can, in principle, also boost an allergic response. But that doesn’t mean aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines are turning children into food-allergic time bombs. Antigens in vaccines such as the hepatitis B surface antigen or HPV proteins are not allergens, and no food proteins are put into vaccines.
Animal experiments
Animal studies form the basis of Kennedy’s claim that aluminum adjuvants in vaccines can create allergies. In these experiments, scientists deliberately sensitize rats or mice by injecting them with a food protein mixed with aluminum. The aluminum strengthens the immune response, but it does not cause an allergy by itself.
“That’s the basis for a lot of the experimental mouse models, where you inject a food allergen with an aluminum adjuvant to sensitize the mice,” HogenEsch said. “I’m not aware of any food antigen being included in vaccines, and so I don’t really see a way by which this could happen.”
Ross Kedl, a professor of immunology and microbiology at the University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, went further, noting that there is no plausible route for vaccines to create a peanut allergy out of thin air. “Someone would have had to mix peanut proteins in with the actual vaccine prior to injection.”
Stefan H. E. Kaufmann, director emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, said results from mice often don’t match what happens in people, because “mice are much easier to push into allergic reactions than humans.” In other words, what looks dramatic in a rodent study doesn’t automatically apply to human immune systems.
And in this case, it’s “important to distinguish between how aluminum behaves in lab animals versus people,” Kaufmann said.
Human studies
Beyond animal models and theoretical scenarios, scientists have looked hard for signals of harm in large human datasets.
In 2023, a study by the Vaccine Safety Datalink, a collaboration coordinated by the CDC, reported a slight increase in asthma among children with higher aluminum exposure before age 2, but the association disappeared in further analyses.
“That paper was roundly criticized,” Offit said. “When they controlled for breastfeeding, the association between asthma and receipt of aluminum-adjuvant-containing vaccines disappeared.”
“It should have never been published,” he said.
Kathy Edwards, professor emerita of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that false signals are common when large databases are mined for dozens of outcomes.
“When you look at a hundred different things, just by the law of percentages, some of those may look like there is a signal,” she said. “The whole RFK Jr. assessment is really prone to cherry-picking,” she said, adding that “there does need to be some kind of basic understanding of statistics for people to interpret this.”
Soon after the 2023 U.S. findings drew attention, scientists at the CDC contacted Anders Hviid, head of epidemiology research at the Statens Serum Institut in Copenhagen, Denmark, to see whether his team could replicate the work.
“It makes perfect sense to try to replicate findings of any kind in different data sources,” Hviid said.
Hviid’s nationwide Danish study followed 1.2 million children over two decades, using linked national health registries that record every vaccination and diagnosis.
“Our health care system is quite egalitarian. It’s free, and there’s universal access. And everyone is in these nationwide registers,” he said. Their findings: no increased risk of these conditions associated with increasing amounts of aluminum received through the vaccines.
Rare bumps
Doctors have documented one genuine reaction to aluminum adjuvants: itchy nodules at the injection site, called “pruritic granulomas.” These small bumps are so rare that most allergists and pediatricians will never see a single case.
This reaction “doesn’t lead to something bad, and it really isn’t associated with anything other than that local irritation,” Edwards said.
Researchers believe these bumps represent a localized immune response — meaning only in the area of the injection, not a body-wide allergy — that is very different from the kind of immediate allergic reaction people treat with antihistamines. These include the reactions driven by food or beestings, when histamine, the body’s own alarm signal, floods the system within minutes and causes hives, swelling, or breathing trouble. Kedl said that distinction often gets lost in public debate.
Eliminating aluminum adjuvants
For many experts, the real issue is not just whether aluminum is safe but what happens to the entire vaccine program if aluminum adjuvants are stripped out. For many modern vaccines that rely on a single purified protein — such as those for diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, hepatitis B, and HPV — adjuvants are crucial.
Edwards said that simply swapping in a different adjuvant isn’t realistic.
“They’re kind of all built on one another,” she said. Once a vaccine has been proved to work and become the standard of care, new or updated versions are generally no longer tested against a placebo in people who should be getting that vaccine. Instead, they’re tested against the existing product, which means each approval rests on the one before it.
Core childhood vaccines would probably have to be reformulated, and large clinical trials would have to be repeated to prove the new products are safe and effective. Meanwhile, production gaps and shortages would have to be managed, potentially for years, while manufacturers and regulators start over — all while diseases such as whooping cough, hepatitis B, and HPV-related cancers gain more room to spread.
“The aluminum adjuvants have sort of hit the sweet spot in terms of being effective at inducing a robust antibody response that is protective for those vaccines in which they’re being used and being very safe,” HogenEsch said. “It would be quite frankly foolish to try to eliminate them.”
A century of safe use
The DTaP, hepatitis B, and HPV vaccines all contain aluminum adjuvants and have been in use for nearly a century. Large-scale studies show no link between aluminum and systemic allergic disease.
“We have had aluminum adjuvants in vaccines for decades,” Edwards said. “I have grandchildren. My grandchildren have received all of their vaccines. And I do not worry about the safety of them.”
If aluminum is falsely cast as the villain and vaccine uptake falls, experts warn, the consequences will not be theoretical: more measles in schools, more meningitis in college dorms, and more young adults dying of cancers that HPV shots could have prevented.
In their view, the real danger isn’t the trace amounts of a metal that children already encounter every day. It’s rolling back the protection aluminum-adjuvanted vaccines have provided for generations.
That’s the trade-off Offit hopes parents will see. “A choice not to get a vaccine is not a risk-free choice,” he said. “It’s just a choice to take a different risk.”

It’s just all the oxygen being sucked out of the Capitol by next year’s legislative bugaboo: school choice, or private school vouchers, or “education freedom,” depending on your worldview.
A pattern has firmed up nicely with Mississippi’s Legislature under the current Republican House and Senate leadership. And so far, this pattern has tended to gum up the works and kill off many initiatives at the Capitol. This year, it resulted in the Legislature accidentally passing a flawed, sea-change tax cut bill and ending its regular session without being able to pass a state budget.
The pattern:
House Speaker Jason White and his closest adherents, months out from the coming year’s legislative session, announce their main priorities and get to work with hearings and forums, to set the market when lawmakers gavel in in January. 
And these House priorities always include at least one doozy: Medicaid expansion White’s first year, then eliminating the income tax, and now, school choice. 
Meanwhile Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and his Senate leaders react to the House’s pre-session maneuvering with something along the lines of, “Um … yeah. We’ll take a look at all that. We’re not so sure we want to do that … but, we’ll see, maybe.”
Per the new pattern, Hosemann, usually well after White has announced the House priorities and with much less actual groundwork or public-facing hearings and such, comes out with something of a Senate priorities list.
And as the session nears, White and Hosemann don’t just appear like they’re from different political parties, but from different planes of existence.
Hosemann said he wants to focus on student absenteeism, raising teacher pay and the lack of affordable housing for first-time homebuyers (even though it’s unclear what the state, or state taxpayers, can do about that).
White said he wants an omnibus education reform package to reshape the state’s K-12 education system, with school-choice initiatives to allow public money to be spent on private schooling at the front and center of any plan.
Pender
White, by his own account, said he’s continuing to push “bold and uncomfortable” initiatives.
So far over the last few years, Hosemann has appeared to be the one most uncomfortable with White’s bold initiatives. 
And whatever the opposite of bold is, that’s how the Hosemann Senate priorities and out-of-session strat-e-gery come across. They’ve mostly been playing defense, parrying the House’s thrusts. They’ve been so busy being against what the House comes up with, they’ve had trouble figuring out stuff they’re for.
One longtime senator recently asked jokingly whether White could go ahead and provide the major themes he plans for the next few sessions so they could start fighting early.
The school-choice debate promises to overshadow the entire coming legislative session or, as mentioned above, sap all the oxygen from other issues – health care, infrastructure, you name it. During the 2025 session, the House-Senate standoff over income tax elimination killed much other legislation, including the state budget.
Is school choice the most pressing, clear-and-present issue facing Mississippi? That’s a fair question, but under the new legislative paradigm, it doesn’t matter. It’s the one about to get all the focus.

July 18, 2021 | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan AdvanceIn the wake of the 2025 election, where Democrats swept seats from gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia, to state legislature special elections in Mississippi, leaders on both sides of the aisle are vying for control of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2026. 
For Democrats, two seats in Michigan — the 7th District and the 10th District — could mark chances for big pickups in Michigan. Meanwhile, for Republicans, the 8th District, though it has stayed with the Democrats since 2018, would be the most likely seat for them to flip. 
The midterm elections are expected to be, in many ways, a referendum on President Donald Trump — some saw the 2025 results as a sweeping show of disapproval, and current polling from Reuters shows the same, with his approval rating sitting at 38 percent.

Michigan’s 7th Congressional District is expected to be one of the more competitive House races in 2026 — the seat has flipped in the last two elections, and is seen by many on both sides of the aisle as a key seat to hold for a majority in the House. 
While 2026 will not be a presidential election, the fact of Trump’s influence in this race will be felt.
Meanwhile in the 10th Congressional District, John James’ decision to run for governor and leave his seat open — a decision that was criticized by some in his party, as it leaves a potentially flippable seat without a Republican incumbent. 
He’s the second Michigan representative to leave his House seat for statewide office — Haley Stevens, who represents the 11th District, is leaving to run for Senate. But her seat is expected to be safe for the Democrats, paving the way for a competitive Democratic primary race.
Without James, that would be a major red flag to Republicans about their popularity in the state.
Here’s Michigan Advance’s breakdown of the race thus far, the support each candidate has received and fundraising totals as of the last filing deadline on Sept. 30.

A 64-year-old man in the Buchanan County jail has been waiting […],"In September, an average of 487 Missourians were waiting for a bed in a psychiatric hospital run by the department. The waitlist had grown by a third since September 2024 and almost 88% since September 2023 (Darrin Klimek/Getty Images).A 34-year-old man has been waiting 472 days in the Greene County jail for services and treatment from Missouri’s mental health department that could enable him to stand trial.
A 31-year-old man in the Jackson County jail has been waiting 445 days for treatment.
A 64-year-old man in the Buchanan County jail has been waiting 304 days.
None of these men have been convicted of the crime that landed them behind bars. They’ve been ordered to receive treatment by a court and instead  have languished in jail, part of a backlog of almost 500 people awaiting help from the Missouri Department of Mental Health, according to a federal class action lawsuit filed Monday.
The lawsuit, brought by the MacArthur Justice Center, ArchCity Defenders and the ACLU of Missouri, alleges the department has illegally denied timely evaluations and services to Missourians with mental health and cognitive disabilities who stand accused of crimes.
These individuals were arrested, deemed unable to stand trial and ordered into services designed to allow them to move their cases forward — a process called competency restoration.
“[The department] is knowingly derelict in its duty to these hundreds of Missourians, all of whom suffer while abandoned in county jails, some decompensating beyond restoration,” the lawsuit says.
When a court orders the department to evaluate a defendant, Missouri law requires the department to do so within 60 days. But Missourians “routinely” wait six months or longer to be evaluated, the lawsuit says.
Once the department has ruled someone incompetent to stand trial, Missouri law requires the department to take custody of the individual to receive restoration services in a “reasonable” time. But people who have been assessed to be incompetent spend an average of 14 months in jail before receiving treatment, according to the department.
The department on Monday declined a request from The Independent to comment. In previous statements, a spokeswoman for the department maintained that people on the waitlist are receiving help.
“All individuals on the waitlist receive services providing they are willing to participate,” said Debra Walker, spokesperson for the department, in an October email. 
Missouri’s Department of Mental Health building in Jefferson City (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The department has rolled out initiatives in recent months to help people move toward competency when there are no available beds in state psychiatric hospitals, including jail-based competency programs authorized by a 2023 state law. Since launching last year, 12 people have achieved competency after completing one of four pilot programs in St. Louis city and county, along with Jackson and Clay counties. More than 50 people have participated in these programs.
But the lawsuit argued jail-based services are a “non-solution,” indicating that services focus on coaching detainees “in hope that they will memorize the ‘correct’ answers” to the competency exam.
Amy Malinowski, an attorney from the MacArthur Center representing the plaintiffs, said jail-based treatment is a “contradiction in terms, because jails are not therapeutic environments.”
The lawsuit described a man in the St. Louis County jail who was arrested in May after wandering naked around a St. Louis airport terminal and knocking off a law enforcement officer’s eyeglasses. He lost access to his caseworker, treatment plan and medications when he was detained, the lawsuit states, and “he is not aware of where he is or why he is there.” He is waiting for an evaluation by the department.
People on the competency waitlist are typically housed in isolation. One plaintiff, who has been awaiting services in the St. Louis city jail for 252 days, is locked down in his cell between 23 and 24 hours a day, according to the lawsuit. He had not been allowed a single phone call during the nearly two years of his incarceration. 
“I think [the department] itself will acknowledge that being in a loud, noisy jail by yourself most of the time, for 23 hours a day, without access to medication, without access to a support system, is literally the worst thing you could do,” said Maureen Hanlon, an attorney from ArchCity Defenders who is also representing the plaintiffs.
The 2023 law also permitted outpatient treatment for individuals who could safely be released on bond. 
But the lawsuit describes that option as “grossly underutilized,” saying that only two people had been ordered into community-based restoration as of January.
The department has two small forensic mobile teams of clinicians who provide medication and case management to people on the waitlist, in-person or via telehealth.
The lawsuit quoted a jail operator who described these mobile teams as “a joke.” 
The department has long acknowledged the growing waitlist.
Dr. Jeanette Simmons, deputy director of the department, told The Independent in October that with a static number of state hospital beds and increasing numbers of competency evaluation requests from courts, the increasing backlog isn’t surprising.
“Our numbers have increased,” Simmons said. “We predicted that they would increase.”
In May, Valerie Huhn, the director of the department, warned the Missouri House Health and Mental Health Committee that the state could face litigation due to its competency waitlist.
Malinowski said the attorneys for the plaintiffs plan to call in experts, including former mental health directors from other states, to help forge a path forward.
“What are things that we can do as a state,” she said, “to ensure that the most vulnerable citizens aren’t being warehoused in jails for years while they wait for treatment?”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/prison.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Getty Images)New Jersey legislators on Monday took another step toward legalizing psilocybin, a hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms that supporters consider a breakthrough therapy bound to transform mental health treatment.
The Assembly health committee’s Democratic majority advanced a bill that would provide therapeutic access to psilocybin for adults over 21, despite some committee members questioning whether state action is needed because the Food and Drug Administration is expected to approve the use of synthetic psilocybin late next year.
The committee heard about an hour of testimony in Trenton from the bill’s supporters, who urged legislators to reject psilocybin’s reputation as a recreational drug and consider its promise in treating chronic psychiatric disorders more effectively than existing therapies.
“This bill really is a no-brainer. You should pass it,” said Neal Usatin of New Jersey for Fungi and Plant Medicine. “The clinical evidence in FDA trials is clear that psilocybin is not only safe and non-habit-forming, it treats depression, anxiety, OCD, addiction, and a number of other mental health indications more effectively than current therapies.”
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the drugs now commonly used to treat many mental health disorders, “aren’t doing enough,” said Jesse MacLachlan of Reason for Hope, a national suicide-prevention nonprofit that supports expanding access to psychedelic-assisted therapies.
“We see that in the form of a veteran suicide crisis, where 22 to 40 veterans are lost to either suicide or substance-related deaths every single day,” MacLachlan said. “And that drives our determination to make a change.”
He called psilocybin “the next great breakthrough in psychiatry.”
Stacy and Jeffrey Swanson, a married couple who both served in the military, testified on behalf of Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions. Stacy Swanson told lawmakers that psilocybin healed her husband’s mental health struggles after years of unsuccessful traditional remedies.
“His treatment was not recreational, and it was not a shortcut. It involved medical screening, preparation, supervision, integration before and afterward. Integration is what allowed him to process what he had carried for years. It reached the roots of trauma in a way that traditional treatment could not,” she said.
Since his treatment, the difference “has been steady and real,” she added.
“He sleeps. Our children feel safe. There is no alcohol numbing the pain. Our home is calm instead of reactive. He shows up in a way our family can feel and not just see. The man next to me is the same man I married, but without the constant internal battle,” she said.
The testimony proved persuasive to most of the panel, including Assemblywoman Melinda Kane (D-Camden), whose son Jeremy was a Marine killed in Afghanistan in 2010. She voted for the bill.
“I know that the loss my family has suffered is terrible,” Kane said. “I also know that there are more losses in our country to suicide than there are to combat deaths.”
Others, though, questioned why they should bother passing a bill, given that a drug manufacturer seeking FDA approval of its synthetic psilocybin is now in its third round of trials and anticipates approval in late 2026 or early 2027.
Assemblywoman Nancy Munoz (R-Middlesex) is a nurse and the Assembly’s minority budget officer. She pointed to $6 million in state funding the bill would allocate to carry out its provisions and abstained from the vote over her concerns for a “budget that is really tough.” The record-high $58.8 billion budget lawmakers approved in June included some deep and controversial cuts.
Assemblyman John Azzariti Jr. (R-Bergen), a physician anesthesiologist, also abstained, saying he preferred to wait until the FDA acts.
“If you’re making claims, you should have to prove those claims, those medical claims,” Azzariti said. “We should hold psychedelic medicines, psychedelic drugs, to the same standards as other medicines.”
The bill now goes to the Assembly’s appropriations committee for consideration. It has already passed two Senate committees and awaits a vote before both full chambers. Lawmakers have less than two months to act, with the current two-year legislative session set to end in January.

The Missouri National Education Association is challenging the state’s $50 million appropriation to MOScholars, a program overseen by the State Treasurer’s Office that provides scholarships for largely private and parochial schools. The teacher’s union is seeking to bar the treasurer from using any more of the appropriation, of which $38 million has already been spent.
“Defendants ask this court to close one eye, ignore portions of the MOScholar Act and the Missouri Constitution,” Loretta Haggard, the teacher’s union’s attorney, wrote in her pretrial brief. “And render a ruling promoting a policy that they seem to like — public dollars for private school vouchers.”
But the state says the use of state funds doesn’t harm MNEA or its members.
“This is a case about a lawful appropriation that helps millions of Missouri families secure a valuable education for their child,” Assistant Attorney General Peter Donahue told the judge Monday. “It harms no one.”
Donahue asked Cole County Circuit Court Judge Brian Stumpe to dismiss the case at the start of his arguments, citing a lack of standing and a mischaracterization of the MOScholars law.
“(The law) allows for the program to be funded by tax credit donations,” Donahue said. “It does not in any way restrict the funding to tax credits alone.”
The motion was denied. 
Parents intervene in Missouri voucher lawsuit with help from Herzog Foundation leader

Haggard called the law that created MOScholars a “tax-credit statute” — one revolving around tax-deductible donations and devoid of any mention of direct state appropriations.
“The MOScholars act does not ever mention the appropriation of general revenue,” she said. “There is no ambiguity in the MOScholars Act.”
The change from a program solely funded through tax-deductible donations to one that also pulls general revenue has altered its framework, Haggard argued. The treasurer’s office had to create a new dashboard online for parents to see the status of scholarships funded through general revenue, and a new process of invoicing started in August.
The process is not in state law or in the existing agreements with EAOs, she said. The change is “not written anywhere” apart from an emergency rule the state treasurer filed in July.
The rule adds a provision stating the “treasurer shall provide the certified (educational assistance organizations) the anticipated budget authority for the program year.”
Previously, the organizations reported their anticipated donations to the treasurer. But now, with the bulk of the funding coming from state appropriations, the number of scholarships leans on the will of lawmakers instead of organizations’ fundraising.
Haggard also points to the usage of the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts Fund, which is described in state law as “for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the scholarship program, whichever is less.” The treasurer’s fund descriptions on the state website also bear this definition.
That fund now is the vehicle to receive general revenue and then distribute it to schools.
“The MOScholars statute creates no authority for the state to transfer general revenue into the (Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts) Fund for scholarships,” Haggard said.
Donahue argued Monday that the statute lacks clear restrictions on general revenue being used for the program. And where there is ambiguity, case precedent presumes that a law is constitutional, he said.
“All they can point to is silence, simply statutory silence,” Donahue said. “It says nowhere that general revenue cannot be added to the structures of tax credits.”
 Donahue also pointed to another part of the law that specifies “monies in the fund shall be used solely by the state treasurer for the purposes of (this section).”
“(The law) says the fund is for the purpose of the MOScholars program,” Donahue said. “The purpose of the Missouri scholars program is to issue scholarships. Full stop.”
Before Stumpe can consider whether state law authorizes MOScholars to use general revenue, he first must determine whether MNEA and its plaintiffs have standing to challenge the appropriation.
MNEA says it has standing as an association, citing members’ opposition to public funding for private and religious schools. Haggard offered excerpts from the association’s 2025 representative assembly resolution as evidence, which Donahue objected to.
Although the state admitted to the document as true and accurate in pretrial filings, Donahue said it was irrelevant.
Haggard said the exhibit was intended to show that “members care about the issues in this lawsuit.”
“I would hate to get to the end of this case and not have shown that the trial is of interest to MNEA’s members,” she said.
Stumpe denied the exhibit. He is considering whether MNEA President Rebeka McIntosh, who is a plaintiff, can be presented as a witness.
McIntosh and MNEA Regional Director Kimberly Duvall also claim individual and taxpayer standing. The impact on taxpayers should be “assumed,” Haggard said, pointing to case precedent.
“All of the discussion of standing is a red herring,” she said.
Donahue said there was “no evidence of any concrete injury.”
“They lack any kind of standing, whether it be individual, associational or taxpayer standing,” he said.
MNEA concluded its arguments Monday. The case is scheduled to conclude Tuesday.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/112425_stumpe1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Photo by Douglas Sacha/Getty Images)Cigarette consumption in Indiana dropped 40% during the first three months of a long-sought tax increase, according to the Indiana Department of Health. Enrollment in the agency’s smoking cessation program jumped almost 40% over that time.
“[Cigarette] use impacts, really, every aspect of health,” said Miranda Spitznagle, director of IDOH’s Division of Tobacco Prevention and Cessation. But it’s a risk factor that is “fully preventable.”
Using taxes to raise the price of tobacco helps current users quit and may dissuade others from starting, Spitznagle said.
“It’s a huge policy factor for public health,” she added.
Senate, House reach final budget compromise

State legislators stuck a $2-per-pack hike into the two-year budget, House Enrolled Act 1001. They also proportionally increased taxes on electronic cigarettes and other tobacco products.
Spitznagle said that across-the-board approach prevents users from switching products instead of quitting or pulling back.
“This year, Indiana lawmakers stood up to Big Tobacco” by boosting the taxes, said Allie Kast Gregg, government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network.
But public health wasn’t the only motivation.
The Indiana Senate resisted for years, but in the wake of a dismal budget forecast, agreed to include the hikes in the budget’s final draft.
The boost to a nearly $3-a-pack tax on cigarettes went into effect July 1 is already paying off.
Indiana has collected $188 million in cigarette taxes from July through October, according to the State Budget Agency’s latest monthly revenue report. That’s almost three times the $68 million earned over that time period last year.


IDOH used the first three months of data — July, September and October — to calculate a 40% drop in consumption.
Meanwhile, Hoosiers are flocking to the state’s cessation help program, Quit Now Indiana.
“The month of July specifically, we doubled our enrollments,” Spitznagle said, compared to that month last year.
Participation was up 38% over those first three months.
Quit Now Indiana is up to eight times more effective than solo efforts, Spitznagle noted. Going it alone has a single-digit success rate, while the state program has a 32% quit rate.

Thousands of Hoosier deaths annually are attributable to smoking. An oft-cited CDC estimate from 2014 places the death toll at 11,000 a year.
Spitznagle said that for every one death, however, 30 people live with chronic health conditions linked to their smoking.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Some of Oklahoma’s largest police departments will change their protocols for responding to incidents on interstates amid a push by the Oklahoma Highway Patrol to try to force them to assume more responsibilities. 
Of the departments contacted by Oklahoma Voice, Oklahoma City, Edmond and Norman said their protocols will not change, meaning the Oklahoma Highway Patrol will need to respond to incidents along interstates in their jurisdiction. 
Only the Tulsa and Moore police departments said they have made changes to how they patrol interstates within their jurisdiction. 
A Tulsa police spokesperson said officers will respond to and investigate reports of non-injury collisions, crime, disabled vehicles, road debris and drunken drivers on the 42 miles of interstate in their jurisdiction. 
“If officers arrive and it is an injury collision, they will render aid until Troopers from the Oklahoma Highway Patrol arrive,” said a spokesperson for the Tulsa Police Department in a statement. “We will respond to everything but fatality collisions, injury collisions, and collisions involving large (commercial motor vehicles).”
Moore Police Chief Todd Gibson said in a statement that officers have “proactively” been assisting Highway Patrol with motor vehicle accidents and traffic response with a “comprehensive plan” along the 5.5 miles of Interstate 35 that cuts through city limits.
This plan includes deploying Moore police when the Highway Patrol’s estimated arrival time exceeds 15 minutes, conducting ongoing training focused on highway safety for officers and continuing to provide fire and medical response to accidents, according to a statement.
Oklahoma City Police will render medical aid and handle motorist assists and DUIs if an officer comes across those incidents on the interstates, but will refer all crashes to the Highway Patrol which does not differ from current protocol. Over 100 miles of interstates cross through the city limits. 
Del City and Midwest City police did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.
In July, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol announced plans to move its resources out of the state’s urban areas by Nov. 1 and shift responsibility for the interstates and highways within those jurisdictions to local law enforcement. The agency said it would refocus those on areas with the “greatest need” outside of Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Edmond, Moore, Norman, Midwest City and Del City. The agency said it would prioritize areas covered by smaller law enforcement footprints. 
The plan drew immediate pushback from leaders within those urban areas, and Attorney General Gentner Drummond later found the plan to be illegal. Drummond said the Highway Patrol cannot make “the arbitrary decision to foist its responsibility” onto the municipal and county law enforcement in certain counties, and that state law vests it with the primary authority to patrol interstates.
Over 1.4 million people, or over a third of the state’s population, reside in those seven cities, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
Public Safety Commissioner Tim Tipton said the plan was never to “abandon” the metros, but to stretch the Highway Patrol’s coverage in the state. 
He said the Highway Patrol has asked the metros to assist with calls within city limits and has had “great support.” 
“It’s important that we have troopers out 24/7 on the interstate system, hopefully to deter bad driving, speed, dangerous driving behavior, and to be able to respond, especially in those areas where there’s no other law enforcement anywhere around,” he said. “Both here in the Oklahoma City metro area and in the Tulsa metro area, we’ve got great partnerships with those local (police departments) that when they’re available, they help us with those more minor collisions, and they’ve been doing that.”
He said sharing the responsibility for responding to calls on the interstates allows his agency to “stretch” their coverage.

Alex Dallman speaks at a press conference in June  that was livestreamed by WisconsinEye. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)WisconsinEye — the independent, nonprofit service that provides coverage of Wisconsin state government similar to C-Span — is set to halt its coverage on Dec. 15 without sufficient funding and is turning to lawmakers as well as donors for help.
The service’s coverage includes livestreams of committee hearings, floor sessions and press conferences. It also has an extensive video archive of more than 30,000 hours of state government proceedings, candidate interviews and other programming. 
“We operate on a shoestring budget, but we exceed our contractual agreement with the Legislature,” WisconsinEye President Jon Henkes said, noting that they are required to cover all floor sessions as well as a certain percentage of committee hearings. “For 18 years, we have far exceeded those expectations and requirements, so we’re doing a remarkable job.”
All of that could stop — live coverage eliminated and the video archive at risk of going offline — if the organization doesn’t raise $887,000, enough to cover its 2026 annual budget, it warns in a popup message on its website. In a November press release, the organization warned of this possibility.
“It’s clear to us that the current funding model is not working. We can continue to knock on doors. We continue to connect with potential donors,” Henkes said. “The fact is by the end of December, we will run out of money — and that is the reason why we sounded the alarm a week ago — if we cannot bridge this gap in the short term.”
Since starting in 2007, WisconsinEye has operated independently with the majority of its funding coming from charitable, nonprofit donations. Henkes said that the organization, similar to other nonprofits, has faced a tough fundraising environment since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
He said there has been “a very palpable donor skittishness” due to economic uncertainty and an increase in competitiveness as nonprofits that were more dormant during the pandemic have reemerged.
“We’re such a small nonprofit, relatively young in the world of philanthropy, we’re never first in line. We’re lucky to be third in line at times,” Henkes said.
“We are not grounded and deeply rooted in a local community meeting basic human needs,” he continued. “We’re not feeding the homeless, we’re not providing shelter, we’re not disaster relief… then we’re also faced with a recent trend, which is record-breaking political fundraising, so donors who are interested in the inputs and outcomes of government are more inclined to give to candidates, campaigns and causes, but yet they put WisconsinEye into that same general bucket of politics, and we’ve got to fight our way through that fog, because that’s not us. We don’t advocate. We’re the neutral ground.”
Henkes said WisconsinEye is continuing to make inquiries and raising $250,000 could get the organization through the first quarter of 2026.
As first reported by WisPolitics, the organization is also looking to the Legislature for assistance. 
The state has provided grant funding on a few occasions, including during the pandemic. In the 2025-27 state budget, Wisconsin lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers extended WisconsinEye’s opportunity to access $10 million in state funds to build a permanent endowment fund until June 2026. 
The state had initially set aside the money in the previous budget, which required WisconsinEye to raise the entire $10 million in order to get the state-funded match. The organization wasn’t able to access the state’s portion because it didn’t meet the full amount.
In the new budget, the organization is able to collect the state portion on a dollar-by-dollar basis that matches WisconsinEye’s own fundraising.
Currently, $250,000 is available with no match requirement. That will cover expenses through Dec. 15.
The organization can receive the other $9.75 million if it raises an equal amount from private sources. Henkes said that those match dollars would not help with current operating costs, however.
“We could raise a half million dollars and the state would match that, but those dollars, by law, then would have to go into an endowment account — could not be spent for operating current budget needs, and could only be used as the income off of that investment is generated,” Henkes said. “Really, in a sense, we are competing against ourselves.” 
However, even still, Henkes says the organization has made “well qualified, well cultivated” donation requests totaling more than $9 million. None of those requests have led to donations.
“We’re trying to raise money for the operating budget. At the same time, we’ve got this wonderful opportunity to raise $10 million to create a $20 million endowment, which would solve the funding need once and for all,” Henkes said. “The priority right now is meeting month-to-month obligations and keeping the lights on, and not losing staff and having to rebuild if we do lose staff, so the pressure is on us right now.”
The organization is turning to Wisconsin lawmakers for some help with addressing its funding gaps by eliminating the match requirement or finding a way to release some of the state funding to support its operating budget.
In a letter to lawmakers, WisconsinEye identified three alternative routes they could take:

Provide annual funding of $1 million dollars per year to fund and maintain WisconsinEye’s live and produced content; 
Provide $1 million per year for each of the next three years, carrying WisconsinEye through the 2027-28 budget cycle; 
 Provide $1 million for 2026 and have the next Legislature consider the 2027-28 WisconsinEye Budget Request. 

Under the third option, the 2027-28 session would not be broadcast until funds are appropriated.
Henkes said he and the rest of WisconsinEye’s management are hopeful that lawmakers will be open to helping. He said there are many champions and supporters of WisconsinEye in the Legislature, including Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton). He also noted that bipartisan effort led lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers during the budget process to extend the availability of the $10 million. 
“This is not like we’re asking for new money. This money has already been earmarked for WisconsinEye. We’re simply asking for release of those funds, or part of those funds, in a way different from the endowment,” Henkes said. “The best case scenario would be if the Legislature would release a minimum of one year, so $1 million, essentially to carry us forward, and we can focus 100% over the next several months through June, to really hammer down and see if we can’t raise some endowment dollars. We think that’s a very viable option, and we’re hopeful.” 
Henkes said WisconsinEye provides accountability for the state government — providing a view of how decisions are made that affect every citizen and community. He said that is the message the fundraising team is taking to potential donors. 
“There’s this current cry out there right now — and a legitimate cry — to save our democracy, and that is a painting that is being colored by different voices,” Henkes said. “Some of those voices are saying we need election integrity. Those who are eligible to vote should have every opportunity, and we need to guard against those who don’t. We need to guard against gerrymandered legislative districts. We need to tone down the partisan rhetoric and all this negative campaign stuff.” 
WisconsinEye is able to meet those demands, he argued. 
“At the heart of all that is WisconsinEye and providing transparency and access to what really happens,” Henkes said. “What we are is a network where truth takes its rightful place. If you really want to know what happened, without partisan spin, without sensational headlines, then you come to WisconsinEye.”

Idahoans United for Women and Families announced last week that the group has collected more than 50,000 signatures so far — out of the nearly 71,000 signatures needed.
The ballot initiative, a power outlined in Idaho’s constitution, allows voters to propose their own policies that carry the power of law — if approved by a majority vote. 
The group hopes to qualify the initiative, which would end Idaho’s near-total abortion ban and add protections for reproductive rights, for the November 2026 election. 
“Crossing the 50,000 signature threshold is both a celebration and a clear signal that Idahoans want their voices heard,” Idahoans United for Women and Families’ Executive Director Melanie Folwell said in a statement. “Every signature is a reminder that these decisions belong with patients and their doctors, not with politicians.”
On Saturday, the group plans to host its largest signature gathering effort with events at dozens of small businesses across Idaho.

Through operation targeting undocumented truck drivers and local arrests, sheriff estimates 70 people in Laramie County have been placed into ICE custody since October. 
The post Laramie County sheriff’s deputies making more immigration arrests around Wyoming’s largest city appeared first on WyoFile .","Since announcing two months ago that he and 25 of his deputies would participate in federal immigration enforcement, Laramie County Sheriff Brian Kozak has led a crackdown on undocumented people in and around Wyoming’s largest city.
Kozak announced in October that a significant portion of his roughly 170 commissioned officers had received federal training under a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement program that enlists local law enforcement in the search for people illegally in the country. 
This week, through a well-publicized operation targeting undocumented truckers, and through comments he made to WyoFile, Kozak revealed the arrest of as many as 70 undocumented immigrants in his county within the last two months.
On Friday, Kozak announced that alongside agents from ICE and the Wyoming Highway Patrol, which is also contracting with the federal immigration agency, he and his deputies had helped arrest 40 undocumented truck drivers over a three-day sweep last week.
Then on Monday, Kozak told WyoFile those arrests came in addition to around 30 people who, since Oct. 1, have been pulled over by his deputies, found to be undocumented and handed over to ICE.
It’s a notable number of people picked up for deportation out of one Wyoming county — though the truck drivers were not living locally — and likely marks the most concentrated immigration enforcement operations in the state during President Donald Trump’s second administration.
The enforcement is making Laramie County, Wyoming and the country safer, Kozak has maintained. “Most definitely their focus is people who are a danger to the community,” he said of ICE officials. 
But it’s unclear how many of the people detained in Laramie County are the type of hardened criminals both Kozak and Trump administration officials say they’re prioritizing for deportation.
“We were sold that with this doubling down on immigration enforcement they’d be trying to get the worst of the worst off the street,” Janna Farley, a spokesperson for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming, told WyoFile on Monday. So far, she said, it seemed the sheriff’s department and its enforcement partners were casting a much wider net in a county that’s home to Wyoming’s most populous city.

In a press release touting the trucking enforcement operation, Kozak referred to the 40 drivers arrested as “criminal aliens.” In a video posted to his department’s Facebook account, the sheriff said those drivers were now awaiting deportation. In immigration court proceedings, however, detainees have a range of legal reasons for which they may seek asylum in the country. Kozak also noted that two of the drivers arrested had accumulated serious criminal convictions unrelated to their immigration status, including larceny and aggravated assault. 
In a Monday interview, he added a third person to that list of people with criminal convictions, and said every person detained during the immigration was pulled over on suspicion of one crime or another. 
“We were pulling over for obvious violations,” the sheriff said Monday. He cited broken or missing safety lights and speeding, as well as violations that made trucks less safe on the roadways. There were 45 brake violations found, 16 issues with commercial drivers licenses and 10 violations of English language proficiency rules that the Trump administration has ordered stricter enforcement of, according to a statement issued Monday by the Wyoming Highway Patrol. 
National immigration arrest numbers, including the numbers for Wyoming and Colorado through this past summer, show that the majority of people detained by ICE do not have criminal convictions. 
Though the exact number of stops conducted by the different agencies was hard to pin down because some reporting may have overlapped, Kozak estimated officers conducted more than 190 traffic stops over the three-day operation. Based on that number, the percentage of drivers ICE agents determined to be undocumented was relatively high, Kozak noted, as was the overall number of violations.  
“I was completely surprised by the number of unlicensed, undocumented drivers and unsafe trucks,” he said. “We have a big problem in our country.”

The proportion of violators may have been buoyed by the operation’s focus which, according to Kozak, was on trucks that were traveling roads that commercial drivers would use to avoid the heavily-enforced Interstate 80 corridor.
Wyoming Highway Patrol officials touted the operation slightly differently in its statement, which was headlined: “Three Day Multi-Agency Operation Leads To Multiple Arrests, Commercial Carrier Safety Violations.” WHP officials indicated in the statement that inspections made by their officers had led to 12 immigration arrests.
Kozak’s Facebook video, on the other hand, headlined that Operation Safe Haul “targeted undocumented truck drivers,” resulting in “40 ICE deportations.” Detractors, like Farley with the ACLU, say that’s in keeping with what they describe as mixed messaging throughout Kozak’s enhanced cooperation with ICE. 
In October, when Kozak announced his enrollment in what is commonly referred to as a 287(g) agreement with ICE (named after the federal statute allowing for the arrangement), the sheriff said that “Wyoming does not want to be a sanctuary state for those that ignore our laws.” 
In joining the federal government’s crackdown, and doing so with an unprecedented number of deputized officers for a Wyoming law enforcement agency, Kozak aligned his department with state politicians who have called for increased immigration enforcement by local officers traditionally entrusted to enforce state, rather than federal, law. But at the same time, he emphasized in the 287(g) announcement that his deputies “will not proactively engage in immigration enforcement.” 
He pledged not to engage in racial profiling or overzealous immigration enforcement. 
“We affirmed our pledge to obey and enforce the United States Constitution which prohibits any type of profiling or discrimination based upon race, language, ethnicity or perceived immigration status,” Kozak said during the October announcement.
Kozak also highlighted that he was likely the first commanding officer of a local law enforcement agency to complete the ICE training himself. 
Kozak has been no stranger to the spotlight since first being elected sheriff in 2022, with his department purchasing a Denver billboard in 2024 to suggest Colorado law enforcement would be better off working in more conservative Wyoming. Earlier this year, he hung a flashing “vacancy” sign, in the manner of a roadside motel, above his jailhouse door, an effort, he said at the time, to tout that his jail has plenty of space for alleged lawbreakers, including federal detainees. 
On Monday, Kozak told WyoFile he’s holding to the promises he made when starting the 287(g) program. “We have never gone to someone’s house or place of employment,” seeking someone because of their immigration status, he said. The vast majority of the 30 people he estimated his deputies detained on behalf of ICE were first contacted during a traffic stop on suspicion of a crime, he said.
But those crimes can vary in severity, Kozak noted. His agency is asking for local prosecutors to file criminal charges against someone detained with a felony that implies a public safety threat, like a DUI, he said. But other people are being stopped on suspicion of a traffic violation, like speeding, and they’re being handed over to ICE for deportation proceedings once their immigration status comes into question. 
“We don’t want our local court holding them up,” by adjudicating a Wyoming misdemeanor charge, Kozak said. “We will not charge the local crime and (instead) book them into the immigration process.”
To immigration and civil liberty advocates, Kozak is describing the type of enforcement that has long driven allegations that the 287(g) program invites racial profiling into communities. 
“It really is what we’ve been talking about and what people within the community are afraid of,” Farley said. “We don’t know why someone was being targeted for a traffic violation, and hopefully it wasn’t racially motivated — as in someone seeing a brown person and then ‘oh, it just so happens you see their brake light was out.’” 
In response to questions about the possibility that critics would perceive racial profiling during Operation Safe Haul, Kozak noted that a number of truck drivers cited for safety violations were citizens or otherwise legally in the country. “We stopped any violation and we enforced all laws,” he said.

After years of federal efforts to revive nuclear power, old mines are stirring again in Wyoming, Texas and Arizona, while new ones line up for permitting expedited by a Trump executive order.
The post Western states brace for a uranium boom as nation looks to recharge nuclear power industry appeared first on WyoFile .","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.

BAIROIL—The remote dirt road through dusty fields of sagebrush that John Cash drove along in June seemed to pass little of economic value. But his car was, in fact, rattling towards the top-producing uranium mine in Wyoming. 
In 2022, the Lost Creek Mine became the first of several such sites across the West to restart operations as the U.S. scrambles to reestablish a domestic supply chain for nuclear fuel. 
Cash, the CEO of UR Energy, which operates the Lost Creek Mine, believes more mines will come online in the years ahead.
“This [area] is loaded with uranium,” he said amid the vast, arid expanse of Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin. “I promise you right now, if I drilled a hole right here, we would hit uranium.”

Newly revived mines are also humming in Texas and Arizona, their owners hopeful that a boom in demand lies ahead. Ten uranium mines operate in the country today, up from three in 2021, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Agency. Company announcements and public records show dozens of others on standby for reopening or queued up for permitting in Colorado, Utah and New Mexico, with at least four currently fast-tracked for approval under recent executive orders. 
“We’re right at the edge of a good little uranium mining boom,” said Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association. “We’ve been off the playing field for decades on some of this stuff.”
For more than a generation, many of these sites sat dormant, stifled by a cheaper imported supply and modest demand from a stagnant nuclear power sector. However, uranium markets have recently reawakened: Spot prices doubled between 2022 and 2024, driven by global supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tension and lofty expectations for a renaissance of American atomic power. 
Lately, a buzzing landscape of nuclear startups has stirred excitement with announcements of ambitious plans for advanced reactors to power artificial intelligence and other heavy industries across the country. But almost all of these companies are waiting for the U.S. to rebuild a nuclear fuel supply chain before they can even power up their prototype units. 
“Expectations for uranium demand have been growing,” said William Freebairn, an associate editorial director at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “But this kind of demand is slow to show up.”
Investor appetite for uranium started to increase around 2022, he said, “as climate concerns became more prominent.” Uranium is processed and enriched into nuclear fuel that provides abundant energy without carbon emissions, although it poses other significant health and safety risks. 
Presidential administrations since Barack Obama’s have pushed to increase domestic production of uranium fuel to supply the national nuclear sector, but that goal remains years away. President Donald Trump issued a flurry of executive orders this year to streamline permitting, expedite environmental reviews and impose tariffs on imports that compete with American products. 
Despite the recent activity, the U.S. still has a long way to go before it could even come close to meeting its nuclear needs with uranium from domestic mines, Freebairn said. 

Unlike pit mines, which scrape away acres of earth, most modern uranium extraction projects drill hundreds of wells, inject them with solvents and suck up the mineral slurry they create. This method has a much lighter impact on the surface but can contaminate or deplete freshwater aquifers if improperly managed. 
In Wyoming, several hundred wells churn out a modest 28,000 pounds of uranium oxide per month at the Lost Creek mine. The mine is licensed to produce more than 1.2 million pounds of uranium oxide concentrate annually, according to UR Energy, but uranium miners are still waiting for the development of a domestic nuclear supply chain before ramping up production.
Supply chain bottleneck 
For now, American uranium production remains a dribble. Despite recent steep increases, total output in 2024 was less than 2% of the country’s peak production in 1981. The U.S. lacks the infrastructure to transform uranium oxide concentrate, known in the industry as “yellowcake,” into the uranium hexafluoride gas used for enrichment. About 99% of the feedstock consumed by U.S. power plants is imported, and much of that uranium is enriched in Russia, despite the prohibition on importing Russian uranium that then-President Joe Biden signed in May 2024. The ban doesn’t fully go into effect until 2028.
“Uranium mining, uranium processing and uranium enrichment have all largely been offshored because they could do it cheaper,” said Rusty Towell, director of the Nuclear Energy Experimental Testing Laboratory at Abilene Christian University. “That whole supply chain was weakened.”
After uranium is extracted from the formation, it goes through a series of binding and refining processes before it is turned into yellowcake. (Jake Bolster/Inside Climate News)
In the U.S., just one commercial plant converts uranium into the gaseous form required for enrichment and only one commercial plant enriches that gas into nuclear fuel at the scale required to fuel power plants. No facility can produce significant volumes of the higher-grade fuel used by new reactor designs — High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium, or HALEU. That also comes primarily from Russia, though the Department of Energy has posted billions in grant funding for private-sector enrichment projects in the U.S. 
“The U.S. [government] is moving very fast on this,” said James Walker, CEO of a startup called Nano Nuclear Energy and a former nuclear engineer at the U.K. Ministry of Defense. “Now the pressure is on everybody to ramp up as fast as they can.”
A whole cluster of advanced nuclear startups like Nano eagerly awaits the availability of American HALEU to begin testing their reactors, and they’ll purchase the new enrichment facilities’ product as soon as it becomes available, Walker said. 

However, even a booming domestic market for nuclear fuel doesn’t guarantee that American uranium miners will supply the needed raw material. New enrichment projects could continue to import uranium mined overseas — but government policies are making that harder, including with the Biden administration’s ban on imports of Russian uranium.
“We are making investments to build out a secure nuclear fuel supply chain here in the United States,” the announcement of that ban stated.
This year, Trump imposed tariffs on imports from 70 countries, including the top uranium producers: Kazakhstan, Canada and Namibia. 
“As long as we’re keeping that foreign uranium from coming in, then I think there is hope for domestic production,” said Brent Elliott, a geologist with the Bureau of Economic Geology at the University of Texas. But if “we can get it cheaper somewhere else, then that will more likely be the case.”
A flurry of new mines
In Wyoming, home to the nation’s richest known uranium deposits, three other companies have recently joined UR Energy in ramping up operations. To the south, in far western Colorado, Canadian firm Anfield Energy announced plans in August to begin exploratory drilling at an abandoned, 2000-acre uranium pit mine. 
As the price of uranium has increased, UR Energy has drilled more wells. (Jake Bolster/Inside Climate News)
In Utah, Anfield’s Velvet-Wood project received an expedited environmental review that lasted just two weeks due to a March executive order from the White House. 
“This approval marks a turning point,” said Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in a press release at the time. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries.”
The reviews of several mines in western New Mexico were also fast-tracked and are expected to conclude in late 2027. They include the Crownpoint-Church Rock and La Jara Mesa projects by Australian miner Laramide Resources, as well as Energy Fuels’ Roca Honda project in the Cibola National Forest. 
On federal lands, where many of the reopened mines are located, digs for minerals are still governed by the Mining Act of 1872. Originally passed to draw settlers to the West, it declares all mineral deposits “free and open to exploration and purchase.” The law has enabled some mines to open in areas that are culturally important to tribes, critical habitat for vulnerable species or revered for recreational and scenic values, often over local opposition.
Some of the fast-tracked New Mexico mines border the lands of the Acoma and Laguna pueblos. In the nearby Navajo Nation, the new activity has sparked concern. 
The Navajo Nation “continues to be affected — not only from abandoned uranium mines and mill sites — but also from other contaminants,” said Perry Charley, chair of the Diné Uranium Remediation Advisory Commission, at a public meeting in August in Shiprock, New Mexico.
From 1944 to 1986, mining activities left more than 500 abandoned mines and an enormous amount of uranium waste in various regions of Navajo land.

Numerous peer-reviewed studies of the Navajo Nation have shown widespread groundwater contamination by uranium, as well as other elements released by the mining process, including arsenic, vanadium, manganese and lithium.
“Though uranium mining ceased on the Navajo Nation in 1986, the contamination left from these operations still represents a significant danger,” said a study from 2019. 
Recent studies have linked proximity to abandoned uranium mines with increased risks of autoimmune and cardiovascular diseases on the Navajo Nation. Uranium concentrations in urine samples of Navajo women are almost three times higher than the national median and are associated with significantly increased risks of preterm births, according to studies in 2020 and 2023. 
Navajo people’s cancer diagnosis rate is 6.3 times higher for gallbladder cancer, 3.2 times higher for stomach cancer, 1.9 times higher for kidney cancer and 1.8 times higher for liver cancer than white populations in New Mexico and Arizona, according to a 2023 report from the Navajo Epidemiology Center.
On the eastern edge of Navajo land, at the Church Rock site, a dam failure in 1979 released 94 million gallons of waste fluids into the Rio Puerco, the largest radioactive material spill in U.S. history. Church Rock is among the sites currently undergoing expedited environmental review to resume production.
“These communities are still trying to clean up from the last time this happened,” said Amber Reimondo, the energy director at the Grand Canyon Trust, a nonprofit advocating for protection of the Grand Canyon and Colorado Plateau. “For years, tribes have been reassured that the problems of the past are just that — problems of the past — and that now we have environmental laws that are supposedly protecting them.”
At the Navajo reservation’s western edge, uranium production began last year at the Pinyon Plain Mine, nestled among pinyon pine trees in the Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni National Monument, less than 20 miles from the Grand Canyon’s south rim in Arizona.

The mine operator, Energy Fuels, began trucking its uranium product through Navajo territory in July 2024, but was forced to stop after the tribal government issued an order banning unauthorized transport of radioactive material. 
“Anyone bringing those substances onto the Nation should undertake that activity with respect and sensitivity to the psychological impact to our people, as well as the trauma of uranium development that our community continues to live with every day,” former Navajo Nation Attorney General Ethel Branch said in a statement at the time. 
Later, the tribal government and Energy Fuels negotiated an agreement to resume transport of uranium from the Pinyon Plain Mine across the Navajo lands. 
“Energy Fuels is pursuing an aggressive plan to quickly increase short-term U.S. uranium supply,” company CEO Mark Chalmers said in a press release this year announcing record production at Pinyon Plain. 
Energy Fuels did not respond to requests for comment. The company has a long list of mines it’s working to bring back online across Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, according to public announcements. 
Groundwater concerns
Permitted in 1986, the 14-acre Pinyon Plain Mine sat dormant for decades, like hundreds of other sites in the country, waiting for uranium prices to rebound. When they did, the U.S. Forest Service cleared it to begin operations for the first time last year, although it last cleared federal environmental review almost 40 years ago. The decision prompted protests from local tribes, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs and Attorney General Kris Mayes.
“We must protect the water supplies,” Mayes said in an August 2024 statement calling for reevaluation of the mine. “The risks are too great to ignore.”
The site contains a single mine shaft extending 1,470 feet down to the uranium deposits, and the company removed millions of gallons of groundwater to access the ore. The mine and others like it pose threats to the region’s network of interconnected aquifers that stretches across the Grand Canyon region, according to research published last year by Karl Karlstrom and Laura Crossey, Emeritus professors of earth science at the University of New Mexico. 
“Energy Fuels doesn’t know how much their mining is contaminating the deep aquifer, and USGS doesn’t know, and we don’t know,” Karlstrom said. “Caution is needed.”

In an interview, both researchers said the Pinyon Plain mining plan assumes that two underlying formations holding water, the upper Coconino aquifer and the lower Redwall-Mauv aquifer, aren’t connected. But ample regional science shows that’s not true, they said; water moves between them. 
The Redwall-Mauv aquifer feeds springs across the region, some of which provide drinking water for the Havasupai Tribe. 
“Current well data are insufficient to rule out a connection between the two aquifers,” wrote the Environmental Protection Agency in a review of the mine following Karlstrom and Crossey’s study. But the agency noted that USGS data from the mine’s well sites show elevated levels of uranium and arsenic contamination, and that it is unclear how or if it will spread.
“The potential for groundwater contamination resulting from operations at the Pinyon Plain Mine site cannot be assessed fully without additional investigations,” the EPA review concluded.
The uranium mining revival has churned up similar concerns in the savannah of South Texas. Encore Energy, based in the Gulf Coast city of Corpus Christi, started production at its Rosita site in November 2023 and its Alta Mesa site in June 2024. In August, it acquired 5,900 more acres adjacent to Alta Mesa, where it plans to begin drilling in October. Another Corpus Christi-based company, Uranium Energy Corp., expects to start mining at its South Texas sites in early 2026. 
One rural groundwater conservation district is fighting the renewal of an old, unused mining permit UEC holds for a site in Goliad County. 
“We are extremely concerned that UEC’s uranium mining activities will lead to groundwater contamination,” said a request for a hearing on the mine permits filed by the district with Texas’ environmental regulator late last year. 
Faultlines and abandoned oil wells connect the mining area to freshwater aquifers, the district claims. Some 30 households, a church and about 400 cattle drink from wells in the area surrounding the mine. Groundwater levels there dropped 15 feet between 2000 and 2022, the district said. 
The Goliad site will use about 130 million gallons per year, according to Art Dohmann, vice president of the Goliad County Groundwater Conservation District. But mining is exempt from groundwater permitting requirements under Texas law, he said. 
“This may cause more wells in the area to go dry,” the district wrote in comments to the state. 
In August, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality voted unanimously to grant the district’s request for a hearing on the permit. UEC did not respond to requests for comment. 
Separate state permits authorize UEC to inject up to 105 million gallons of mining wastewater underground for disposal every year at its Goliad site. UEC has four other projects under development in South Texas. 
The company, which calls itself “America’s largest and fastest growing supplier of uranium,” also owns sites in New Mexico and Wyoming, where its Christensen Ranch mine began production last summer and its Sweetwater Uranium Complex was selected in August for the fast-tracked approval authorized by President Trump’s executive order.

UEC calls Sweetwater “the largest uranium complex in the U.S.” It encompasses 20,000 acres of exploration and mining rights in Wyoming’s Great Divide Basin, and sits only a few miles from UR Energy’s Lost Creek Mine, where Cash, UR Energy’s CEO, was surveying his company’s project.Before UEC can even develop the site, the expedited review is expected to take 18 months, according to a federal permitting tracker.
Drilling uranium 
On a hot morning in June, three men and a 25-foot-tall winch pulled piping from the ground at the Lost Creek mine in Wyoming. They had just completed a new uranium well.
Cash, a trim man with brown hair lightly graying on the sides, inspected a slab of wood containing samples of wet earth taken every five feet down the well. A chunk he scooped up was a deep green, indicating it probably contained uranium.
“For a geologist, it’s like reading a book,” said Cash, who has a master’s degree in geology and geophysics from Missouri University of Science and Technology.
Lost Creek extracts uranium using in-situ recovery — ISR mining — a process pioneered in Wyoming in the 1960s. Over the eons, water carried uranium off the granite mountains surrounding the Great Divide Basin, burying it in the sandstone. Water is now used to draw it back out. The company drills wells patterned like the five sides of dice and then injects a leachate — water, oxygen, CO2 and occasionally soda ash at UR-Energy’s project, according to Cash — into the exterior four shafts. When that stew is pumped back to the surface through the center pipe, it’s full of uranium. 
Wells’ surface impacts bother Cash, he said, looking out over the site. “I wish we could do this with less disturbance.”
But if this were an open-pit mine, a crater would displace the vegetation on the surface and “this would all be gone in perpetuity,” he added. Instead, the company will replant native sagebrush and grasses, Cash said.

Hundreds of wells surrounded the site’s processing facility — a concrete and steel warehouse where employees wearing radiation-monitoring badges oversee chemical processes that turn uranium-filled slurry into yellowcake, the base ingredient of nuclear fuel.
Water that isn’t reused, about 21,600 gallons a day, according to Cash, is treated and disposed of underground.
Lost Creek has detected groundwater contaminated by what the company injects — moving “where it shouldn’t move” — four or five times since 2013, Cash said. If left alone, it could spread to freshwater sources. This is “exceedingly rare,” and each time it has happened, UR Energy has successfully prevented an escape, he said.
Employee and environmental safety are among Cash’s top concerns, but he feels U.S. nuclear regulations often hamper innovation and curb profit margins. He chaffed at the fact that UR Energy was required to install and maintain a full-blown weather station at Lost Creek, and wondered why his company had to take groundwater that was already undrinkable and make it slightly cleaner, but still unpotable, before disposal.
“We need to be protective,” he said. “But we don’t need to be hyper-protective.” 
Cash left Lost Creek for another UR Energy project, which would revive the Shirley Basin mine some 80 miles east at the foot of the Laramie Range. On his way that June day, he passed another potential mine, the Lost Soldier project, a claim he isn’t sure the company will ever develop. 
“There’s a lot more work we need to do,” Cash said.

Ron Richard was a Wyoming author and actor who lived more than eight years after a lung transplant, recalls columnist Kerry Drake.
The post Thanksgiving memories of a talented and funny friend appeared first on WyoFile .","Friends are the folks in our lives who lift our spirits and help keep us sane. And Thanksgiving is one of the best times to be with them.

Opinion

I’ve always looked forward to the holiday because, on most occasions for the past two decades, my wife Corryne and I spent it in the company of Ron Richard and Pat Greiner of Casper, who hosted dinner for several of their friends. They “adopted” us even though we were very close in age.
This year’s dinner will be different, because it’s the first time Ron won’t be there. We all felt lucky to have him for another eight years after he received a lung transplant, but his new lung started to fail and he died on June 5.
I’m sure we’ll make many toasts to Ron, a truly gifted and gentle soul, and share some memories. These are mine, paired with some favorite moments Pat told me about in a recent conversation.
I’ll always remember Ron as an entertainer. We first met the couple at Stage III, Casper’s community theater, where they were always the highlights of any show they were in. Corryne and I felt grateful to be in several casts with them, because they were so funny, talented and dedicated to their craft.


Pat and Ron were friends for 20 years before the relationship turned romantic. Pat recalls it happened when they were rehearsing for “The Owl and the Pussycat.” They kissed so long in one scene that their director literally had to break it up.
“He said, ‘Uh, that’s probably long [pause] — that’s long enough!” Pat recalled, laughing.
Pat said the acting bug bit Ron when he was taking photos at a Casper College theater rehearsal, and was fascinated watching the director coach an actor through a scene who wasn’t getting it. “He thought, ‘I understand that, I could do that,’” Pat said. “He didn’t spend a lot of time doing small roles. Once he jumped in, he was good from the start.”
In 2006, Stage III performed “The Laramie Project,” the story of how the university town coped after the 1998 murder of student Matthew Shepard, who was gay. His death helped galvanize the movement for LGBTQ+ equal rights, and the play has been performed worldwide.
Matthew Shepard had appeared in Stage III plays, and I know that made playing his father, Dennis Shepard, an emotional time for Ron. I didn’t know the young man, but I covered his story and had a small role in the play where I relived a scene reporting about his funeral.
There is a powerful moment in the play where Dennis Shepard addresses one of the killers and tells him about his son. Those of us backstage could look through peepholes, and during all eight shows, my eyes were riveted on Ron. I couldn’t get through the scene without crying. I think it was because I couldn’t cry in court when that speech was made, but watching Ron was a cathartic moment for me. And he was brilliant in the role.
Ron spent his career with Casper’s traffic department, where he was a supervisor until he decided he didn’t like writing evaluations of his friends, so he stepped down to take a different role.
He told Pat after his retirement that he was going to write a fantasy novel. Since he had the story already worked out, he started immediately. After he wrote “Group Six and the River: Of Water and Brimstone,” two more books continued the tale. Ron was nearing the conclusion of the fourth book when he died, but left notes for his wife to finish it.
“I’m glad he did, because he wrapped up the whole series since he knew he couldn’t do any more,” Pat said. “The ending is always the hardest part to come up with.”
Ron had a remarkably clever and wicked sense of humor, which is a great combination. “Like Shakespeare, my writing contains occasional scenes of gory violence, but in a fun, light-hearted kind of way,” Ron wrote in his author’s bio.
Here’s a sample from his first book:
“Tresado plodded down the filthy alley, wondering if the pouring rain would lessen or add to its filthiness. His question was soon answered as the delicately blended mixture of soil, grease, urine, and fish scales that was the road beneath his Eryndi feet embraced the rain water like a long-lost family member. The happy reunion produced a substance as slippery as owl poop on a brass sword pommel.”

Ron and Pat shared reading duties on Audible, which, like the book format, is available on Amazon. Pat had a long career working at KTWO Radio, where she honed her skills, and both of their voices are superb. As much as I like the printed word, it’s my favorite way to enjoy Ron’s work.
Ron and Pat were fans of “Star Trek,” and an entire room in their house is filled with memorabilia, much of it from “Star Trek” conventions they enjoyed.
“On the day of my surgery, they were waiting for the transport guy, the one who pushes the wheelchairs,” Ron told us. “There was a delay and the nurse said, ‘I don’t know what happened to the transporter.’”
Naturally, he quipped, “Get Scotty to fix it.”
Ron was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2015 and had a lung transplant at the University of Colorado a year later. He had some infections that caused a few hospital stays, but he remained active until the past year, when he could no longer do some of his favorite things, including making detailed models of various ships and planes. 
We didn’t get to enjoy Pat and Ron’s Thanksgiving feast last year because I suffered a heart attack the day before. Corryne and I drove to Casper a few weeks later and brought one of his favorite meals — bought at a fast-food place, because we burn everything — but it made us long for this year’s celebration. But Ron, who was on oxygen since before the transplant, labored mightily to breathe.
We last saw him over Zoom a short time before his death, when he could no longer have in-person visits due to his deteriorating condition. He was in great spirits and told many funny stories, but near the end, he was so tired he fell asleep.
Pat cooked the turkey every year, and it was always at least 20 pounds and delicious. Ron’s specialty was the gravy.
“It wasn’t just the great food that made Thanksgiving so special; it was being with our friends,” Corryne said. “Ron was always so positive and upbeat, even with all he had to go through.”
Corryne bonded with Ron in her first play over their mutual love of “Mystery Science Theater 3000.” Watching episodes was often an after-dinner treat, along with pumpkin pie.
I’m looking forward to dining again with friends. I’ll always have fond memories of Ron, not just on Thanksgiving. Before we moved to Cheyenne five years ago, Ron built me bookshelves as a going-away present because I admired his so much.
Whenever I go into my office, I remember my friend. I’m looking at his gift right now. Since he left us, it brings a tear to my eye, but a smile always follows.

I have never met anybody who works there. I haven’t donated. I do, however, drive through this scenic prairie landscape on my way to Fort Peck Reservoir. I also get American Prairie’s newsletter and always read news stories about the organization, which gives me enough information to believe American Prairie doesn’t deserve all this political pushback. Instead of buying into this constant criticism, Montanans should be thrilled with everything the organization is doing.
In the latest salvo, Gov. Greg Gianforte and all four members of Montana’s congressional delegation penned a letter to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum asking him to deny previously granted grazing rights to federal land leases acquired by American Prairie and claiming granting these grazing rights “threatens the economic viability of our most important industry.” 
Really? 
In their next breath, these five men would claim private property rights are sacred, and they would never try to keep any private landowner from exercising his/her property rights. Yet, they have no problem denying American Prairie’s legally acquired property rights. The state has also been setting on American Prairie’s approval to graze state lands, which has forced the organization to sue state government. 
American Prairie owns about 600,000 acres of deeded and leased prairie in north central Montana. Most, if not all, of this land was previously closed to public access. Now, it’s open to public hunting, camping and other recreational uses, and it’s free! Where are the hunters in this debate? In a time when lack of public access seriously threatens the sport of hunting, they should be publicly worshiping American Prairie. 
The main reason naysayers have this irrational fear is American Prairie’s plan to restore free-roaming bison herds. Currently, the organization runs about 900 certified brucellosis-free bison on only 46,000 acres. It manages cattle grazing on much of the rest of its holdings, raising 7,000 cattle in partnership with local ranchers. Again, hunters benefit. The organization allows hunters to annually harvest a small number of bison.
Keep in mind, incidentally, that many ranchers raise bison in Montana. Also, several tribes manage free-roaming bison herds on their land. But you don’t see Governor Gianforte or Attorney General Austin Knudsen or any of our senators and representatives bashing these private land owners. Also keep in mind, that American Prairie doesn’t force anybody to sell their land. It pays good money to willing sellers only, no different than any other buyer.
The truth is American Prairie has been an economic boom to an economically depressed section of Montana, providing good-paying jobs and bringing in tourists who otherwise would never come to north central Montana to spend their money at local businesses. Every year, more people flock to north central Montana to experience a rare and unspoiled prairie environment. American Prairie also remodeled a building in downtown Lewistown into a wonderful visitor center. Since American Prairie opened its doors, population has increased and unemployment has decreased in this economically depressed area. 
Clearly, no rancher or business has gone bankrupt because of American Prairie, and many have benefited from the organization’s efforts. And this economic bonanza will only continue to grow as the organization grows.
Nonetheless, a few local ranchers just can’t get over the fact that American Prairie exists, even though the organization doesn’t affect them in any negative way. They put up “Don’t Buffalo Me” and “Save the Cowboy” signs at strategic intersections on the network of unpaved roadways in the area, next to the “Roads Impassable When Wet” signs. Again, really? I’m absolutely positive American Prairie has nothing against cowboys, if we have any left. If we do, they’re probably chasing cows on ATVs.
This senseless paranoia reminds me of the early 1900s when business groups in northwestern Montana opposed the creation of Glacier National Park. A few decades, later, the park became the economic driver of the entire region and photos of the park’s scenery adorned most business websites and brochures.
So, let’s lose the hysteria and welcome American Prairie to our state because now, Montana has something special that no other state has. Decades from now, we will look back and realize the current madness was utterly ridiculous.

(Photos by John Partipilo)With one week until the Dec. 2 special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, the money is pouring in, signaling both parties think the race is competitive. 
Former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps, a Republican, was slightly favored by most political rating organizations to defeat state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Democrat, in the special election to replace retired former U.S. Rep. Mark Green. The district was redrawn in 2022 to include parts of Nashville, Clarksville, and a swath of rural and suburban Tennessee counties with strong GOP leanings. Green won the district in 2022 and 2024 by nearly identical 20-percentage point margins. 
But as President Donald Trump’s approval rating has steadily dropped over the last few months because of the government shutdown, his handling of SNAP benefits and the impacts of tariffs on farmers and consumers, the Democratic Party has sensed an opportunity. 
Political action committees, PACs, tied to Democratic donors have spent almost $1.8 million in the race to help Behn, and Republican-tied PACs have spent $2.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings as of Nov. 24. The latest spending in the general election comes after nearly $3 million was mostly to help ensure a Van Epps victory. 
Of the $4.1 million spent so far, more than two-thirds has been spent on negative advertising about Behn and Van Epps. 
For Democrats, the vast majority of their PAC money has been spent by two groups: HMP and Your Community PAC.
The largest individual donors to HMP this year are Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, and Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix. The HMP PAC also received a significant contribution from the House Majority Forward, a campaign arm of U.S. House Democratic leadership. 
Your Community PAC’s money doesn’t link back to an individual donor but to a group called North Fund, whose donors are untraceable. The North Fund, as of 2024, was run by a Washington, D.C. consultant named Jim Gerstein, who has served as a pollster and independent expenditure campaign organizer in support of several Democratic Party candidates. 
For Republicans, MAGA Inc. has spent nearly $1.2 million in the race, with Club for Growth and  Conservatives for American Excellence spending a combined $1 million. 
MAGA Inc. is Trump’s primary PAC, whose largest individual donors this year are Jeff Yass, a billionaire investor who most notably owns a significant stake in Chinese social video company TikTok, and Kelcy Warren, the billionaire owner of Energy Transfer Partners. 
Conservatives for American Excellence spent around $600,000 in the primary to help Van Epps. The organization has received most of its donations from Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, billionaire owners of two hedge funds.
Club For Growth’s main backers are Yass and Virginia James, a long-time conservative donor and supporter of private school vouchers. Club for Growth also funds the School Freedom Fund, which spent around $850,000 to help Van Epps in the primary and spent more than $3.3 million in 2024 to elect a slate of pro-private-school voucher supporters to Tennessee’s state legislature.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/behn-vanepps.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Justin Paget | Getty Images)An in-patient psychiatric treatment facility for children is closing in Cabell County, decreasing the number of beds the state has available for kids experiencing severe mental health crises. 
Barboursville School has 22 beds for children who have psychiatric disorders and need specialized, 24/7 care. 
“After much consideration, the decision has been made to close Barboursville School,” said Leslie Clagg, director of business development for River Park Hospital, which operates the facility located in Barboursville Park. 
“Our intention to close by Feb. 4, 2026, comes after completing a comprehensive, careful review and evaluation of multiple factors including the environmental impacts of recent flooding and cost required to renovate the aging leased building,” she said on Monday. “River Park Hospital is committed to working with the families/guardians of each current resident to identify and facilitate a smooth transition to another appropriate facility.”
Barboursville School was built in 1986 as an off-site facility for River Park Hospital. The state owns the building.
Universal Health Services, which operates River Park Hospital, is not renewing its lease with the state. 
“The West Virginia Department of Human Services was formally notified in early November by Universal Health Services of its intent to terminate its lease for the property and cease services at that location. DoHS is actively exploring all available options to ensure continuity of care, and the safety and well-being of the children we serve remains our highest priority,” said department spokesperson Angelica Hightower.
DoHS didn’t respond to a question about whether the state had enough available psychiatric treatment patient beds for children in West Virginia. 
Foster care officials have said that West Virginia doesn’t have enough in-state treatment options for kids in need of specialized mental health or behavioral care, leading the state to send hundreds of children out-of-state for help. It has also led to some children living in hotel rooms while in the state’s care.
Del. Evan Worrell
Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, said he is gathering more information, including whether DoHS will continue work with any other providers to move into the building and continue in-patient mental health care for children. 
“I do have concerns,” he said. “I want to make sure that there’s a proper plan for every one of these children to continue to receive the care they need.”
Clagg said the decision to close Barboursville School did “not affect River Park Hospital’s other psychiatric residential treatment programs and acute inpatient programs.”
River Park will continue to offer in-patient psychiatric residential treatment to children at its other location, including a 30-day diagnostic program for children ages 10 to 17.

(Photo courtesy of the Texas-Louisiana Canid Project)A new kind of creature is making its home where the prairies of Southwest Louisiana turn into brackish coastal marshes. 
It’s a coyote, kind of, with bigger ears and longer legs that have adapted to live among the tall wetland grasses in Cameron Parish. Believed to be unique to this corner of the Gulf Coast, they have evolved to cope with manmade changes to their environment thanks to their genetic connection to the red wolf, a species declared extinct in the region around 40 years ago.  
Scientists are now working to better understand this new species, both for the sake of scientific discovery and to understand how to best live with them. 


What is a canid?
Canids belong the biological family Canidae, which includes dogs, wolves, coyotes, foxes, dingoes and jackals.


“They’re definitely not a red wolf, but they’re not typical coyotes either,” said Tanner Broussard, a graduate student at McNeese State University and field supervisor for the Texas-Louisiana Canid Project, which has made researching the hybrid its sole focus. His group has joined forces with the Wolf Conservation Center, McNeese and the Canid Project, a separate coyote rehabilitation program in Louisiana. 
Broussard’s days involve riding throughout the farmlands and prairie of Southwest Louisiana on a four-wheeler, setting traps to catch the hybrid coyotes. He’s part of a small team of researchers and students capturing the animals for tagging, bloodwork and measurements to understand their red wolf genetics.

“That’s kind of where our project is, trying to figure out why they’ve been able to retain those genetics and then also assess what exactly these animals are,” Broussard said.  
Joey Hinton is a senior research scientist with the Wolf Conservation Center, based in Salem, New York. His prior research points to strong evidence of red wolf ancestry in the coyotes found along the Gulf Coast in Louisiana and Texas.
“They’re really built for surviving in that coastal marshland complex” where coyotes historically haven’t lived, Hinton said. “They seem to have carved out a unique niche there along the coast.”
Hunting and development led to the disappearance of the red wolf from the southeastern United States in the 19th century. As their numbers dwindled, the need for a large predator emerged as populations of invasive species such as nutria and feral hogs increased. This readily available food supply led coyotes to expand into areas they hadn’t previously occupied. 
As the two species’ paths crossed, red wolves began to breed with coyotes. 
Decades later, their offspring retain a surprisingly high level of red wolf DNA, Broussard said, and it’s this genetic blend that’s helped the hybrid thrive in the coastal marsh. 
Broussard said its progression is similar to the sea wolves of British Columbia, a subspecies of gray wolves that have adapted to a coastal environment with special features like webbed feet to make them better swimmers. 
“We’re kind of seeing a similar thing happen with our coyotes, where they’re becoming like a wetland-adapted coyote, which is largely in part from those mix of genes from the red wolves,” he said. 
The hybrid’s bigger body helps it swim across canals that weave throughout the landscape, a legacy of the fossil fuel and shipping industries. Longer legs let them see over tall wetland grasses as they search for prey. Smaller heads and larger ears allow them to target prey that includes nutria, feral hogs, rabbits.
Researchers say it’s the very nature of Louisiana that helps these wolf-coyote hybrids thrive. 
Hinton and Broussard are exploring the theory that the animals are doing so well in Southwest Louisiana because of its concentration of wildlife refuges along the coast, along with Interstate 10 acting as a manmade boundary to the north.   
“Areas that have the higher red wolf ancestry in their animals are typically areas that there’s a lot less people around, so they’re not getting shot as much or hit by cars,” Broussard said.

In coastal Cameron Parish alone, there are three national wildlife refuges: Cameron Prairie, Lacassine and Sabine.
“Those areas are very isolated. There’s not a lot of human interaction with them because a lot of areas are gated. People can’t get back in there,” Hinton said. 
“It allows them to retain that red wolf ancestry, pass it on for breeding,” he added.
The researchers want to continue studying these new creatures, including their impact on nutria populations. 
“They feed on certain types of small mammals, keep those numbers in check. They consume wild fruit and become dispersers of certain plant species that could be beneficial …” he said.
Hinton hopes the research can be used, in part, to better educate the public on how to live alongside these unique animals.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/24002M-standing-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Photo courtesy of Lindsay Nohl)If you live in a town like Driggs, and an area like the Teton Valley, what possibly could go wrong?
It fits the definition of paradise with its abundance of outdoor recreation. The Teton and Snake River mountain ranges are the backdrop to skiing, hiking and mountain biking. And there are few better places for fly fishing. With a population of just over 1,600, Driggs is as far away as one can get from the rat race of the rapidly growing cities.
But Sara White, executive director of the nonprofit Mental Health Coalition of Teton Valley, sees a darker side. It’s a place where suicides have occurred all-too-often.
The coalition was formed in 2009 after 19 suicides. But White says the need for mental health has not gone away, and the suicide threat remains. 
“Idaho always has been in the top 10 with suicides, and it isn’t just one thing,” she says. “The cost of living is high, housing is hard to find and there are limited resources. And in communities such as this, people don’t think they need help.”
That’s a barrier that White and members of the coalition are trying to break. More than 20 mental health providers, and as many as six free counseling sessions, are available for those who live or work in the Teton Valley or Alta, Wyoming.
A few years ago, Lindsay Nohl needed help in a big way, and she credits the coalition for saving her life. Her story started six years ago while mountain biking. Her foot slipped off a pedal, and she landed squarely on her chin.
Lindsay, who once considered playing professional soccer, thought nothing about the incident. She had taken more than a few spills in her life, but this one was different.
“Within a month, I started experiencing anxiety and suicidal thoughts. It got worse – insomnia, memory loss and inability to concentrate,” she said. “I couldn’t drive, I was unable to work and I had digestive issues.”
That wasn’t the Lindsay Nohl that her friends knew. She’s 47 now, but much younger in terms of athletic skills. She’s a mountain bike coach, works as a strength and conditioning coach at a local gym and recently she landed a part-time job with the coalition. Her personality is upbeat, but during her ordeal she struggled with getting out of bed and showering.
She moved to the Teton Valley full-time in 2020 and connected with a coalition counselor, Jenn Carter, who asked the right question. 
“She asked me about head injuries, and the bike crash kind of flashed before my eyes. Nobody had asked that,” Lindsay said. From there, Lindsay was able to get the treatments, medications and physical therapy she needed, and by June of 2020 she was participating in a bike race.
“It took a full year to get functional, and I still have issues with focus and short-term memory,” she said. “But with the correct diagnosis, I was able to understand what was wrong with me.”
And through her part-time work with the coalition today, she knows she’s not alone in dealing with life’s challenges in the Teton Valley’s version of “paradise.”
“This is a great place to live, but it’s really hard to survive financially. I’m having trouble paying my rent now, and then there are groceries. I can barely make it work right now. At least I can work, drive and cook,” she said.
“In rural Idaho, people will say they don’t need help, but it’s OK to see a therapist,” she said. “It’s not because you are weak, but it’s because you are strong.”
And Lindsay is convinced that people can be even stronger if they take advantage of the counseling sessions and the variety of other activities offered by the coalition – such as school-based counseling, and workshops on a multitude of mental-health topics. The coalition’s website includes information about suicide prevention.
“Not all mountain communities have mental health coalitions, but every mountain community should,” Lindsay says.
She’s lucky to be living in a place that does.

(Courtesy of Mark Cohen)LINCOLN — Mark Cohen, a former Air Force attorney and karate instructor, is running a nonpartisan bid in Nebraska’s 3rd Congressional District against U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith in the 2026 midterms.
The state’s rural, sprawling 3rd Congressional District includes central and western Nebraska and much of the state’s northeastern and southeastern edges. It’s one of the nation’s most conservative congressional districts by political party registration and voting history.

Cohen’s bid comes after launching an exploratory committee in August. Smith already faces a Republican primary challenger in former U.S. Border Patrol agent David Huebner. Democrat Becky Stille, an agricultural lab tech, is running for the Democratic nomination.  
Cohen, from Lemoyne near Lake McConaughy, said in a statement,  “Nebraskans are fed up with a two-party system that forces us to choose between extremists.” 
Cohen’s campaign website says he supports responsible gun rights, legalizing and regulating marijuana and ensuring that crops can be grown in Nebraska, because the agriculture sector is particularly vulnerable to climate change. He also wants to “require paper ballots in every election,” he wrote on his site, as he doesn’t “fully trust electronic voting machines,” and says he believes in regulated capitalism.

He said voters are “tired of a system that rewards politicians for speaking in sound bites … I won’t sit quietly while those who should represent us destroy agriculture and cut rural healthcare to give tax cuts to billionaires.”
Cohen added he “will represent rural Nebraskans, not party bosses or big donors.”
Smith campaign spokesman Chris Peterson has previously said Smith’s “conservative record reflects the priorities” of the 3rd District.
“Congressman Adrian Smith is a proven and trusted conservative fighting for Nebraskans alongside President Trump to secure the border and stop illegal immigration,” Peterson said. 
Cohen would be another nonpartisan candidate in Nebraska’s 2026 election. Former Omaha labor leader Dan Osborn, a registered nonpartisan, is in a competitive race against Republican U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts.

About 85% of the children Washington Pediatrics treats are insured under Medicaid. Beaufort is a small, rural, economically disadvantaged county surrounded by others like it. Families travel far, sometimes up 90 minutes, to get to the office in  Beaufort’s county seat, Ainsworth said. 
“There’s nothing else around,” she said. “We’re kind of a catch-all.”
Independent primary care practices like Ainsworth’s are struggling to cope with the state’s 8% rate cuts for the care they provide to people who use Medicaid. Independent practices aren’t owned by large hospital systems that have more sources of income and are likely better able to absorb rate cuts. 
Community Care of North Carolina, an organization that supports independent physicians and their practices, asked a group made up of mostly independent practices how they would respond to the rate cut. More than 60% said they would need to limit the Medicaid patients they see or stop taking on new ones, while 24% said they may need to stop treating Medicaid patients altogether. And 22% — one in five — said they may need to close. 
More doctors closing their doors to Medicaid patients would mean additional hurdles to treatment for rural residents who already tend to travel farther to get to doctors and who are more likely to use Medicaid as their insurance than suburban or urban residents. 
More than 39% of people who use Medicaid live in rural counties, according to a report from the NC Rural Center. Rural residents are about 35% of the state’s population.
According to the Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC, about 20 of the state’s 100 counties had no practicing pediatricians last year. 
“These practices in rural areas — after a while, they may not be able to survive if this goes on,” said Gregory K. Griggs, NC Academy of Family Physicians CEO. “And once they’re gone, they’re not opening back up. It’s going to hit our areas of the state that already have access problems the worst, because those are the areas of the state that have higher percentages of Medicaid.”
Ainsworth said she will continue to welcome children who use Medicaid, but will likely cut expenses by “tightening our belt.” That means not replacing staff members who are leaving and ending plans to recruit a new doctor. 
“We’ve always taken Medicaid,” said Ainsworth, a member of the CCNC board of directors.  “I can’t stop taking Medicaid patients. I can’t drop them both financially or ethically. We’ll continue to see new patients. That’s just what we’re going to do.”
The Medicaid program needed to find a way to save $319 million over eight months, said DHHS Secretary Devdutta Sangvai. 
DHHS imposed rate cuts from 3% to 10% for Medicaid services beginning Oct. 1, with Sangvai and Democratic Gov. Josh Stein saying the state legislature did not provide enough money for the Medicaid program to operate until June 30 of next year. 
“There’s no way we did this with the idea that no one is going to get hurt,” Sangvai said. “We need to get this funded so that we can start reprocessing claims, making people whole, and focus on getting people healthy.”
The impact of the cuts differs depending on what services are provided, who is providing them, and where practices are located, Sangvai said. 
There was no way to fine-tune rate cuts based on geography, he said. 
Republican legislative leaders say the reductions are premature, and Medicaid has enough money to last into next year without cutting rates. 
Dr. Mark McNeill, president of the NC Academy of Family Physicians, has met with both Stein and Republican legislative staff since rates were cut. 
“I sincerely think all parties sincerely want to get a solution in some way shape or form,” he said. 
McNeill said he wanted to emphasize in those meetings how lower rates will affect family practices, particularly independent practices.

“We’re already struggling with access to primary care,” he said. “This is just making it so much worse.”
McNeill, whose office is in Asheville, has decided to stop accepting new Medicaid patients until the rate cuts are reversed. Between McNeill and the other doctor in the office, about 15% of the practice’s patients are on Medicaid.  
The state must seek permission from the federal government for the rate cut. DHHS must have the request into the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services by Dec. 31. 
If the funding controversy is resolved, the state must go back to CMS for permission to reverse the cuts. 
McNeill wonders whether there’s a chance that CMS won’t allow the state to restore the rates. The Trump administration has been eager to reduce Medicaid spending. The “Big Beautiful Bill” Act on taxes and spending cuts about $1 trillion from Medicaid over 10 years. 
Sangvai agrees there is a risk CMS will refuse to allow North Carolina to restore its Medicaid rates if funding increases, but he’s confident that won’t happen because the funding issue involves state money.
“I’m optimistic that CMS will allow us to take the corrective action in that second filing,” he said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2235105609-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Courtesy of Gomez family)On the night of Oct. 8, a man named Delmar Gomez drove to pick up his younger brother from a mechanic’s shop on Lamar Avenue. He never came home.
On the return trip, law enforcement officers with the Memphis Safe Task Force pulled over his 2011 Toyota Tundra pickup and arrested the brothers on immigration charges.
The Guatemalan brothers — both longtime Memphians — are known in national Pentecostal Christian circles as well-traveled worship singers, performing at churches from New York to Florida.
They were moved from one immigration detention center to another, finally arriving at a lockup in Louisiana, more than 300 miles from Memphis. The younger brother, Eber Gomez, a 30-year-old with no known criminal record, was soon deported, leaving behind a wife and two young children in Memphis.
Delmar Gomez, a 38-year-old husband and father of four U.S. citizen children, is still holding on. Though he had only minor motor vehicle violations on his record, he’s spent more than 40 days in an immigration detention as he heads into a hearing Tuesday that could result in his deportation.
Not only did the Trump administration lock up the brothers, the government published a news release with false information portraying Delmar Gomez as one of 11 “worst of the worst” immigrant criminals in Memphis.
The allegations deeply upset his wife, Sandra Perez.
“I want people to know that all of the charges that they’re accusing him of now are false, that none of that is true,” she told the Institute for Public Service Reporting in a Spanish-language interview. “He’s a person who is very respectful, honest, very hardworking. He is a good person.”
The news release included the false claim that Delmar Gomez had been arrested on an aggravated assault charge. The claim was re-published on at least one local TV station’s website.
In a second version of the news release, the Trump administration published Delmar Gomez’s mug shot and misidentified him as “Miguel Torres, a criminal illegal alien from Mexico arrested for selling synthetic narcotics, vehicle theft, traffic offense and drug possession.” The same caption also appears under another man’s photo.
Delmar Gomez was misidentified as “Miguel Torres” in this Department of Homeland Security news release.
Weeks later, the government has not corrected the misidentification, or explained how it happened, even after a reporter repeatedly asked about it.
The situation reflects broader issues. The Trump administration is conducting a massive immigration crackdown in Memphis and across the country, spending billions of dollars to arrest, detain and deport people, using stories of criminal immigrants as justification for harsh treatment.
The arrest and detention of the Guatemalan singing brothers illustrates the sharp contrast between the administration’s rhetoric — that it’s arresting hard-core criminals — and the reality on the ground in Memphis and across the country: that it’s mostly arresting immigrants with minor criminal records or no criminal record at all.
As of this month, 74% of immigrants in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention had no criminal convictions, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. Many of those who were convicted committed only minor offenses, such as traffic violations.
Detailed numbers for Memphis are not available. The top state prosecutor in the Memphis area, Steve Mulroy, told The Institute in October that immigration arrests account for about 20% of total task force arrests, and most of the immigrants have no criminal history other than unlawful presence in the United States.
Delmar Gomez’s wife Sandra acknowledges her husband entered the country illegally in January 2005, more than 20 years ago.  He was 17 at the time.
Sandra said Delmar was unable to gain legal immigration status, but has lived a clean life.
Delmar Gomez’s attorney, Skye Austin with advocacy group Latino Memphis, said she is aware of the federal government’s news release that included the false information.
“When I was first made aware of it, my immediate thought was, ‘Do people think that all Hispanics look alike?’ ” Austin said. “Do people think that it is OK to mix up names and faces and histories?”
There is no evidence that Gomez was ever accused of aggravated assault, drug dealing, vehicle theft or any other major crime, she said.
The Institute for Public Service Reporting conducted its own independent records search and was unable to locate any such criminal charges against Delmar Gomez.
Austin said Gomez’s entire criminal history consists of six traffic tickets issued over a period of nearly two decades, from 2006 to this spring. The tickets were for violations such as driving without a license and without insurance — both misdemeanors, and an Atlanta ticket for driving too fast for conditions and a related driving charge. The most recent ticket came this March, when he was cited for following too closely and driving with an expired tag, she said, adding that prosecutors dropped those charges.
“I think that people should view this as unjust and that this is the opposite of the narrative that we’ve seen where criminals are being taken into detention,” she said. “Because my client’s not a criminal. He is an everyday hard worker just trying to provide for his family.”

From work and singing to detention
Delmar Gomez’s wife Sandra spoke in an interview in the kitchen of her family’s East Memphis home, which is decorated with a poster depicting the Ten Commandments.
She said she learned of the arrests when Eber Gomez called her on the way back from the mechanic’s shop, when the two brothers were in Delmar’s truck. Delmar was driving, but Eber blamed himself for what happened, she said, because if hadn’t needed the ride, Delmar wouldn’t have gone on the errand at all.
“He just told me ‘I’m sorry, it’s my fault that they stopped us.’” she said. “And I told him ‘It’s not true.’
He said ‘Yes it is. Listen.’ And I heard them (law enforcement officers) talking in English.”
“‘Now we can’t do anything,’ he told me. That’s all he said.”
Sandra Perez is a stay-at-home mother to four children who range in age from 17 to three. Delmar Gomez is the family’s primary breadwinner and earns money mainly by mowing yards. He has a lineup of about 60 houses, and he and his father typically mow about 30 yards one week, then about 30 more the next, his wife said.
He’s also a lead vocalist for a Christian band called Agrupacion Vision Emanuel, or Vision of Emanuel Group, which has produced studio recordings and professionally edited music videos.
In the band’s music videos, Delmar Gomez stands in front of as many as 15 musicians, singing passionately at scenic locations including Shelby Farms, the Overton Park shell, and near the “Memphis” sign on Mud Island. One of the videos has been watched more than 400,000 times.
His younger brother Eber Gomez has worked as a roofer and sang with a different touring band called Adoradores de Cristo Memphis, which means “Christ Worshipers of Memphis.”
The two bands have traveled as far away as Chicago, Florida, Alabama, New York and Atlanta to perform at weddings, church anniversaries and other Pentecostal church events, family members said.
Delmar Gomez’s band doesn’t treat these performances as a money-making endeavor, his wife said.
“They don’t charge. They go for faith. If the brothers (at the other churches) want, they give them an offering for their expenses, and if they don’t, they cover their own expenses,” his wife said. “They go for love of the work of God.”
Amid a surge of well over 1,000 federal agents and state troopers in Memphis, community groups say law enforcement officers are arresting and detaining immigrants every day here, often in traffic stops.
The Memphis Safe Task Force has released little information about the immigration arrests. In a statement early this month, the task force said it had made 319 immigration arrests in October.
That’s about 17% of about 1,900 total arrests.
As of November 17, the task force arrest total had risen to 2,790 arrests, Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal Ryan Guay said in an email to The Institute.
He did not say how many of these were immigration arrests, referring questions to the Department of Homeland Security, which did not respond.
Delmar Gomez was taken to an ICE office near the airport, then an immigration prison in Mason, Tennessee, then a lockup in Alabama, and finally to a big ICE prison in Jena, Louisiana, his wife said.
She said she wants one thing. “That they let him go,” she said through tears. “That he can be with my family and with me, because he’s been a good person. To be together as a family and work on the things of God, that’s been our desire.
“We’re a very decent family, and it’s unfair what they’re accusing him of.”
Mass deportation campaign
The federal government generally has treated unlawful presence in the United States as a civil violation, not a crime. Under prior presidents, including Republican George W. Bush and Democrats such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden, it’s unlikely people like the Guatemalan singers would ever have been detained.
The background: Businesses wanted a low-cost, reliable workforce. Congress didn’t want to increase legal immigration.
The federal government found a solution: quietly tolerate illegal immigration. Consequently, the government usually enforced immigration law only at the border.
But in non-border areas like Memphis, the federal government rarely bothered to expel unauthorized immigrants, unless the immigrants committed crimes. Unauthorized immigrants like Delmar Gomez could live normal lives – working and raising families, but they often had no way to gain legal status.
The Trump administration has thrown out the practice of non-enforcement and is arresting people who have allegedly committed civil immigration violations, but have no other criminal history. It is also arresting some people who have legal immigration papers, and has even arrested and detained U.S. citizens, most of them of Hispanic origin.
The October 20 news release involving Delmar Gomez demonstrates how Trump’s government is also publishing false information about specific immigrants in Memphis and across the nation.
It’s part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his administration of portraying immigrants as dangerous and evil. Trump famously launched his first presidential campaign in 2015 by calling Mexicans “rapists” and claimed in a presidential debate last year that Haitian immigrants in Ohio are eating other people’s cats and dogs.
Today, the administration sometimes labels immigrants as “terrorists” as justification for deporting them.
In high-profile cases, including a big raid on an apartment building in Chicago, nonprofit news outlet ProPublica has found that those claims were frequently false — that the so-called “terrorists” are often ordinary immigrants with no criminal records.
In fact, multiple studies from the Cato Institute, the U.S. Department of Justice and other researchers have concluded that immigrants are less likely than U.S. citizens to commit crimes — even if the immigrants are in the country illegally.
The Institute contacted the White House for comment for this story. Spokeswoman Abigail Jackson responded by criticizing the reporter.
“Violent criminal illegal aliens who murder, rape, and assault innocent American citizens deserve to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. It’s despicable for any so-called journalist to try and compare these monsters with law-abiding immigrants. This is why no one trusts the media.”

News release includes unverifiable claims
Memphis TV station Action News 5, which had originally re-published the government’s false aggravated assault claim about Delmar Gomez, has since broadcast a follow-up story saying there’s no evidence to support it.
Not only does the government’s October 20 news release include false information about Delmar Gomez, it also includes unverifiable information about at least four other men arrested in the Memphis area.
For instance, the news release says a man named Jardi Caal Requena was arrested “for domestic violence and for making a physical threat.” A reporter with The Institute found no criminal records for anyone with this name in local or federal courts.
The news release claims that a man named Simeon Sosa-Camargo had been convicted of “smuggling aliens into the U.S.”
Federal records show that a man with the same name was convicted in Texas for at least three cases of entering and re-entering the U.S. illegally.
But The Institute found no record that he was ever convicted of human smuggling.
The news release says a man named Wilmer Flores Godoy was convicted of “illegal alien in possession of a firearm and arrested for larceny.”  A man named Wilmer Flores was arrested on a felony domestic violence charge in the Memphis area in 2024, and the case was dismissed in October.
But a reporter found no local or federal court records related to gun possession or larceny.
Delmar Gomez is misidentified in the news release as Miguel Torres, a man from Mexico whom the feds accused of drug dealing, vehicle theft, traffic offense and drug possession.
A search for the real Miguel Torres turned up little – the name is common, with hundreds of criminal cases against people with that name in the nationwide federal court system.
But a reporter found no records that matched those allegations for Torres in the Shelby County criminal court system or in federal courts for the western district of Tennessee.
The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to written questions about the Delmar Gomez case and the other men mentioned in the Oct. 20 news release.
Younger brother accepts deportation
The father of the two brothers, Ramiro Gomez, told a reporter he originally had eight children. One of them, Jaime Gomez, was a heavy drinker who was found dead in the Mississippi River several years ago, he said.
By contrast, he said arrested sons Delmar and Eber are clean-living family men. “What I want is for my sons to come back. My grandchildren need them,” he said.
Days after that interview, on Oct. 30, the younger brother, Eber, accepted deportation back to Guatemala, according to an online system that allows people to search immigration court hearings by an identifying number. He arrived back in Guatemala on Saturday, Nov. 8, his father said.
Ramiro Gomez said he had spoken with his son briefly by phone from Guatemala, but he didn’t have a chance to talk with him about why he accepted deportation.
However, the Trump administration has made it extremely difficult for detained immigrants to win release on bond. Instead, detained immigrants are forced to fight their deportation cases from behind bars.
Critics say that by denying bond, the government is using the hardship of imprisonment to grind down immigrants’ will and ability to fight and pressure them to sign paperwork accepting deportation.
Ramiro Gomez said the deportation has caused severe hardship for his son’s wife and their two children. “She’s still at home and paying rent and food for the children.”

Delmar continues to fight deportation
Delmar Gomez remains behind bars in Louisiana. As of today, he’s been locked up for 48 days.
He is scheduled for an individual hearing Tuesday before Immigration Judge Maithe Gonzalez at the lockup in Jena, Louisiana.
Gomez’s attorney Skye Austin will appear via remote link from Memphis and argue for “cancellation of removal” — an immigration judge’s formal ruling that he should not be deported.
Her argument: Delmar Gomez has lived in in the U.S. at least 10 years continuously, and his deportation would harm his four U.S. citizen children. “I also have to prove that he is a person of good moral character and has not been convicted of a crime that would have serious immigration consequences.”
What would she say if an ICE attorney argues that his six traffic tickets for driving without a license, speeding and other violations show bad moral character?
“So, my pushback would be that a number of these traffic violations have been (dropped by prosecutors) or closed, and that my client does everything in his power to pay the fines and make sure that he has nothing pending with the court. He’s not causing any judicial delay or anything of that nature.”
Austin said she’s collected dozens of reference letters to present to the immigration court on her client’s behalf.
“Seven local ministers have written me letters, and that’s on top of again, neighbors, friends, clients of Señor Delmar just wanting to let people know, ‘Hey, this is a good man. I know him personally. I’ve known him for years,’ et cetera, et cetera.”
Most immigrants who go before Judge Gonzalez lose their cases, according to data from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.
In 2024 and 2025, the judge decided 148 asylum cases and denied about 87% of them, slightly higher than the denial rate of 78% across judges at the Jena immigration court.

“Mommy, where did Papi go?”
Meanwhile, Delmar Gomez’s children are struggling with his absence.
His oldest child, 17-year-old high school senior Nancy Gomez, said her father had only a limited education in Guatemala and is pushing for her to study.
She’s already been accepted to the University of Memphis.
“He always has given me advice on everything that I do and always has been proud of me and everything that I have done. And then I just want to see him again. I feel really something that has been taken away from me that I want back. Every time he came from work, I would hear his truck coming in, but now I haven’t heard that and I just want to hear it again,” she said.
“When the house is quiet and he comes from work, he fills the environment with his laughter. And he always be talking about his day and asks us about our day, how it was. And I just want to see him back. I just miss him a lot.”
As the adults showed a reporter a family album during a recent visit, the youngest child, three-year-old Betuel, spoke up.
“Mommy, where did Papi go?” he said in Spanish, crying.
His mother picked him up, gave him a hug and kissed him.
“He went to sing, my love,” his mother said.
“He’s working?” the boy said.
“Yes, my love.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s hemp industry has reached an agreement with state agencies, dismissing a lawsuit and enabling some businesses to keep selling Hemp-derived products such as THCA for a short time after new restrictions take effect. 
The Tennessee Healthy Alternatives Association announced it entered an order with the state Agriculture and Revenue Departments allowing businesses with licenses issued before Dec. 31, 2025 to continue using a 2023 regulatory framework until their licenses expire June 30, 2026. Such a move allows stores to keep selling many products that will be banned after a new law takes effect Jan. 1.
Because of the agreement, a pending declaratory judgment against the Agriculture and Revenue departments has been dismissed, the association said in a statement.
Part of the new law adopted by the legislature this year transfers regulatory authority over hemp products and beverages from the state Agriculture Department to the Tennessee Alcoholic Beverage Commission.
The new law also bans the hemp derivative, THCA, which converts into delta-9 THC – an illegal substance in Tennessee in greater than trace amounts – when smoked or heated. The synthetic cannabinoid, THCP, is also banned under the law.
Hemp industry attorney Clint Palmer, who testified before lawmakers this year, said about 75% of the market will be considered illegal under the new ban, which includes THCA flower and vapes. The new law will push consumers to synthetic cannabinoids, he said.
“If you ask your typical consumer, they’re gonna say gross,” Palmer said.
Palmer told lawmakers early this year hemp businesses will be forced to shut down despite spending millions of dollars to comply with state regulations.
State Sen. Richard Briggs, a Knoxville Republican, said during a committee meeting that the legislature should withdraw the bill and consider another one allowing recreational marijuana.
“Let’s be perfectly honest. It’ll help the businesses, we’ll have great revenue, and everybody smoking the stuff will be a lot happier,” Briggs said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Hemp-bill004-1024x761.jpg,,,2025-11-25 06:56:16.076590

(Photo by Cory Fontenot/ Courtesy Festival International)Pascal Danae feels right at home in South Louisiana.
Based in France, the Guadeloupean musician sings in Creole. A sousaphone, popular in New Orleans brass bands, covers the low-end in his trio Delgres. And the group got their U.S. market debut in 2016 thanks to Lisa Stafford and Festival International.
“The kind of music we make, that fusion of Creole from the West Indies, the blues, but also all the Caribbean vibes — it resonates in a very special way in Lafayette,”  Danae says.
So, of course, he’s itching to return for Festival International’s 40th anniversary in 2026 — if he can afford it.
It’s getting much more costly to keep Festival International, international. Visa costs for international musicians have soared, as have processing times. And it’s complicating the work of putting together a heavy-hitting lineup befitting a 40th anniversary. The bureaucratic hurdles have made American tours a riskier affair for international artists and a more expensive endeavor for stateside talent buyers like Stafford.
“It’s basically more than double the price of everything,” she says.
The situation has raised the financial pressure on festival’s organizers, who still rely on sponsorships, donations and hundreds of volunteers to produce the sprawling, multi-day takeover of Downtown Lafayette each April.
And it’s also begun to put limits on the kinds of acts Festival can import, with Stafford having an easier time pulling bands from Canada or who are already based in the U.S. In a given year, anywhere from 15 to 20 countries are represented in a Festival lineup.

“Your curation can kind of suffer, because there’s so many bands I want to bring in that I can’t,” says Stafford.
This week, Festival’s volunteer board launched a fundraiser pegged to the expense of international bookings. All told, organizers spend about $300,000 on talent costs, with roughly 30% going to fees associated with international artists, like Danae’s band, hailing from Paris.
Tabbing up visa application fees, legal bills, flights and prepaid taxes, it could cost upwards of $20,000 for Delgres to get here. And that’s before they get paid.
To be sure, importing international talent was never cheap. But it’s getting more difficult to sustain a diverse international roster as entry processes and costs intensify.
In her early days as Festival programming director in the 1990s, Stafford coordinated visa applications herself, trained by a local attorney with immigration experience. The process was more predictable and cheaper. Filing fees were in the neighborhood of $325 per visa then, she recalls. Today, those are up nearly eight-fold.
And as each year’s lineup got bigger, Festival began prioritizing artists with booking agents and referring them to lawyers who specialize in artist visas.
The trend has been years in the making, spanning several presidents and policy platforms.
“Each administration has its own ideas on how and who they want to have enter the country, how much resources they devote to the administrative state,” says Mel Puljic, a booking agent representing international artists.


Premium processing fees, which unlock the expedited timeline necessary to comfortably plan a tour, are now $2,805 for the artist. They were introduced in 2001 at $1,000, and climbed steadily to keep up with inflation until leaping to $2,500 in the first Trump administration, settling at the current price in the Biden era.
For artists and their agents, however, it’s not just about the cost, it’s also processing times that make planning difficult.
Puljic, based in Chicago, says the costs and bureaucratic snares have shifted his representation model. He now almost exclusively works with artists who can obtain three-year O-1 visas designated for people with “extraordinary ability,” instead of the more time-limited P visas often used by traveling artists and musicians.
A lifer in international music, Puljic has booked dozens of acts at Festival International over the years, including fest favs like Las Cafeteras.
Processing times have grown longer and longer — a 30-day federal shutdown didn’t help — raising the threat that a tour could be scuttled by delays at U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services.
Regular processing can take six months or more. Even premium processing, purportedly a 15-day turnaround, can drag on if USCIS asks for more documentation in a request for evidence. Along the way, applicants must show proof of their fame and credibility back home — press clips, videos, testimonials from influential people — and secure the endorsement of U.S. labor representatives (incurring another fee), and that’s just to complete the petition.
Arranging a visa interview can tack on another month once a petition is approved. As of October, USCIS requires that visa-seekers conduct their application interviews at U.S. embassies in their countries of origin, not residence.  That’s easier said than done for groups that may live and work in Europe but hail from Africa.
It’s a winding process, in other words, and one that comes with a lot of risk for artists and their agents.
“If you can’t get an O-1 visa, the chances of me representing you are next to nothing because I could literally be throwing away my money for a visa application,” Puljic says.
Meanwhile, the rumors of arbitrary or politically motivated denial haunts visa-seekers along the way.
Puljic says he’s not had any of his artists inexplicably blocked, but the anxiety is now a common one among artists planning tours in the U.S.
And that’s as demand for world music climbs in the U.S. “There’s a kind of contradictory crosscurrent thing that’s happening,” he says.
The complications before agents like Puljic and buyers like Stafford have set up a taller barrier for emerging international artists looking to get their big break in the U.S. For decades now, Festival International has been an essential springboard for that world.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In Danae’s case, connecting with Stafford led to a booking agent and Delgres’ first American tour, including several other festivals.
“That’s how everything started for us in America,” he says.
Festival International is a must-book stop for international artists, a resume-builder that can lead to more stages and notoriety. The scope and pedigree are virtually unmatched — few festivals of its kind attract hundreds of thousands of people.
“People who operate in the space know that there’s a huge opportunity at the end of every April for international music in Louisiana,” says Puljic.
Of course, for artists like Danae, the lure is bigger than career-building. Coming to Festival is about coming to America and jumping into its melting pot.
“The heart of the music we play, part of it is there,” says Danae, “and not addressing that audience would be like walking on one foot or something. It would feel just wrong, you know.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CoryFontenot__4292022_0799-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 05:56:15.932429

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)State lawmakers have moved a proposal to standardize and expand programs that divert children to alternatives to the criminal justice system after they’re arrested. Supporters say the approach yields positive outcomes. 
House Bill 144 would require counties to offer diversion to minors facing non-violent felony and misdemeanor charges, unless it’s their third or subsequent offense within three or fewer years. 
Listen to the audio recap: 

https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/23epHB144.mp3
 
“Decades of research show us unequivocally that when youth are charged with less serious crimes, they have better outcomes – for public safety and in their lives – when they are diverted from the juvenile justice system,” said sponsor Rep. Rick Krajewski (D-Philadelphia).  
The measure also would prohibit diversion programs from requiring kids to plead guilty or to pay any fees. 
Utah, Washington, Kentucky and South Dakota are among states where standardized requirements for diversion programs have been linked to reduced recidivism and incarceration among children. 
In Pennsylvania, all counties do offer diversion of some kind. And the vast majority of first-time juvenile offenders – more than 80% annually during 2020-24 – in Pennsylvania end up being diverted before their cases are fully adjudicated, according to the state’s Juvenile Court Judges Commission report from 2024.
But some advocates say programs’ setup and utilization rates vary widely across the commonwealth. 
The range was between 2% (Monroe County) and 69% (York County) of young people diverted before formal charges were filed, according to data in a report released by the state’s Juvenile Justice Task Force in 2021. 
“While we acknowledge that there are many local actors who are implementing diversion programs effectively, it cannot be ignored that a lack of guidance from our state statute means that a youth in Lancaster may not have the same opportunity for a second chance as a young person in Philadelphia or even York,” Krajewski said. “As a state legislator, it is my responsibility to ensure that every child, no matter their zip code or county, is given the same fair shot.”
Juvenile Court Judges Commission (JCJC) Executive Director Robert Tomassini raised concerns about relying on that data, which is from 2018, during an informational hearing about the bill earlier this fall.
The commission’s report from 2024 provides more recent statistics. They’re based on allegations rather than individuals.
However, this metric likewise ranges widely among counties between 35% (Monroe) and 96% (Northumberland), according to Children First PA.
Tomassini didn’t respond to requests for comment; JCJC colleagues deferred to him.
The House Children & Youth Committee passed the bill, 21-5, before recessing for the holidays. 
Rep. Scott Barger, who represents parts of Blair and Huntingdon counties, is among Republicans who voted in favor of the bill. He said he’s experienced diversion’s effectiveness firsthand as a vocational minister working alongside faith-based and secular programs. 
“I’ve seen diversion programs kind of intercept some of these kiddos from being treated as though they’ve got no hope for redemption, and bumping them towards a second chance or a different way of looking at life,”  said Barger, adding he does have some concerns about what expanding diversion would cost local governments. 
Research has documented saving money from using diversion short term because the programs cost less than “formally processing youth” – including potential stays in juvenile detention or residential placement. Studies have shown long-term benefits of diversion, including better public safety outcomes and enhanced life prospects compared to formal justice system processing.

Republicans Kate Klunk (York County), Brenda Pugh (Luzerne), Jamie Walsh (Luzerne), Gary Day (Lehigh) and John Schlegel (Lebanon) voted against it.
The measure echoes some of the recommendations from the Juvenile Justice Task Force. Diversion was among main focus areas for the panel, convened in the wake of revelations of abuse at Glen Mills in Delaware County and other residential facilities. 
Since the task force released a report with recommendations four years ago, two laws have since been enacted that explicitly address issues raised, according to Stefanie Arbutina, policy director of Children First PA, which tracks related legislation. 
One requires courts to revisit kids’ cases more frequently (every three months instead of every nine). Another standardizes the expungement process, establishing automatic triggers for courts to clean out minors’ records. 
Both stem from legislation sponsored by state Sen. Lisa Baker, a Republican representing all of Wyoming and Susquehanna counties and parts of Wayne and Luzerne counties.

But the big box stores aren’t the only place to find a good bargain. Small Business Saturday, the day after Black Friday, offers shoppers an opportunity to find great quality items at a competitive price and invest in their community.
Small Business Saturday has become a great way to kick off the holiday season. What began 15 years ago as a way to promote local businesses recovering from the Great Recession has blossomed into one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Last year, shoppers spent roughly $22 billion at their local businesses.

The holiday season is a time to celebrate and express gratitude. Here in the Centennial State, small business owners are particularly grateful for how elected officials in Washington, D.C., have stood up for Main Street. Back in July, Congress and President Donald Trump made the 20% Small Business Tax Deduction permanent, averting a major tax hike at the end of the year. This federal tax victory will go a long way in helping our small businesses navigate an uncertain economic environment.
There was less good news coming out of the statehouse, with lawmakers passing more red tape for our job creators to navigate, increasing their litigation risk, and eliminating the sales tax vendor allowance. Unfortunately, during both the regular and special sessions, the General Assembly made it more difficult to be a small business owner in Colorado.
Between rising prices, a tight labor market, and a decline in sales, small businesses across the country are heading into the holiday season with a little less cheer. According to a recent NFIB survey, optimism among small business owners declined in October, as job creators reported reduced sales and profits. And while many small businesses want to hire, filling open positions is becoming nearly impossible.
On Small Business Saturday and every day of the year, shopping small plays a big role in supporting our communities. In Colorado, Main Street businesses are the beating heart of our economy, accounting for more than 99% of businesses in the state and employing nearly half of working Coloradans, according to the Small Business Administration.
When you stop in at your favorite coffee shop, locally owned boutique, or family-run restaurant, your dollars go further. Nearly 68 cents of every dollar spent at a small business stays within the community where it’s spent and creates another 50 cents in local business activity.
Small businesses’ investment in the community goes well beyond providing good-paying jobs for our friends and neighbors. Oftentimes, it is small business owners who sponsor little leagues, contribute to school fundraisers, and help keep food pantry shelves stocked.
This holiday season, don’t forget to shop small. Our local businesses keep our communities strong and our economy growing.
When Main Street prospers, we all prosper.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)As we approach the 2026 General Assembly and election season, we have yet another example of Kentucky Republican officials and/or candidates behaving badly.
A few weeks ago, there was Calvin Leach running for state Senate after once writing online that young women are “promiscuous skanks,” “coddled americunts,” “party whores” and “damn sloots” (internet slang for slut).
When asked about this, Leach described his writing as dating advice, saying that diversity, equity and inclusion has gotten out of hand.
Now we have state Rep. TJ Roberts responding to a female citizen’s email with an AI-generated video of himself, superimposed over President Donald Trump, as the president said to a female reporter, “quiet, piggy.” 
Roberts stated that his response fit the tone of the woman’s initial email, writing, “The leftist activist posing as a PR specialist sent me a joke of an email, attacking law and order and our law enforcement community, so I sent a joke of a response.” He also posted the video on social media.
A citizen had questions. In what way was her email a joke?

And yet, Roberts has a history of posting what he seemingly considers “jokes” on social media in which he demeans women. 
I know, because I am one of them.
In summer 2023, Roberts, of Burlington, posted four photos of firearms on Twitter/X and wrote, “Kentucky ‘journalist’ Teri Carter has to be the biggest Karen in Kentucky. Show off your guns and make her mad.” Days earlier he’d posted three photos of firearms with “Make a gun grabbing ‘journalist’ mad. Post black and scary guns.” 
Notably, summer 2023 followed the horrific mass shooting at Old National Bank in Louisville in which a mentally unstable 25-year-old walked into a store, legally purchased a firearm and ammunition, and days later shot five people to death – Thomas Elliott, James Tutt Jr., Juliana Farmer, Joshua Barrick, Deana Eckert – and injured eight. 
A few days after Old National Bank, David Huff and Deaji Goodman were killed and four others injured when someone shot into a crowd in Louisville’s Chickasaw Park.

I wrote about both incidents, which appeared to trigger Roberts, whom I have never met nor spoken with.
A year later, over Fourth of July weekend 2024, there was a mass shooting at a 21st birthday party in Florence (Northern Kentucky, Boone County) in which four people were shot to death and three were recovering, including a 19-year-old girl. According to news reports, the 21-year-old shooter was on probation with a criminal history that included sexual assault of a 13-year-old.
After I wrote about this incident and mentioned Roberts’ prior social media statements (as listed above), he posted a photo of an AR-15 style gun on Twitter/X and wrote, “Every time a leftist posing as a “journalist” runs a hit piece on me for my total commitment to your constitutional rights, including your right to bear arms, I will buy a new gun and name it after the fake journalist. Meet Teri.”
On July 21 this year, following a church shooting, I emailed Senate President Robert Stivers, President Pro Tempore David Givens, House Speaker David Osborne and Speaker Pro Tempore David Meade, writing in part, “Mr. Roberts posted this (see attached below) on his Twitter/X account just days after the shooting of a state trooper and a shooting in a church. Is there no respect for the community? For survivors? For law enforcement? For the victims?”
I did not receive a response.
Roberts’ post showed a pie chart titled “Reasons I own a gun,” above which he wrote “FAFO” which stands for “f*** around and find out.” 
As a female writer in the internet age, I am used to ignoring internet trolls. But Roberts’ posts display a disturbing pattern of behavior and regular citizens — like the woman who wrote to him of her concerns re: a bill he has proposed for 2026 — deserve better than to be publicly mocked by a state representative saying “quiet, piggy.”
Is this conduct befitting a member of our General Assembly? Of the Republican Party of Kentucky? 
It seems the answer is yes.
Recently Bobbie Coleman, chairperson of the Hardin County Republican Party, made national news after she posted an AI video on the county party’s Facebook page with former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama portrayed as grinning apes. 
Kentucky GOP Chairman Robert J. Benvenuti III called Coleman’s video “vile and reprehensible” and said the party would take “the harshest action available” against those involved. 
That was a month ago. Where is this alleged “harshest action?”
Based on experience, I suggest we not hold our breath.
I do not know what has befallen the Republican Party of Kentucky, nor what has fueled Senate and House leadership’s continuing tolerance of such unprofessional and embarrassing behavior within their ranks.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)When a group of gun rights advocates piled into House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi’s State House office to rail against a proposed assault-style weapons ban last spring, Shekarchi gave them some advice: Organize. Get involved earlier. Don’t come in at the last minute and complain.
David Levesque took the message to heart.
“If it wasn’t for the Speaker sitting in that conference room six or seven months ago, telling us ‘you need to be organized, you need to do this for the long fight,’ we probably wouldn’t be here now,” Levesque, a Narragansett resident and owner of Brewed Awakenings coffee houses, said in a recent interview.
Levesque got to work. He revived a dormant political action committee started during the pandemic to “fight against all the ridiculous rules and laws.” He made a website, registered the 501(c)4 with the R.I. Department of State, held fundraisers, and started to recruit 2026 state legislative candidates. 
The piece de resistance: a string of 40 political action committees — one statewide and one for every city and town in Rhode Island — allowing The League of RI Businesses to circumvent the $2,000-per-candidate annual campaign donation limit set by state law. 
“With 40 PACs aligned in mission, The League has the capacity to direct up to $1 million annually toward supporting new,  common-sense candidates and challenging extremist incumbents,” the business group boasted in a Nov. 17 press release. 



Taking it to the next level 
It’s a loophole already employed by seasoned political strategists to a much lesser, and less vocal degree. Amica, Bally’s Corp., and the state teachers’ union all have two PACs apiece, according to state campaign finance data. The Providence firefighters union has four PACS. The union representing local and state government and public school workers was the previous chart-topper, with five PACS.
“What the League of RI Businesses is doing is taking it to an extreme,” said Ric Thornton, campaign finance director for the Rhode Island Board of Elections. “It’s unprecedented.”
While not illegal, the move exposes The League and its financial beneficiaries to greater risk of reporting mistakes and violations. A candidate who receives a donation from The League’s Narragansett PAC, for example, would be wrong to report the donor as one of the sister PACs. 
Thornton has already devoted a member of his campaign finance team to track the money flowing in and out of the 40 PACs with the aim of catching potential mistakes quickly. While unusual, he didn’t see the move as a problem.










What the League of RI Businesses is doing is taking it to an extreme. It’s unprecedented.”


– Ric Thornton, campaign finance director for the Rhode Island Board of Elections 


But John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, does. 
“Structuring it this way could allow some very wealthy individuals to have an outsized influence on elections,” Marion said. 
Which is perhaps why federal campaign finance law states that only “nonconnected PACs” can max out annual donations to candidates.
Levesque, The League’s co-founder and manager of all 40 PACs, shrugged off concerns.
“Whether you have one PAC or 40 PACs, as long as you have your own separate bank accounts, which we do, and you abide by the state campaign finance laws as to how much you can share, there’s no problem,” Levesque said.
The municipal committees have yet to start raising or spending money. Most had a $5 or $10 balance, donated by Levesque or the statewide PAC, as of Sept. 30, according to the most recent state campaign finance reports.

Power in numbers 
Levesque promises large sums of money will start flowing fast. Already, the group has raised $60,000 collectively, Levesque said. 
“We’ve made more progress than the Democratic Party and the Republican Party,” Levesque said. 
In the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, the statewide PAC raised nearly $10,000, including $2,000 donations from Providence hedge fund manager Russ Jeffrey; Gary Gosselin, co-owner of Shannon Motors, and Walter Martish, who owns chemical company Lincoln Fine Ingredients. Levesque also personally donated nearly $450 in the third quarter. The state PAC ended the period with $2,314 cash on hand, after spending more than $11,000, including $9,000 for political consulting by Michael Levesque, a prominent figure in Rhode Island politics whose career includes two terms as West Warwick Mayor and leading the Rhode Island GOP Chairman. Michael and David Levesque are not related. 
David Levesque considers himself a political outsider. He’s never run for office, never run a campaign, never even finished high school, he said. His strategy comes from observations, lived experiences and deep-rooted ties to the business community. 
“I just pay attention, I read a lot, I listen to people,” he said.
Levesque identifies as a Republican, and vocal Trump supporter, but The League bills itself as nonpartisan. However, its “common sense” platform rings conservative, preaching “disciplined spending,” and “reasonable gun ownership rules” along with cutting taxes on retirement benefits, estate transfers and high-value second homes.
The three candidates endorsed by The League so far are Democrats, though their platforms appear less progressive than the incumbent lawmakers they are looking to unseat.
Mark Mesrobian, general manager of Bonnet Shores Beach Club, has The League’s endorsement to challenge Sen. Alana DiMario for Senate District 36. The PAC has also backed Laura Turini, a nurse anesthetist, as the Democratic challenger to Sen. Bridget Valverde in Senate District 35, and attorney Leah Bosclair to primary against Rep. Tina Spears in House District 36. 
All three incumbents supported gun restrictions, including a comprehensive state ban on assault- style weapons before it was watered down in a compromise reached on the final day of the 2025 legislative session.

Taking aim at progressives 
Levesque insisted that gun rights were one of many issues — not the sole focus —  The League considered in its endorsements. Mesrobian, for example, approached him with the interest in running a challenge to DiMario. 
“I am not targeting her,” he said of DiMario. “Mark came to me. We think he’s a better candidate than her. We need someone that’s going to be pro-business.”
DiMario in response pointed to her votes of support for relief for small businesses in the wake of the pandemic, workforce development initiatives and removing the state tangible tax.
“They are an anti-gun safety group, not a business group,” DiMario said. “If they were a business group, they would be looking at my record.”
DiMario also said her three consecutive legislative victories as a candidate who campaigned on gun safety show that district voters support stricter gun laws.










They are an anti-gun safety group, not a business group. If they were a business group, they would be looking at my record.


– Sen. Alana DiMario, a Narragansett Democrat, on The League of RI Businesses 


Many of the Senate Democrats who The League is looking to challenge in  2026 primaries — identified on a webpage titled “The Wall” — also supported the attempt to oust the late Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, and later, after Ruggerio’s death, the challenge to now-President Valarie Lawson. 
For example, Democratic Sen. Ryan Pearson, Ruggerio’s former second-in-command who unsuccessfully battled Ruggerio for the president’s seat in Nov. 2024, and ran against Lawson in late April, is one of the candidates identified by The League on “The Wall.”
But Levesque said he is not interested in the personal political feuds of either chamber. 
“If there’s somebody up there who’s not doing what they are supposed to be, then we don’t want them there,” Levesque said. 
Pearson, for example, missed a string of Senate sessions following Lawson’s election — a sign of poor performance to Levesque.
Pearson acknowledged that he deliberately skipped a few legislative sessions directly after the April leadership election in order to give the newly elected Senate leaders “an opportunity to lead without distraction.” However, he highlighted his 13-year attendance record at the State House, including as former chair of the Finance Committee and later as majority leader, positions which often necessitated 10-hour days at the State House.
Levesque is much more open in his desire to oust Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat who voted alongside 11 Democrats to advance the more comprehensive assault weapons ban out of committee.  Levesque said Casimiro privately acknowledged her concerns with the proposed legislation in conversations with him, but recommended the bill anyway. And according to Levesque, Casimiro did not have a good explanation for her change of heart.
“We will do everything we can to get her out of office,” Levesque said.
Casimiro did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.
Shekarchi, who is backing all incumbent House Democrats, disagreed with Levesque’s criticism of sitting lawmakers.
“Everyone in the House is doing their jobs,” Shekarchi said. Of Spears specifically, he added, “I think Tina is one of the best representatives we’ve seen in a long time. I will fully 100% support her.”
Talk vs. action 
Shekarchi remained skeptical that The League’s splashy announcements and big-money PAC strategy would amount to much.
“It’s a lot of talk,” Shekarchi said. “There are always people who come out guns blazing after I tell them to get involved. How well they actually do it, and how they perform, we’ll have to wait and see.”
Indeed, prior efforts to spur competition in state elections outside the confines of the two-party system have had little staying power, Marion said. There’s little trace left of the Moderate Party that former gubernatorial candidate Ken Block started in the early aughts. The conservative-leaning Rhode Island Taxpayers, also known as the Rhode Island Statewide Coalition and the Rhode Island Shoreline Coalition, disbanded in 2016 amid waning financial support, The Public’s Radio (now Ocean State Media) reported.
“For a really long time the history of America is a history of a two-party system,” Marion said. “Trying to sidestep that has generally been a fool’s errand.”
More productive to good government watchdogs: reforming the state campaign finance laws that let The League leverage a multi-PAC strategy in the first place.
Common Cause may include this proposal as part of its 2026 state legislative package, Marion said.
DiMario was also eyeing The League’s strategy as an opportunity for policy change.
“I am not really concerned about that,” she said of Mesrobian’s challenge to her seat. “Money doesn’t win elections. Hard work wins elections.”
But, she continued, “I think this provides an opportunity for the General Assembly to look at campaign finance laws and to see where we need to tighten up some loopholes to make sure that money can’t have an outsized influence on the outcome of elections.
The state Board of Elections could alternatively develop internal regulations, or propose legislation, addressing campaign spending by related PACs. Christopher Hunter, a spokesperson for the board, declined to comment.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Voters spoke loud and clear in this fall’s General Election: the cost of living is the most important issue for Virginians right now. That includes utility bills that continue to rise year after year. Lawmakers are debating how to bring those bills down in the midst of the unprecedented demand for power and climate change impacts.
“Our agenda is focused on lowering costs, lifting wages, expanding opportunity,” said House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth.
In recent days, House Democrats released some of their priority bills – two of which zoom in on energy efficiency in homes. Here’s a look at what these measures would accomplish.
 House Bill 3: Establishing an Income-Qualified Energy Efficiency and Weatherization Task Force 

The major utilities in the state, namely Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Company, already have weatherization and efficiency programs that customers can opt into. They also have upgrades and improvements programs for low-income households. However, Democrats want a task force to take a closer look at any barriers that may be keeping low-income customers from utilizing these programs.
The legislation establishes a group of at least 12 citizen members and representatives from the Department of Energy, Social Services, the Attorney General’s Office and a staff member from the Commission on Utility Regulation.
The task force will be expected to create a report by the end of Sept. 2027 on how many households meet the income requirements for efficiency programs, how many of those homes are in need of weatherization, how many homes have been submitted to providers for improvements but are on the waitlist, how many homes have gotten state or utility sponsored upgrades, and any barriers there may be in implementing the programs.
As part of the Virginia Clean Economy Act, Virginia utilities each have efficiency goals they are expected to meet, which means they have to find ways for their ratepayers to cut back on the amount of energy they use through smart thermostats, rebate programs for more energy efficient appliances, or rewards for using less power during high demand time periods.
Homeowners that would qualify for these programs would have to make 60% of Virginia’s median income, or 200% of the federal poverty level, whichever is higher.
 House Bill 2: Reducing heating related costs by requiring utilities to provide energy efficiency upgrades

On top of the requirements to meet energy reductions by certain years set out in the legislation, this proposed bill would implement a requirement that 30% of their qualified customers receive efficiency measures and improvements by the end of 2031.
The State Corporation Commission would have to deem those improvements to be in the public interest. Should the SCC’s make that determination the utilities would have to “lower each household’s total heating-related energy costs, which determination shall be subject to Commission review and approval, and based upon widely available and credible energy consumption and cost data,” according to the legislation.
The utilities would be able to work with the Department of Energy to utilize state and federal funding sources to aid in their efforts to implement the programs.
The proposed legislation also asks the utilities to report to the SCC by January 2028 about how much their efforts to reduce heating costs have translated into savings for customers and how it potentially cuts back on energy infrastructure needs such as transmission lines, power generation and the importing of energy.
Both of these bills will be considered in the 2026 General Assembly legislative session that begins Jan. 14.
The state previously received funding for efficiency programs through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Virginia joined the multi-state agreement in 2020, which brought the commonwealth into the cap and trade program aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions from the power sector. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin pulled the state from the agreement in 2024, stating that the additional $2 on utility bills to fund the program was an unnecessary tax. A Floyd County Circuit Court judge ruled last November that “the attempted repeal of the RGGI Regulation is unlawful, and thereby null and void,”
While the fate of the state’s involvement in RGGI is still held up in the courts, things could change under the Spanberger administration. The Gov.-elect has said she would put the state back into the agreement to bring that funding stream back for flooding and efficiency programs. However, it is not clear when that would occur.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s financial analysts say education costs are poised to rise over the next two years — but with enrollment still in flux, lawmakers don’t yet know how much the state will ultimately have to spend. 
Last week, the House and Senate money committees met separately to assess what they will face across major funding areas, including K-12 education, over the coming biennium. The briefings were part of a broader effort to understand how to financially support Virginia as the state absorbs changes from the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” or HR 1, which will affect SNAP and Medicaid benefits.
Virginia will be responsible for offsetting at least some of the costs.
“Education funding continues to be a top priority,” said House Education Committee Chair Sam Rasoul, D-Roanoke. “Clearly the impacts of HR 1 are creating havoc on forecasting further investments. We will work hard to fund education priorities in this chaotic environment.”
Because enrollment data is a core factor in calculating Standards of Quality costs — the formula determining how much the state and localities must contribute — both committees are still waiting for updated projections. Simultaneously, lawmakers have been considering ways to address the decades-old funding formula that researchers have found underestimates and inadequately accounts for English Learners and students with special needs. 
So far, data from the Virginia Department of Education show enrollment continues to decline, driven largely by declining birth rates and migration patterns. 
Kenita Matthews, a VDOE spokeswoman, told The Mercury the agency is still collecting daily membership counts from all 132 school divisions. The reports were due Sept. 30.
“Unfortunately, we have had numerous divisions with delayed submissions that have impacted the release of the latest attendance data,” Mathews said in a statement. “We have sent letters to the final remaining divisions that have not submitted their annual report as of November 18 copying their governing board chairs and board of supervisors chairs.”
Using data from the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at the University of Virginia, VDOE staff told the Board of Education earlier this month that K-12 enrollment is projected to keep declining, with more than 30,000 fewer students expected statewide.
The board will receive a presentation on funding schools for the next two years at its Dec. 10 work session. Enrollment data for the current school year will be provided in January.
As part of the state’s rebenchmarking process, officials are reviewing the cost of maintaining direct aid to programs for the next two years. Both chambers estimate the baseline cost at no less than $844 million. Those areas include specialized student populations, targeted support, school operations, special incentives and personnel instructional expenses, which have risen. 
Salaries for the next biennium were adjusted to include two 3% salary increases for the 2024-2026 biennium, increasing the total base budget by $3.1 billion. Other projected costs include $134.4 million in one-time bonuses, a $332.3 million increase for students and specialized programs, $13.2 million for career and technical education and $18.4 billion for early reading intervention.
The committees are still seeking updates on sales tax revenue, English Learner enrollment and final inflation figures.
Analysts in the two chambers produced different projections for  the total cost of funding schools over the next two years — a gap of $122 million — tied to whether the state fully funds the Virginia Preschool Initiative. Planning and Budgeting estimated a cost of $120 million over the biennium.
The House used a lower estimate of $32.3 million, which aligns with typical spending.
Senate Education and Health Committee Chair Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, said supporting “high quality” schools is essential while balancing and meeting the state’s other urgent needs in crafting the next budget.  
“Education remains a cornerstone of our economic future, and we must remain committed to securing the resources to recruit excellent educators, maintain safe schools, and ensure students in every community can succeed,” Hashmi said in a statement to The Mercury. 
“At the same time, we cannot ignore critical pressure points on health care, behavioral health, and essential services for our most vulnerable residents. These areas also directly affect the conditions in which our students learn and develop.”
Lawmakers return to Richmond on Jan. 14 for the start of the General Assembly.

(Getty photo)If you have ever watched a loved one pull away from conversations, skip social events, or stop answering the phone, hearing loss may be part of the reason. It does not happen overnight, but little by little, struggling to hear can chip away at confidence, connection, and happiness.


Recognize any of these warning signs?
If so, it may be time for a hearing test:

People seem to mumble more often.
Your family says the TV or radio is too loud.
Telephone conversations are becoming difficult.
You frequently ask people to repeat themselves.
You notice ringing, buzzing, or hissing in your ears.
You no longer hear common household sounds.
Group conversations are hard to follow.
You hear, but struggle to understand words clearly.
You have trouble hearing when your back is turned.
Others tell you that you speak too loudly.



A recent study published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that older adults who treat their hearing loss retain one additional person in their close social circle compared to those who do not. Even one more friend or family member to talk with can make a meaningful difference. Staying connected keeps the mind sharp and the mood lifted.
Hearing loss is far more than a change in volume. When conversations become hard to follow, people naturally step back. They might smile and nod without catching everything or avoid group settings because it is tiring to keep up. Over time, that withdrawal can lead to loneliness, depression, and cognitive decline. Research now shows that treating hearing loss is among the top modifiable actions to reduce the risk of developing dementia, making hearing care an important part of protecting brain health and overall wellbeing.
The good news is that treating hearing loss has never been easier. Today’s advanced technology, including AI-powered hearing aids, automatically adjusts to surroundings and helps the brain focus on the sounds that matter most. These devices do not simply make things louder. They make life clearer and more natural.
There is also growing recognition that hearing care needs to be more accessible. Lawmakers are reviewing ways to expand Medicare coverage for hearing and balance services so older adults can get help without barriers. Hearing health is health, and it deserves the same attention as vision or dental care.
I meet many people who have waited too long to address their hearing loss, often because they did not know where to start or assumed help was out of reach. But once they take that first step, everything changes.










Hearing health is health, and it deserves the same attention as vision or dental care.


In my practice in Woonsocket, I see transformations like this every day. It is heartwarming to see a loved one begin participating in conversations again after a long period of withdrawal. A patient’s daughter-in-law was in awe as she watched her mother-in-law engage more at family gatherings, share memories, ask the great-grandkids questions and laugh at their jokes. Seeing this inspired her to schedule an appointment for her husband, who was beginning to show signs of hearing loss.
Although he was skeptical, trying on hearing aids helped him realize how much he had been missing. A month later, his students admitted they had stopped asking him questions because they thought he was ignoring them. He soon saw his classroom engagement rise and felt less exhausted after work. He had not realized that straining to keep up was causing physical fatigue.
Stories like this show how one person’s experience can encourage others to take action. In this family, helping the matriarch led to her son getting help. His experience then encouraged his aunt to revisit hearing aids after five years without them. Her frustrations were simple. They no longer fit comfortably. With some of the smallest devices available, I was able to show her custom options that suited her needs.
Hearing loss is not just an elderly concern. I have seen patients in their mid-thirties seek help after noticing that conversations were becoming harder to follow and that they were increasingly sensitive to loud noises.
One concerned wife brought her reluctant 35-year-old husband to the Woonsocket clinic. “I have to repeat myself so often that I sometimes do not even bother talking to him.” It was a painful statement for a young couple raising children. As a shy introvert working from home, he had not noticed much difference in his own life. But hearing his wife explain how it was affecting their family finally encouraged him to take the next step. After two weeks he shared that his sons were delighted he was more present, and he was amazed at how much he had been missing.
Every day, patients admit they never wanted hearing aids, but now they cannot imagine life without them. Hearing care enriches daily life, strengthens relationships, and supports long-term health.

In r[...]","Marjorie Taylor Greene speaks at an April town hall in Cobb County. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderCongresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s abrupt announcement that she plans to resign from office early next year is likely to send ripples through Georgia’s political landscape.
Greene, formerly among President Donald Trump’s staunchest allies, announced her plans in a video message Friday, citing frustrations with the political system and the president. In recent months, Greene and Trump had publicly sparred over topics including the release of the Epstein files.
Once she officially leaves office on Jan. 5, it will be up to Gov. Brian Kemp to set a date for a special election to replace her.
Kemp’s office said Monday that there’s no word on timing yet. State law gives the governor 10 days to issue a call for an election starting from the day of the resignation. After that, the election can be held after 30 days have passed from the governor’s order. That means the election could come in mid February at the earliest, though it will likely be held later.
A crowded field
Qualifying for the race will begin after Kemp officially calls for the special election. A race for an open seat usually attracts a lot of candidates, and the race to replace Greene is likely to be no exception.
Several candidates had already filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission to run against Greene when she was set to go up for re-election in November along with all of Georgia’s other congressional members. They include:

Republican Star Black, a Federal Emergency Management Agency employee and entrepreneur.
Republican actor Elvis Casely
Republican business owner Jeff Criswell
Republican Uloma Ekpete
Independent Rob “Rush” Ruszkowski

Democrat Shawn Harris, a retired Army Brigadier General and farmer who challenged Greene in 2024 and earned just over 35% of the vote, has announced plans to run again next year.
On Saturday, Christian Hurd, a U.S. Marine and Dalton resident, announced his plans to run on an “America first” platform including building new infrastructure and banning the purchase of single-family homes by private equity firms.
Members of Congress are not required to live in the districts they serve. Greene herself originally announced a run for a more moderate metro Atlanta district in 2019 but moved her home and her campaign to the 14th District after former U.S. Rep. Tom Graves announced his plans to retire, so the seat could once again see candidates declare from out of the district.
Downstream effects
A congressional race with no incumbent is also likely to attract sitting politicians looking to run for higher office.
“I think we’re going to see a lot of dominoes falling,” said Kennesaw State University professor of political science and former Cobb County Republican Party Chair Jason Shepherd.
A number of state senators are rumored to be considering heading up to Washington, and that’s all part of the process, said Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie.
“This is actually kind of part of the natural life cycle of running for office,” she said. “When you have an open seat, which doesn’t happen often, especially in a safe district like the 14th District, when you have somebody who chooses to retire, that is kind of an expression of pent up ambition in terms of the number of people who end up running for the seat.”
Much of the Republican leadership in the state Senate already plans to run for higher office, and other GOP lawmakers could be attracted to an open seat in the deep red district.
State Sen. Colton Moore, a Trenton Republican, has openly flirted with a run.
“I’m exploring a run for Congress because Northwest Georgia needs a fighter who won’t bow to the swamp,” Moore said in a statement. “With Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resignation, I’m seriously considering stepping up to fight alongside President Donald J. Trump to advance the America First Agenda that’s turning our country around.”
Moore is popular among conservative voters in his district, but he has riled his party’s leadership under the Gold Dome, including in 2023 when the Republican Senate Caucus suspended Moore after he revealed their personal contact information as part of a pressure campaign to impeach Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis.
Last year, Moore was arrested outside the state Capitol after trying to force his way into the House chamber despite being banned from entering. Moore had been exiled from the chamber by GOP House Speaker Jon Burns after speaking ill of the late House Speaker David Ralston, a Blue Ridge Republican, while Ralston was being posthumously honored in the Senate.
Other state senator names being tossed around by politicos as potential candidates include Majority Leader Jason Anavitarte, a Dallas Republican; Republican Sen. Ed Setzler of Acworth, author of the state’s religious freedom law and six-week abortion ban, and Republican Sen. Chuck Payne of Dalton, a U.S. Army veteran who chairs the Senate Committee on Veterans, Military and Homeland Security.
Anavitarte, Setzler and Payne did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.
The timing of the race could put wrinkles into the plans of potential candidates. The 2026 legislative session, when state lawmakers all come to Atlanta to pass laws, is set to begin Jan. 12 and could last through late March or early April.
Members of the state Legislature are banned from raising campaign money during the legislative session when running for a state office like governor, or when they are seeking re-election, but they are free to fundraise for a run at federal office like Congress.
“The question will be, however, obviously that if you’re down there working in the general assembly during the session, it’s hard to be back in the district campaigning, so the likelihood is you’ll see a number of them resign,” Shepherd said.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Staff cuts at an Ohio Planned Parenthood affiliate have been finalized, according to the union who represents workers there. Amid the cuts, staff were also notified that a clinic in the system will close this month.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio announced the plan for cuts in early November, but with the union in place, negotiations were necessary before details could be finalized.
The cuts came into play because of federal spending losses specifically for Planned Parenthood nationally, but also cuts to Medicaid, which makes up a significant base of patients for the organization.
Nationally, Planned Parenthood has said the Medicaid cuts will impact more than 1 million patients, and put more than 200 clinics at risk.
Two primary care/family planning clinics in Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region’s system already closed earlier this year due to the cuts.
The Greater Ohio affiliate’s union, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio Workers United, works under the Office of Professional Employees International Union Local 98.
Union organizer Clarie Randall told the Capital Journal that the reduction in force was implemented on Nov. 18.
Leaders at the affiliate confirmed the date the staff cuts went into effect, saying the cuts “impacted 17 staff members in family planning across the organization.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Staff were notified by affiliate leaders that the clinic in Franklinton would be closing as part of the staff reduction, with all workers at that location subject to the layoffs.
In their statement to the Capital Journal on Friday, Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio said it has “altered staffing arrangements” at the Franklinton and North Columbus locations.
“Ultimately, we will close the Franklinton location on Nov. 28, 2025, and we will work to transfer these patients to our North Columbus location,” the statement read.
Leaders at the organization said the federal spending and Medicaid cuts amounted to about $10 million in losses for the Ohio branch alone.
Medicaid patients make up about 40% of the recipients of their care, according to Erica Wilson-Domer, president and CEO of the Greater Ohio branch.
So the loss of those patients on top of other federal funding cuts caused a need for “right-sizing” as Wilson-Domer put it when the reduction in force was announced in November.
The closure of the Franklinton clinic will leave 11 health centers across Ohio, along with two ambulatory surgical centers in Bedford Heights and Columbus.
Randall said the workers understand that “nobody wants to be doing these layoffs,” but some action had to take place.
This second reduction in force came “seemingly out of nowhere,” however, just months after the first staff cuts made by the organization in the summer of 2025.
“While we as the union have a different take on where the money could come from to fill the gaps, and think that management should be taking a little bit more of the burden on, there are financial holes to be filled,” Randall said.
The first cuts were also attributed to a lack of funding to sustain operations as usual.
The summer reduction cut a total of 20 staff members, 17 of which were members of the union.
“People definitely weren’t expecting this quick of a turnaround for another (reduction in force),” Randall said.
Wilson-Domer said in November that cuts to the tune of $2 million had already happened at the administrative level, and that area of the organization had “gotten as lean as we can go.”
Planned Parenthood state leaders have maintained that none of the federal funding they have received has gone to abortion care, since that has long been prohibited by federal law.

Concord and Laconia were the only two cities in New Hampshire to clear the way for social districts, where public drinking would be allowed in designated areas. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Voters in Concord and Laconia approved ballot measures earlier this month to allow “social districts” in their cities, and local officials are in the early stages of deciding what they’ll look like.
The districts were enabled by legislation that went into effect in September. The law allows towns and cities to create areas where certain alcohol laws are partially suspended to allow public drinking. Patrons will be required to drink alcohol only out of designated containers, with time limits set and signage posted for the districts.
While Portsmouth, Nashua, and Keene voters all rejected social districts, 52% percent in Concord and 56% in Laconia saw enough upside to grant their approval.
In Laconia, Kristin Bastille, the owner of Defiant Records and Craft Beer and the Candy Bar, is amped for social districts to come to her town. She was among the business owners who pushed city officials to put the measure on the ballot.
Bastille hopes to see a social district on Main Street where Defiant Record and Craft Beer is located. The various festivals and events the city holds — such as the Laconia Pumpkin Festival, the annual Charity Car Show, Laconia Bike Week, and Concerts on Canal — would be ideal times to have these social districts, she said. Laconia already allows outdoor drinking for some events, she said, but not without headaches.
“It’s kind of a process,” Bastille said. “Instead of just being able to automatically be allowed to do that and not be sectioned off. We’re usually in a small section where we can allow it. But for the car shows people automatically assume they can walk the street. So they’ll come out with a beer, and then they’ll try to cross the street or go down the street, and they can’t.”
During the same election in which Laconia voters approved social districts, they also elected Mike Bordes as mayor. Bordes, a three-term state representative, was a co-sponsor of the social districts legislation, House Bill 467. Now, as he prepares to take over City Hall, he is set to implement on the local level a bill he helped pass on the state level.
“A lot of times we cast bills, and we don’t really firsthand get to sculpt out what they become,” Bordes said. “So now we can actually take the bill and put it to action.”
Bordes said he believes social districts will be great for revitalizing downtown, boosting tourism, and bringing foot traffic to local businesses. He hopes to see a social district downtown around Canal Street, but plans to meet with his new colleagues on the city council and staff on the topic over the next few weeks as they work to establish the first social districts.
City Manager Kirk Beattie said because Laconia has lots of experience with festivals in which alcohol is consumed, “it’s not going to be a huge stretch for us to try to figure out how we want to do it and how we want to create these districts.”
In Concord, planning is in much earlier stages. Mayor Byron Champlin said the city hasn’t even fully decided whether it’s going to implement social districts.
“I think what’s important to realize here is that we’re not talking about a social district,” Champlin said. “We’re talking about the opportunity, if desired, to create one or more social districts.”
He said the ballot measure simply gives city officials the legal authority to implement social districts. He said the reason he supported putting it on the ballot was that, because the legislation requires voter approval, if the city didn’t do it this month, it would’ve had to wait until the next election in late 2027 to consider it again.
“I don’t think having a social district is automatic,” he said. “There are a lot of hoops that have to be gone through.”
Now, he said, bar and restaurant owners must come forward saying they would like to participate in creating a social district. The city council would then need to approve the plan and create guidelines. He said he hasn’t been in communication with any business owners yet.
He said one thing he would consider in any request is how a social district might affect Concord’s family-friendliness.
“If we were looking at Market Days (the annual downtown Concord festival), what would the impact be on Market Days being a family event?” he said. “Would this create any concern on the part of people with their kids downtown if people could be walking around with an open container?”
At-Large City Councilor Amanda Grady-Sexton said she’s seen a lot of excitement around social districts from her constituents.
Grady-Sexton said the issue should be referred to the city’s Public Safety Advisory Board, which she chairs, so the districts could be set up safely with assistance from the police and fire departments. Her hope, she said, is that social districts might help dispel Concord’s reputation as a sleepy town and spruce up downtown.
“That’s what the voters told me,” she said. “And that is absolutely what I heard: that people are looking for new energy. They are looking to find ways to keep young people in the community. Of course, affordable housing has been the number one challenge, but also, the reputational piece. That (Concord is) more of a place where older people convene, or business people, or people leaving the State House, versus a place where all sorts of younger people can come and enjoy downtown. And so I do think that is the reason why this passed. I think Concord voters are very deliberate.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/bicentennial-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-25 05:56:15.932429

(Photo by Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images for Autism Speaks)State Medicaid agencies are struggling to pay for an intensive therapy for children with autism — and looming federal Medicaid cuts are likely to make the problem worse.
Parents of children and young adults who receive applied behavior analysis, or ABA, worry states’ cost-saving measures will make it harder for them to get vital services. About 5% of children ages 3 to 17 on public insurance have autism spectrum disorder, compared with 2% who have private insurance, according to a CDC survey.
Many families and autism therapists say ABA can help improve communication and social skills, sharpen memory and focus, and replace challenging behaviors with positive ones. ABA therapy can range from 10 to 40 hours per week in different settings, including home and school. That makes it expensive.
In 2014, the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services mandated that all state Medicaid programs cover comprehensive autism services for children. It did not explicitly require coverage of ABA, but by 2022, every state Medicaid program covered ABA.
In addition, more kids are getting diagnosed with autism as screenings increase. As a result, state spending on the service has skyrocketed. In Indiana, for example, Medicaid spending on ABA therapy grew from $21 million in 2017 to $611 million in 2023. The sharp increase has prompted Indiana, and other states, to take steps to control costs.
Meanwhile, federal auditors have begun examining states’ coverage of ABA services to ferret out fraud and abuse.










For such a costly and intensive service, the states need to explore how to best reimburse this benefit so that it's sustainable and promotes quality.


– Mariel Fernandez, vice president of government affairs at the Council of Autism Service Providers


Mariel Fernandez, vice president of government affairs at the Council of Autism Service Providers, a nonprofit trade association, acknowledged that states are facing difficult choices.
“For such a costly and intensive service, the states need to explore how to best reimburse this benefit so that it’s sustainable and promotes quality,” said Fernandez, who is also a board-certified behavioral analyst. “Is [the rate] going to bankrupt Medicaid? Is it going to ensure that people are actually receiving the service?”
The Medicaid changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July will increase the pressure: The law includes more than $900 billion in federal spending cuts over the next decade. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal government and the states.
Meanwhile, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has described autism as a rapidly growing “epidemic” in the U.S. and has made it a major focus of his tenure. Kennedy has promoted the debunked theory that there’s a link between childhood vaccines and autism.
Curbing costs
Several states this year have considered curbing ABA costs by capping therapy hours, tightening provider enrollment rules, reducing reimbursement rates or changing patient eligibility rules. A bill in New York, for example, would establish a 680-hour annual cap on ABA services.
But nowhere has the issue been more prominent than in Indiana, where Medicaid has covered ABA therapy since 2016.
Governor’s group recommends ABA usage cap, rate changes as Medicaid costs rise

Historically, Indiana Medicaid has reimbursed ABA providers for most services at a rate of 40%, regardless of what they charged.
That “created some very strange incentives for a small portion of the provider network,” said Jason McManus, president of Indiana Providers of Effective Autism Treatment (InPEAT), which represents smaller ABA providers in Indiana and larger providers that operate in Indiana and elsewhere. “You had folks who were charging exorbitant amounts for the service.”
Beginning in 2024, Indiana lowered its reimbursement rate to about $68 per hour — and received plenty of pushback.
“That did have an impact on the provider community,” McManus said. “You had a lot of folks, smaller shops, who ended up closing their doors or consolidating with other organizations. So that was disruptive.”
And that year, the HHS inspector general issued a report which found that Indiana’s Medicaid program made at least $56 million in “improper” payments to ABA therapy providers in 2019 and 2020.
The state’s rapidly rising ABA costs and the federal audit prompted Republican Gov. Mike Braun to issue an executive order earlier this year creating a working group to examine ways to cut costs without compromising quality.
The group crafted recommendations to correct the problems identified in the federal audit and put ABA coverage on a financially sustainable path. Without changes in the state’s reimbursement policies, the group concluded, Indiana’s Medicaid spending on ABA therapy would reach a projected $825 million by 2029.
This month, Braun unveiled the group’s recommendations, which include the creation of a new ABA office to increase oversight and lower reimbursement rates, which the state has not yet detailed.
ABA allows people with autism “to obtain the highest level of independence that’s possible for them,” said McManus, who served on the working group.
“But from a state perspective, I can see how, if you’re purely just looking at the cost, you would say, ‘Wow, this is a cost that has grown over time, and if absent all other contexts, this is something we need to pay attention to, because it’s unsustainable.’”
Nebraska rate cut
In Nebraska, state officials also have been looking for ways to control spiraling ABA costs: Last year, Nebraska Medicaid paid out more than $85 million for ABA therapy, a surge from $4.6 million in 2020.
Democratic governors launch multistate public health alliance to counter Trump, RFK Jr.

In July, the state announced that it would cut its Medicaid reimbursement rates for ABA, including a 48% cut to reimbursement for direct therapy provided by a behavior technician. That brought the rate to $74.80 per hour, down from about $144 per hour. Rates for therapy by physicians or other board-certified professionals also were reduced by about 37%.
Many providers saw the cuts coming, as the state has had the highest hourly reimbursement rate in the nation.
“It would be fiscally irresponsible of the state to maintain that,” said Leila Allen, vice president of external affairs at Lighthouse Autism Center, which has ABA therapy centers in Nebraska as well as in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and North Carolina.
Sam Wallach, president of Attain, an ABA therapy provider that operates in Nebraska and a dozen other states and Washington, D.C., said the service is “life-changing for children and families.” He views the ABA reduction as a “correction” that will make it feasible for Nebraska Medicaid to continue to cover it.
“The previous rates were well above what most Medicaid programs pay nationally, and while that created short-term benefits, it wasn’t realistic or sustainable,” Wallach said.
But some providers are taking issue with the way Nebraska went about those cuts.
For example, the state provided only 30 days’ notice before making the change. “There were providers that within 30 days had to tell their staff, ‘We’re so sorry. We have to cut your salary by ‘x’ percent in 30 days,’” Allen said.
Nebraska also didn’t examine how much it costs to provide ABA in the state, she said. The new rate is closer to what neighboring states, such as Iowa, pay. But therapists are few and far between in sparsely populated Nebraska, and families there often have to travel long distances to reach ABA providers.
“There was no cost survey to determine what the cost should be,” said Allen. “They didn’t take into account that you do have to pay people a little bit more to be able to work as behavior analysts in Nebraska.”
Finding ABA therapists in Nebraska is particularly difficult for families with older kids. Angela Gleason, executive secretary on the board of autism advocacy organization Arc of Nebraska, has a 13-year-old son with autism. She said many companies only serve very young children, up to age 6.
“So for families like mine, it’s then hard to even find a company that will serve his age and will provide that kind of support,” she said. To be able to afford therapy, her son Teddy has Medicaid coverage as his secondary insurance. ABA therapy helps him with socializing and speaking with his speech delay.
“He needs a lot more help throughout his day than a normal 13-year-old without autism might need,” Gleason said.
North Carolina court case
In North Carolina, the cost of covering autism services, including ABA, will total an estimated $639 million in fiscal 2026, up 425% from 2022, according to the state’s Medicaid agency. About five autism providers made up roughly 41% of the state’s increase in spending in fiscal year 2023-2024, according to the state.
GOP-led lawsuit that could dismantle disability protections draws public backlash

Effective on Oct. 1, North Carolina Medicaid cut reimbursement rates for all kinds of health care services, arguing that state legislators had not budgeted enough money to keep up with rising costs. The reductions, which ranged from 3% to 10%, included a 10% cut to the reimbursement rate for autism services, including ABA therapy.
But the families of 21 children immediately sued the state Department of Health and Human Services to halt the move, arguing that it was discriminatory because it targeted children with disabilities.
Earlier this month, the families won a preliminary injunction temporarily halting the rate cut.
But families across the state are on edge as children with autism often see multiple providers — psychologists and speech language pathologists, for example — whose rate cuts were not paused, according to Allen, of Lighthouse Autism Center.
David Laxton, director of communications for the Autism Society of North Carolina, which is also a provider, said many providers won’t be able to absorb the rate reductions and continue operating.
“At some point, the math is not going to math,” Laxton said.
“It’s very stressful for families, because right now, there’s not an end in sight,” Laxton said. “There’s agreement that this [service] is very important, but there’s not been action to bring an end to the cuts.”

The Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles has fired a longtime employee nearly five years after investigators found he used his position to garner steep discounts on cars he bought from a towing company, according to a termination letter obtained last week.
The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica reported in March on the accusations against Dominik Stefanski and the DMV’s failure to take action against him or the towing company. The story was part of a larger series about how Connecticut’s towing laws have come to favor tow truck companies over vehicle owners and how the DMV’s lack of oversight has allowed abuses in the system. The DMV investigated Stefanski for over a year beginning in 2020 but didn’t fire him until early November, months after the news organizations’ story.
According to the 2020-21 DMV investigation, when employees of D&L Auto Body & Towing in Berlin, Connecticut, went to the main DMV office in nearby Wethersfield, they would make eye contact with Stefanski, who would then allow them to cut the slow-moving DMV lines. In exchange for this favor, the report said, D&L employees would allow Stefanski to select vehicles that had been towed by the company weeks or months before. D&L would then undervalue the cars on DMV forms, investigators said, allowing Stefanski to buy them cheaply and resell them for a profit.
In total, DMV investigators found that from 2015 to 2019, D&L sold 15 vehicles to an investment firm owned by Stefanski, who had worked for the agency since 1999 and was then a document examiner in the DMV’s main office. In one case, Stefanski bought a Cadillac for $1,000 and sold it for $17,500. The car was eventually sold by another company for $23,250.
In 2020, DMV investigators recommended that Stefanski be criminally charged for the scheme they alleged made him thousands of dollars, and they completed an arrest warrant. A prosecutor decided not to file charges, however, citing “prosecutorial discretion” and “insufficient evidence to meet the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” The prosecutor suggested the DMV could handle the matter internally.
But the DMV did not discipline Stefanski or issue fines against D&L in the years after the investigation. The agency declined to comment on the firing and declined to answer specific questions about the investigation.
Stefanski was placed on paid administrative leave in March, two business days after the story was published. He earned just over $72,000 annually. The Nov. 6 termination letter notes that he was fired for misconduct “when you used your position for financial gain.” 
Stefanski said he has appealed and anticipates having a hearing next month. In an interview with reporters earlier this year, Stefanski maintained that he hadn’t done anything wrong.
Reached by phone last week, Stefanski said that after the news organizations published the article, he had a hearing in which he presented evidence, including a check he received as a loan to buy one of the vehicles. He said the check proves he paid more for the vehicle than the warrant indicated.
The state rejected Stefanski’s argument.
“The agency did not find that the information presented provided any basis to mitigate the contemplated penalty of dismissal,” the termination letter said.
A D&L official declined to comment on the firing but said previously in a statement that the manager working with Stefanski was fired and that the company is working with the DMV “to ensure that this type of situation doesn’t happen again.”
“The company’s manager at the time acted on his own and thought he was doing the right thing by selling in-operable cars,” the statement said. According to investigators, many of the cars were in good condition.
Stefanski said his union is helping him with the appeal, but he declined to give details until it is over.
Logan Williams, a representative of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Council 4, which represents DMV workers, said the union can’t comment on the specifics of the case but that the rights of workers “derive their strength from the integrity of due process.”
“Every Union exists to defend this process and our members’ rights,” Williams said in a statement. “Whenever discipline is handed down in the workplace, our union has an obligation to ensure that the process is followed and that our members have access to due process.”
Stefanski said no one at the DMV indicated why he was being fired close to seven years after the incidents and five years after DMV investigators learned what was happening.
“They didn’t give me an explanation. They actually didn’t give me nothing,” Stefanski said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_0219_SR_Towing_016_preview_maxWidth_3000_maxHeight_3000_ppi_72_embedColorProfile_true_quality_95-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-25 05:56:15.932429

(Photo by Morgan Trau.)The Ohio Senate unanimously passed an academic intervention bill last week aimed to help students who score below proficient on state assessment tests. 
Ohio Senate Bill 19 would allow a public school student who scored below proficient in a state assessment test in math or English language arts to receive academic intervention services at no cost. 
The bill now heads to the Ohio House for consideration. 
“Our educational system must be responsive to the needs of our students,” said Ohio Sen. Andrew Brenner, R-Delaware. 
“If we are unable to say that our students who need the most help are in fact receiving assistance from their school, we are putting the interest of the adults ahead of the needs of the children.”

A fifth of Ohio students scored limited proficiency in English and almost a third of Ohio students scored at limited proficiency in math during the 2022-23 school year during state achievement tests, said Brenner, who introduced S.B. 19 bill earlier this year. 
“A disturbing number of Ohio children are in need of significant and prolonged academic intervention before it is too late to address their desperately needed learning loss,” he said. 
“Once a student demonstrates proficiency on a state assessment, they would no longer be required to receive academic intervention services, though the school may continue providing such services to students, if they so choose.”
State achievement tests assess a student’s comprehension in various subjects, including math and English. A student is assessed at one of five proficiency levels —  limited, basic, proficient, accomplished, and advanced. 
“Generally speaking, a student will need to answer approximately a quarter of the test questions correctly in order to achieve a rating of basic,” Brenner said. 
Ohio math and reading scores continue to be below pre-pandemic levels, according to the latest report from the National Center for Education Statistics.

The academic interventions in the bill must be evidence-based and could include high-dosage tutoring at least three days a week, additional instruction time, and an extended school calendar. 
Ohio S.B. 19 also deals directly with math intervention. 
The bill would require school districts or individual schools to come up with a math achievement improvement plan if 51% or less of the district or school’s students who took the third grade math achievement assessment scored at least a proficient score on the assessment.
Under the bill, schools would be required to develop math improvement and monitoring plans for each student that qualifies for math intervention services within 60 days after getting the student’s third grade assessment math results.
A math improvement and monitoring plan would identify the student’s “specific math deficiencies,” describe the additional instructional services they will receive, offer a chance for their parent or guardian to be involved, outline a monitoring process and offer high-dosage tutoring at least three days a week.
“Math is absolutely essential to our economy, to our national defense, to promoting peace throughout the world,” said Ohio Sen. Tim Schaffer, R-Lancaster. 
“Nothing happens without math. Business don’t transact. Machinery doesn’t work. Engineering, architectural designs don’t happen. Everything depends, ultimately, on the basis of good math.”

Last week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead of burning fossil fuels. “It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection[...]","The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. (Photo by Douglas Rissing/Getty Images)New England winters can get wicked cold. Last week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead of burning fossil fuels.
“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”
The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.
The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.
New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.
At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.
“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.
The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.
The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.
The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.
These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.
“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”
Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.
Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.
The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.
The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.
The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.
The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.
Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.
“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”

If the cancer isn’t gone by her follow up appointment in December, Phipps said she won’t be seeking additional treatment because her and her husband have decided to go without health insurance. Phipps […]","Kennebunk resident Rachel Phipps, here pictured with Gov. Janet Mills, is currently undergoing treatments for skin cancer, but said she may have to forgo insurance next year due to spiking costs. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Rachel Phipps, a retired social worker from Kennebunk, was diagnosed last month with skin cancer, which she has been getting treatments for. If the cancer isn’t gone by her follow up appointment in December, Phipps said she won’t be seeking additional treatment because her and her husband have decided to go without health insurance.
Phipps currently pays about $200 a month for her marketplace health insurance plan, covering herself and her husband, who owns a small woodworking business in Sanford. But without federal subsidies, her monthly premium will go up to $2,000 with an almost $15,000 out-of-pocket deductible, which they can’t afford.
“I’m not choosing to not have health care insurance next year, but I can’t afford $49,000 in health care,” she told Gov. Janet Mills, U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree and several other officials at a roundtable in South Portland on Monday. 
“So I might be one of the 51,000 people that they know will die next year without the extension of the tax subsidies,” she said, citing a June study from the Yale School of Public Health, which warned that the proposed changes to Medicaid and increasing health insurance costs could lead to tens of thousands of preventable deaths. 
That estimate was even before the pending expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, which subsidize the cost of marketplace health insurance for millions of Americans, including approximately 60,000 Mainers. 
Since Congress has not yet extended those credits, thousands of Maine residents — who are predominantly small business owners, older people or individuals that buy plans on the marketplace — now face significant increases in health costs. Experts are warning that the ripple effects of this increase will be felt by everyone, and will eventually result in an overburdened health care system with reduced services.
At the roundtable on Monday, Mills and Pingree called on the Trump administration to extend the subsidies in order to protect the state’s health care system and, by extension, Maine’s economy. 
Mills, who is currently challenging Republican Susan Collins in next year’s Senate race, said “it is time” for the country to develop a universal health care program.
“Whether you call it Medicare for All or something else, it’s clear the people of the United States deserve a universal health care plan and I would be committed to finding a way to get there,” said Mills, who signed an order expanding Medicaid in Maine on her first day as governor.
In the meantime, the governor said Maine would work to extend the state marketplace’s enrollment deadlines if Congress opts to extend the credits.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.) has pledged to hold a vote on the subsidy the first week of December, though House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) has not made such a promise. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee began more broad discussions about how to address rising health care costs last week. 
“The bottom line is more people will choose to go without health insurance if they can’t afford it,” Mills said, “delaying care until they wind up in the emergency room we’ve met and then with medical debt that lasts a lifetime.” 
“This has been deeply concerning to us, and now we are in the thick of it,” Pingree added.

Maine’s uninsured rate fell from 15% in 2019 to about 9% in part because of the enhanced premium tax credits that allowed more people to buy marketplace plans, according to Maine Bureau of Insurance Superintendent Bob Carey, who also attributed the rise to the expansion of Medicaid in Maine. 
If the tax credits expire, “it won’t have a direct, immediate impact on the uninsured rates but it will eventually for sure,” said Carey, whose agency regulates insurance providers that offer plans through the CoverME.gov state marketplace, after the round table.
More than 2,000 people who buy marketplace health insurance have already canceled their 2026 coverage, according to Hilary Schneider, director of the Office of the Health Insurance Marketplace. Thousands have also chosen to purchase high deductible plans, she said, making themselves liable to pay large amounts out of pocket, because that is all they can afford.
“Even for those who have enrolled and have decided that they can afford the 2026 coverage, they are paying more than last year,” she said. “This is another necessary household cost, and it is rising as household budgets continue to get squeezed.”
During the event, Carey warned people to be wary of scammers selling cheap plans, which people may resort to as authorized plans through CoverME.gov get more expensive. 
“People are going to start looking at alternatives, which worries me, because I’m going to have to deal with the consequences,” Carey said. “If people resort to alternatives that aren’t regulated by the bureau, these bad actors aren’t regulated by us, they don’t answer to us.”
These cheap plans don’t cover most services — something that customers often learn after they are already on the line for those costs, which Carey said can be worse than being uninsured.
Lack of affordable alternatives 
The cost of insurance is increasing in general next year, including for those who have insurance through their employers, because health care services are getting more expensive, Carey said. 
But the steepest increases will be felt by people like Phipps, whose tax credits are expiring.
Ossian Riday of Topsham told the panel that he originally delayed starting his own business because he was worried about insurance costs, and was only able to after the enhanced premium tax credits were put into place.
Last year, Riday was paying roughly $8,000 a year for his family, which rose to $13,000 this year. Now, if the subsidy expires, Riday’s family faces an annual rate of $29,000, which with out-of-pocket costs could go as high as $42,000.
“This is basically the equivalent of purchasing a new car every year,” Riday said. “The medical insurance system in the U.S. is broken, and without government intervention, it will only get worse.” 
Since the federal government shutdown concluded without an extension of the credits, Mainers have been warning about what their projected costs would mean for their lives and livelihoods.
At a Friday press conference hosted by the Maine Democratic Party, Portland-based artist Justin Levesque shared how he was born with a chronic condition called hemophilia, which makes him dependent on medication. 
Levesque said his insurance premium could double or triple, going up to $600 or $700 a month, which would throw his future as an artist into question.
“If folks can’t access their medication because they can’t even afford the premium, we’re going to see deaths, and we’re going to see people coming to harm,” Levesque said. “The ACA, being able to afford it, has changed my life. It has allowed me to follow my dreams and I’m really worried about the future.”
Pingree said Monday the people who will lose health insurance — small business owners, farmers, service industry workers and artists — make up a large portion of Maine’s economy. 
“Based on so many of these stories, there isn’t anywhere to turn, there isn’t an affordable plan,” she said. This is going to “have a huge detrimental impact on the Maine economy and the things we’re so proud of, growing our small businesses and our entrepreneurship and keeping more people in Maine.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1334-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-25 04:56:27.499571

(Photos/Graphic by  WEWS.)The Ohio governor’s race is narrowing as Democrat Dr. Amy Acton gears up for a fight against Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, likely avoiding a costly primary battle.
“Together, we are going to build the Ohio that we all want to live in,” Acton said in an interview on Friday afternoon.
Former Congressman Tim Ryan announced this morning that he will not be running for governor. This means Acton will remain the Democratic frontrunner.
But for Acton, Friday was just another day on the campaign trail.
We asked Acton if Ryan’s announcement came as a surprise.
“People like to create stories and drama, but I can tell you the work that we’re doing on the ground every day has been my focus,” Acton said.
She is also focused on facing off against Ramaswamy.
GOP leader Tony Schroeder said he was never worried about Ramaswamy’s chances, but the party would be more prepared to fight Ryan.
“Our great vice president, then-Senator JD Vance, showed us a pretty good lesson on how to defeat Tim Ryan, and the playbook was already there,” Schroeder said. “I think the playbook would be a little different this time.”
Each candidate is focusing on affordability, but Acton hopes to sway voters by supporting public education and health care.
Ramaswamy hopes to, and is succeeding, at getting the backing of Ryan’s former union support.
“While the Democrats have spent months fighting to secure their shrinking base, Vivek has been talking to voters of all political persuasions to build an unprecedented coalition of support that includes conservative leaders and farmers to truckers and labor unions — and we’re just getting started,” Ramaswamy’s spokesperson Connie Luck said after Ryan’s decision was announced.
“If you’re receiving union backing as a conservative Republican, you’re reaching a different sort of coalition, and I think that’s what we’re looking at coming into 2026,” Schroeder said.
Both Ramaswamy and Acton are also trying to make their campaigns about uniting the state, with Acton reminding the public that she worked closely with Gov. Mike DeWine.
The governor, unlike the majority of the Statehouse and congressional leaders, has not endorsed a candidate.
Previously, he told us he would support the Republican Party. Several weeks ago, he told us he would be endorsing Ramaswamy “soon.”
We asked him Friday why he had not endorsed Ramaswamy yet.
“That’s coming very soon,” he responded.
Pressed on when, but the governor smirked.
Acton and Ramaswamy have raised record amounts, money that Acton will get to save for the general election — instead of a contentious primary.
We asked Acton if she thinks the Democratic Party can now fully come together to support her.
“Well, I think what I’m seeing is that people in Ohio are uniting, uniting to create the kind of state that we all want to live in, that we all deserve,” Acton said.
She said she has started vetting for her lieutenant governor, which both she and Ramaswamy are expected to announce in the coming weeks.
Other candidates who have filed to run for governor include Republican Philip Funderburg, Democrat Jacob Chiara, and independent Tim Grady.
Heather Hill had previously announced she would run as a Republican but later stated she would run as either a Libertarian, an independent, or a member of Elon Musk’s America Party — a party that is not yet recognized in Ohio.
Together, that group has reported having about $1,500 cash on hand.
In contrast, Ramaswamy reported raising $9.7 million, and Acton reported about $1.4 million.
To make the primary ballot, a governor and lieutenant governor candidate must collect petition signatures together.
Party candidates have a deadline of Feb. 4.
For major parties, teams must collect at least 1,000 valid signatures, and minor parties have to collect 500.
Independents must have 5,000 signatures in by May 4.

(Getty Images)If you practice social work in Kansas or Missouri, you already know that access to care is more than a clinical question. It is a social justice question.
With the recent federal government shutdown and the expiration of pandemic-era telehealth waivers for Medicare, we are now witnessing disruptions that directly threaten vulnerable clients, our practices, and the wider social welfare network.
In October, funding and authorizations for key telehealth flexibilities under Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services lapsed. These waivers had allowed Medicare beneficiaries to receive telehealth services from home, including audio-only in many cases, removed geographic or originating-site restrictions, allowed a broader list of providers, and sustained the “hospital-at-home” model.
Although CMS says providers may still furnish telehealth services, reimbursement is no longer guaranteed.
For social workers in Kansas and Missouri, our clients face transportation barriers, rural isolation, chronic illness, caregiving demands, mental health needs, and limited mobility. Telehealth has offered a lifeline: home-based services, flexible scheduling, connections across distances. The sudden uncertainty or withdrawal of coverage threatens these gains.
Social workers often deliver or coordinate mental health, substance use, family support, trauma recovery, and other interventions. The tele-behavioral-health flexibilities have been among the more stable, but the broader telehealth framework’s disruption increases the potential for fragmentation of care. And while some behavioral health “home rules” are permanent, many allied services are now destabilized.
The dilemma faced by practitioners in Kansas and Missouri is: Do they continue telehealth with risk of non-reimbursement? Do they revert to in-person only and lose clients who cannot attend? Do they shift staff, workflows, scheduling, risk financial loss, and cut services? This is a major burden on the social work infrastructure.
In the rural counties of Kansas and Missouri, where provider scarcity, long travel distances, and transportation already existed as barriers, telehealth offered a way to increase access. Rolling back those flexibilities threatens to widen disparities and access to critical services.
Social workers have always stood at the intersection of care and policy. This moment is no different. It demands raising our voices with state legislatures, federal representatives, provider coalitions, and communities to ensure that access isn’t rolled back at a time when many of our clients have fewer alternatives.
A stable, predictable telehealth reimbursement environment is critical. Our state practices cannot carry indefinite uncertainty while caring for older adults, rural clients, homebound persons, trauma survivors, and families. Making telehealth flexibilities permanent, or at least multi-year, is not a luxury. It’s a necessity for continuity of care, especially in underserved regions.
Funding and reimbursement must account for the full spectrum of care — not just physician visits but therapy, social work, behavioral health, speech/OT/physical therapy, case management, and community-based wraparound services.
Kansas and Missouri should consider state-level policies and reimbursements to supplement or backstop federal gaps, ensuring no one falls through the cracks when federal policy fluctuates. Social workers in community-based settings, especially those serving marginalized populations, should be included in crafting telehealth policy and program implementation, given our experience with access, equity, digital divides, trauma-responsive care, and culturally sensitive outreach.
To my colleagues in Kansas and Missouri, review your service models. Identify which clients rely on telehealth and map out alternative plans in case reimbursement is delayed or revoked.
Document the impact on clients who lose access or experience delays in services, and increased emergency visits or crises triggered by disruptions. This evidence will be crucial for advocacy. Engage with state chapters of the National Association of Social Work, other social work associations, Medicaid directors, and local behavioral health authorities to raise these issues and propose solutions. Most importantly, communicate with your clients. Be transparent about possible changes. Some may no longer qualify for certain telehealth visits or may have to shift to in-person. Your honesty is especially important during times of upheaval.
For social workers in Kansas and Missouri, this is a moment of real risk and real agency. The lapse of telehealth waivers isn’t just a bureaucratic hiccup. It has the potential to undo gains in access, equity, trauma-responsive care, and community-based support that our profession has worked hard to build. But it is also an opportunity to show how social work bridges practice and policy, care and advocacy, local realities, and federal frameworks.
Our clients deserve no less than consistent, accessible service. Our states deserve a system that leverages telehealth’s promise. And our profession must step forward to ensure no one is left behind.

In his recent article, Nick Evans quotes Ohio state lawmaker Thaddeus Clagget as saying, “(i)t makes no difference the ability of a donkey to speak, that does not make the donkey a human, okay?”
As directors of the Laboratory for the Future of Citizenship, which studies how technology is reshaping the legal and philosophical foundations of personhood and belonging, we agree. But we have concerns about the approach Ohio House Bill 469 takes to AI safety, not only for Ohio, but as precedent for other jurisdictions.
If passed, it would be one of the most sweeping and consequential pieces of AI legislation in the country because it would outlaw not only human-AI marriage, but also rule on a question of metaphysics — whether it is possible for beings made of metal and silicon to have feelings.
It would go even further than the recently-passed law in Utah, which declares that no AI can ever be a person, no matter how person-like it may become.
What’s in Ohio’s proposal banning AI personhood

The stakes are high.
According to a recent survey conducted by the Center for Democracy and Technology, 19% of around 1000 9th to 12th graders surveyed said that they or someone they knew had been in a “romantic relationship” with an AI.
To be clear, we agree that humans should not be allowed to marry large language models like ChatGPT.
We also agree that it is unlikely that today’s AI systems are conscious or sentient (one of us is a philosophy professor, and the other is a human rights lawyer. We have thought about these questions quite a bit).
The problem is that Ohio’s bill doesn’t stop there.
Ohio H.B. 469 defines “artificial intelligence” so broadly that it could apply to “any software, machine, or system capable of simulating human-like cognitive functions, including learning or problem solving.”
This is far-reaching.
Consider the future of medicine: neural implants that use AI to restore memory in people with Alzheimer’s, or prosthetic limbs driven by machine-learning algorithms interpreting neural signals.
Under the bill’s current language, such systems could qualify as “artificial intelligence.”
If part of a person’s cognition or motor control is mediated by AI, does that make them partly AI?
Would Ohio’s law mean that a veteran with a bionic limb or a patient with an AI-driven brain implant couldn’t legally marry?
The drafters of the bill surely didn’t intend that outcome, but that’s the point.
Overbroad definitions make bad law. Instead of limiting its scope to what currently exists and is known about AI, the law attempts to legislate the unknown and unknowable future of a tech that just a few years ago would have sounded like impossible science fiction.
Imagine if someone had written a law in the 1700s setting a forever speed limit of 10 miles per hour for all wheeled transport. That might have made sense for carts, but not so much for airplanes.
Yet that’s what this bill attempts to do for artificial intelligence.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Consider animals.
The law asserts that animals are not people. That is why you cannot marry them.
It is not necessary to add that animals don’t have feelings (as we philosophers would put it: that they aren’t “sentient”, or “conscious”). It is a question of fact whether animals have feelings, not a matter for the law to decide.
And we don’t need to deny that animals can have feelings to explain why it isn’t ok (and shouldn’t be legal) for humans to marry them.
Yet, bill H.B. 469 declares that no AI systems may ever be sentient or conscious.
Contrast H.B. 469 with the model rules on declaring a human to be brain dead, The Uniform Determination of Death Act, which contains numerous scientifically established indicators that must be met and is frequently reviewed and updated with the latest findings on consciousness in the human brain.
If the Ohio bill passes, no amount of testing or indicators could ever be enough to establish AI consciousness, no matter what might develop in the future.
None of this means we should open the door to exploitative or absurd forms of “AI marriage.”
Laws can and should protect vulnerable people from predatory relationships with software, as well as from corporate manipulation of emotionally dependent users.
But a sound approach would define the problem narrowly, for example, banning contracts or ceremonies purporting to create legal marriage with text-based auto-regressive LLMs, rather than issuing sweeping, metaphysical bans that will age as badly as 18th-century laws about airplanes.
We commend Ohio in taking the initiative to lead in AI governance, but what we need is humility.
Lawmakers should invite scientists, ethicists, and legal scholars into the drafting process and build in a requirement for periodic review as the technology evolves. AI is moving fast, but we must not panic.
Premature legislation can cause problems in the future, just as inadequate legislation may.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-25 05:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal funding loss puts CT’s communities at risk,Kendall Webb,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/25/federal-funding-loss-puts-cts-communities-at-risk/,Charity Bridge Fund is a new initiative designed to help donors stay informed on the impacts of the widespread loss of federal funding.,"Across Connecticut and the nation, nonprofits have been faced with making impossible choices. Many organizations that feed families, house the homeless, mentor children, and care for the most vulnerable in our communities have had to scale back their programs after critical federal support was cut.
In October, the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance released a survey of 72 nonprofit organizations. Of that group, 33 percent reported federal funding loss or delay in federal funding, and 44 percent said they had to reduce or eliminate their programs as a result. These nonprofits are the front line of Connecticut’s social safety net. When one falls behind, the ripple effect is felt across schools, hospitals and neighborhoods. That strain is only growing as federal funding shrinks and demand for services continues to rise.
National data from earlier this year paint the same picture. Most nonprofits can’t cover their full operating costs without the support of government funding. Without their financial support, somewhere between 60 to 80 percent of nonprofits in each state would be operating in the red.
Nonprofits have long been critical partners in meeting community needs. But they can’t carry the burden alone when the foundation beneath them has shifted. Here in Connecticut, the sudden loss or freeze of federal funds has left organizations scrambling. Food banks, domestic violence shelters and community clinics have reported scaling back their services or delaying programs, leaving the people who rely on them the most without the support they need.

That impact hits home. Frontline staff and volunteers have no choice but to stretch limited resources to meet the growing community needs. I think about all the parents waiting for a hot meal for their children, seniors relying on a clinic and families seeking shelter. When nonprofits are forced to cut back, people feel the consequences immediately and deeply.

My career in philanthropy has been dedicated to making generosity more accessible, smarter and impactful. From co-founding a global education nonprofit to creating early online giving platforms and now launching Charity Bridge Fund, I’ve seen how connecting donors to real-time needs can make a significant difference. The goal is simple: make sure nonprofits that are struggling receive the support they need to ensure they can continue to serve their communities. 
Charity Bridge Fund is a new initiative designed to help donors stay informed on the impacts of the widespread loss of federal funding. For decades, the federal government helped safeguard many of our country’s basic needs, supporting food access, housing stability, education and community health. With recent reductions in federal funding, many of these essential needs are now at risk, reminding us that private giving must also help sustain the core services that keep our communities strong. 
This initiative raises awareness of the urgent needs created by loss of funds, offering a list of affected projects by cause and geography, insight into the short-term impact of sudden decreased funds, and the long-term societal risk of losing critical social programs. 
As we work to protect this vital network, it’s important to understand what these changes look like on the ground. We invite nonprofits to share their stories on the platform, detailing how these cuts have impacted their work. Doing so provides access to matching dollars and opportunities for broader visibility, helping elevate their voices and drive meaningful action.
The safety net only works when every part holds together. Our local nonprofits have carried us through recessions, pandemics and policy shifts. Today, many of them are at risk. If we want them to survive, we must act now. Every donation, step of support and connection made today helps protect the people in our community tomorrow. 
Connecticut’s nonprofits are holding the line. It’s time for us to ensure they have the support they need.

Crankfield, a counselor at Crofton High School in Anne Arundel County, was named the 2026 American School Counselor Association National Counselor of the Year last week. She is the first Marylander to win the national award that was started by the association in 2008.
She will be honored by the association in Washington, D.C., in January and recognized by the state Board of Education at its Dec. 9 meeting.
“Ms. Crankfield is an exceptional school counselor and an even more remarkable person,” Crofton High School Principal Greg Ryan said in a statement. “She empowers students to thrive academically, socially and emotionally, while also strengthening our staff by fostering positive relationships, encouraging collaboration, and challenging us to bring our very best to our students each day.”

Crankfield has been a school counselor since 2010, and has been at Crofton since it opened in 2020. It was in that year, according to the school counselor association, that Crankfield disaggregated course enrollment data to determine whether the school had a course access gap, particularly in honors and Advanced Placement courses.
The data showed Black and Latino students were disproportionately taking standard-level courses rather than honors and Advanced Placement classes.
The association said Crankfield created guidelines for middle and high school teachers to use when making core course recommendations. In addition, she collaborated with the testing coordinator and department chairs in several content areas to promote higher-level courses and honors and advanced placement electives that met students’ interests.
Over time, Crankfield’s work decreased the access gap for students so that the advanced lever courses more reflects the diversity and composition of the Crofton High School student population.
“Danielle represents the very best in professional school counseling from her commitment to her students’ academic, college/career and social/emotional success, to her reputation among her peers as Crofton High School’s ‘North Star,’” Molly McCloskey, a member of the counselor of the year selection committee, said in a statement. “Her excellence is not only in what she does, but in the way she does it – authentically and with an eye toward meaningful, measurable results.”
Crankfield credited her colleagues and her students for her success.
“I stand alongside an amazing team with strong district support that I could not do this work without. This work will continue and we will make the program even better,” Crankfield said in a statement.
.To every student, whether on my caseload or not, this award is because of you. Your success. Your ability to do what you want in this world is what motivates me every single day,” she said in her statement. “This is for you.”
The award was open to state school counselors of the year from all 50 states. Crankfield was one of five national finalists, who included elementary school counselors from Woodbridge, Virginia, and Youngsville, Louisiana; a middle school counselor from Burlington, North Carolina; and a high school counselor from Kahului, Hawaii.
All five will be honored in Washington, D.C., in January. They will also participate in online events during National School Counseling Week starting Feb. 2-6.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Craig Richards, a longtime member of the board in charge of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation, has been replaced.
On Monday afternoon, Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced he had selected Ralph Samuels, a former state legislator, businessman and tourism expert, to serve on the board in a public seat formerly occupied by Richards, whose term was slated to expire this year.
The board directs Alaska’s $85 billion Permanent Fund, whose investments are the source of more than 60% of the state’s general-purpose revenue. That money is used annually for services and the annual Permanent Fund dividend.
Richards had served on the board since 2015, first under then-Gov. Bill Walker, and then under Dunleavy, who appointed him to a four-year term as a public member of the board in 2021. 
Richards did not immediately answer a message left on his cellphone. It was not immediately clear whether he had sought another term but was passed over by the governor.
Samuels also did not immediately answer a message left on his cellphone.
A statement announcing Samuels’ appointment did not include a comment from Richards or note his departure.
Of Samuels, the governor said, “He is a lifelong Alaskan with an innate understanding of our state’s business and political landscape. As a Trustee he will bring that experience and insight to managing Alaska’s sovereign wealth fund not only for today, but for future generations of Alaskans.”
Under Richards, who chaired the Board of Trustees from 2018 through 2022, the board launched a controversial in-state investment program that has yet to deliver positive results. 
The board in recent years has also intensified its warnings about the threat that the fund may run out of spendable money in the coming years. 
An analysis paper commissioned during Richards’ time on the board suggests that a constitutional amendment may be needed to change the Permanent Fund’s structure to firmly cap the amount of money that may be spent from the fund and to consolidate the fund’s current two-account structure.

Ford/Maryland Matters)A federal appeals court was wrong when it ordered a new trial for Jeremiah Antoine Sweeney, who was convicted of second-degree murder for an April 2010 shooting in Prince George’s County, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.
In a unanimous, unsigned ruling, the justices reversed the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which the high court said had wrongly ruled for Sweeney based on a claim that he “never asserted” in his appeal.
The justices wrote that Sweeney made “one, and only one claim” in his appeal — that his attorney at his trial was ineffective. His attorney put on no witnesses or evidence, and failed to question jurors to see if they had been influenced by one juror who made an unauthorized visit to the crime scene.
“Instead of ruling on that claim, the Fourth Circuit devised a new one, based on a ‘combination of extraordinary failures from juror to judge to attorney,’” the high court said in its ruling. “The Fourth Circuit’s ‘radical transformation’ of Sweeney’s simple ineffective-assistance claim ‘departed so drastically from the principle of party presentation as to constitute an abuse of discretion.’”
Attar, co-defendants plead not guilty in alleged blackmailing scheme

The justices wrote in their brief, four-page ruling that “’the parties frame the issues for decision,’ while the court serves as ‘neutral arbiter of matters the parties present.’” It sent the case back to the circuit court with instructions to reconsider Sweeney’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim only, in light of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which severely limits relief on appeal.
The Maryland Office of the Attorney General, which represented Prince George’s County in the case, declined to comment Monday on the high court’s ruling.
Jo-Ann Tamila Sagar, listed as an attorney for Sweeney, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
A Prince George’s jury found Sweeney guilty in 2011 of second-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons violations in a 2010 shooting during an argument over stolen marijuana, that ended up killing a bystander 75 yards away. He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms, plus 30 years.
Sweeney’s state court appeals were rejected, and his first post-conviction appeal to the federal system — claiming ineffective assistance of counsel — was turned down at the district court level.
But a divided three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit disagreed in March, ruling that Sweeney deserved a new trial.
Circuit Judge Roger Gregory, in a 46-page opinion joined by Judge Terence W. Boyle, wrote that the case was built entirely on eyewitnesses who identified Sweeney “as the shooter — late at night, on a crowded street,” where “vantage point was an issue; light was an issue,” and a murder weapon was never found.
When Juror No. 4 went to inspect the crime scene on his own, and then joined deliberations with the rest of jury before the judge was alerted, it threatened Sweeney’s right “to a fair and impartial jury, reaching a verdict based solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom,” Gregory wrote. But he said Juror No. 4 was “just the tip of the iceberg.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Despite this, the judge allowed Juror No. 4 to return to the jury lounge with the other jurors for over an hour, with no instruction that they not deliberate,” according to the opinion. “After ultimately excusing Juror No. 4, the judge never instructed the remaining eleven jurors that they were not to consider anything Juror No. 4 had told them.”
“Judge and defense counsel both failed in their responsibilities. The trial court judge did not properly inquire into the jury taint” by Juror No. 4, he wrote, and Sweeney’s attorney “rendered representation far short of what is objectively reasonable.”
“The breakdown of the judicial process in this case – from juror to judge to attorney – deprived Sweeney of his constitutional rights, and he is therefore entitled to a new trial,” Gregory wrote.
But Judge A. Marvin Quattlebaum Jr., in a 50-page dissent, said that Sweeney raised only one claim in his appeal — not receiving competent representation at trial. Despite that, the majority “raises on its own, and then decides the case on, a totally different ground from what Sweeney argued to the state courts, to the district court or to us on appeal,” justifying its decision based on “the special circumstances” of Sweeney’s case.
“That alone is a problem. What’s the standard for this? It seems purely subjective. Like beauty, special  circumstances are in the eye of the beholder,” Quattlebaum wrote.
“We are not free to scour the record for issues that we think are important when the parties never raised them below and then dispense our subjective views of justice. That, however, is exactly what the majority does,” he wrote.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC03528-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 22:56:53.302076

King/Mississippi Today)Illicit drug overdoses and the deaths they cause are trending down this year, despite spikes in a handful of states, according to a Stateline analysis of data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
A handful of places with rising overdoses are responding to the problem with cooperation, they say, by sharing information about overdose surges and distributing emergency medication.
“The national conversation is just about warships in the Caribbean and drones and borders,” said Nabarun Dasgupta, who studies overdose trends at the University of North Carolina. “It discounts this huge groundswell of Americans taking care of Americans.
“There’s a huge amount of caregiving and tending to the needs of local communities that is being done in a non-flashy way because this is hard, slow work.”
Overdose deaths have been dropping steadily since 2023. As of April, the latest date available, deaths were at 76,500 for the previous 12 months — their lowest level since March 2020. A pandemic spike in overdose deaths drove the number as high as almost 113,000 in the summer of 2023, according to federal statistics.
President Donald Trump has ordered more than a dozen military strikes against boats in the open waters of the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean since Sept. 2, claiming without publicized evidence that their occupants were drug runners bringing narcotics to the United States. Nearly 60 people have been killed.
The bulk of deadly fentanyl is smuggled over the border with Mexico in passenger cars, according to a September report by the federal Government Accountability Office. Chemicals and equipment, mostly from China, are smuggled in via cargo trucks, commercial ships, airplanes and the mail, according to the report.
A more timely indicator of overdoses — nonfatal suspected overdose patients in hospital emergency departments — was down 7% this year through August compared with 2024, according to Stateline’s analysis of CDC statistics.
The nonfatal overdoses were up for the year in only a few states and the District of Columbia. The largest spikes were 17% in the District, 16% in Rhode Island, 15% in Delaware, 11% in Connecticut and 10% in New Mexico, with smaller increases in Colorado, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, South Dakota, Utah, New Jersey and Minnesota.
Other states saw drops in nonfatal overdoses: Maryland had the largest decrease through August, about 17%.

But Baltimore had an attention-grabbing cluster of 42 overdoses between July and October, all within the same neighborhood. No fatalities were reported. The cluster led the city to set aside $2 million in October for more mobile services, harm reduction and social supports to fight overdoses.
New Mexico is seeing more overdoses and more deaths than the previous year in three counties on the Colorado border. In response, New Mexico is distributing both warnings and naloxone, an opioid-overdose antidote.
Officials are giving naloxone to storekeepers near overdose sites and alerting those seeking services about the deadly threat in the local supply.
“We started planning naloxone saturation and different types of outreaches so we can hopefully stem this from getting even worse,” said David Daniels, harm reduction section manager in the New Mexico health department.
“Putting messaging directly into clients’ hands is extremely valuable. That might be, ‘If you’re choosing to use, don’t use the regular amount. Maybe you should use a quarter of it. Test it out first,’” Daniels said.
The three counties in New Mexico — which include the capital city Santa Fe, ski resort Taos and Española, the setting of the 2023 TV black comedy series “The Curse” — saw about 438 more deaths from July through September than they did during the third quarter of 2024, according to Stateline calculations. That’s more than double the 383 overdose deaths for the area during the same time period last year.

Roger Montoya, a former Democratic state representative who runs an arts nonprofit in Rio Arriba County, said most of the deaths there have been among homeless substance users.
A local hospital has responded with programs to get treatment for more people, and his own Moving Arts Española group concentrates on helping children and young people break a cycle of economic despair that often leads to addiction and homelessness, he said.
“We try to redirect and strengthen the resiliency of young people who largely are being raised by grandparents and kin because mom and dad are either dead, on the street or incarcerated,” Montoya said.
But most states with overdose increases are still showing fewer deaths, mostly because the drug supply in the eastern United States is more likely to be cut with sedatives that don’t have the same deadly effect as fentanyl, though they can cause overdose.
The drugs linked to Baltimore’s mass overdoses were cut with an unusual, powerful sedative, according to federal testing. The sedative can cause people to lose consciousness but can’t itself be treated with reversal medication such as naloxone.
By contrast New Mexico’s tests on this year’s clusters generally found more deadly fentanyl than usual in the local supply, said Phillip Fiuty, a technical adviser on adulterant testing in the state health department.
Scott announces grants to combat overdoses in Baltimore after another mass overdose event

“We’re not seeing the type of adulteration they’re experiencing on the East Coast. Once something is in New Mexico, there’s little to no adulteration,” Fiuty said.
Some East Coast states are seeing more overdoses but fewer deaths. Rhode Island warned of spikes in nonfatal overdose in August and September, but deaths through September were still lower than during the same period last year, according to state figures.
That’s not always the case. Connecticut reported a surge of both fatal and nonfatal overdoses near interstate highways in May and June.
“One of the factors is change in the illicit drug supply or bad batches. I think that’s what’s playing out now. The drug supply is increasingly unpredictable,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.
The association has a suggested framework for community response to spikes, but cities and counties may be hampered by a new aggressiveness on enforcement and more hostility to local efforts to stop deaths, she said.
The current Trump administration has shown some reluctance to support community harm reduction techniques, she said. That includes the temporary suspension of $140 million in funds for a program called Overdose Data to Action, known as OD2A, that the first Trump administration started to sound the alarm when spikes happen.
“Given recent cuts to health care and substance use and overdose prevention services that we’re seeing, that is impacting some of the work on the ground,” Freeman said. “It’s pushing people away from being able to make the changes they need to make to change their lives. It has the potential to create more of an overdose problem.”

(Source: Waymo)Earlier this year, Montana passed a law allowing for the use of autonomous vehicles on the state’s roadways.
Part of the bill  — Senate Bill 67 —also gave the state’s Department of Transportation and Department of Justice some rulemaking authority over their use. 
“The intention of this legislation is to get all parties to the table to promote the safest ways to promote autonomous technology incorporating the diverse roadways, weather, and animal-human encounters in Montana and to make Montana the showcase for advancing new technologies in transportation,” the bill’s preamble states.
The Legislature’s interim transportation committee has taken up the issue as part of a study into mass transportation and sent state Sens. Russ Tempel and Denley Loge on a mission to Arizona to find out more about Waymo, an autonomous taxi service.
The pair spoke about the experience during the transportation committee meeting on Monday.
“When Senator Tempel ordered up the Waymo, a car pulled up with a little ball on top, and his initials were on it. That’s how we knew that was the one that was coming for him,” Loge, an St. Regis Republican, told the committee.
“It’s comparable to a taxi price, but it is impressive,” he added
They described that it changed speed limits appropriately, if fast (“It wasted no time,” Loge said) and that it turned corners well. It recognized a pickup truck pulling out in front and was able to change lanes without issue, they added.
Meetings with Waymo gave them an opportunity to see more of their business. Waymo officials were mum on the financial side of the business, but did describe the learning abilities of the software the cars run on. Essentially cars take photos of the route, learning curb heights and even if there’s a new pothole. They added that it seemed to perform well around pedestrians.
With emerging obstacles like a pothole, the car will download that information when it gets back and the other cars will now have the knowledge of the pothole as well.
“There was one instance there was a car backing out of a parking spot. It waited till that car got backed out, and then it took that spot to go into the charger,” Loge said. “And I asked the guys, I said, is it like milk cows? They go back to the same stall? And they said, ‘No, they talk to each other, and whatever stall is open, they go to, and if somebody’s backing out, it waits, or it backs up, if it has to.’ It’s pretty incredible.”
The committee did have some questions, including on animal collisions and road conditions. Part of SB 67 gives the Department of Transportation some authority over that matter, including limiting autonomous vehicles in certain situations, but also allows the department the ability to exempt them as well. 
“The Department of Transportation may exempt from limitation commercial vehicles with an automated driving system that are demonstrated to be capable of operating safely during dangerous road conditions,” the bill reads.The company is testing their vehicles in Buffalo, New York, though has been mostly limited to southern markets, they said.
The Department of Justice has some authority, too.
“The Department of Justice shall consult interested stakeholders prior to proposing rules on vehicles with an automated driving system, such as members of the transportation interim committee and representatives of law enforcement agencies, motor vehicle and insurance industries, drivers, pedestrians, and tribal and local governments.”
The lawmakers also got some advice on rulemaking from the mayor of Mesa, who said part of the reason Waymo came to the city was because they didn’t put any restrictions up.
“One thing he mentioned was, ‘Be careful putting any restrictions on these things until they work through it and explain to you what they’re capable of,’” said Tempel, a Chester Republican.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/WAYMO-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 21:57:20.416623

A Nutmeg State Poll released Monday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found voters approve of his performance by a margin of 55% to 38%, a net approval rating of +17, virtually unchanged since September.
Lamont’s challenger for the Democratic nomination, Rep. Josh Elliott of Hamden, barely made an impression among likely Democratic voters after four months of campaigning. Nearly 80% had no opinion of him, while 69% had a favorable opinion of the two-term governor.
If a Democratic primary were held today, the poll found Lamont outpolling Elliott, 55% to 7%, with 37% undecided and 2% saying they would write in someone else.
The data released Monday offered no matchups between Lamont and either of the two Republican candidates, Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich or former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain.
Overall, 34% of voters were enthusiastic (11%) or satisfied (23%) about Lamont’s candidacy for a third term, while 31% were dissatisfied (21%) or angry (10%), 28% indifferent or neutral, and 6% unsure. 
Among Democratic voters, the poll found little evidence of the dissatisfaction that liberal Democratic lawmakers have expressed about Lamont over his refusal to embrace a more progressive tax code or higher spending.
Eighty-seven percent of self-described liberals, 76% of progressives and 63% of moderates had favorable opinions of Lamont. Forty-eight percent of socialists had a favorable opinion, but only 15% of socialists were negative. 
Asked to name the most important problems facing Connecticut, the cost of living was named by 22%, following by taxes (18%), housing (15%), jobs and the economy (10%) and immigration (5%). Four percent mentioned national issues or the federal government.
The poll was conducted from Nov. 12 to 17 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5% percent on questions posed to all voters and 6.5% on questions posed only to likely Democratic voters.

As urban Alaska’s electric utilities look to import natural gas to fill a looming supply gap, residents and businesses face a future surge in electricity and heating prices.
 




Some of the price increase is unavoidable: Importing gas will require expensive infrastructure, and those construction costs will be paid by consumers.
 




But observers of the state’s urban electric and gas utilities are now warning of an even more painful possibility: Customers could be charged tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars for work that may not benefit them.
 



Urban Alaska’s privately-owned gas utility, Enstar, hopes to bill its customers to reimburse a project developer’s study costs for one import project — even if the project isn’t built.
 


There’s also a risk that the region’s utilities could build two separate import projects to meet differing priorities and timelines when one project could be enough to meet demand.

“The ultimate horror show is we end up with two projects,” said Antony Scott, a former Alaska public utility regulator who now works as an analyst for a green energy organization, Renewable Energy Alaska Project. “If each project is going to cost a half a billion dollars and you have two of them, then we’re paying half a billion for no reason.”
Scott is personally skeptical that more than one import facility will ultimately be built given the substantial expense involved, and he thinks competition could be good for consumers as long as only one project emerges.
But for now, two separate projects are moving ahead.
Collaboration, then a split
One of the two projects is led by Harvest, an affiliate of the privately held oil and gas company Hilcorp.
Harvest’s project would repurpose a dormant liquefied natural gas export plant on the Kenai Peninsula so that it can receive cargoes of LNG shipped in from outside Alaska.
The retrofitting plan, according to utility studies and officials involved, could cost $500 million or more, and it has at least one major potential customer lined up: Anchorage’s cooperatively owned electric utility, Chugach Electric Association, which has endorsed the project. Harvest last week announced that it had finalized a deal to buy the plant from its previous owner for an undisclosed sum.

Meanwhile, Enstar, the natural gas utility, is working with another energy company, Glenfarne, on a separate project, also on the Kenai Peninsula.
That project would involve construction of new LNG imports infrastructure and, according to Enstar President John Sims, could also cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
Urban Alaska’s other three electric utilities — one on the Kenai Peninsula, one in the Mat-Su north of Anchorage, and one in Fairbanks — could end up procuring imported gas from either project, though no formal agreements have been announced.
The parallel development efforts represent a significant split among urban Alaska’s utilities — which, according to regulators and watchdogs, also drove up costs for consumers by failing to coordinate when they spent $1.5 billion on new power plants and other infrastructure in recent years.

Sims acknowledged as much, and said he’d welcome intervention from regulators to encourage closer collaboration.
“It’s a mathematical certainty. All the load on the same project reduces the cost,” Sims said in an interview. “This isn’t the only example where utilities can’t work together and it’s cost ratepayers more.”
Chugach, Enstar and the other urban Alaska electric utilities had previously been studying import projects cooperatively in an Enstar-led working group they formed in 2022 in response to the impending gas shortage.
But then, earlier this year, Chugach effectively split off in its partnership with Harvest, according to Sims — who said in an interview that he was “very surprised” and only learned of that separate project when he heard a rumor about it the night before it was announced.
The announcement underscored an already tense relationship between Enstar and Hilcorp, the Harvest affiliate. The two companies had been feuding in court over the terms of an existing, unrelated natural gas supply contract.
Sims has said publicly that his company is not interested in participating in a project that could further consolidate the position of Hilcorp, which is currently urban Alaska’s dominant supplier to utilities of locally produced natural gas.
The Enstar-Glenfarne project, Sims said, would have the advantage of being what’s known as a “greenfield” facility — meaning it’s newly built — in contrast to the existing facilities that Harvest wants to repurpose.
“If you’re going to be spending half a billion dollars, I’d much rather do it on greenfield than something where I don’t know what I’m digging into,” he said.

A spokeswoman for Chugach, the Anchorage electric utility, said that the region’s dependence on Hilcorp is not inherently problematic and that the company has been an “excellent business partner.”
Chugach, said spokeswoman Julie Hasquet, is pursuing the retrofit because of how quickly the project can launch — as soon as 2026, according to Harvest. Chugach’s primary contract for locally produced natural gas ends in 2028, while the Enstar-Glenfarne project isn’t expected to come online until 2029 at the earliest.
“Our plans are not only the most cost-effective and closest to completion but are designed to be flexible, scalable and work with other long-term supply options to continue offering valuable service to Alaskans well into the future,” Harvest’s chief executive, Jason Rebrook, said in a prepared statement.
Sims said he thinks utilities could work together to stretch out scarce gas supplies so that Chugach could wait until the Glenfarne-Enstar project comes online.
No ‘blank check’ for Enstar
Some of Enstar’s customers, meanwhile, are raising concerns about what they describe as an unusual arrangement with Glenfarne that they say shifts risk to consumers.
Enstar, in filings with state utility regulators, said Glenfarne is expected to spend up to $48 million studying the project before making a final decision on whether to build it. If it’s not built, Enstar will still have to reimburse Glenfarne for those costs — and it aims to raise that money by billing its customers.
Residential consumers would see increases to their bills of $15 a month over the course of a year, Enstar said in its preliminary filing with the Regulatory Commission of Alaska in January.
That filing drew sharp objections from some watchdogs and consumers. One lawyer representing a pair of Anchorage commercial real estate firms wrote in a comment that Enstar “seeks to shield its shareholders from any risk associated with exploring the potential construction of a project that may never provide any benefit to ratepayers.”
“Speculative, non-regulated projects that Enstar wants to engage in are an Enstar shareholder and owner issue, not a ratepayer issue,” Robin Brena, a veteran energy lawyer and co-owner of one of the real estate firms, said in a phone interview.
The commission rejected Enstar’s request for preapproval to bill customers up to $48 million to pay Glenfarne, saying in a formal order that it would not give Enstar a “blank check.”
Commissioners did, however, say they would consider allowing Enstar to recover up to $42 million once the money is spent — if the company can show those expenses were reasonable, among other conditions.
A Glenfarne spokesman referred a request for comment to Enstar.

Jim Pillen said his team is ""working our tails off"" to ""make lemonade"" out of the sour announcement that the Lexington Tyson Foods plant is to close in January. Dec. 27, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska “got our butts kicked” by the Tyson Foods decision to close a Lexington beef plant employing about 3,200 people, Gov. Jim Pillen said Monday. But he sees a possible Hail Mary pass to resurrect the industrial property.
Pillen, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner on the agribusiness closure, said he learned officially of Tyson’s decision Friday at noon, just a few hours before the Arkansas-based multinational corporation made the news public.

He said his team had been seeking a meeting with company officials amid the struggles faced by the cattle industry, including cutters and other meat processors facing lower cattle supplies and higher retail prices for beef. 
The governor said he was told a key contributor to Tyson’s decision involved the age and inefficiencies of the Lexington factory, which was built decades ago to manufacture combines and other farm machinery. 
The “good news,” Pillen said, is that Tyson officials are exploring other options for the Lexington property, including repurposing it into a specialty, “value-added” agricultural operation akin to Tyson’s Omaha plant that produces millions of pounds of raw and cooked bacon. 
 Specialty meat operation? 

His hope, he said, is that the company might take a cattle carcass, for example, Pillen said, and create a specific type of steak or other commodity and make something people want, as does Tyson’s Omaha plant. 
“There [are] discussions going on within the Tyson organization, ‘How can we turn that plant into a value-added plant with either pork, beef or poultry because they’re in that space. That’s a real-life possibility,” Pillen said.
Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The governor harkened back to the origins of the Lexington Tyson plant. It was built originally to manufacture farm implements for Sperry-New Holland, which during the farm crisis in 1985 announced it would close and eliminate 940 jobs.
IBP in 1990 opened the property as a converted meatpacking facility. The company later was acquired by Tyson Foods, doing pivotal work for ranchers in west-central Nebraska. Pillen said the plant might have survived this round of Tyson cuts had it been tailor-made for beef production.
“My guess would be that if that plant would have been built brand new from scratch, this is a conversation that wouldn’t be taking place,” Pillen said. “They took lemons after New Holland and made lemonade out of it for a while. But as it got really, really competitive, [and] it’s not really one of the best plants in the United States.”
Asked whether workforce availability problems influenced Tyson — including limited availability of temporary foreign workers and immigrants who have staffed many of the cutting-floor jobs — Pillen said he was told the Lexington plant had a “great team,” which “made it extra hard.”
“Tyson wants to turn it into something because … when you have a great team of people, the last thing you want to do is walk.”
 ‘Lived this nightmare before’ 

Nebraska’s congressional representatives have taken a harder line on the closing than Pillen, who defended Tyson as an American-owned meat-processing, protein provider. He has said he is not an advocate of foreign-owned businesses crowding the food space.
Nebraskans lament Tyson decision to close Lexington plant with 3,200 workers

Pillen’s family runs a massive hog and hog genetics operation based in Columbus, and his family has a significant ownership stake in a pork-production plant in Fremont. He said his family has long done business with Tyson’s plant in Madison. The company also has a major plant in Dakota City.
U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb, said in a video on social media that “we’ve lived this nightmare before,” when Tyson pulled out of Norfolk nearly 20 years ago.
He said the Tyson decision for Lexington “brought a lot of emotion back.” In 2006, he was a new state senator representing Norfolk when he said he got a call that the Norfolk plant would close and eliminate 1,300 jobs.
He showed a video of the abandoned Tyson plant in Norfolk and asked Tyson to help resurrect the Lexington facility in some way, even if for another company.
“We can do this much better,” he said. He also said, “There is life after Tyson,” adding that he worked with a local hospital in his northeast Nebraska town to build a nursing school. He said it helped create a “regional medical destination” with a health service system he called “unparalleled for a town our size.”
He said his city’s downtown has since seen major revitalization projects. 
 ‘Dude ranch’ fascination

Pillen acknowledged Tyson’s presence in other communities, saying,  “I think it’s incredibly important we’re focused on what we have.”
He said the state and its agricultural-focused economy cannot afford to feel sorry for itself. 
“What are we going to do?” he asked. “Wallow in the muck  … or are we going to roll up our sleeves and try to solve something?” He said he has spent much of his time since Friday “calling people and getting input” on next steps.

He said he has been privy to conversations about what it would take for the new Sustainable Beef in the North Platte area to take on a second shift  — perhaps opening slots earlier than anticipated for some Lexington-based workers. 
The Lexington plant is to close around Jan. 20. 
Pillen said one of the easiest, short-term ways to help might be to bus or transport former Lexington plant workers to the North Platte plant. He said Sustainable Beef already has hired many of their first 800 workers and a chunk was from Lexington. 
“So that transfer has been taking place,” he said. “We’re talking to people on all fronts to be able to get ideas and bring people together.” 
Pillen, Nebraska’s first farmer-governor in more than a century, talked about reasons behind the U.S. cattle shortage that has impacted meatpacking companies and processors. 
Among factors reducing the heads of cattle being raised, Pillen said, are extended drought conditions that shrank “mama cow herds” and bad winters that hurt cattle conception rates. He said the 2023 winter reduced herds and births by more than 300,000 cattle in Nebraska alone. 
Also, he said much ranch land is being gobbled up by rich people that prefer operating a “dude ranch” over raising cattle, which has contributed.
 ‘Gotta make lemonade’ 

Pillen said the number of jobs eliminated by Tyson may be lower than the 3,200 the company reported because of fewer shifts being run during tight times. But he called the loss devastating to a community of about 11,000 people in Dawson County. 
He urged Nebraskans to consider donating to charitable organizations, including local churches and civic groups trying to gather help for affected workers and their families over the holiday season.
He said Tyson didn’t ask for state incentives or other changes to keep the Lexington plant open. He said ag producers and industrial users are more interested in lasting property tax relief.
Tyson’s cuts stretched beyond Nebraska’s Lexington plant, which slaughtered up to 5,000 cattle a day, according to industry reports. The company said it was also downsizing a Texas beef plant to a single shift each day from two.
“We’re working our tails off,” Pillen said of his team. “This was a bad lemon drop day. But we gotta make lemonade out of it.”

Brad Little gives a press conference after delivering his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, in the Lincoln Auditorium in the Idaho Capitol. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Facing a significant projected budget deficit, Idaho lawmakers will have major spending and cutting decisions to make during the upcoming legislative session, Gov. Brad Little said Monday, though he remained seemingly optimistic.
Little, during an Idaho AARP telephone town hall, addressed questions regarding education, health care, immigration, and other issues. 
“There’s going to be some significant decisions that the Legislature is going to make this year, but I would project that generally, the state will continue with their upward trajectory,” Little said. “Right now, we’ve already had to dial back spending a little bit, mainly to compensate for some of the tax bills that we did in previous years and the (federal) Great Big Beautiful Bill is going to have another impact.” 
A recent Idaho Fiscal Policy Center report found that tax cuts over the past five years have reduced the state’s revenue by $4 billion since 2021, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
New report shows 5 years of Idaho income tax cuts have reduced state revenue by $4 billion

The projected budget deficit for the current fiscal year is $58.4 million, the Sun previously reported. The projection does not include the impact of the federal tax and spending budget package, or “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which could result in an additional $284.4 million reduction in annual revenue, according to an analysis by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy.  
The budget shortfall is estimated to increase over time, with one scenario shared with state budget committee members this month showing a potential $555.2 million deficit for fiscal year 2027.
Little said that about 22% of the state’s general fund is set aside in a rainy day fund for emergency use. 
“I don’t think it’s raining. I think there’s some clouds out there, but I don’t think it’s raining,” he said. “… our ethos in Idaho is, don’t spend money we don’t have, save for a rainy day, be prudent about it, don’t grow government too much, and that’s what we’ll continue to do going forward.” 
 Little: Private school choice tax credit unlikely to increase this year

Two callers questioned the governor about the school choice tax credit approved in 2025, which set aside $50 million for a $5,000 per student credit that could go toward education expenses, including private school tuition. House Bill 93 allows families with incomes at or below 300% of the federal poverty level to receive the money in an advance payment rather than reimbursement later. 
One caller questioned why Little signed the bill when more than 86% of those who contacted his office about the bill asked him to veto it, Idaho Education News reported
A Twin Falls resident asked, “Would you at least veto any increase, even if you won’t do anything about what you signed already?” 
Little responded that he would “be very surprised” if the Legislature added money to the program, because it’s still in its infancy. 
“We haven’t even started it yet, we’re just getting the rules in place to see how it works,” he said. 
He also said he signed the bill because he proposed school choice legislation in his 2025 State of the State Address, and said the bill met enough of his requirements to be “contained” and “means-tested,” or targeted only at certain income groups. 
The bill in its first year prioritizes families at or below the 300% poverty level, which for a family of four is an annual income of $96,450. However, in the later years, it prioritizes families who have previously received it. 
He also received a question about the accountability guidelines in the legislation and not being “as stringent” as they are for public schools. The requirements under the bill include that the money goes to K-12 education “that includes, at a minimum, English language arts, mathematics, science, and social studies,” according to the bill language. 
Little said the regulations on public K-12 schools are overly burdensome. 
“I, frankly, think we ought to look at the rules we have for public schools and make them more akin to charter schools,” he said. “I’m all for that.”

 Medicaid may face further cuts 

A St. Anthony resident, who said she had a child with autism and owned an agency that provided services to people with disabilities, questioned Little about the recent 4% cut to provider reimbursement rates for those who serve Medicaid patients. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced the cuts in August, a week after Little directed state agencies to cut mid-year budgets by 3% in response to the projected budget shortfall.

Little said that the budget for the program had grown too much. 
“As I look forward to Medicaid funding this coming year, it’s going to be a challenge again,” he said. “The bottom line is, the growth in Medicaid, both at the federal level and the state level, has been so large that it was just a matter of either terminating the program … or basically, dialing back the level of it so that my Medicaid budget balances, and we can live within the means we have there.” 
He noted there’s “not going to be a lot of new money this year,” and that the state was awaiting decision making by Congress regarding health care premium tax credits, which help keep insurance premium costs lower for private insurance purchased through the state marketplace and are set to expire this year. 
The congressional tax and spending megabill also included reductions in federal Medicaid spending of around $1 trillion over the decade. 
 Some lawmakers hope to address women’s health care shortage

A Lewiston resident said his adult children had moved out of Idaho because of a lack of job opportunities and because of Idaho’s strict felony abortion ban. 
“It’s just not reasonable or logical that they can’t be treated for miscarriage in Idaho, if they have severe complications of pregnancy, they have to go out of state to get treatment,” the caller said. 
Idaho’s law makes it a felony to provide an abortion in almost all cases except to remove a dead fetus, treat a molar pregnancy, prevent the death of the mother, and narrow circumstances involving rape and incest if a police report is provided in the first trimester. 
A study published this year found that Idaho lost more than a third of its practicing obstetrician providers since the state’s abortion ban went into effect, the Sun reported. 
Some Republican state lawmakers, including Rep. Mark Sauter, R-Coeur d’Alene, and Sen. Jim Woodward in the 2025 session, introduced legislation to add an exemption to the ban to protect the health of the mother, rather than prevent her death. None of the bills have received public hearings. 
Little noted that women’s health has been an issue discussed since the bill went into effect upon the U.S. Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. 
He said there are “well-meaning people that are talking about some changes to that legislation.” 
“Idaho is never going to be a place where it’s a preferred place for abortions. That’s my position. That’s position the most Idaho,” he said. “But we want women’s health to be available at the highest level.” 
 Four ICE agents in Idaho, Little says 

A caller asked about immigration enforcement in Idaho, as it has escalated nationwide. 
Little said there are four federal Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents in Idaho. 
The governor noted that the Idaho State Police has signed what’s called a 287(g) agreement with the  ICE. The state approved ISP to spend up to $300,000 from the governor’s emergency fund to transport undocumented people to ICE detention facilities for deportation. 
Little said Monday the program is focused on people who have been convicted of separate crimes. 
“After they go through their due process, rather than turning them back out on the street that they’re they’re sent to their home country,” he said. 
Through this agreement, the state has transported more than 50 people to ICE detention centers. An analysis of criminal records by the Idaho Capital Sun found that most but not all had had convictions in Idaho, with some being charged and transported before their cases completed and a couple who had faced charges that were later dismissed.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in News & Citizen on Nov. 20, 2025.
For the second time in just over a year, farm workers and immigrant rights advocates last Saturday staged protests at multiple Hannaford supermarket locations to pressure the regional grocery chain to guarantee better labor conditions for dairy workers.
Locally, protesters gathered outside the Hannaford in Morrisville’s Fairground Plaza on Nov. 15 to push the company and its multinational Dutch parent company, Ahold Delhaize, to participate in immigrant rights advocacy group Migrant Justice’s Milk with Dignity program.
The Milk with Dignity program asks participating corporations to pay more for dairy products to ensure better working conditions for workers on dairy farms. Vermont-based ice cream giant Ben & Jerry’s has participated in the program since 2017.

In October, Vermont Way Foods, a progressive distributor of Vermont products, announced a partnership to allow Migrant Justice to monitor working conditions in their products’ dairy supply chain, and even promoted the partnership with a “Cheese with Dignity” product.
In a survey conducted by Migrant Justice of Vermont farmworkers, over two-thirds of survey takers said they make less than minimum wage — in some cases far less — while another two-thirds reported suffering an injury due to working conditions.
Though Migrant Justice has targeted Hannaford in pressure campaigns to join Milk with Dignity since 2019, the campaign has escalated since protestors last appeared at the Morrisville location in October 2024.
In April, Migrant Justice filed a complaint with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international trade forum in which 37 countries develop policy around economic trade, alleging “grave human rights violations” in Hannaford’s dairy supply chain.
With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza Saturday, Nov. 15 with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.

Ahold Delhaize responded by commissioning an independent human rights investigation. Migrant Justice “recently hosted the investigators charged with looking into labor violations, connecting them with workers on farms supplying Hannaford-brand milk,” the group said in a website post promoting the Nov. 15 protests, as investigators return to the Netherlands to submit their report.
Representatives for Portland, Maine-based Hannaford grocery or Ahold Delhaize did not respond to requests for comment.
With Hannaford under greater pressure, protestors returned to Fairground Plaza on with makeshift instruments, blaring music and chants in English and Spanish, handing out flyers to would-be shoppers and asking them to boycott the supermarket for a day.
A farmworker employed on a farm that guarantees fair labor conditions as part of the Ben & Jerry’s supply chain and asked that his name be withheld due to concerns of retaliation said that he valued the working conditions guaranteed by the Milk with Dignity program compared to what he sees on other farms.
“I have a voice, and I know that I have rights,” he said in Spanish, according to Migrant Justice spokesperson Will Lambek, who acted as translator. “For example, if I get sick, I can take a day off and I’ll still be paid for it. For Hannaford supply chain workers, even if they get sick, they have to keep working.”
Hannaford responded with an increased security detail, employing not just private security guards as they had the previous year but also law enforcement with the Morristown Police Department and the Lamoille County Sheriff’s Department. Officers questioned anyone attempting to park in the Hannaford parking lot to ensure only customers were allowed.
Farmworkers and activists gathered publicly on Nov. 15 even as federal immigration detainment actions have become increasingly common, with nine people detained in Hardwick in September and another seven detained after a targeted raid at a gas station in Jeffersonville earlier this month.
Eight people were detained after an immigration police raid on a Franklin County dairy farm in April, and Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, an organizer with Migrant Justice, and his stepdaughter were detained after being pulled over on the road by the United States Border Patrol in Richford in June.
“We are here again, speaking up and demanding our rights, and there is a lot of risk to that,” the farmworker said. “We understand that, but if we were to let ourselves be conquered by our fear, that would be letting them win.”

Gianforte and USFS Lolo Forest Supervisor Ben Johnson holding the permit for the 2025 State Capitol Christmas Tree
Most years, the tallest Christmas tree harvested in Montana, as far as the Daily Montanan is aware, takes up residence under the Capitol rotunda in Helena for the holiday season, towering nearly three stories tall and adorned with more than 3,500 lights.
On Monday, as Gov. Greg Gianforte looked on, foresters felled this year’s Capitol Christmas tree in the Lolo National Forest.
Near Seeley Lake, a Good Neighbor Authority project between the state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation and the U.S. Forest Service provided an active forest management site to harvest the Douglas Fir that will serve as the state’s Christmas tree, all while contributing to the health of the forest.
“Each year, it’s a privilege to bring a tree from our public lands into the state capitol for all to enjoy,” Gianforte said in a statement. “Through the Good Neighbor Authority, the State of Montana and the Forest Service work together to actively manage our forests and improve their health. This year’s tree is an example of the good work happening to reduce fire risk in Montana.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said they didn’t know how tall the Douglas Fir was, but will have a better idea once it’s installed in the rotunda.
The Capitol Christmas tree is selected from a different parcel of public land around the state each year. Similarly, the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., displays a Christmas tree harvested from a different National Forest each year. The last tree from Montana — a 79-foot tall Engelmann Spruce from the Kootenai National Forest — was selected in 2017.
This year, a 53-foot red fir named Silver Belle all the way from the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest in Nevada arrived in D.C. over the weekend to become the nation’s Capitol Christmas Tree.
Montana has a long history of producing commercial Christmas trees.
At its height in the middle of the last century, northwest Montana was shipping more than 4 million trees to homes around the country, earning the town of Eureka the nickname “Christmas Tree Capital of the World.”
Now, Montana doesn’t rank in the top 20 states for growing commercial trees, with just 6,338 cultivated trees harvested in 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
However, following the governor’s lead, Montanans are able to harvest trees from the state’s vast public lands — data that is not available from state or federal agencies — creating a tradition for many Montana families.
The 2025 State Capitol Christmas tree will displayed in the Capitol rotunda throughout the holiday season. The governor and first lady invite Montanans to join them at the Capitol for a tree lighting ceremony on Monday, Dec. 1, at 5 p.m.
The governor encourages Montanans to participate in the unique tradition of harvesting Christmas trees from public lands to benefit forest health and resiliency as well as improve wildlife habitat.
Cutting any trees on state trust land requires a permit from the local DNRC field office. The cost is $10 per tree. To find a local DNRC field office to secure a permit in person to harvest a Christmas tree, see the map here.
Montanans can also harvest trees from National Forest land with a $5 permit, though some restrictions on height and species apply to trees from federal land.
Forest Service permits can be obtained online by visiting recreation.gov and searching “Christmas tree” and the forest you plan to cut it from, i.e. “Flathead National Forest, Lolo National Forest.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image001-1-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-11-24 19:56:59.017689

She worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service until she lost her job as part of the Trump administration's reduction of the federal workforce. (Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)When 9-year-old Liz Renner visited the Gavins Point National Fish Hatchery in southeastern South Dakota with her grandfather, she was hooked.
In adulthood, she devoted more than a decade of education and work to understanding the intricacies of fish biology and conservation. Then, in May 2024, she was hired to work at the hatchery as a fish biologist and member of the Pallid Sturgeon Recovery Program, working to save the endangered species of fish.
“But it felt more like a nightmare at the end than a dream come true,” said the 31-year-old, originally from Crooks.


From insiders to ousted
This is the first of four stories about federal government employees or contractors in South Dakota affected by the Trump administration’s reduction of the federal workforce.
Read the series >


Renner was laid off in February under Department of Government Efficiency action, reinstated in March, and then offered and accepted a deferred resignation weeks later because she feared she’d be let go again later on. She was paid her federal wages through the end of September in exchange for her leaving her position.
“I finally felt like I could breathe after I left the hatchery for a second time,” Renner said. “It was a sense of relief that the roller coaster was done for me.”
Renner was one of about 154,000 federal employees who took buyouts — officially known as deferred resignations — offered by the Trump administration earlier this year as a way to reduce the size of the federal workforce. Office of Personnel Management Director Scott Kupor said recently that he expects the total decrease in the federal workforce to reach more than 300,000 eventually.
Of the 45 probationary employees laid off in February in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Mountain-Prairie Region, which includes eight states, Renner said she was one of at least 25 who didn’t return, either because they were not reinstated after DOGE cut them or because they accepted a buyout. Probationary employees are recent hires, usually in the first year of their position. Their loss burdened remaining employees with larger workloads and a hectic summer, Renner heard from her former colleagues.
‘My trust in these institutions is forever shaken’
At this point, Renner is grateful she was able to stay in her field and in the Midwest. Many other former federal biologists are not as fortunate, she said.
Renner moved in with her grandmother in Lyons, South Dakota, and splits her time between there and Lincoln, Nebraska, as a post-doctoral fisheries biologist at the University of Nebraska.
Now she researches, teaches and mentors students, and warns them about what they face. Their most promising options, she tells them, are finding a program out of the country, working in private consulting or with nonprofits, or working in liberal states with legislatures that prioritize conservation funding. 
Due to federal workforce reductions, Renner said, those recent graduates may be competing for an entry-level or seasonal job against someone with a master’s degree or over 10 years of experience in the field. Other peers have left the fisheries field altogether.
Renner remains passionate about research to conserve, propagate and reintroduce threatened and endangered fish and improve water quality in the state. She plans to stay in the field and look at ways to accomplish her mission outside of the federal government.
“My trust in these institutions is forever shaken,” Renner said, adding that if federal cuts continue, “I don’t know what young person in good conscience could look at what’s happened and say, ‘I want to work for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.’”

Nate Blouin is jumping into the race for a newly drawn congressional district favoring Democrats.  
Blouin is running for Congress in 2026 instead of a second term in the Utah Senate because he wants to stand up to President Donald Trump and work on making housing more affordable, he told Utah News Dispatch Monday.
“People are having to decide between a mortgage or child care, and that’s unacceptable. We should be able to provide people in the richest country in the world with all of those opportunities,” Blouin said. 
Blouin, 36, said he believes Congress needs more representatives who are younger and understand what it’s like to navigate today’s economy with student debt. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Earlier this month, a Utah judge rejected a map proposed by the state’s Republican-controlled Legislature, saying it did not comply with a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria. 
The judge selected boundaries pitched by a coalition of voting rights groups and citizens, creating the state’s first Democratic-leaning district in 20 years. 
Blouin’s announcement this week follows those of former state Sen. Derek Kitchen, state lawmaker Katheen Riebe and former congressman Ben McAdams, all declaring a bid for the U.S. House seat ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. 
Blouin was elected to the state Senate in 2022 and represents parts of Sugar House, Millcreek, Murray, West Valley City and South Salt Lake. He said the entirety of his current district is contained in the new District 1.
“I know from these constituents that I’m standing up for the stuff that they — the values that they — believe in, and I’m going to keep doing that,” Blouin said. 
Outside of serving in Utah’s part-time Legislature, he is a communications strategy consultant working with clean energy and environmental groups.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)The corn and soybean harvest is complete in Iowa, according to the final U.S. Department of Agriculture crop report. Producers, meanwhile, remain concerned about the cost of inputs, commodity prices and markets.
The report said Iowa corn harvest, at 99% of acres harvested, is “virtually” complete. The national report shows the other top corn-producing states have on average just 4% left to harvest. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said farmers delivered a “significant crop” in 2025 despite “variable” weather conditions, disease and a challenging agricultural economy.  
“Strong production requires strong markets, and we will continue working to build and diversify demand at home, across the country and around the world,” Naig said in a statement.

According to the report, 67% of topsoil moisture and 66% of subsoil moisture across Iowa is adequate. South central Iowa has the driest soil conditions with about 60% of topsoil and subsoil short of moisture. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan said the statewide average precipitation for the Nov. 17 through Nov. 23 reporting period was 0.20 inch. That means precipitation was about half of the normal of 0.43 inch.
Glisan said the statewide average temperature for the period at 43.8 degrees Fahrenheit was 6.1 degrees above the normal.
Will Cannon, a board member with Iowa Corn Growers Association and a farmer in Jasper County, said his harvest wrapped up in a “pretty typical timeframe” though he said almost everyone he has spoken to had a handful of fields with “disappointing yields.” 
Cannon said these fields were hit with disease, like southern corn rust, or seemed to reach maturity quickly but with small kernel sizes. His estimations, and conversations he’s had with other growers, point to the warm overnight temperatures as the crop matured as the cause. 
“I think about everybody’s got at least one or two fields that were like that this year,” Cannon said. 
He said marketing corn this season has been “interesting” because the lack of federal farm reports during the 43-day government shutdown this fall meant producers were “flying blind.” 
The latest crop production report from USDA estimated corn yields were at 186 bushels per acre nationally, though the report does not include October yields due to the shutdown. Cannon said he expects the next report will show lower yield figures that will help some farmers’ marketing strategies. 
“There’s going to be a lot of people paying attention to that report, because, in theory, that’ll probably be the most complete report we’ve gotten in many, many months,” Cannon said. 
Iowa Capital Dispatch spoke with Cannon in early October about ag trade uncertainty, in particular with China. 
Since then, China agreed to purchase U.S. soybeans and remove tariffs on agricultural commodities like corn. 
Cannon said from his perspective, there is still uncertainty in the market and a general unease about the farm economy. 
He said on the other hand, he has been encouraged by conversations and legislative efforts to address some of the “fundamental issues in farming” like consolidation and high input costs. 
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley and U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, both Republicans from Iowa, have introduced legislation known as the Fertilizer Research Act that would require a government study on consolidation and pricing in the fertilizer industry. 
Grassley additionally led a hearing in the Senate in late October about consolidation in the fertilizer and seed industries that he alleged are causing elevated input costs. 
“Whatever you want to call it right now, farmers are still incredibly concerned about what it’s costing to produce the crop, and what the price is right now,” Cannon said. “There’s still a tremendous amount of concern about what it’s going to cost for next year’s crop to produce it.”

Free school meal advocates in North Dakota are calling on the state Legislature to prioritize permanent funding to pay for meals. (Dan Koeck/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakotans may have the chance to cast their ballot on whether every public school student in the state can have breakfast and lunch for free. 
Advocacy organization Together For School Meals plans to submit language for the potential ballot petition to the Secretary of State’s Office this week. 
If approved and the required 31,164 signatures for constitutional ballot measure are gathered, submitted and verified, the measure would appear on the 2026 general election ballot in November with the free meals beginning during the 2027-28 school year.
Robin Nelson, chair of the ballot petition’s sponsoring committee, said the effort to provide school meals to North Dakota students for free began with a small team of citizens in preparation for the 2021 legislative session. While legislative proposals have failed, she said polling shows it is popular with the public.
Lawmakers expand free school meals in North Dakota after rejecting larger proposal

“We carefully brought it through the proper channels legislatively and, due to the high approval rating across the state of North Dakota, we weren’t going to stop if this is what our North Dakota citizens want,” Nelson said.
Free school lunches for all students received 79% support in a recent North Dakota United poll. In 2024, a poll by the North Dakota News Cooperative revealed 82% of those asked support more government involvement in providing school meals.
She also said the measure would affect every public school student in North Dakota and private and tribal schools can opt-in to the program.
Nelson is a school board member for Fargo Public Schools and the CEO of the Boys and Girls Club of the Red River Valley, but she said she will be working on the ballot petition as a private citizen.
During the 2025 legislative session, two bills were introduced that would have provided breakfast and lunch for every North Dakota student, attending public or private school, at no cost to the student. Both bills failed in the North Dakota House of Representatives, with some lawmakers citing a need to balance the state budget while others said a federal program was adequate.

In submitted testimony, Lynelle Johnson, director of child nutrition and food distribution programs for the Department of Public Instruction, said the department estimated the cost to provide a breakfast and lunch to every North Dakota student would be about $140 million for the current biennium.
In the funding estimate, Nelson said the measure relies on schools receiving 100% reimbursement from federal free or reduced meal programs. Federal programs provide free school meals to students with household incomes at, or below, 130% of the federal poverty level, and partial reimbursement for households below 185% the federal poverty level. 
Legislators have used state funding to slightly expand who qualifies for free and reduced meals. Earlier this year, legislators added about $7.3 million in state funding. With the change, a family of four with income of $72,000 a year qualifies for free school meals. 
If the measure passes next year, the petition would allow state lawmakers to fund the program how they see fit. However, if lawmakers don’t identify a funding source during the 2027 legislative session, language in the petition would require it to be funded from the Legacy Fund earnings. That fund also provides money for property tax relief through the primary residence tax credit.
Amy Jacobson, executive director of Prairie Action ND and member of the coalition, said when kids are fed, they are more productive in the classroom.
“This is something that will directly impact a family’s ability to have more money in their pocket book and be able to spend that on other necessary needs that they do have,” Jacobson said. “There is nothing better that North Dakotans could be investing in than our future, and that is our children.”

FEMA officials said on Nov. 21, 2025 that those seeking compensation for recent well contamination will need to first prove “injuries and causation.” (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Officials with the federal claims office overseeing a multi-billion-dollar compensation fund for New Mexico’s Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire victims told Source New Mexico they will consider paying to address newly found well contamination, but only if victims first prove “injuries and causation.”
A recent independent geologic study discovered high levels of heavy metals in several dozen private wells in Mora County, findings the study’s author attributed to fire suppressants firefighters used in battling the 534-square-mile wildfire that raged for several months in spring and summer 2022. 
Geologist Kate Zeigler’s report — which documented elevated levels of metals like antimony, manganese and uranium beyond federal safe drinking water limits — also prompted the state Health Department to issue a health alert, warning families using the wells to drink bottled water and citing fire suppressants as a potential source for the contamination. Other state and local agencies have also since stepped in to donate pallets of bottled water to the area. 
Meanwhile, some Mora County residents and U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández (D-N.M.) have called on the Federal Emergency Management Agency to use some of roughly $2 billion remaining in a compensation fund it oversees to help address the issue. The FEMA claims office responded Friday afternoon with answers to Source New Mexico’s questions about whether it will award compensation for claims for the latest contamination. 
New Mexico officials, Mora residents say feds should respond to groundwater contamination

Officials wrote in an unsigned statement that, “FEMA does not make determinations related to recent reports of heavy metals in drinking water in Northern New Mexico” and that the office “is not authorized to conduct studies of potential damages caused by the fire.”
Still, the statement said the office would consider claims individuals and households bring regarding contamination.
“Heavy metals caused by the fire can be compensable, and a claimant will need to present a claim demonstrating injuries and causation,” officials said in the statement.
Congress awarded FEMA $5.45 billion with the aim of “fully compensating” victims of the wildfire, which resulted from two botched prescribed burns on federal land in early 2022. In addition to burned property and smoke damage, the fire also caused widespread floods and debris flows, known as “cascading events,” for which the office has also agreed to pay. 
According to the latest figures, the office has paid about $3.24 billion in compensation. 
In an emailed statement to Source on Monday afternoon, Leger Fernández called on FEMA to quickly establish a process to address the heavy metal contaminants “rather than being dismissive.” 
“The office can and should create a protocol to quickly address these claims, similar to what they have done in other instances of loss,” she said.
Given that she helped draft and pass the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire Assistance Act, which created the compensation fund, Leger Fernández said she knows the bill’s legislative intent, which is to pay for the fire, as well as flooding and other ensuing harms. 
NM officials issue warning over high metals in Mora County groundwater

“The cascading events from the fire, including the flooding and now the water contamination, must be compensated,” she said. “Given that water is essential to life, these claims must be processed as expeditiously as possible.”
Paula Garcia, a lifelong Mora resident and director of the New Mexico Acequia Association, said the agency needs to be more proactive to deal with the latest environmental threat the fire caused. 
“The claims office should make a determination based on available data that the fire retardant drops caused elevated levels of heavy metal in our water. They don’t have to do their own study, she told Source. “It is within their power to make a determination on existing data on causation.”
She said she’s also unsure how claimants can prove “injury,” at least while compensation is still available through the fund. 
“Heavy metals have long-term impacts. I don’t see how an individual could demonstrate injury. Making people demonstrate injury and causation is a way to weed people out,” she said. 
According to the Health Department, prolonged or high-concentration exposure to the metals can damage kidneys and the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Infants, young children and pregnant people are the most sensitive, particularly to arsenic and manganese, which can affect brain development and cause other health effects. 
In the statement, the claims office noted that if a connection between the fire and the contamination is proved, the office would reimburse claimants, and encouraged people to contact claims office navigators to work on reopening or adding to their damage claims.
The statement also declined to respond to recent criticism from Leger Fernández and other members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation about the office’s treatment of “cascading event” claims. In a Nov. 6 letter, the delegation said FEMA was not acting quickly enough or at all on claims for new flooding damage. 
The statement provided to Source said FEMA does not comment publicly on its responses to congressional inquiries, but officials noted that claims can be reopened in some cases. 
“However, not all issues that arise from after the fire are caused by the fire, and in some cases requests for additional compensation have been found ineligible,” the statement reads.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_5381-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo via FWC)Florida’s first bear hunt in a decade will take place as scheduled next month after a state judge on Monday denied a motion by a conservation group to stop it from taking place.
Leon County Circuit Judge Angela Dempsey denied the temporary preliminary injunction sought by Bear Warriors United, which argued the hunt authorization was based on outdated data and will harm the bear population in Florida — right now estimated at around 4,050.
The group filed a lawsuit in September seeking to stop the 23-day hunt, after it was approved by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) in August and is scheduled to take place from Dec. 6 to Dec. 28.
“I’m going to find here that the plaintiff has not met their burden on substantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Judge Dempsey said at the end of a two-and-half-hour hearing that took place via Zoom on Monday.
“The 2015 hunt was found constitutional under the rational basis test and this hunt is significantly more conservative than that hunt in 2015, both in number of bears that could be harvested as well as the timing, when it’s a little less likely for more female bears to be killed.”
Supporters of the hunt point to increased interactions between bears and humans and consequent fears of attacks.
Questions about the data
Bear Warriors United contended the FWC was relying on “stale and outdated” data to reach the conclusion that the best way to manage the black bear population in Florida was a regulated hunt.
The most dramatic part of the hearing was an exchange between Thomas Crapps, attorney for Bear Warriors United, and FWC bear management coordinator Mike Orlando. Crapps asked Orlando at one point whether it “wouldn’t be more prudent to wait to get that information to decide whether or not a hunt was appropriate, based on more current data?”
“Actually, the science that we have now is actually very good data and, as those population estimates come in over time, we have the ability to actually adjust harvest rates and other things. But no, the population estimates that we’re working with right now are fantastic,” Orlando responded. “It’s good science.”
Orlando said that it takes up to two years for FWC to conduct a population study. That prompted Crapps to ask him why not wait to get more current data before making such an important decision?
“Because we will never have new data. It will always be old,” Orlando said. “So, what we’re doing again is taking a very conservative estimate approach to the hunting season, using the best available science that we have and, any new science that comes in, we will make adjustments. We have to be adaptive. That’s management 101.”
This will be the first bear hunt in Florida since 2015, when the hunt was shut down at the end of its second day after nearly 300 bears had been killed.
The bears are spread out across the state in seven areas known as Bear Management Units by the FWC. In justifying the hunt, the agency has said that, since 2015, the four largest subpopulations of bears have grown annually, and no subpopulations have shown evidence of decline.
Plan calls for removal of 172 bears in four ‘hunting zones’
The plan now allows for the removal of 172 bears from four “bear hunting zones” — 68 in the East Panhandle; 31 in the North; 18 in Central Florida; and 55 in the South hunting area.
To participate, individuals must have been at least 18 years old by Oct. 1 and hold a hunting license and a bear harvest permit. Bear harvest permits cost $100 for Florida residents and $300 for non-residents and are not transferable. It cost $5 to submit an application, and there was no limit on how many applications individuals could submit.
However, not all of those who have received a permit will use it to kill a bear.
News 6 WKMG in Orlando reports that 44 people selected for the bear hunt are against killing bears. “By the time it’s all over with, we’ve got at least 52 of the 172, which will reduce the number of bears killed down to about 120 or less,” said Chuck O’Neal, president of Speak Up for Wildlife.
In his closing statement representing Bear Warriors United, Crapps noted that agency staff presented the first report on the Florida Black Bear Management Plan in December 2024 with a recommendation that no immediate action was needed.
“And it’s the FWC commissioners then direct them to have a hunt,” he said. “At that point, the science is being driven by the politics. And that is wrong.”
Not true, argued attorney Rhonda Parnell, representing the FWC.
“The science is sound,” she said. “Bears have always been a game animal. This hunt is no different than any other hunt, whether it is deer, turkey, quail, etc. We are the ones who get to make that determination. It is not for the court to say, ‘Well, you can determine deer hunting, but you can’t determine bear hunting.’ That would be an impermissible ruling by this court.”
Litigation will continue, as Judge Dempsey declined FWC’s request to dismiss the lawsuit. A hearing on that motion will take place on Dec. 15 — halfway through the bear hunt.
In a survey conducted by the FWC of more than 13,000 self-selected participants, 75% opposed the proposal, with just 23% in support. Other polls, such as a Remington Research survey commissioned by the Humane World for Animals, showed that 81% of Florida residents oppose the reopening of bear-hunting season.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard) Colleen Melody said she’s done interviews for two jobs in the past 12 years. Bob Ferguson conducted both.
About a decade ago, Ferguson, then Washington’s attorney general, chose her to lead his office’s new civil rights unit devoted to investigating and enforcing anti-discrimination laws.
On Monday, Ferguson, now governor, named Melody as Washington’s newest state Supreme Court justice.
Melody, 43, will succeed Justice Mary Yu, who announced her retirement in September. 
“Anyone who has had any interaction with Colleen in a legal setting would all agree that she has a brilliant legal mind,” Ferguson said at a news conference in the Supreme Court chambers at the Temple of Justice in Olympia. 
Melody said “the toughest question” in the hiring process was why she wanted to leave a job she so enjoyed.
“I never dreamt of being a judge,” she said. She added that working the past decade with individuals and juries, and in courthouses across the state, incited the desire.
Though the U.S. Supreme Court and federal courts are in the headlines, “state courts are actually the place where most of us who are able to access justice go to seek it,” Melody said, adding that they have “never been more important than they are right now.”
Yu will leave the court at the end of the year. An election will be held next year to complete the remainder of Yu’s term, which runs through Dec. 31, 2028.
This is Ferguson’s first appointment to the state’s high court. Sixteen people applied. He said he was evaluating applicants for their intellectual capacity, work ethic and ability to build consensus with other justices.
Melody, a native of Spokane and graduate from the University of Washington law school, worked previously in the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division.
Ferguson, then attorney general, created the Wing Luke Civil Rights Division and hired Melody to guide the new department in 2015.
In her tenure, Melody has established the division as a “national powerhouse” for standing up for the rights of Washingtonians, “and, we’ve seen, many Americans as well,” Ferguson said.
In 2017, Melody helped lead Washington’s successful challenge to President Trump’s first travel ban, which barred the citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the United States.
This year, Melody’s team won the first temporary restraining order against the second Trump Administration’s attempt to revoke birthright citizenship, protecting the constitutional rights of everyone born in this country.
“She’s a unique talent,” Ferguson said.
Washington’s nine state Supreme Court justices are elected to six-year terms with vacancies filled by appointment of the governor until the next general election. The only requirement for the office is that a prospective justice be admitted to the practice of law in Washington state.
Justice Sal Mungia, the newest member, was sworn into office in January following his narrow election win in November 2024. 
Each year, justices are asked to review more than a thousand cases, mostly from state appeals courts and some from superior courts.
Melody, during her remarks Monday, noted problems with declining credibility in courts and said that “the rule of law seems more fragile than it has to me at any point during my lifetime.”
“It seemed important to me,” she said, “that people of goodwill, who are willing to work hard and who have deep faith in the courts as cornerstones of democracy, that those people be willing to raise their hands and serve.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/unnamed-2-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

The five-member search advisory constituency, announced Thursday, is tasked with helping to vet candidates for the historically Black university’s next leader, according to the IHL board. 
The board also announced plans to begin recruiting candidates to be Jackson State’s next president in December. The top job at Jackson State has been vacant since May, after Marcus Thompson resigned without explanation less than two years into his tenure. Thompson was the third president to depart in five years. 
Denise Jones-Gregory, who was the provost and vice president of academic affairs, is serving as the interim president. 
The constituency members “were selected for their professional insight and long-time connections with Jackson State University,” John Sewell, director of communications for the IHL board, said in an email.
The search advisory constituency group members are: 

Nicholas J. Hill, dean of the College of Business 
Candice L. Jackson, secretary of the faculty senate and an associate professor in the Department of English, Foreign Languages and Speech Communications 
Deidre L. Wheaton, associate dean of the College of Education and Human Development
Retired Brigadier General Robert Crear, Jackson State Development Foundation advisory board member
Patrease Edwards, national alumni association president

Some alumni still question if the IHL board will allow the group full agency to properly vet candidate applications and approve of candidate finalists. Jackson State alumni and supporters have questioned the IHL board’s opaque search process, advocating for more stakeholder input into selecting the next president.  
The creation of the constituency group is one way the board is acting on concerns from JSU alumni and supporters who want more input in the search process. Last month, the board voted unanimously to create the group.
IHL board policies allow for the creation of an advisory group of up to 15 members. It’s not clear why they selected only five. John Sewell, a spokesman for the board, did not directly respond to a question from Mississippi Today about the rationale for the group size.
The IHL board has not used an advisory group to assist with Jackson State’s president searches since 2017. That search resulted in IHL hiring William Bynum, who was unpopular among alumni and constituents — but Bynum wasn’t on the list of finalists the constituency group recommended. 
The board ultimately rejected the group’s input and named Bynum president of the university. Bynum resigned in 2020 after he was arrested in a prostitution bust that ended his presidential term. 
In 2022, the IHL board revised its policies to provide for a search advisory constituency. 
The advisory group should have a meaningful stake in the selection of Jackson State’s next president, said Mark Dawson, chairman of Thee 1877 Project, an alumni-led group advocating for transparency in the selection process. The number of alumni selected for the advisory group is disappointing, he said, and the individuals the IHL board selected for the advisory group doesn’t represent a breadth of alumni voices.
“Members should have the full ability to reject and approve candidates. As constituents, we should also know who the potential finalists are for university president,” Dawson told Mississippi Today.  “Our group will continue to advocate for a fair, transparent search and the opportunity for all constituents and stakeholders voices to be heard and involved in the university’s president search.” 
Sen. Sollie Norwood, a Democrat from Jackson, said he would want more representation of students and community in the group, but ultimately, those chosen will have the best interest of the university at heart. 
“My hope is that after all this we will have a leader in place. We’re missing out on a lot of opportunities, and we all need to galvanize and work together to take Jackson State to a place where it should rightfully be,” Norwood said. 
Since August, the IHL board has gathered constituent feedback to shape the role before it starts to seek potential applicants. The job profile will provide an overview of Jackson State as well as information on issues and challenges stakeholders presented during campus listening sessions in October.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182234/JSU18.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo by Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill is condemning the Trump administration for launching an investigation into an Arizona senator accused of misconduct by the Pentagon.
U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday said U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Arizona) brought “discredit upon the armed forces” for joining other Democrats last week in a video telling military members they have the right to refuse to follow illegal orders. Kelly is a retired Navy captain.
Sherrill, a Democrat and former U.S. Navy helicopter pilot, in a statement called the Trump administration’s targeting of Kelly “another abuse of power by the most incompetent and unfit Secretary of Defense in our nation’s history.”
“Sen. Mark Kelly — a New Jersey native and fellow U.S. Navy veteran — has served our country with distinction, both in combat and space missions. Now, Hegseth wants to prosecute him for stating unequivocally that service members must follow the law and the Constitution — a reminder that Hegseth himself should heed,” she said.
Sherrill was elected governor earlier this month, and takes office on Jan. 20.
The six Democrats who appeared in last week’s video have been battling Trump since it dropped, with Trump accusing them of “seditious behavior at the highest level.” The Pentagon on Monday said potential repercussions for Kelly include recalling him to active duty for court-martial proceedings. 
Kelly said on social media that he would not be intimidated out of “holding this administration accountable.”
“I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution,” he said.
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Kelly and the other Democrats in the video were encouraging “disorder and chaos within the ranks.”
“Not a single one of them … can point to a single illegal order that this administration has given down because it does not exist,” Leavitt said. “They knew what they were doing in this video and Sen. Mark Kelly and all of them should be held accountable for that.”

(Photo by Getty images)Four Idaho mental health clinics are suing the state over a contractor’s plans to cut critical Idaho Medicaid services for people with severe mental illness. 
The lawsuit, filed last week in state court, asks a judge to pause Magellan of Idaho’s plans to cut specialized mobile teams that treat patients with severe mental illness who have struggled in routine settings. The cuts, providers argue, would effectively end the program, risking worsening mental health conditions and violent episodes in communities. 
“This is critical care — without their medication, these patients pose a serious threat of harm to themselves or others,” attorneys for the clinics wrote in support of their motion for a stay on the planned cut.
Magellan’s cuts, announced late last month, stem from the state’s attempts to avoid a projected budget shortfall, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. The private company, which runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits, plans to cut peer support services and the mobile treatment program, called Assertive Community Treatment, on Dec. 1.
Spokespeople for the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and Magellan Health declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying they don’t comment on pending litigation.

 Lawsuit follows outcry over the cuts

Four mental health clinics — Access Behavioral Health Services, Tueller Counseling Service, Riverside Recovery and Mental Health Specialists — filed the lawsuit against the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
The providers argue that the state can’t change payment methods for the Assertive Community Treatment program “without following the required procedures; without publishing its decision and the reason for it; and without otherwise complying with applicable law.”
Idaho Medicaid contractor to cut critical services for people with severe mental illness

Days before the lawsuit was filed, several leaders of the mental health clinics that sued the state told the Idaho Capital Sun they feared these cuts could risk violent episodes in communities. 
Many of the roughly 400 to 500 people on the program will end up homeless if the program ends, Tueller Counseling Service Clinical Director Tom Tueller previously told the Sun.
In a news release Saturday, the Idaho Association of Community Providers said the program ending would shift costs to police, jails, local governments, hospitals and emergency medical services. The group’s analysis said the program costs the state $7 million each year.
“Idaho is eliminating every evidence-based program for its highest-acuity psychiatric populations,” the analysis found. “These cuts will not save money — they will destabilize six distinct populations and shift $150-180 (million) in new costs to Idaho’s hospitals, counties, EMS systems, and child-welfare programs.”
A Change.org petition opposing Magellan’s cuts has over 7,500 signatures.

(Courtesy of Getty Images)After a months-long state budget impasse that resulted in no new recurring funding for mass transit agencies, Gov. Josh Shapiro announced Monday that he’s sending an additional $220 million to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) to fund repairs and infrastructure projects meant to improve safety. 
The money will come from the Public Transit Trust Fund, which is broadly used for capital projects, and will be used in part to comply with federal mandates following a series of fires on SEPTA railcars.
“800,000 riders depend on SEPTA every single day, including 55,000 students who rely on SEPTA to get to school,” Shapiro said at a press conference Monday in Chester County. “… Mass transit is critical to our commonwealth’s success, it is critical to our commonwealth’s economy, and it’s critical that we invest in it.”
SEPTA is the largest mass transit authority in Pennsylvania. Earlier this year, its leaders warned that the agency was entering a “death spiral” unless lawmakers could find a new source of funding.

Ultimately, the Shapiro administration directed funding from the state’s Public Transit Trust Fund to SEPTA to keep the transit authority afloat. However, many Democratic state lawmakers and mass transit advocates say a long-term solution — and more money — is still needed.
The $220 million Shapiro announced for SEPTA today, the second major investment in a matter of months, will be used to repair and maintain its existing fleet, purchase new equipment, upgrade infrastructure in SEPTA stations, and replace catenary wires for trolleys and railcars.
SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer said the projects are necessary to “overcome the current crises” and “prevent problems moving forward.”
“We’re looking at every mile of infrastructure, each railcar, bus and all the other equipment that SEPTA runs to make sure we are putting out safe and reliable service each day,” he added.
SEPTA had already been carrying out a series of safety improvement projects following an emergency order from the Federal Railroad Administration after an investigation into five fires on Silverliner IV railcars used by the transit authority which had passengers on board.
The Governor made the announcement at SEPTA’s Frazer Shop & Yard in Chester County.
A long fight over transit funding
When budget negotiations began in February, mass transit funding was a key point of disagreement at the state Capitol between Democrats, who have a large Philadelphia-area caucus, and Republicans, who are more likely to represent rural parts of the state and object to increases in recurring spending.
Shapiro and Democrats had pushed to increase the share of sales tax the state directs to transit authorities in all 67 counties, which cover urban, rural and suburban areas. But Republicans in the state Senate ultimately blocked those efforts, citing, in part, failures by the largest transit authorities to tackle issues of crime and fare evasion. 
Roughly 1 million Pennsylvanians — about one in 13  people in the state — use mass transit every day across the commonwealth.
“Sadly, the Republicans who lead the Senate have been unwilling to come up with a deal to deliver reliable, recurring funding for mass transit,” Shapiro said at Monday’s press conference. “That left SEPTA in a position earlier this summer where they didn’t have enough funding for their operating costs at their operating service levels.”
What’s at stake over proposed increase in mass transit funding in Pa.? 

While budget negotiations dragged on last summer, SEPTA announced a series of fare raises and service cuts to offset what they called a lack of state funding. However, the Court of Common Pleas blocked the proposed cuts to bus and rail service, saying they disproportionately impacted low-income and minority riders..
The Shapiro administration then directed $394 million in capital projects funding to SEPTAy, effectively ending the fight over new transit funding in the 2025-2026 state budget.
It was a victory for Republicans, who had pushed to fund the state’s transit authorities with money from the Public Transportation Trust Fund, which they said contained more money than necessary for just the capital projects it was intended for.
“We have been consistent in recognizing the value of transit while making it clear investments by taxpayers need to include reasonable accountability measures,” Sen. Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) said in a statement Monday. “It was not until our transparency efforts shed light on the massive fund balance that the Governor’s hand was forced to finally make these resources available for their intended use.”
But SEPTA and other transit authorities say the solution was only a stopgap, and are continuing to push for a new source of recurring revenue that will keep them afloat into the future.
“For the second year in a row, Gov. Shapiro has stepped up and offered a lifeline to public transit in the southeast,” said Sauer.
In 2024, Shapiro unilaterally diverted $153 million in federal highway to SEPTA, a move that Republicans in the statehouse objected to.
Shapiro was also joined Monday by Democratic allies, such as Philadelphia Mayor Charelle Parker, Senate Appropriations Chair Vincent Hughes (D-Philadelphia) and House Transportation Chair Ed Neilson (D-Philadelphia).",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEPTA-Bus-2025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City) pleaded not guilty Monday to federal extortion charges alongside her two co-defendants, during a brief appearance in U.S. District Court in Baltimore.
A federal grand jury indicted Attar in October, on charges that she attempted to blackmail a political consultant who she feared would spread negative information about her to thwart her 2022 reelection campaign.
Prosecutors allege that Attar’s brother, Joseph Attar, took part in the plot, as did a campaign volunteer, Kalman Finkelstein, a Baltimore City police officer who has been suspended without pay.
Attar, brother and campaign volunteer charged with reelection extortion plot

All three, who were released from federal custody, appeared together in the courtroom Monday morning before Magistrate Judge Douglas R. Miller, each represented by their own attorneys. During the brief proceedings, each defendant rose and affirmed that they understood the charges, before formally entering their pleas.
Judge Miller set a Dec. 15 deadline for pretrial motions, though either side could request an extension.
Jeff Ifrah, an attorney for Dalya Attar, issued a statement after Monday’s hearing that said he plans to file a motion to dismiss the case. Attorneys representing the other two defendants declined to comment following Monday’s proceedings.
Attar, 35, was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2018, as a Democrat representing Baltimore’s District 41, and reelected in 2022. In January, she was appointed to fill the District 41 Senate seat, which became vacant when former Sen. Jill Carter stepped down.
Besides serving in the General Assembly, Attar is a lawyer and a former Baltimore City assistant state’s attorney.
Prosecutors allege that as Attar prepared for her 2022 reelection bid for the House of Delegates, Attar grew concerned that a political consultant, who was not identified in court documents, would attempt to derail her campaign, according to her indictment.
The three defendants, alongside unnamed co-conspirators, colluded to install cameras inside smoke detectors in a room where the consultant was staying, and videotape the consultant having an extramarital affair.

“I just want her to be a non-issue in my mind and in reality that won’t happen as long as she is relevant or doesn’t have anything to worry about,” the then-delegate wrote in a January 2020 message.
Joseph Attar ultimately used the footage to threaten both the consultant and the married man with whom she was having the affair.
Each of the three defendants face charges including conspiracy, extortion and interception and disclosure of a wire, oral or electronic communication.

BURLINGTON — Calling his crimes “brutal” and “brazen,” a judge ordered a former California man to spend the rest of his life behind bars for leading a cross-country murder-for-hire plot that led to the death of a Vermont man.
The sentence handed down Monday by Judge Christina Reiss in federal court in Burlington came after 43-year-old Serhat Gumrukcu maintained his innocence and claimed he played no role in the events leading to the 2018 fatal shooting of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville. 
“I didn’t plan it, I didn’t ask for it, “I didn’t know about it,” he said during the hearing.

This was the first time Gumrukcu spoke publicly since a jury convicted him in April following a five-week trial. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all charges, including murder for hire and conspiring to commit wire fraud. The verdict came after three other co-defendants reached plea deals and testified against him. 
In pronouncing the sentence Monday, the judge pointed out that Gumrukcu had the sole motive for the killing — silencing Davis, so he wouldn’t expose his deceitful business schemes — and that he should bear the consequences for his actions. 
“You decided to commit fraud and murder,” she said.
Gumrucku is a Turkish national who had been living in Los Angeles, California, for about a decade before Gregory Davis’ killing. In Turkey, Gumrukcu had worked as a magician before moving to the United States where prosecutors said he falsely posed as a medical doctor.   
Gumrukcu’s husband, William Anderson Wittekind, attended the hearing, sitting in the courtroom gallery behind him. After the hearing as Gumrukcu was placed in handcuffs and being led away, he turned to Wittekind and the two appeared to share a glance.
The three other participants in the plot were sentenced over two days in September to prison terms ranging between roughly nine and 16 years.
Gumrukcu was also initially set to be sentenced at that time, but sentencing was delayed after his attorney requested more time to prepare for the proceeding.
The murder-for-hire charge alone against Gumrukcu carried a mandatory sentence of life in prison, leaving little suspense about what sentence Gumrukcu would receive.
“I didn’t choose the sentence for you, Congress did,” the judge told Gumrukcu in formally imposing it.
In addressing the court, Gumrukcu said he made mistakes but still followed his principles and commitment to non-violence, maintaining that he wasn’t involved in the killing of Davis, despite the jury’s verdict.
Gumrukcu said he has sympathy for the family and what they have been through, but was saddened by the fact they believe he was involved in the plot. 
In her statement to the court, Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ wife, thanked all the people who worked to ensure justice, saying that she and her family are living proof that the legal system works.
Gregory Davis was the father of six when he was killed, and his wife was pregnant with the couple’s seventh child. 
Melissa Davis remembered her husband as “funny” and “brilliant” and described how his absence has been felt in every birthday, graduation, and holiday he missed. 
Still, she forgave Gumrukcu even if he had shown no remorse. She had previously addressed the four defendants in September and offered forgiveness to all of them, but Gumrukcu.
“It is not my job to condemn you — that belongs to God,” Davis told Gumrukcu on Monday. “My job is to live free,” she said, adding that forgiveness would allow her to move forward without anger or bitterness.
Gumrukcu and Gregory Davis had spent years prior to the murder working on a several million dollar business deal involving oil trading. Prosecutors had contended during the trial that Gumrukcu masterminded a plot to kill Davis because he was afraid the Vermont man was going to expose his fraudulent business tactics. Prosecutors added that Gumrukcu had sent fake emails and provided phony financial records. 
Jerry Banks, a former detention officer in Colorado, had been recruited by another plot member to serve as the hitman. Banks shot and killed Davis on a snowy night in January 2018 after kidnapping Davis from his home. Banks, posing as a deputy U.S. Marshal complete with a uniform and badge, showed up at Davis’ residence and told him was under arrest for racketeering.
Banks, according to prosecutors, then drove Davis away from the home in handcuffs before stopping a few miles away in a pull off in Barnet where he ordered Davis out of the vehicle. Banks then repeatedly shot Davis, killing him.
Investigators spent the next several years poring over business and banking documents and electronic records to piece together the links among the four men prosecutors would eventually charge for their roles in the deadly plot.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig, one of the prosecutors, told the judge that while Gumrukcu quoted the nonviolence philosophy spoken by Gandhi, it would be Davis’ murder that would define Gumrukcu’s life.
Susan Marcus, Gumrukcu’s attorney, contested the prosecution’s argument that Gumrukcu had obstructed justice. 
But the judge disagreed with her, saying that Gumrukcu’s trial testimony – denying any participation in the murder-for-hire plot – amounted to perjury and obstruction of justice.
In addition to sentencing Gumrukcu, the judge ordered that all four defendants should pay a total of $1.36 million in restitution to Davis’ family.  
The payments made by each of the defendants toward that restitution would be based, in large part, on a percentage of their incomes. The restitution figure, according to prosecutors, was based on an estimate of the amount of money Davis would have earned had he continued to work up until his retirement age.
Davis’ estate has also filed a civil wrongful death lawsuit against Gumrukcu in federal court in Vermont, which remains pending.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)State lawmakers are recommending the General Assembly continue to ease regulations for housing developers and strongly consider funding to incentivize housing and infrastructure construction as Kentucky grapples with a significant housing shortage. 
A couple of lawmakers on the Kentucky Housing Task Force during a Monday meeting emphasized the urgency of the shortage as the panel released recommendations ahead of the legislative session beginning in January.
A national research firm hired by the Kentucky Housing Corp. estimated last year the state needs more than 200,000 housing units, including rentals and homes for sale. The gap could grow to over 287,000 units by 2029 without efforts to build or repair housing, the study said, with low-income renters being particularly squeezed by the growing shortage. 
Rep. Mike Clines, R-Alexandria, told his colleagues the legislature must act. “I do think it’s time for us to really write some legislation that’s going to make some changes for our housing shortage,” Clines said.
The nine-page memo of recommendations, created after four prior meetings of the task force that began this summer, recounted gathering input from a number of groups including the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, the libertarian think tank Mercatus Center, the Homebuilders Association of Kentucky, the conservative advocacy group Americans for Prosperity and the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky. 
Most of the recommendations to lawmakers for the 2026 legislative session, when a two-year state budget will be crafted, focused on regulatory changes that seek to lower the cost of housing construction by either encouraging or mandating state and local governments “eliminate barriers” to building new homes. 
Those regulatory recommendations include: 

A two-year moratorium on any changes to state building and electrical codes “that would result in any increase to construction costs of residential units.” 
Allowing regulated third parties to issue permits for housing construction in lieu of the state. 
Recommending that local laws requiring a certain number of parking spots for housing developments “be reduced or eliminated entirely.” 
Various changes to the state building code that would “reduce costs to homebuilders.” One recommended change includes requiring only one staircase in multi-family and apartment buildings, the memo arguing that the cost is “exorbitant” to require additional staircases in larger housing developments “while any safety benefit is likely negligible.” 
Allowing religious institutions to build housing on their own land with less regulation, pointing to a bill filed, but not passed, in this year’s legislative session that aimed to do that.

The lawmakers on the task force write in their memo that the regulatory changes would build on bills signed into law during this year’s legislative session such as a law that prevents local governments from implementing certain restrictions on manufactured housing.
Sen. Robby Mills, R-Henderson, a co-chair of the task force, in a Lantern interview after the meeting said a large debate before the legislature is how far the state government will go in telling local communities how to regulate housing construction. Mills said he generally supports local government control but that “we’ve got to get active in building residential units.”
“We’ve got to allow more building to take place in Kentucky. And if it doesn’t happen then we need to step in, or we’re going to be, once again, falling behind,” Mills said. “I do believe the locals need to have an opportunity to act and react.” 
New take on factory-built could ease housing crunch, says Kentucky nonprofit

The task force recommends allowing local governments to establish “districts” within their boundaries where housing developers and local governments would be incentivized to build. 
The task force is also calling for lawmakers to strongly consider throwing state funding at the issue, especially to establish a revolving loan fund for housing infrastructure similar to a fund in Indiana and to create a state low-income housing tax credit to match an existing federal tax credit. 
Adrienne Bush, the executive director of the advocacy group Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, said she’s overall “pretty pleased” with the memo, including a recommendation that would increase the real estate transaction fees that go toward the state’s Affordable Housing Trust Fund that subsidizes housing construction. 
“We have this proven tool. It’s been working well for Kentucky,” Bush said, referring to the fund. “It just really hasn’t kept pace with what is needed to build and repair and renovate.” 
Bush said that “housing is fundamental” despite potential budget constraints. Republican legislative leadership is projecting a more challenging state budget due to federal funding uncertainty, and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear has said his administration is making adjustments after state revenue came in below projections for the last fiscal year.
“It is becoming clearer, clearer and clearer every day that without state financial intervention, Kentucky is going to continue to fall further and further behind in terms of our housing stock,” Bush said.
As the state budget is crafted, Mills said, a lot of things will “fall on the cutting floor because of the cost of Medicaid and other large ticket items.” He said he still planned to encourage his fellow lawmakers to put money into incentivizing affordable housing construction.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_9913-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 18:57:25.223319

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota soybean industry leaders said Monday that a new trade pledge with China is lifting prices but hasn’t erased anxiety about how much farmers depend on a single foreign buyer.
“China’s the number one buyer of soybeans out of the United States,” said Tom Kersting, CEO of South Dakota Soybean Processors. “At times, they buy 60% of all the exported soybeans out of the U.S.”
Harvest of stress: Soybean farmers await help as tariff dispute closes China market

Kersting was one of the participants in a panel discussion about soybeans hosted by the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club. South Dakota produced $2.3 billion worth of soybeans last year, the ninth highest value in the nation.
Kersting said China has “quietly” stepped back into the U.S. soybean market since Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the trade pledge in late October, after China had been boycotting purchases of U.S. soybeans in retaliation for tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Soybean prices at grain elevators were “right around $9” per bushel before the news of the trade pledge, Kersting said, and are now “over $10.”
But farmers are not benefiting equally from the price bump. Some sold at lower prices before the trade pledge announcement.
“The prices really didn’t appreciate till after harvest was pretty much complete,” Kersting said. “The ones that had some beans stored, they’ll see those gains.”
By his rough estimate, a new $500 million Mitchell soybean processing plant that opened in September has added 25 cents per bushel in value to local cash bids. 
Lake Preston farmer Paul Casper said the price increase has pushed him “closer to break-even on beans,” while Trump’s tariffs have raised the price of farm inputs such as fertilizers.
Casper said Brazil has emerged as a rival to U.S. soybean farmers after years of infrastructure investment backed by China, which makes the future feel less certain. Yet Casper said he still has faith in Trump. 
“I’m still thinking this dealmaker dude has got something up his sleeve,” Casper said.

Kersting said the threat of tariffs nudged other buyers to the table, including Vietnam and Thailand, “who we sell a lot of soybean meal to.”
Both men warned that long-term overreliance on China leaves U.S. agriculture vulnerable.
“At the end of the day, you should not be making deals with people you don’t trust, and nobody trusts them,” Kersting said. 
Doug Sombke, president of the South Dakota Farmers Union, did not appear on the panel, but said weeks ago after the trade pledge announcement that Trump is attempting to put out a fire he himself started, “and the building is already charred.”
“We went backward from where we started, and we didn’t need to do that,” Sombke said. “This isn’t a win. We’ve been played.”
Sombke said the numbers he has heard regarding the trade agreement fall short of what producers were counting on. He said smaller and beginning farmers are being squeezed the hardest.
“Well-established farmers are just going to eat through some of their equity,” he said. “But the younger farmer, the smaller guy, doesn’t have that.”
Sarah Sellars, an assistant professor and Extension specialist at South Dakota State University, told South Dakota Searchlight that the trade deal is “positive in a market that’s been facing a lot of negative news lately,” but said farmers “are still facing really tight crop margins.”
“If we’re not factoring in the money given by government programs or crop insurance, the cost of production is higher than what we’re actually able to sell the crop for,” she said.
On Monday, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the Trump administration plans to announce a financial aid package for U.S. farmers and provide more details on the China trade deal within two weeks. The aid package is designed to compensate farmers with government payments for tariff-related losses.

After the co-chair of the town's trails committee posted some 20 signs along the perimeter of Burn's Meadow, he said a selectboard member ""verbally attacked"" him. The selectboard member denied the characterization.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in The Citizen on Nov. 20, 2025.
“No hunting” signs posted around Charlotte’s 50-acre Burn’s Meadow have stirred contention between an elected official and volunteer, resulting in the co-chair of the trails committee leaving his post after saying he was “harassed” by a selectboard member earlier this month.
Jack Pilla, co-chair of the trails committee, submitted a written resignation to the selectboard earlier this month and filed a formal complaint this week, saying selectboard member Lewis Mudge “verbally attacked” him after Pilla placed “No Hunting” signs along the perimeter of Burn’s Meadow.
Mudge, in a phone call, denied Pilla’s characterization of the conversation as “harassment,” and said his concern was rooted in the lack of proper procedure taken and the possibility that the new signs would open the town to a legal battle with an upset hunter.

Pilla said he received a phone call in September from someone wondering about hunting on other recreation paths located in the town. He said there’s always been discussion about whether hunting is allowed on town-owned lands that are near the extensive trail network. He often sees people out squirrel hunting, noting that seeing someone sitting up in a tree stand with a .22 while walking the recreation path can be off-putting for some trail users.
“That’s been a question I’ve had for many years and in the Charlotte Park and Wildlife Refuge, there is no hunting there,” he said. “I was on the [Charlotte Park and Wildlife Refuge] committee years ago, and I actually posted 290 acres of that entire park and not once did I have any negativity from the selectboard. I had some feedback from some of the locals who like to hunt there, but it is what it is.”
Pilla said former town administrator Nate Bareham — who resigned in October — gave him permission to move forward with the state’s procedure of posting the land.
The registration for Burn’s Meadow, located just off Greenbush Road, was submitted, with the town administrator’s signature, to the town clerk’s office on Oct. 13, citing the property’s proximity to the public trail system. “There are regular posted signs that the state wants you to use and that’s exactly what we used,” Pilla said. “And you have to date them, and then there’s a whole procedure of [posting] every 400 feet and it has to be on the perimeter. So, I did that.”
He said roughly 20 signs had been posted, although most, as of Monday, had been taken down, with a few still spotted along the perimeter. While the signs remained unbothered for a few weeks that followed, in November, he was contacted by Mudge. “Within a two-hour period, before I could even talk to him on the phone, he had called and texted and voice mailed me eight times,” Pilla said. “I call that harassment.”
He said after he finally called Mudge back, the conversation — which he said wasn’t really a two-way dialogue — lasted roughly three and a half minutes before he finally had to hang up. “He was just livid and was all over me,” Pilla said. “I couldn’t deal with any more of his yelling at me.”
For Mudge, the issue isn’t just whether there should or should not be hunting on town land. It was ultimately a concern over ensuring proper procedures and public input are being taken and the real possibility of opening the town to extensive legal liability. He learned about the signs from a hunter in town, who said he was prepared to consult a lawyer due to the issue.
And although Pilla went to the town administrator, Mudge says the green light should never have been given in the first place, seeing as a town administrator works under the direction and supervision of the selectboard.
“The signs say that we’re going to prosecute anyone who’s violating these laws,” Mudge said. “With all due respect to Jack, and I’m not saying that facetiously, he can’t post signs saying that the town is going to prosecute people without running that by the selectboard. The town administrator at the time, frankly, made a mistake that should have been raised with the selectboard and it wasn’t.”
Charlotte is not the only Chittenden County town in which committees are discussing how to balance the wide array of users on town-owned forests and land. The approach is, however, different.
The Citizen reported last week that the neighboring town of Hinesburg’s forest committee opted this year to close a large swath of the recreation trails in the Town Forest and the LaPlatte Headwaters Town Forest to all recreation except hunting from Oct. 25 to Dec. 14 in order to encourage the sport as a management tool to prevent over-browsing by deer.
Charlotte selectboard chair and liaison to the trails committee, Lee Krohn, did not comment on the situation or how the selectboard could chart a path forward. But in an email to Pilla following his resignation, both Krohn and Mudge expressed their dismay that Pilla had resigned from the town committee.
“Not happy you are resigning, Jack. You’ve done an admirable job on the trails committee,” Mudge wrote in an email to Pilla. “Sorry things got heated on the call, Jack. It is just that procedures were not followed correctly. I hope you will reconsider your resignation.”
Pilla, in his formal complaint, cited the town’s harassment policy as a violation and, in a separate email, requested that Mudge be removed from his selectboard seat. While his resignation remains as is for now, he did admit that he’s not sure how long he will be able to stay away from the trail work that he’s spent over two years dedicating his time to.
It remains unclear what the status of the posted signs are or how the selectboard will take the issue up. The selectboard and former town administrator have been drafting a new handbook for committees and commissions in town that they’re hoping will more clearly establish general rules of procedure for volunteers, public officers and boards.
But in this case, it may be too little, too late.
“I just don’t need this shit, selectboard members all over me when I am following procedure doing work on the trails,” Pilla wrote. “I’m a volunteer spending way too much time and energy to make a better place for people in this town and I don’t need to be yelled at by Lewis for following procedure.”

Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky
“We are looking at a severe cut to our existing programming,” said Adrienne Bush, executive director of the Homeless and Housing Coalition of Kentucky, which helps provide homes for about 60 households. “There are folks who without this program would be homeless. They most likely will be homeless again without rent support and case management.”
Overall, the changes announced Nov. 13 by the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) could put more than 2,000 Kentucky households at risk of becoming homeless again, according to an analysis by the Corporation for Supportive Housing, which is working with providers.
In Louisville, the changes could cause more than half the 1,900 people in what’s called “permanent supportive housing” to lose housing, according to the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless.
“This puts everything at risk,” said Katharine Dobbins, CEO of Wellspring, a Louisville nonprofit that specializes in finding homes for and supporting people with severe mental illness. “Many people we serve come from chronic homelessness. There’s a reason people are chronically homeless. They usually are pretty disabled.”
At stake is much of about $48 million that flows to Kentucky each year in HUD money, with the largest portion, $23 million, going to Louisville. Most of it is used  for permanent, supportive housing to help people find and stay in homes with services including counseling, mental health and addiction treatment, financial education and other help.
For more than a decade, HUD has prioritized such spending as the best way to combat homelessness, with about 90% going to permanent housing. But the new federal rules announced Nov. 13 cut to about 30% what states can spend on permanent housing.
‘Biden-era slush fund’
This month, the federal government announced a major shift in how it allocates funds, stressing that the majority of money now must go to short-term, “transitional” housing aimed at getting people into jobs and in charge of their own housing.
Generally, transitional housing is covered for about 24 months.
In a news release, HUD announced the new funding priorities as “monumental reforms” aimed at ending the “Biden-era slush fund.”
“We are stopping the Biden-era slush fund that fueled the homelessness crisis, shut out faith-based providers simply because of their values and incentivized never-ending government dependency,” HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in the news release. The new plan, Turner said, will carry out President Donald Trump’s mandate to “make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”

It also announced a new method to score applications for HUD money that considers public safety, self-sufficiency, enhanced treatment options and “cracks down on DEI, gender-ideology extremism, and the misuse and abuse of taxpayer dollars on illegal aliens.”
‘Cruelty and criminalization’
Advocates, including the  Washington D.C.-based National Low Income Housing Coalition, say the changes will simply worsen the nation’s struggle with homelessness.
The HUD changes “signal a fundamental shift in federal homeless policy away from effective, humane approaches and toward wasteful cruelty and criminalization,” it said in a news release.
In Kentucky, around 3,700 individuals with disabling conditions live in permanent, supportive housing, which advocates say has proven to be the best solution for preventing homelessness.
Catherine McGeeney. communications director, Louisville Coalition for the Homeless
“We know that permanent housing is the solution to homelessness,” said Catherine McGeeney, communications director for the Louisville Coalition for the Homeless, which coordinates HUD funding for the area. “It effectively ends homelessness.”
And the changes will affect a wide range of programs throughout Kentucky including housing help offered by domestic violence, veterans and mental health groups as well as agencies that directly serve the homeless, Bush said.
At Volunteers of America (VOA) in Louisville, staff are looking at how to best try to preserve funds for programs such as Unity House, that help families in its shelter with services meant to help them become independent and move to housing, said Tamara Reif, director of housing services. The nonprofit agency also provides case management for residents in permanent housing supported by Louisville city government.
“Case management is what keeps folks housed,” Reif said. “The more services you provide to people, the more they are going to stay housed and not return to homelessness.”
The new federal rules allow case management but now require at least 40 hours a week for services including counseling, job training and other aid. Work hours may be included in the 40-hour requirement.
VOA typically provides about six hours  to 10 hours a week of case management.
More than 50% of clients VOA now serves already have jobs and most of the rest are seeking employment, Reif said.
‘Bad for all of us’
In Kentucky, advocates agree self-sufficiency is an important objective, stressed in services offered to the homeless. But many clients with severe mental illness, addiction and other disabilities simply can’t go through a short-term “transition” program and be expected to survive independently, they said.
“It will be bad for all of us, even if you’re not currently experiencing homelessness,” Bush said. “If you’re frustrated with the number of people on the streets or camping, it’s just going to cause that number of people to grow.”
McGeeney said she understands the frequent complaints by some about the growing number of homeless encampments and people on the streets.
That’s because the number of people losing housing is growing faster than local housing services can accommodate, she said.
In 2025, about 5,800 people in Kentucky were considered homeless through an annual “point in time” count, a number that has increased every year since 2022, Bush said.
Last year, programs in Louisville placed 1,600 people into housing even as another 3,300 people became homeless, McGeeney said.
“We know the programs we are running are very effective,” McGeeney said. “Ninety percent of the people we put into permanent housing stay housed. We just don’t receive enough funding for those programs.”
Now agencies are likely to receive less money unless they can reorganize or repurpose services to align with the new HUD requirements.
But the changes — combined with unusually short deadlines — have left agencies scrambling to decide how to provide as much help as possible to the homeless.
In past years, HUD typically announced funding criteria for the following year by late summer, McGeeney said. And typically, the federal government would simply renew most existing programs that met standards.
This year, the notice for applicants was issued Nov. 13 with a deadline for applications of Jan. 14 to apply for HUD funds with dramatically different rules. And new awards of funding won’t be announced until early May, though some federal grants will expire before May 1.
‘Scramble’ to apply
“It’s so quick to shift everything over,” said Ra’Shann Martin, executive director of the St. John Center in Louisville.
St. John provides a day center for homeless people as well as providing housing for 200 formerly homeless people, Martin said.
“Housing is the long-term solution we want for everybody,” she said. “Supportive housing is the intervention that has been the most effective at helping people succeed.”
But getting next year’s application together while trying to preserve resources for the 200 people it helps house has been a “scramble,” she said.
Katharine Dobbins, CEO of Wellspring
“It’s very possible to adapt but just adapting in such a short timeline with so many vulnerable people in our care contributes to the scramble.”
The expiration of some grants with no guarantee of renewal is another concern, said Dobbins, with Wellspring.
Her agency currently provides housing for 24 women with mental health and addiction issues in a program called Journey. Most have experienced significant trauma including sexual abuse and trafficking.
The HUD grant that provides money to pay rent and provide support services to those women expires Jan. 31. If it’s renewed, funds wouldn’t resume until after May 1, she said,
“I’m extremely concerned about this population of women,” Dobbins said. “When the grant ends, their rent ends because there’s no money coming through to pay their rent. Most need support services and we can’t pay staff to provide support. Talk about a cliff.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/St.-john-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 17:58:27.049744

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor leaders denounced President Donald Trump and Republicans’ recent attacks on Minnesota’s Somali-American community at the State Capitol on Monday.
“We do not blame the lawlessness of an individual on a whole community,” said Omar, referring to a slew of Minnesota human services fraud cases, many of which involved Somali-Americans charged with bilking hundreds of thousands of dollars from government programs meant to feed hungry children, assist young people with autism and help people find housing.
Trump posted on Truth Social Friday that he’s ending Temporary Protected Status for Somalis in Minnesota specifically, alleging without evidence that “Somali gangs are terrorizing the people of that great State.”
(The legality of removing TPS from residents of a specific state, like Minnesota, is dubious, as noted by Omar.)
Temporary Protected Status for Somalia is currently already scheduled to end in March. Addressing the 400 or so Somalis in Minnesota protected under TPS, Omar said, “We will make sure we do everything that we can to help make sure that your status is adjusted” before then.
Revoking the status would affect 0.5% of Somali Minnesotans. There are roughly 80,000 Somali Minnesotans; an estimated 41,748 residents were born in Somalia as of 2024. Most Somali Minnesotans were either born here or are naturalized citizens. Many came to Minnesota as refugees from an ongoing civil war starting in the 1990s, which the United States has been heavily involved in.
Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said in Minnesota on Sunday that her office will evaluate whether to revoke protections for Somali nationals, which would require giving 60 days’ notice, the New York Times reported.
Trump’s post came two days after a City Journal article alleging that the ill-gotten gains from human services fraud are being funneled into the Al-Shabaab terror network in Somalia.
“We broke the Somali fraud story and called on President Trump to revoke the Temporary Protected Status for all Somalis. Now, the President has delivered,” wrote Rufo in an X post. A Fox9 article in 2018 also made the assertion that fraud cash was going to Al-Shabaab.
Federal prosecutors have said that dollars meant to feed children instead went to buying luxury vehicles, real estate in Minnesota, Ohio, Kentucky, Kenya and Turkey, and to fund international travel.
The U.S. Attorney, which is responsible for federal terrorism charges, has not charged any defendants with financing terrorism.
In another Monday press conference, Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-MN, a Muslim civil rights group, said the broader social media attacks following the article were part of a larger coordinated attempt to spread fear of Muslims by what he called “Israel-first politicians.”
“Obviously it’s normal for people to share things within days, but within minutes means that somehow there is an organized campaign to push this information out and to create it to be viral,” Hussein said.
Noem also announced in an official news release on Monday it will remove Temporary Protected Status from Myanmar effective January 26, citing improvements to the situation in the country.
John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters, “The (U.S.) factual analysis is fantastical. Contrary to its content, there have been no improvements in governance or stability.”

(Photo by Troy R. Bennett/ Maine Morning Star)U.S. Sen. Susan Collins has signed a referendum effort seeking to bar transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams and from using girls’ bathrooms and locker rooms. 
The Republican’s signature was shared on social media Sunday by someone involved with the campaign and reshared by the Maine Republican Party. 
A spokesperson for the senator confirmed on Monday that she had signed the petition.
“Senator Collins supports Title IX, which provides opportunities for girls and women to compete in sports that they did not have prior to the passage of this landmark law,” wrote Blake Kernan in an emailed statement. “That federal law makes distinctions on the basis of sex, not on the basis of gender identity, thus promoting fair competition.” 
Kernan continued, “Reflecting this view of the federal law, she signed the petition, but will not be involved in the state referendum campaign because, as a federal official, she does not advocate on state ballot issues.”
Collins took a similar position earlier this year, when several agencies in the Trump administration launched probes into Maine’s inclusive transgender student policies and threatened the state with the loss of federal funding. 
At the time, Collins wrote on social media that while she would “continue to advocate strongly for federal funding for Maine, I disagree with the state’s position and instead support the original intent behind Title IX.” 
“People who are transgender deserve to be treated with respect and dignity,” she wrote. “But that does not change the fact that Title IX mandated equal access to athletic resources and facilities on the basis of sex — not on the basis of gender identity.”
Title IX, the federal anti discrimination law, has been consistently interpreted by the Trump administration to enforce action against trans people, although the law itself does not mention them, and has been interpreted by courts to protect gender identity. 
Petition effort
The petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022. 
If it passes, the proposal would require schools to separate athletic teams, locker rooms, and bathrooms strictly by “biological sex,” forcing trans students to use facilities corresponding to their sex assigned at birth. It would also mandate the establishment of coed teams. 
The petition is the latest effort by a conservative group to roll back Maine’s inclusive policies, which for two decades have guaranteed transgender students the right to participate on teams and use facilities aligned with their gender identity under the Maine Human Rights Act.
The proposal resembles recent rules adopted by several school boards that defy state anti-discrimination laws. Last week, the Maine Human Rights Commission sued five districts that recently passed anti-trans policies. 
Kit Thompson Crossman, executive director of the quasi-independent state agency, told Maine Morning Star that a lawsuit is the fastest, most transparent way to ensure that schools do not impose rules that discriminate against students based on gender identity.

The private university announced in a news release last week it has committed $10,000 to the Grinnell Food Coalition, an initiative within the Claude W. and Dolly Ahrens Foundation that works to address food needs. Insurance company Grinnell Mutual and the Campbell Fund, a trust operated by the city, also donated $10,000 each, according to the release.
Jennifer Cogley, director of programs for the foundation, said Monday the coalition has reached its $50,000 fundraising goal.

“Across Poweshiek County, food pantries and meal programs are already feeling increased demand, and they are working tirelessly to support families who are struggling,” Cogley said in the release. “The Grinnell Food Coalition is committed to uplifting these organizations. We believe it’s essential to work alongside the groups who have their boots on the ground every day, ensuring our neighbors have access to the food they need.”
While benefits for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are being issued once again after the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the release stated “many households and local food providers continue to face significant strain as demand for food assistance rises.”
With the funding, the food coalition will distribute “up to” 3,000 $10 vouchers for groceries to those in need across Poweshiek County, according to the release, and bolster area food pantries and other food programs that have seen increased demand. Organizations are also encouraged to apply for emergency food grants through the coalition, as “typical funding limits” will not be applied.
Barb Baker, director of advertising and community relations at Grinnell Mutual, said in the release the donations will hopefully “serve as a springboard for support” for residents and organizations working to help them.
“Grinnell College is glad to be part of a community that pulls together in times of need. We’ve seen this community accomplish amazing things when working together, and we’re proud to collaborate with our partners at Grinnell Mutual to support this emergency response,”  said Monica Chavez-Silva, Grinnell College vice president for community engagement and strategic planning, in the release.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)State employees filed a formal complaint on Monday accusing the Mills administration of not bargaining in good faith in ongoing negotiations for labor contracts that expired at the end of June. 
The state employees’ union, which represents about 10,000 workers across four bargaining units, filed the complaint with the Maine Labor Relations Board Monday, according to a news release.
In the complaint, the Maine Service Employees Association, Local 1989 of the Service Employees International Union (MSEA-SEIU Local 1989) specifically alleges Gov. Janet Mills’ administration violated state labor laws related to prematurely declaring impasse, regressive bargaining, cancelling bargaining sessions following the premature declaration of impasse, and otherwise engaging in behavior designed to frustrate the collective bargaining process.
After almost a year of attempted negotiations, the Mills administration declared an impasse last month. The union alleges this was done without discussing a third of the proposals put forward by state workers. Now, the union is asking the labor board to order that the declaration of impasse be withdrawn. 
A spokesperson for the Mills administration told Maine Morning Star that the state was surprised by the filing because both parties were supposed to meet Tuesday to discuss the union’s complaint. The state said it disputes each allegation and anticipates filing its response to the complaint by Dec. 15.
“The Administration will continue to negotiate with MSEA and defend itself against these unfortunate claims before the labor relations board,” the spokesperson said
Mark Brunton, president of MSEA-SEIU Local 1989, said the union has for years pleaded with the administration to address widespread recruitment and retention issues among state employees due to uncompetitive wages. 
Brunton said the administration should be held to account “for its intransigence not only at the bargaining table but also for the understaffing problem and the vacancies resulting from the persistent state employee pay gap,” according to the statement. 
Vacant positions not only affect the economy, but can also create “impossible” workloads and, in some cases, dangerous working conditions, he added.
State employees experience a 14% pay gap compared to their private sector counterparts, according to the State of Maine Market Pay Report the Mills administration conducted in September 2024. That is a slight improvement from the 2020 report that showed state employees had a 15% pay gap. 
According to the Mills administration spokesperson, base wages for state employees have increased by 24%, on average, since 2019 when Mills took office. State workers have also received merit increases, longevity pay for staying in their positions longer than five years and other benefits financial or otherwise.
The complaint filed Monday isn’t the first time state employees have gone to those measures. Brunton said they have filed seven such complaints against the administration in the last five years.
“This administration has gone to great lengths, including violating the basic foundations of labor law,” Brunton said.

Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, faces a complaint related to how he spent campaign contributions at, among other places, a barber shop, a cigar shop and a high-end Denver hotel. There is also a donation to the Israeli rugby team Maccabi Tel-Aviv Football Club.
The complaint was filed in August by Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican. Weinberg had an opportunity to respond to the complaint and address the allegations. The submitted documents are not publicly available.
“Given their responses to the Complaint, Respondents did not substantially comply with Colorado campaign finance law,” the investigation notice, dated Nov. 19, says.

The enforcement team in the Elections Division has 30 days to either dismiss the complaint or file it with a hearing officer.
Weinberg told Newsline he thinks the donation to the rugby team triggered the complaint. He said he sponsored the team by purchasing the players’ jerseys when they competed in a 2024 tournament in Glendale. The jerseys featured the phrase “Weinberg for Loveland” and served as advertisement for his campaign. Weinberg is Jewish and has family ties in Israel. He said the opportunity to meet the rugby players at the tournament was a “humbling experience.”
“Everybody has the right to look into this stuff. But I’m not going to lawyer up. I’m fully transparent — I know that everything I’ve done campaign-wise is not in violation,” he said.
Weinberg has served in the House of Representatives since 2022, when he was appointed to replace Hugh McKean after his death. Last week, he announced his reelection campaign for next year.

Michelle Lujan Grisham's remarks on crime during her State of the State speech on Jan. 21, 2025. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Sam Bregman, the Bernalillo County district attorney seeking the Democratic nomination for New Mexico governor, on Friday announced proposals to “fix” the state Legislature by seeking term limits for lawmakers, extending the length of legislative sessions, paying lawmakers and changing the system by which the state doles out funding for big-budget infrastructure projects.
In a statement, Bregman said the changes will ensure the state government “works for the people, not the politicians.”
His campaign’s plan calls for working with state lawmakers to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would create term limits for state representatives and senators; making legislative sessions an annual 90-day affair; creating salaries for state legislators in line with New Mexico’s median salary; and requiring all new capital outlay projects to be included in the state budget and subject to public debate.
Bregman in a statement said the Legislature is “dominated by long-serving incumbents” and hopes that term limits will attract new candidates for office.
Extending the length of legislative sessions, which currently alternate between 30 and 60 days, would give policymakers adequate time to effectively govern, he said. In the 2025 regular legislative session, leaders from the nonprofit Common Cause New Mexico pushed to “modernize” the Legislature, noting that its sessions are among the shortest in the U.S. The short sessions routinely lead to debates that are “curtailed and cut short,” the group said at the time.
Bregman’s campaign said that providing salaries for New Mexico’s lawmakers, who are the only ones in the nation not to earn compensation for that work, would lower barriers to holding elected office.
And introducing more public debate to the capital outlay request process would cut down on the potential for “political favors” to be the deciding factor in which costly public infrastructure projects advance.
“For far too long, New Mexico has been last in all the good things and first in all the bad things,” Bregman said in a statement. “With the right leadership, New Mexico can finally move from the bottom of the rankings to the top, where we belong.”
If elected, any road toward implementing Bregman’s envisioned changes would have to go through the state’s 100-plus lawmakers. It’s unclear whether there’s much appetite among those office-holders for provisions such as term limits.
“If you expect me to be a full-time legislator and you’re going to pay me enough to do that … that’s a lot of money,” Senate Minority Floor Leader William Sharer (R-Farmington) told Source NM. Any salary from the state would likely be less than he earns as a business owner and traveling to Santa Fe for three months each year could make it impractical to continue running his business, he said.
Sharer, who first won election in 2000, said he was in favor of term limits early in his tenure. In the subsequent decades, though, he said he’s learned that legislative staffers “know everything” and is concerned that term limits would “in essence, turn the staff into the real governing body.”
State House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) and Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) did not respond to requests for comment.
Bregman will face former U.S. Interior Secretary and Congresswoman Deb Haaland and former Las Cruces Mayor Ken Miyagishima in the June primary election.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) A California union and a group of farm workers from around the country are suing to stop new, lower-wage federal guidelines that save money for farmers but cut pay for temporary foreign agriculture workers — hurting local laborers as a result, the suit alleges. 
In a lawsuit filed Friday in federal court, the United Farm Workers and 18 individual workers sued the U.S. Department of Labor over the October guidelines for laborers who are in the United States under temporary, H-2A visas. The new guidelines set lower wages — differentiating them by state — including pay cuts to account for the value of free housing provided by law to foreign workers. 
“Farm workers, and the rural communities across America they sustain, need and deserve fair wages and job security, not a race to the bottom with an endless supply of cheap foreign labor,” Teresa Romero, president of the United Farm Workers, said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. 
Trump allows more foreign ag workers, eases off ICE raids on farms

The new Trump administration rules are “drastically cutting the minimum wage that U.S. employers must pay foreign farmworkers, all while costs and wages in other sectors have sharply increased,” the lawsuit states, adding that the lower pay for foreign workers will also force cuts for American workers. The lawsuit asks a federal judge in California to halt implementation of the guidelines and recalculate wages. 
The lawsuit also objects to first-time pay differentials based on the value of employer-provided housing. It alleges violations of laws requiring that foreign visas not affect wages of U.S. workers with similar jobs. 
The cuts “will severely impact farmworkers — some of the most vulnerable members of our society and many of whom already live in poverty,” according to the lawsuit. 
One worker, not identified by name, works in Missouri with an H-2A foreign worker visa was formerly paid $17.83 an hour and will suffer a $4.08 pay cut, leaving him unable to afford food and essential protective clothing for his job helping with squash, eggplant and other vegetables, according to the lawsuit. 
One worker, Irene Mendoza, a U.S. citizen, said in the lawsuit that her wages could be cut by $3.22 an hour, to $13.78, because of the guidelines, even though she doesn’t need a foreign worker visa, forcing her to get a second job to pay for food, housing and transportation between jobs in some of the states where she works. Mendoza said in the lawsuit that she works picking and packing green beans and potatoes in Michigan, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin.
Midwest farm economies suffered while some Sun Belt states kept rolling in early 2025

The lower wage guidelines vary by state and are subject to state minimum wage laws that could make them higher in some states. In North Carolina, for instance, the new hourly wage is $11.09 for less-skilled workers, compared with $16.16 last year, and $12.27 for local workers who don’t need housing, according to a Cornell University analysis.
The Department of Labor referred a Stateline request for comment to the Department of Justice, which declined comment. 
Some farmers and experts have hailed the new guidelines as lifesavers that will stave off bankruptcy as costs rise and some prices for their farm goods stay low. 
Almost half the H-2A visas in the 2025 fiscal year were in a small group of states including Florida (60,000), Georgia (44,000), California (37,000), Washington state (36,000) and North Carolina (28,000). The government expects an additional 119,000 visas to be issued under the new rule, on top of the nearly 420,000 a year issued in recent years. 
Public comments on the rule are open until Dec. 1.

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Washington state is fining health insurance giant Regence Blue Shield over half a million dollars for disparities between its mental health and medical coverage.
For years, Regence failed to provide the state with detailed documentation showing its behavioral health offerings are comparable to medical or surgical coverage, in violation of state and federal law. The data the company did provide showed major differences between the two types of care, including for in-network reimbursement rates, among other areas. 
“Throughout this process, Regence’s staff appeared to willfully misinterpret our questions, dismiss our concerns and generally disregard their own responsibilities to their members’ well-being,” state Insurance Commissioner Patty Kuderer said in a statement.
Regence argued parity wasn’t an issue, but didn’t provide documentation to prove that, according to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner.
“The data Regence provided, or in some cases failed to provide, demonstrates a lack of accountability for following this nation’s insurance laws,” Kuderer said.
A Regence spokesperson said the company has “implemented state and federal requirements for behavioral health access in good faith, made necessary updates and will continue prioritizing compliance while supporting future rulemaking for clear, consistent standards.”
“Everyone should have access to high-quality behavioral health care,” spokesperson Ashley Bach said in an email. “We value our collaborative relationship with the Office of the Insurance Commissioner and worked diligently to provide comprehensive responses to the OIC’s inquiries.”
Under an order signed Friday and announced Monday, the insurer will pay the state $550,000. It’s the second major fine Kuderer’s office has issued over mental health coverage parity issues since she took office this year.
The money will go to Washington’s general fund, the main source of funding for state operations. Since 2001, the insurance commissioner’s office has sent over $44 million from fines like this back to state coffers.
Persistent parity problems
State and federal law require insurers to cover behavioral health treatment similar to physical health care. For example, an insurer can’t charge different co-pays for mental health treatment and physical health. And if there’s no limit on outpatient physical health care visits, there also can’t be a limit for mental health care.
Despite mental health parity laws, mental health coverage still often doesn’t stack up. 
A nationwide study last year found patients went out of network to see a behavioral health specialist 3.5 times more often than they did for physical health clinicians. For some types of care, the disparity was even greater. Going to out-of-network providers generally results in higher out-of-pocket costs.
And for those who stay in their insurers’ network, reimbursement rates were higher for physical health office visits than mental health appointments, the study found.
This year, Washington state legislators passed a bipartisan law aimed at bridging this divide. 
The new law, which takes effect in 2027, seeks to make clear that mental health and drug treatment are “medically necessary” care that insurance companies are required to cover. Insurers argued it would drive up premiums. 
Over the summer, Kuderer’s office similarly levied a $550,000 fine against Premera Blue Cross for not following mental health parity laws. The company’s online provider directory also didn’t comply with state law.
The insurance commissioner’s office has been scrutinizing mental health care parity among Washington insurers with the help of federal grants.
In 2023, the agency found similar violations at UnitedHealthcare, resulting in a $500,000 penalty.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration this year has paused new rules issued by former President Joe Biden that looked to strengthen mental health protections and hold insurance companies accountable for denying such coverage.
This is notable because many Washingtonians are subject to federal mental health parity laws, instead of the state’s. That includes those on Medicaid and workers on so-called “self-funded” plans whose employers directly pay for medical benefits, instead of through premiums to an insurance company.
This isn’t the first time the state has dinged Regence this year. 
Last month, Kuderer’s office fined the company $100,000 for denying over 950 claims for treatment due to a lack of prior authorization between June 2020 and May 2022. The care included physical, occupational, speech and hearing therapies.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/patty-kuderer-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 17:58:27.049744

(Photo by Jonathan Shorman/Stateline)A coalition of Democratic attorneys general is withdrawing one of their lawsuits filed in Rhode Island’s federal court after the Trump administration agreed to drop a rule that would have restricted aid for undocumented victims of sexual assault and domestic violence.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and a coalition of AGs from 19 other states on Monday submitted their motion to dismiss their complaint against the U.S. Department of Justice that sought to block the new “Legal Services Condition” that would have applied to grant programs under the Violence Against Women Act and  the Victims of Crime Act.
The lawsuit filed in Providence’s federal courthouse Oct. 1 argued the administration violated the U.S. Constitution’s Spending Clause, along with the Administrative Procedure Act, when creating the conditions barring nonprofits from administering legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status in this country.

States were notified of the rules on Aug. 18 via what the complaint called “surprise notices” informing them they could no longer provide legal services to undocumented immigrants with funding allotted to them through the federal grants.
Attorneys general argued that the restrictions would have strained victim services programs by forcing states to screen immigration status. The coalition also warned legal residents and U.S. citizens could also be denied help.
“With this agreement, the Trump Administration is effectively surrendering, as well they should, for attempting to withhold critical funding for victims of sexual and domestic violence,” Neronha said in a statement. “When a victim seeks help, the first question can never and will never be concerning their immigration status.”
But a Department of Justice Spokesperson in a statement still maintained that any grants funded by the agency cannot be used to provide services to undocumented migrants “unless otherwise required by federal law.”
“The Department of Justice will continue to ensure taxpayer dollars are used responsibly and for services that directly benefit Americans and lawful residents to prevent American taxpayers from being treated like second-class citizens,” the spokesperson said.
A separate suit against the DOJ and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi to stop withholding Victims of Crime Act funding to states whose officials refuse to comply with federal immigration enforcement remains ongoing in Rhode Island federal court.
But even as that lawsuit plays out, the DOJ has already posted its state-by-state allocations of the congressionally appropriated Victims of Crime Act — without any strings attached. Rhode Island will receive over $4.8 million for federal fiscal 2025. In federal fiscal 2024, the state received $3.3 million.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The legal wrangling in Utah’s ongoing redistricting saga isn’t over. 
In a flurry of more court filings last week, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson was again tasked with sorting through more issues with Utah’s congressional boundaries after Utah’s top election officials raised some technical issues with the new map. 
Split homes and other boundary issues in Sandy, Cottonwood Heights, Alpine, Highland, Orem, Huntsville and Summit County led the lieutenant governor’s office to ask the court for clarifications to Utah’s new map ahead of implementing it for the 2026 elections. 
Meanwhile, attorneys for the Utah Legislature — which continues to protest the state’s court-ordered redistricting process as a violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches — argued the lieutenant governor’s request for boundary clarifications “amplifies how these proceedings have transgressed the Utah and U.S. Constitutions,” they wrote in court filings. 
“Plaintiffs’ counsel can instruct the Lieutenant Governor how to resolve those issues. But in doing so, the constitutional problem — the denial of the Legislature’s constitutional authority to redistrict — only becomes more obvious,” legislative attorneys wrote.

Further, lawmakers’ attorneys argued the boundary issues “further reveal that there was no good reason” for the judge to choose the plaintiffs’ map over the Legislature’s map, arguing that the boundary issues resulted in a similar number of county and city splits as lawmakers’ preferred boundaries. 
Therefore, they argued the “only map approved in accordance with constitutional requirements” is the Legislature’s 2021 congressional map, and that Gibson should throw out the plaintiffs’ map, which she picked on Nov. 10. 
Months ago, Gibson issued a ruling voiding the 2021 map as the result of an unconstitutional process, ruling the Utah Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority when it undid a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative known as Proposition 4, which implemented an independent redistricting process. In that August ruling, Gibson restored Proposition 4 as Utah law, while ordering a “remedial” court process to enact a lawful map ahead of the 2026 elections. 
In that court-ordered process, Gibson ultimately picked a map submitted by the plaintiffs instead of the Legislature’s preferred map — ruling that lawmakers’ map, known as map C, didn’t adhere to Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria to the “greatest extent practicable.” The map she picked creates a compact congressional district in northern Salt Lake County — resulting in one Democratic-leaning district and three safe Republican districts. 
In response to the Legislature’s complaints against the new map, attorneys for the plaintiffs in the case argued that the boundary issues identified by the lieutenant governor — which were largely the result of annexations that took place after the 2020 census — were not out of the ordinary in redistricting and that the Legislature’s attorneys didn’t follow Utah’s rules of civil procedure when requesting the stay. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

“Ten days after this Court’s ruling — ten days in which an entire emergency appellate process could have commenced and completed — Legislative Defendants now suggest in three paragraphs at the end of an unrelated 10-page filing that the Court should stay its orders in this case and permit the 2021 congressional map to govern the 2026 election,” the plaintiffs’ attorneys wrote. 
“They seize on minor technical questions raised by the Lieutenant Governor — questions that arise with every redistricting map, are more prevalent in Map C, and exist in the 2021 congressional map — as the hook to belatedly raise this request,” they added, arguing it should be rejected. 
After hearing recommendations from both the lieutenant governor and the plaintiffs to remedy the boundary issues, Gibson on Friday issued an order implementing a minor fix to move a single home in Sandy from District 1 to District 4 to prevent a one-home precinct, which would have resulted in voter privacy issues. 
As for the boundary issues, Gibson deferred to the lieutenant governor’s discretion to make boundary clarifications when there is uncertainty. 
“The Court notes that Plaintiffs have suggested an approach to making determinations with respect to those issues and the Lieutenant Governor may take those suggestions into consideration when making determinations for implementation,” the judge wrote. “Likewise, as the Lieutenant Governor notes, the Utah Code grants discretion in making determinations should questions subsequently arise.”
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

As for the Legislature’s complaints regarding the number of city splits, the judge noted that attorneys for both the plaintiffs and the Legislature agreed to use 2020 census files in the court’s “remedial” map-drawing proceedings. 
“For that reason, any municipal annexations that took place after the Census Bureau provided the 2020 municipal file did not factor into any analysis (by the parties, any experts or the Court) assessing the map proposals,” Gibson wrote. “Notably, no party raised any issues regarding any possible discrepancies between the 2020 municipal boundaries and current municipal boundaries.” 
Gibson issued her order last week while acknowledging that time is of the essence, with state election officials needing to implement the map with enough time for county clerks to finalize their precincts ahead of candidate filing opening in January.
The judge said she would explain her legal reasoning — as well as address the Legislature’s attorneys request for a stay — at a later date. 
“The Court will endeavor to issue that analysis as soon as possible,” Gibson wrote.

It’s the first major state facility set to be permanently relocated as a result of damage sustained in the devastating flooding of 2023.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s flood-prone hub for vehicle maintenance is getting a new home — on higher ground.","BERLIN — David Thurber was helping clean up the Vermont Agency of Transportation’s Central Garage in Berlin, days after flooding inundated the facility in July 2023, when he came across a drawer full of photos. The images gave him pause, he recalled in a recent interview. They showed the same location, decades prior, also flooded over.
It was a timely reminder, Thurber said, of something he and other agency leaders had long known to be true: The Central Garage, which has sat on the same site along U.S. Route 302 for the past seven decades, was long overdue to be relocated.
“It was like, no, we can’t keep doing this every five, or even 10, years,” said Thurber, who oversees the facility’s operations. “It would just be crazy.”

The Central Garage is the state’s nexus for outfitting and maintaining its snowplows, road graders, pickup trucks and almost “anything with a tire,” as Joe Flynn, the state secretary of transportation, put it. When the state gets a new plow, for instance, it often comes here first, where workers install key electronics and other finishing touches before sending it out to a regional hub in other parts of the state.
But like so many other pieces of state and local infrastructure in Vermont, the Berlin garage was built on land that’s highly susceptible to flooding. The facility is surrounded by water on two sides: The Stevens Branch of the Winooski River runs along its western edge, while the Pond Brook traces its southern boundary.
In July 2023, both those waterways leapt over their banks and flooded much of the facility with several feet of water, washing away tools, damaging vehicles, leaving offices full of mud and rendering many of the facility’s vehicle bays unusable.
As the old photos Thurber found show, however, that was far from a one-off. Todd Law, the transportation agency’s fleet division director, said his father, who also worked for the agency, remembered flooding at the Central Garage in the 1970s. The site has flooded more than half a dozen times since Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, Seven Days reported last year.
The damage in 2023, however, was “the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Flynn said in a recent interview, sitting in one of the facility’s few office spaces that wasn’t damaged in 2023.
Now, the transportation agency is in the early stages of building a new, more modern facility on an empty plot of land just over a mile away, still in the town of Berlin. The new garage — which would be far less prone to flooding — is slated to cost around $25 million, an amount the state hopes will be covered, at least in part, with recovery funding provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
The project is notable because it is the first major state facility set to be permanently relocated as a result of damage from the flooding in July 2023, according to Doug Farnham, Vermont’s chief recovery officer.
Plans also call for the existing garage facility to be torn down and its land to be turned into open space to help mitigate future flooding. The state has recently been working out the details of that process with the town of Berlin, where some local officials have raised concerns with the state’s plans for the new garage over the past year.

“It’s not going to alleviate all the flooding — but it can help,” Flynn said of the area around the current site. “It just makes sense.”
‘Just isn’t what it used to be’
The agency’s Central Garage is, in fact, a hodgepodge of different garages, sheds and small office buildings, with a large parking lot in between. Five structures on the site took significant damage in July 2023. One, a small shed, was essentially destroyed.
Flynn showed a reporter a photo he took of a dumpster flowing down Route 302 on the back of rushing floodwaters. The dumpster crashed through part of the facility’s fence, toppling it. “That’s how much force was behind it,” he said of the water.
On a given day, there are eight to 10 vehicles at the garage getting annual preventative maintenance, and four or five more in for finishing touches, such as getting the agency’s “VTrans” decals tacked on, according to Law. At times, there can be two dozen or more vehicle chassis parked in the lot outside waiting to be outfitted with new parts. 

On a recent morning, crews were doing routine maintenance ahead of the first major snowfall of the season. One snowplow was opened up to get new turbochargers installed; another was lifted into the air while a worker stood underneath, filling its differential fluid. A cruiser for the Department of Motor Vehicles police force was getting its winter tires put on.
After the July 2023 flooding, crews worked for about a month to get the Central Garage back to a state where it could service vehicles. Flynn said he and other agency leaders were impressed by how quickly the facility’s staff, along with other state workers, got it up and running again.
But there was a significant loss: the facility’s largest vehicle maintenance building took too much damage, largely to its electrical systems, for repairs to be cost efficient. The building still sits mostly empty today, except for some equipment that’s in storage.
As a result, the transportation agency has shifted much of its vehicle maintenance into an adjacent building that was previously used for storage, after putting in new ventilation and pumping systems there. That building sits at a higher elevation, so it saw almost no flooding in 2023 beyond some water lapping at its edges. 
A smaller building at the rear of the complex — just a stone’s throw from the Stevens Branch — has long housed several maintenance bays, too. It was also inundated with water in July 2023. But its key mechanical systems were elevated after a flood in a previous year, Thurber said, which made it easier to get the building back into service. 
Overall, the 2023 flood damage left fewer vehicle bays available for the Central Garage’s staff to work on snowplows and other trucks each day. That’s had a noticeable impact on its operations over the years since, said Andrew Casavant, the transportation agency’s Central Garage regional supervisor.
In a larger building, like the one that’s been unusable since 2023, parts could be easily swapped between two different vehicles that were being worked on at the same time, he said. That building also had a dedicated parts shop for easy access. Now, parts frequently have to be ferried across the facility’s parking lot, he said, which can be time consuming — and potentially dangerous when it’s raining or snowing outside. 
Having less space also means the facility’s staff are, sometimes, tripping over one another while working on vehicles, Casavant said. The crew have still been able to get done what they need to in recent years in the leadup to the winter, he said, but preparations have been inching closer to the start of the season than he’d like.

“The job’s still getting done, but it’s just not in the time frame that we would like,” Casavant said. “I’ll be honest. Our output just isn’t what it used to be.”
‘We couldn’t stay where we are’
Plans for a replacement garage facility are already well underway. 
In the 2024 legislative session, state lawmakers sent the agency $2 million to purchase a roughly 23-acre parcel off nearby Paine Turnpike for the project. Plans are to build a 53,000 square foot structure with 22 maintenance bays split into two wings, with parts storage in between.
The transportation agency considered about a dozen other sites for the project, according to Law, of the fleet division, including on land the state already owned, such as the nearby Edward F. Knapp State Airport.
Officials chose the site they did partly because it is adjacent to an existing state facility, the Berlin Vermont State Police barracks, on a site that formerly housed the state Department of Libraries, Flynn said. The state had considered buying the land that’s now slated for the central garage facility to be used as the state police barracks in the past, so it was already on his and other officials’ radar, he added.
The site also has access to a local municipal water and sewer system, which was another plus, Flynn said. He called the location “kind of serendipitous.”

The state bought the land later in 2024 from Superior Development Ltd. That company is owned by Wayne Lamberton and Randal LaGue, according to business records available on the Vermont Secretary of State’s website. Lamberton and LaGue have done business with the state before — they built the large rest area just off Interstate 89’s Berlin exit in a partnership with former Gov. Peter Shumlin’s administration.
Lamberton is a close friend of now-Gov. Phil Scott’s and has ties to a construction business Scott previously owned a portion of. Both Lamberton, and Superior Development Ltd., have contributed to some of Scott’s past political campaigns, according to campaign finance records on the secretary of state’s website. 
For instance, the company donated $4,000 to Scott’s 2016 gubernatorial campaign and made in-kind contributions totaling $1,000 to Scott’s 2018 campaign, records show.
Law said in an email that the agency’s decision to buy the new parcel had nothing to do with Scott’s relationship with those developers, and was instead entirely due to the merits of the site. He also noted, in an interview, that the transportation agency wanted to build the new facility close to the current one to make it easy for its employees to stay in their jobs.
At the local level, however, it hasn’t been an entirely smooth ride for the state’s plans. 
Last year, according to reporting from the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, Flynn got a stiff reception to the plans from the Berlin Selectboard. That’s because the new garage would be built in the area Berlin wants to build a new, walkable town center, the paper reported, and some board members worried the garage project would be out-of-line with that vision.
But at a subsequent meeting, the board members softened their tone on the project and said they wouldn’t stand in the way of it, the Times Argus also reported.
Vince Conti, the Berlin town administrator, said last week that the town and the state have largely come to an understanding related to both the current and new garage sites. The plan is now to install a sidewalk along the new garage parcel, he said, paid for by the state as well as a federal grant the town already has access to.
Meanwhile, the town and state have drawn up an agreement saying the current garage site will be cleared for open space once the agency is able to relocate its operations, Conti said. He said the state will pay for soil cleanup work that needs to take place on the site from decades of use before that happens.
“I think there’s mixed feelings about it, probably both on the board and within the town as well,” Conti said. But he added the project was likely to advance, regardless.
Law said in an email he wasn’t aware of any outstanding points of disagreement between the town and state, and noted the town’s purview over the project was limited. 
Flynn said he and other state leaders hope that, by turning the Central Garage site into open space, they’ll be creating more “water storage” upstream of downtown Montpelier, which sits several miles west of the facility. He hopes that could help, even in a small way, reduce the impacts of future flooding that’s inevitable in the capital area.
To make that happen, the state is also relying on help from FEMA. The federal agency has a program to pay costs of relocating a structure when analysis determines that is more feasible than rebuilding on the original spot. Flynn hopes FEMA will pay as much as 80% of the project’s cost, though negotiations are still underway. 
Law, the fleet director, said he has been meeting with FEMA officials regularly and expects to know how much the federal government will contribute by mid-January. Those efforts come as the state is still reviewing estimates for how much FEMA will pay to help the state repair the 2023 damage to the complex of state offices in downtown Montpelier, according to Farnham, the state’s recovery officer.
The state hopes to break ground on the Central Garage project next year, with completion possible in 2028.
Law said even with details still to be worked out, he’s certain the state won’t be staying at its site on Route 302. He remembered standing with a group of state officials and surveying the post-storm damage in 2023.
“It became very clear, very quickly — for everybody that was down there — that we couldn’t stay where we are,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 21:31:26+00:00,CT Mirror,Revolution Wind work goes on as Trump administration misses deadline,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-revolution-wind-ruling-appeal/,The Trump administration has missed the deadline to appeal a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project.,"The Trump administration missed last week’s deadline to appeal a federal judge’s decision ordering work to resume on the Revolution Wind project, handing another victory to advocates and local officials who have fought to keep the project afloat.
Construction of the of the 704-megawatt wind farm — which is being staged from the State Pier in New London — was allowed to resume on Sept. 22 after U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the federal government lacked justification when it halted work on the project earlier this year.
The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issued the stop-work order, had 60 days to appeal the judge’s decision. That deadline passed on Friday, Nov. 21 with no action taken by the federal government. 
“The Trump administration is rightly choosing not to continue to defend the indefensible,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a statement Monday. “Trump’s erratic actions were the height of arbitrary and capricious government action, and their decision not to pursue this defense is further confirmation of that. This is a major win for Connecticut workers and Connecticut families.”
A BOEM spokesperson declined to comment Monday.
In response to a series of questions seeking clarity on whether the administration was dropping its opposition to Revolution Wind, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly provided a statement that included no mention of the project or the court ruling.
“In just a few months, President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and restored American energy dominance,” the statement read. “This means prioritizing the most effective and reliable tools to power our country, which includes following through on his promise to ‘Drill, Baby, Drill’ and unleash domestic oil, gas, and nuclear power — supporting thousands of good-paying energy jobs across the country.”
Revolution Wind was already 80% complete when the stop-work order was issued in August. All the foundations for the project’s massive turbines had been driven into the seafloor.
The Trump administration cited unspecified national security concerns as its rationale for halting the project. The project’s proponents said it had undergone extensive reviews during the years-long permitting process, which included approvals from the federal Department of Defense.
Revolution Wind’s developers, which include Danish energy company Ørsted, filed suit challenging the stop-work order in federal court in Washington, D.C.
Lamberth, the judge in the case, was appointed to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan. In remarks from the bench in September, Lamberth chided the the government for failing to provide evidence to support its order, which he called “the height of arbitrary and capricious action.”
“There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm,” Lamberth said, adding that the developers were required to meet strict deadlines to get the project up and running.
Since work resumed in September, the project has progressed to around 85% completion, according to Ørsted’s most recent quarterly earnings report. Construction is currently slated to finish in the second half of 2026.
A spokesperson for Revolution Wind declined to comment on the government’s decision not to appeal Lamberth’s ruling. 
A second lawsuit challenging the federal government’s action against Revolution Wind was filed in September by Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island, Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha. That case remains pending as of Monday.
The project employs nearly 1,200 workers across both states, according to the lawsuit, including more than 100 jobs at the State Pier in New London. The wind farm itself is located in federal waters off the coast of Block Island.
Both Connecticut and Rhode Island also signed agreements to purchase the power produced by Revolution Wind once it is online. Under the terms of its contract, Connecticut’s utilities will purchase up to 304 megawatts for $99 per megawatt-hour.
Separately this week, another federal judge in Washington, D.C. is considering whether the Trump administration erred in its decision to halt all approvals for future offshore wind projects, according to Reuters. Trump announced that order as part of a flurry of executive actions upon his return to office on Jan. 20.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

(Photo via Google Earth)Over the past five years, there have been at least 15 cases of Iowa nursing home workers being accused of taking photos or videos that violated residents’ right to privacy and dignity, an Iowa Capital Dispatch review of state records shows.
The most recent case involves a northern Iowa nursing home that was cited for failing to report an employee’s allegations that a caregiver streamed video of a partially undressed resident to the social-media platform Snapchat.
The Nora Springs Care Center, which is 10 miles east of Mason City, has been fined $500 for failing to report to the state inspections department an employee’s allegation of resident abuse.

According to state inspectors, a certified nursing assistant was working the evening shift on Sept. 6, 2025, when she went to the care center’s shower room to obtain a wheelchair. The CNA allegedly reported that after she knocked and opened the door to announce that she was entering the room, she saw another staffer in the room, kneeling down in front of a resident who had known cognitive issues.
The CNA allegedly reported she could see that a cell phone was propped up against the wall and was recording on the Snapchat app, a social media program that streams video but typically limits the viewability of the content to a brief period before it becomes inaccessible.

According to inspectors, the CNA alleged the worker who was kneeling in front of the resident appeared startled and quickly stood up. Upon fully entering the shower room, the CNA allegedly reported, she could see her own leg come into view on the video recording, and she could also see the resident’s leg on the phone screen.
She allegedly stated that after she grabbed the wheelchair, she turned back to leave the room, and her colleague was standing in the doorway with no cell phone in sight. At that point, the resident was sitting in a shower chair with a shirt and briefs on, but their pants were not fully on.
The CNA left the shower room and immediately reported the incident to the nurse on duty. The resident was interviewed by the care facility’s staff three days later and allegedly stated he had no concerns regarding improper treatment and had not witnessed any improper cellphone use.
According to inspectors, the facility conducted a “comprehensive investigation” that included interviews with the staffs and found “no evidence” to support the CNA’s allegations.
“To reinforce expectations and safeguard resident privacy, the facility has implemented robust staff re-education, increased supervision, and ongoing monitoring to ensure strict adherence to all cellphone-use and abuse-prevention policies,” state inspectors reported.
According to the inspectors, the facility’s administrator allegedly confirmed Nora Springs Care Center had not notified the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing of the incident as required.
Records show over 15 cases of media abuse
An Iowa Capital Dispatch review of state inspection records shows that since 2021, there have been at least 15 other instances of care facility workers taking photos or videos that resulted in the homes being cited for violating residents’ rights. In most of those cases, the photos or videos were shared with others via social media.
Among the cases:
Bishop Drumm Retirement Center, Johnston: In January 2024, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing cited this nursing home for four separate instances of social-media abuse.
In one instance, a male resident was photographed sitting in a wheelchair with a blue bonnet on his head with a caption underneath stating, “Like, why are you stealing my bonnet?”
In another instance, video was recorded of a resident sitting on a toilet with their pants around their ankles while an unidentified individual waved their stocking feet back and forth under the resident’s nose as the resident protested, saying, “Stop doing that, your feet stink.” A caption underneath the video read, “Gassed.”
In the third instance, a resident was photographed sitting on a toilet with their pants around their ankles with their shirt off and exposing one side of their breasts. A caption underneath the picture “was not able to be read,” inspectors reported.
In the fourth instance, inspectors reported that a video showed a resident of the home lying in bed with their eyes open and a blanket over them while another individual was “shaking their butt — twerking — in front of the resident’s face.”
The available records indicate each of the four residents was “exposed to social-media abuse by a member of staff,” but they don’t indicate how the photos or videos were shared, what social media platform was used or how many workers were involved.
No fines or penalties were imposed by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing as a result of the inspectors’ findings.
Good Samaritan Home, Algona: In November 2024, state officials cited this facility with failing to protect residents from personal degradation. The violation was tied to a video posted to social media of a CNA having a conversation with a resident sitting in her wheelchair in her room.
In the video, the worker was seen talking about being the resident’s friend, pulling the woman’s pants up and sitting on her lap. “You can clearly see and hear the resident in the video,” an employee who reported the matter allegedly told inspectors.

In addition, inspectors reported that a dietary aide indicated she had received “a couple of videos” and photos from a former colleague, one of which showed a resident’s feet with a caption stating, “This man is literally dying.” Another photo was of a catheter bag with the caption, “The color of a resident’s p—.”
The Iowa Department of Inspections Appeals and Licensing imposed a $500 fine for resident abuse and the personal degradation of residents, plus a $500 fine for failing to adequately report resident abuse to state regulators.
Good Samaritan Home, Ottumwa: In August 2023, this facility was cited for failing to maintain residents’ personal privacy. A certified nursing assistant at the home had allegedly reported that she personally witnessed a colleague using the social media platforms TikTok live and FaceTime while at work and then, without disconnecting, entering residents’ rooms to provide personal care while livestreaming.
The CNA allegedly reported that on one such occasion, she heard her colleague state a resident’s name.  The home’s assistant director of nursing told inspectors no formal disciplinary action was taken, but there were “verbal discussions” about personal phone use during work hours.
Altoona Nursing and Rehabilitation Center: In August 2022, the state cited this facility for resident abuse related to video of a resident’s shredded brief that was shared with at least one other staffer. The state inspection report gives no indication as to whether the resident was visible in the video, but indicates that when a licensed practical nurse was informed of the matter she “went to the staff member who took the video and escorted that staff member out of the facility.”
Parkview Manor, Wellman: In January 2024, state inspectors cited this facility for failing to treat residents with dignity by posting a picture of a resident on social media. The undated photo showed a resident laying in bed, with her right arm visible, and papers and clothes strewn on the floor. The photo displayed “facebook.com” at the top, inspectors reported.
A dietary aide told inspectors she’d heard that a housekeeper posted a picture of a resident on social media, adding that she had then been asked to help remove the photo from the social media site. Another worker told inspectors she had visited a social media site and had seen three photos of “a resident’s room, which was a mess.”
National study completed last month
Last month, Colorado’s Long-Term Care Ombudsman published a report that examined 100 incidents of privacy violations in 30 states that took place between March 2017 and April 2025.
The incidents involved caregivers taking unauthorized photos and videos of residents and posting them to various social media platforms. The report cited “many disturbing incidents” of photos and videos “showing naked residents in compromised positions in their beds or in their bathrooms with feces on them, or verbal/mental or physical abuse of residents with demeaning captions.”

The report indicates that of the 100 incidents that were examined by the Colorado ombudsman, six took place in Iowa. The report does not include the incidents referenced above that took place during the March 2017-April 2025 timeframe, although the incident at the Altoona home doesn’t appear to have involved any social media postings.
According to the ombudsman’s report, the homes with the most incidents of social-media abuse were Illinois, with nine; Michigan, with eight; and Minnesota, with seven.
Along with Iowa, the states of Ohio, Indiana, California, Kansas and Oklahoma each had six incidents detailed in the report.
The six Iowa incidents identified by the Colorado ombudsman are:
Karen Acres Center, Urbandale: Sometime in 2024, a worker recorded video of a female resident lying in bed, speaking random words, with her face visible in the video. The worker could be seen in the video, wearing a hoodie while rubbing his chin and rolling his eyes while the resident spoke in an incoherent manner.
The worker posted the video to Instagram with the words, “Everyone, say hi to (resident’s first name).” The resident’s daughter later told inspectors, “My mom has dementia for some time now. Why would he video her? Was he trying to embarrass her?”
The worker later explained his actions to investigators by saying he had been “chilling and talking” to the resident. “I videoed it and put it on my Instagram and let it out there,” alleging that he had seen others posting similar pictures and thought it was OK to do so. The home reported the matter to the state as required.
Clearview Home, Mount Ayr: In December 2022 or January 2023, a caregiver at the home recorded video of a male resident in bed tearing up his briefs. The worker later explained that she shot the video because she thought it was funny, and asserted that when she placed the phone in her pocket she accidentally uploaded the video to Snapchat.
An assistant administrator stated that initially management of the home dismissed the matter as “teenage drama” between the worker who shot the video and the worker who saw it on Snapchat, but months later, when another worker was alleged to have taken photos of a different resident, the investigation into the May 2023 incident was reopened and the employee admitted shooting the video. The home failed to report the matter to the state as required.
Accura Healthcare, Pleasantville: In March 2022, a CNA recorded video of herself reclining in a chair while a resident with dementia rubbed her feet. The video, uploaded to Snapchat, was titled “A real man.” The worker, who admitted the conduct, was suspended by the facility. The home failed to report the matter to the state as required.
Living Center West, Cedar Rapids: In November 2024, a worker uploaded to Snapchart video of a male resident holding an ice cream cone. The man, who had moderate cognitive impairment, appeared to be sitting in a wheelchair without his dentures in place, as a female asked, “Let me see your teeth.” The man then displayed a toothless smile and the female laughed. The home reported the matter to the state, but not in the required timeframe. The worker was fired.
Careage Hills Rehabilitation and Health Care, Cherokee: In February 2021, a CNA used Facebook to relay to others the details of a fatality in the home. (State inspection records describe the CNA’s communication as both a “post” to Facebook as well as a message sent using the Facebook’s Messenger app.)
The information shared by the CNA included the name of the resident who had died after falling out of a chair while being removed from the home’s whirlpool bath. The worker was counseled by the facility and given a verbal warning, according to inspectors.
Midlands Living Center, Council Bluffs: In September 2024, a nurse aide in training allegedly recorded video of a discussion between herself and a resident which she later uploaded to Snapchat. It showed the aide talking to a resident whose face and body were obscured so she could not be identified, but others later told inspectors they recognized the voice.
The resident could be heard asking for help with the nurse aide responding in a condescending and disrespectful tone, “I would be willing to help you, but you haven’t listened to me once this entire night. I can’t help you if you’re not going to listen to me.” The aide was fired. The home reported the matter to the state as required.
Social-media violations in other states
A total of 147 victims were identified as part of the Colorado Long-Term Care Ombudsman’s report. About 88% of the victims were reported to have some level of cognitive impairment.
While many state investigation reports didn’t reference the specific social media platform used by the caregivers, the most commonly named platform was Snapchat, followed by Facebook.
Among the incidents identified in states other than Iowa:
Colorado: A video showed a woman with severe cognitive impairment on the floor after falling off her bed while wearing only Depends. The caption on the video read: “How the f— did you end up here?”
Ohio: A video showed an African American woman with cerebral vascular disease seated on the toilet with feces running down her leg. A cartoon image of a nurse aide was placed over the woman’s face and upper torso. The caption on the video read: “Bruh, now I am pissed and ready to f-ing go.”










We have cardboard coffins.


– Oregon nursing home workers to a resident


Oregon: After a resident with dementia repeatedly expressed their desire to make funeral arrangements for an already-deceased relative, two CNAs recorded video of themselves pretending to be funeral home staff and offering the resident funeral-plan options. While laughing, they made comments such as, “We have cardboard coffins.”
Oklahoma: Two CNAs recorded video of themselves taunting a woman with dementia as they held down her hands and inserted their fingers, wet with saliva, into the woman’s ears.  The Snapchat video was shared with another employee of the home.
New York: A video showed a CNA pulling a wig off of a woman with dementia and then slapping her on her head with it.
Illinois: A video showed a CNA jiggling the loose skin and tissue on the back of the arm of a woman who had severe cognitive issues. The caption on the video read: “Don’t leave your family members with her, she plays with their skin.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is a Republican from New Hartford, Iowa.
In 2016, following a spate of photo-related cases of nursing home abuse in Iowa and other states, U.S. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa called on federal officials to take a more active role in fighting privacy violations of nursing home residents. In the wake of that effort, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services sent out a memo to state inspection agencies reminding them of residents’ privacy rights.
In 2024, a professor at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing reported that a review of inspection reports from 31 states showed evidence of abusive privacy violations involving 152 nursing home residents.
Writing in McKnight’s Long-Term Care News, Eilon Caspi stated that 85% of the victims had some level of cognitive impairment, and that the cases involved workers sharing on social media photos and videos of residents in a demeaning, humiliating or abusive manner.

Jones announced his candidacy for Alabama governor Monday afternoon. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones officially joined the race for Alabama’s governor Monday afternoon.
Jones posted a video to social media Monday where he confirmed the “worst kept secret” in Alabama. He also teased an official kickoff next month.
“Folks in Alabama deserve a governor who is going to fight for them,” he said. “What we’ve heard all along is that Alabama wants their next governor to be someone who lives here, who works here, who listens to the people of this state, who understands the people of this state.”
A message seeking comment from Jones was left Monday afternoon. Jones’ gubernatorial campaign was formally registered with the Alabama Secretary of State’s office early Monday afternoon. 
Alabama’s primaries are May 19.
Jones’ entry into the race likely sets up a rematch with U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who defeated Jones in the 2020 senatorial race and has largely cleared the field in the GOP gubernatorial race. It also gives Democrats their highest-profile gubernatorial candidate since Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox and Former Alabama Supreme Court Justice Sue Bell Cobb jockeyed for the nomination in 2018. 
A message seeking comment from Tuberville’s campaign was left Monday afternoon. Communications director for Tuberville’s campaign Mallory Jaspers posted to social media Monday morning that the governor’s race will yield similar results.
“This race is already over — but if Comrade Doug wants to get blown out again, be our guest,” Jaspers wrote. 
In a shot at residency questions that have dogged Tuberville for several years, Jones in his video said Alabama “wants their next governor to be someone who treats this state with grace and dignity, and not just like a rest stop on the way to the Florida beach.”
The path to the campaign
Rumors of Jones’ candidacy picked up over the weekend when the Voice of Alabama Politics reported Sunday that Jones would file the necessary paperwork to enter the race this week. Monday morning, staff at the Secretary of State’s Office said Jones’ campaign would not appear until it received the physical form with Jones’ signature in the mail. 
Jones is a former U.S. attorney who secured convictions against Thomas Edwin Blanton Jr. in 2001  and Bobby Frank Cherry in 2002 for the murder of four little girls in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963. Both men were sentenced to life in prison. 
In 2017, Jones launched what at first appeared to be a longshot bid for U.S. Senate, promising to focus on “kitchen table issues” for Alabamians. In a December special election, Jones beat Republican nominee Roy Moore, a former Alabama chief justice who divided Republicans and faced accusations of sexual abuse and misconduct during the campaign. 
Despite outraising Tuberville in the 2020 election, Jones lost re-election by election results as President Donald Trump easily won Alabama and straight-ticket Republican voting pulled Tuberville ahead. After his defeat, Jones, a longtime supporter of Joe Biden, helped the Biden administration guide U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson’s nomination through the U.S. Senate. 
Jones had been dropping hints of a gubernatorial run throughout the year. He endorsed and campaigned for Alex Braswell, a Democratic candidate in the House District 11 special election this summer. He hosted a town hall for Braswell, who was the first Democrat to run for the seat in nearly 20 years, in Cullman, his wife’s hometown.
Jones hinted at his run for governor at a town hall hosted by U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Birmingham, earlier this month.
Jones was also part of a discussion in October with former U.S. Attorney Bill Baxley where the pair of attorneys reflected on the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing.
“At the time, it was a hope of race here in America. But today, it’s really a hope for everyone, given all that we’re doing,” Jones said at the event hosted by the Southern Poverty Law Center. “Even when I tried these cases years ago, immigration issues and other issues of hate will begin to bubble up. And today it’s really the hope of so many people that we can all live on this planet together, love each other a little bit more, (and) respect each other a hell of a lot more.”
Jones joins Will Boyd and Chad “Chig” Martin in the Democratic primary. Tuberville and Ken McFeeters make up the Republican primary so far.
Democrats face a tough battle for statewide office in Alabama. Jones, who was the first Democrat to win election to the U.S. Senate in 25 years, is the only Democrat to win a statewide vote for a political office since 2008, when former Public Service Commission President Lucy Baxley narrowly won election to the PSC. The last Democrat to win the governor’s mansion was Don Siegelman in 1998. Siegelman served a single term.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0104-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

[…]","More than 100 pieces of DNA evidence integral to a rape and manslaughter appeal in Washington County are likely missing, attorneys allege in a recent court filing. The evidence, ranging from a sexual assault kit to fingernail scrapings and strips of masking tape, is tied to the 2002 killing of a 6-year-old girl in Greenville.
If the evidence is lost, attorneys Jacob Howard and Adnan Sultan argue, their client King Young Brown Jr., should be exonerated.
Brown is incarcerated in the Marshall County Correctional Facility and serving two consecutive sentences — 30 years for rape and 20 for manslaughter. He was convicted in 2005 of raping and killing the child whom the attorneys refer to as R.W. in their motion. 
It was a day Gloria Brown, King Brown Jr.’s mother, remembers well. She said her life before that day was different. Her son was 15, and had never been arrested before. He will turn 39 in prison next month.
“I may not be behind bars, but I feel like I’m doing the time with him,” Gloria Brown told Mississippi Today.
For many years after the little girl’s death, the family of R.W. held a block party in her honor at H.T. Crosby Park, where she was last seen alive. Addie Cannon, R.W.’s aunt, misses her niece.
Cannon believes the state has the right man behind bars. 
“She was just a little shy child,” Cannon recalled. “I will always remember the way she said, ‘Hey auntie, come give me a hug.’”

Brown Jr.’s attorneys are appealing his convictions and hope a new analysis of the evidence will help to exonerate their client. They write that as recently as Aug. 29, 2023, the Washington County Circuit Clerk’s Office in Greenville had the evidence. 
On Sept. 16, Washington County Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Smith ordered Circuit Clerk Barbara Esters-Parker to ship the evidence within 30 days to Bode Technology, a Virginia-based company that provides forensic DNA analysis, including newer methods such as Touch DNA and Y-STR testing. Smith’s order also required Esters-Parker to email a copy of the shipping receipt.
But in a Nov. 6 court filing, Howard and Sultan allege that Esters-Parker can’t account for the evidence or the other exhibits.
“More than thirty (30) days have passed since the Court issued its Order and the Clerk has failed to ship the specified biological evidence to Bode Technology,” the attorneys wrote.
Esters-Parker and Deputy Clerk Cynthia Lakes declined to comment because of pending litigation.
If the evidence is not located, the attorneys argued, the court should vacate Brown Jr.’s convictions and drop the related charges, the attorneys wrote. 
On April 21, 2002, R.W. was found dead in a garbage bin that belonged to her grandmother’s neighbors — Brown Jr.  and his family. Brown Jr. was tried three times for the crimes. The first two trials resulted in hung juries. At the third trial, after over 13 hours of deliberation, a jury found Brown Jr. guilty of rape and manslaughter. 
“We remain hopeful that Mr. Brown will have the opportunity to establish his innocence through the DNA testing ordered by the circuit court,” said Sultan, an attorney at The Innocence Project who focuses on securing DNA testing for post-conviction cases and overturning wrongful convictions. Howard, senior counsel for the Mississippi office of the MacArthur Justice Center, also focuses on wrongful convictions.
Modern DNA testing
In their motion, Howard and Sultan said, “Law enforcement collected a wealth of biological evidence in this case that has never been subjected to DNA testing or that can be re-tested using more advanced technology.”
None of the hairs collected from Brown Jr.’s home that underwent microscopic comparison were linked to Webster or her “material relatives” the attorneys wrote. “The results of this testing were never presented to a jury.”
The prosecution’s case against Brown Jr. hinged on the testimony of a hair follicle expert who compared microscopic hairs found at the Brown home to those of the victim, the court filing reads.
There is also controversy over the accuracy of microscopic hair comparison. In 2016, then-FBI Director James Comey wrote in a letter that FBI examiners made statements about the analysis that “went beyond the limits of science,” putting “more weight on a hair comparison than scientifically appropriate.”
In 1999, a Justice Department task force found that 96% of 150 cases involving microscopic hair analysis had flaws. In 2009, the National Academy of Science announced that microscopic hair analysis had “no scientific support.” After Innocence Project co-founder Peter Neufeld asked the FBI to review cases in which microscopic hair analysis had been used in evidence, the FBI established that every member of the agency’s 28-person hair and fiber unit had given flawed testimony in the 268 convictions that were reviewed. 
“In several cases in which microscopic hair comparison evidence was introduced, defendants were later exonerated by DNA after being convicted,” Comey wrote. “We want to make sure there aren’t other innocent people in jail based on our work.”

In R.W.’s case, the state did not submit for modern DNA analysis of any of the DNA evidence nor did prosecutors present it to a jury.
The analyst who inspected the fingernail scrapings from R.W.’s killing in 2005 conceded it was difficult then to make an accurate identification of the perpetrator given the capabilities of technology at that time. Modern DNA testing doesn’t require as large of a DNA sample to get a result. 
Some DNA testing was not used at Brown Jr.’s trial because the defense received the results too late to review them and get an expert in court, according to Howard’s and Sultan’s recent motion.
Earlier this year, on April 8, Assistant District Attorney Austin Frye  responded to a motion for post-conviction DNA testing by listing evidence he said was already presented to the jury including Brown Jr.’s fingerprints on both the outer ring of the garbage bag and garbage bags at his home, and DNA analysis results that proved Brown Jr.’s hairs matched those found in the inner and outer garbage bags of where R.W. was found. He also touted the results of microscopic hair comparison, and he said further DNA testing would not exonerate Brown Jr.
Frye did not address the issue that none of the hairs the state submitted from Brown Jr.’s home matched the victim or any of her material relatives. Frye could not be reached for comment by the time of publication.
Sultan and Howard explained that it would make logical sense that Brown Jr.’s hairs and fingerprints would be found in a garbage bin he along with his family used regularly.
A “wealth” of biological evidence suitable for modern DNA testing became available after Brown Jr.’s 2005 trial, said Huma Nasir, an expert the defense team retained who is a director at a private DNA analysis lab in Oklahoma City.
Howard and Sultan’s Nov. 6 motion asks the Washington County Circuit Court for a hearing to determine the chain of custody of the evidence and to have the circuit clerk and deputy clerk testify under oath.
A 2009 Mississippi law mandates preservation of all biological evidence in criminal cases with the court instructed to “impose appropriate remedies” and “order appropriate sanctions” in the case of violation. The law was amended in 2011 to clarify that when biological evidence needed to be destroyed, the incarcerated and their attorney should be notified along with other interested parties.
“Innocent people mistakenly convicted of the serious crimes for which biological evidence is probative cannot prove their innocence if such evidence is not accessible for testing in appropriate circumstances,” read the 2009 law.
Two decades of difficult memories
When R.W.’s killing made headlines in 2002, both the victim’s family and that of the accused were thrust into the media spotlight. The two families had been next-door neighbors for more than two decades.
For Gloria Brown, King Young Brown Jr.’s mother, the news of potentially missing evidence felt like a blow. She hopes that he will win his appeal. She and her stepfather say they were with Brown Jr. the night R.W. was killed. 
“I felt that it was the end for me, and didn’t feel like I’d survive it,” Gloria Brown said of her son’s trials and convictions. “But I had a lot of family support that helped me. I didn’t think I’d be able to be this strong.”

She says it was hard to watch the police search her home after the murder. Her late husband, King Brown Sr., was a well-respected city councilman in Greenville and known as a peacekeeper during contentious council meetings. She wasn’t accustomed to the scrutiny.
The recent motion about the missing evidence has also dredged up difficult memories for Cannon, R.W.’s aunt. She still remembers the mints that her sister, R.W.’s mother, would bring from Sonic Drive-In. Her niece loved them. Cannon also still remembers the scream she believes was hers on the night R.W. disappeared. 
Cannon remembers the shock of identifying her niece’s body over two decades ago. She is wary of the defense’s push to vacate King Young Brown Jr.’s conviction if the evidence is not located. 
“When my sister passed, that’s when it really took a big toll on me because I know that’s [the killing of R.W.] why she was sick,” Cannon said of R.W.’s other aunt. “And it’s still terrible, just the idea of him thinking that he needs to get out. You don’t need to be in the free world if you can do a child like that. You don’t need to be here.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/21133628/IMG_3852.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

(File photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)COLUMBIA — When Iris Barham’s great-grandfather started in the dairy business, he milked cows by hand and delivered the bottles door-to-door in Cherokee County.
Today, robots milk the cows on an Anderson County farm Barham runs with her father and brother.
In the future, Milky Way Farm hopes to install a robotic manure system to clean the barns, as well as an automated system to bottle-feed calves, said Barham.
Developing more of these types of technologies that make business easier and more profitable for South Carolina farmers are what a one-time grant program hopes to accomplish.
“Each step is to improve the welfare of the animals on our farm, but also to improve the quality of life of the people that are working our farm,” Barham said Monday at the announcement of a new program for farmers.
The Cultivating Innovation in SC Agribusiness Program, funded by a $600,000 donation from the Wells Fargo Foundation, will award 14 grants worth $30,000 each to farmers or startup companies with ideas for using technology to sustain South Carolina’s nearly $52 billion agriculture industry.
New SC law aims to preserve dwindling farmland

Applications open Dec. 1 and close just before midnight Feb. 2, 2026. An information webinar is scheduled for 4 p.m. Dec. 4.
“Our funding reflects a clear belief that supporting small farmers and agribusiness is essential to South Carolina’s economy and our future,” said Pam Bryant, a vice president of philanthropy at the Wells Fargo Foundation.
The grants act similar to seed money or an angel investment to help get projects started.
Barham told the SC Daily Gazette she intends to apply for a grant to help buy a robot to feed calves.
Beyond the $30,000 grants to the award winners, Wells Fargo’s donation also funds a series of training sessions, covering subjects such as intellectual property and how to fundraise for next steps after the initial grant round is over. Or, as in Barham’s case, how to keep growing the farm’s customer base so her daughter can one day take over as a fifth-generation dairy farmer.
The program will be jointly operated by the South Carolina Research Authority, state Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Small Business Administration-supported Small Business Development Center, headquartered at the University of South Carolina.
South Carolina’s Agriculture Commissioner Hugh Weathers said technology and agriculture have become synonymous.
“We have technology using optics to grade peaches,” he said. “One of our great peach farms over in Edgefield County uses a scanner that I think replace as many as 20 people to grade the peaches.”
Other farms, he said, are using drones and infrared technology to monitor the health of crops and spray for weeds.
That type of technology has helped farmers stay in business amid rising costs, labor shortages and environmental conditions such as drought, Weathers said.
“Because of the challenges for agriculture, we have to think smarter going forward than we have up until today,” he said.
The state’s agriculture agency has a history of helping farmers through its Agribusiness Center for Research and Entrepreneurship (ACRE), founded in 2018. Those grants are capped at $25,000 each.
The Milky Way Farm, which has 120 dairy cows, was among the recipients in 2021. Barham said that helped buy a $200,000 robotic milker.
“It’s a drop in the bucket but every little bit helps,” she told the Daily Gazette.
In the most recent round, announced in May, a dozen farms were collectively awarded $200,000 in state funding.
That includes Kindlewood Farms in Walterboro, which spent its share on a greenhouse to extend the growing season for tomatoes sold to Lowcountry restaurants. Harvest Moon Farm and Flower in Pelzer used its portion to convert a yurt on its property into a farm store for its pick-your-own flower operation. And Old McCaskill’s Farm in Rembert used its funds to develop a line of freeze-dried meals made from produce grown and processed on the farm.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/robotic-milker-1024x749.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

(Photo: Clayton Henkel/NC Newsline)Bishop William Barber, North Carolina faith leaders and dozens of activists gathered at the N.C. General Assembly Monday to symbolically eulogize the thousands of people that they believe will die as a result of cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net programs.
Barber said communities are just now beginning to feel the impact of cuts from the Trump administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which he has dubbed the “Big, Ugly, Deadly, Destructive Bill.” He said the refusal to extend Affordable Care Act (ACA) tax credits could result in 51,000 American lives lost annually.
“Later this week, we will be releasing an open letter to every member of the General Assembly, demanding that every member put down partisan politics and pick up humanity,” said Barber.
Barber said he wants lawmakers to return to Raleigh for an emergency session to address ongoing state cuts to Medicaid and to urge Congress to pass the enhanced ACA subsidies that are set to expire on December 31, 2025.
Barber said the cuts to Medicaid, the loss of the health care tax credits, and the withholding of SNAP benefits during the federal government shutdown are all examples of “policy violence” inflicted on the most vulnerable.
Nikki Williams came downtown Raleigh Monday to take part in the symbolic eulogy, with the hope state legislators would understand the importance of strengthening the social safety net.
“I personally receive Medicaid, and without Medicaid, I can’t receive pain management. I can’t go to the dentist,” explained Williams. “I appreciate financial assistance, but it doesn’t cover everything.”

Pushing a rollator with a sign that read “Save Our Healthcare,” Williams shared that she has already heard from friends who have seen their monthly health insurance premiums double without the subsidies in place.
Williams believes those who may find themselves uninsured in the new year will simply turn to the emergency room for primary care. Those with insurance may find themselves paying more to offset the cost of the uninsured.
“Then that means everybody’s fees [cost] going up, so that the doctors can get paid,” said Williams.
It may be a legislative long shot to expect lawmakers to address the Medicaid funding gap before the end of the year, but Williams remains ever hopeful.
“It’s not about having the funds to do it. It’s about not having the willingness to do it,” Williams said. “And they should be ashamed because their people should come first. Their people put them in office. It’s their responsibility to protect them.”
North Carolina has cut payments to Medicaid providers from 3% to 10% this fall. Democratic Governor Josh Stein says those cuts are necessary because state lawmakers failed to fully fund the program. Stein has called on state House and Senate leaders to return to Raleigh and address the funding shortfall.
Republican state lawmakers say those cuts were premature and politically motivated. Both the House and Senate have separately approved plans to fully fund the Medicaid program, but have shown little willingness to reach a compromise that would end a months-long standoff. Earlier this month, Republican legislative leaders refused Stein’s call to hold a special session.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 20:59:44+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump’s ACA subsidy stance unclear as CT premium hikes loom,Katy Golvala and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/trumps-aca-subsidies-premium-hikes/,President Donald Trump was reportedly mulling the rollout of a health care proposal on Monday that could shake up last-minute negotiations.,"In 2008, Leslie Silverman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. A divorce left her without health insurance, and she was grappling with a chronic disease, all while raising three young children. When the Affordable Care Act passed, it was a saving grace, she said.
“This insurance — this exchange — is a lifeline for so many,” Silverman said during a press conference in Hartford on Friday.
Like Silverman, more than 140,000 Connecticut residents are waiting to see if there will be an extension of the enhanced subsidies that help lower costs for Affordable Care Act health plans. They are set to expire on Dec. 31, and without congressional action, premiums are expected to rise for many in 2026.
Congress remains locked in a fierce debate over the fate of the tax credits, which were created under Democrats’ pandemic relief bill in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025. And as President Donald Trump was reportedly mulling the rollout of a health care proposal on Monday that could shake up last-minute negotiations, the path forward is in limbo just weeks out from the deadline.
The enhanced premium subsidies were in the spotlight throughout the 43-day government shutdown, with Democrats making their extension a key demand to end the stalemate.
If the subsidies lapse, Connecticut residents could see their premiums rise by an average of $2,380 per year — or about $198 a month — according to mid-October estimates provided by the state’s health care marketplace, Access Health CT. A household of four would see premiums rise by an average of over $10,000 per year.
Enrollees in Affordable Care Act plans can qualify for various subsidies to reduce health care costs based on their income. Households earning between 100% to 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for getting financial help to afford plans. The 2021 bill expanded eligibility to those who make more than 400% of the federal poverty level.
As part of a deal to end the shutdown, U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., pledged to hold a vote on renewing the subsidies by the second week of December. While enough Democrats got behind it to reopen the government, most in the party — including all of Connecticut’s delegation — opposed it because it wouldn’t guarantee an extension. And House GOP leadership hasn’t made a commitment to schedule such a vote in the lower chamber.
Republicans haven’t coalesced around an alternative to the subsidies, but some got behind an early idea by Trump to send money directly to consumers that could be used to cover the cost of premiums. As debate over a solution intensifies in the days since the shutdown ended, he told Congress to “not waste your time and energy on anything else.”
“THE ONLY HEALTHCARE I WILL SUPPORT OR APPROVE IS SENDING THE MONEY DIRECTLY BACK TO THE PEOPLE, WITH NOTHING GOING TO THE BIG, FAT, RICH INSURANCE COMPANIES, WHO HAVE MADE $TRILLIONS, AND RIPPED OFF AMERICA LONG ENOUGH,” Trump wrote last week on the social media platform, Truth Social. 
Yet reports suggested Trump was warming to a temporary extension of the subsidies for another two years in a plan that was expected to be released on Monday. It also limits eligibility to those who make up to 700% of the federal poverty line.
While an announcement was never officially scheduled for Monday and the details were light, the forthcoming proposal was delayed as the framework started to get pushback from some congressional Republicans skeptical of the Affordable Care Act, according to MS Now.
That has left an already uncertain policy on even shakier ground heading into the final weeks of the year and an imminent deadline for the enhanced subsidies.
Advocates fear that if premiums go up dramatically, people who purchase plans through their state’s exchange will lower their coverage or drop it entirely. That means sicker individuals will remain on the rolls, which could drive up costs. Plus, those forgoing health insurance could end up relying more on emergency rooms if they get ill.
“Make no mistake, your health care cost will rise even if you think you’re fine, because the ripple effect will go through our entire health care system and our economy,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said.
Silverman, who currently works as an independent marketing consultant and still gets her insurance through Access Health CT, has considered several options if the subsidies expire. She said she could go without insurance, find a full-time job to qualify for employer-sponsored coverage or leave Connecticut altogether. She’s also thought about moving to a state where health plans are cheaper for people who are self-employed.
“I love where I live. I love my community,” Silverman, who lives in West Hartford, said. “It’s a really tough financial choice.”
But there is limited time for Congress to address the subsidies before the end of the year. Lawmakers are out of town this week for Thanksgiving, and when they return to Washington in December, they will only have three weeks in session before the rest of the holidays.
If they can’t find a resolution, that means the issue could slip into the next year and subsidies would go away. U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., insisted Democrats would keep pressuring Republicans to take it up. But GOP leadership in both the Senate and House control what votes come up on the floor, and the minority party has little recourse.
“When these premium increases go into effect in January, the pressure is just going to mount because that’s when the real misery happens,” Murphy said. “As that pressure builds and builds and builds, we will keep at it. We will keep pressing our Republican colleagues to come back to the table and to reinstate those subsidies, even if we do it in January, February, March. We can at least stem the full year impact of those rate increases.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ACA-SUBSIDIES-1124-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

Credit: AP Photo/Bruce Newman
It is Monday of Egg Bowl Week, and we are in unchartered territory – even for Lane Kiffin.
Rick Cleveland
 I mean this in two ways. First, his Ole Miss Rebels are 10-1 heading into the Egg Bowl, needing only a victory over 5-6 Mississippi State to either earn a bye or a first-round home game in the FBS playoffs. Ole Miss, for the first time since integration, is a legit national championship contender in late November. Secondly, 28 years into his coaching career at age 50, the immensely talented Kiffin has taken his otherwise tired act – that of narcissistic coaching diva – to a new level with his highly public flirtations with Florida and LSU.
Will Kiffin leave Ole Miss for Florida – or, more likely, LSU – or will he stay at Ole Miss and coach his team in the playoffs and beyond? It is almost as if he is a high school recruit, sitting at a press conference with three caps in front of him? Which will he choose?
I have no clue what will happen Friday in Starkville and then Saturday in Oxford when Kiffin’s decision is supposed to come, but clearly Kiffin already has worn out his welcome with a huge segment of Ole Miss faithful.
None of this is normal.
I do have a clue about this: If Kiffin chooses to leave Ole Miss and his team with it headed into the playoffs, that will be his everlasting legacy. He forever will be the coach who deserted his team at its moment of highest achievement.
Think about it, Brian Kelly was roundly criticized for leaving Notre Dame for LSU when the Irish were still under playoff consideration (not when they were already in). Kelly famously left Notre Dame because he thought LSU afforded him a better opportunity to coach a national championship team. We see how that turned out. Notre Dame, under Kelly’s successor, Marcus Freeman, has at least played for the national championship earlier this year. Meanwhile, LSU has fired Kelly, who never made the playoffs at Baton Rouge, and now the school is scheming every which way on how to not pay Kelly what’s left on his contract.
None of that would appear to matter to Kiffin, who seems completely oblivious to the image he portrays. That is a telling characteristic of a narcissist, a person who exhibits a grandiose sense of self-importance, a need for excessive admiration, a lack of empathy, and a sense of entitlement. A diva simply enjoys all the attention.
Many, including Kiffin’s former boss, Nick Saban, blame the current college football system for the situation Kiffin and Ole Miss find themselves in. And, yes, it is a bad system. But for my money what Kiffin is doing can’t all be blamed on the system.
Kiffin has spoken in the past about how OIe Miss and the Oxford community have been integral in his personal growth and transformation. He has gone so far as to say he needed Oxford and Ole Miss more than Oxford and Ole Miss have needed him. I would agree. But they have been good for each other. If Ole Miss wins Friday, as the Rebels are favored to do, that will make 50 victories over the past five seasons. Yes, Kiffin, an offensive genius, has been good for Oxford. Ole Miss enrollment is up nearly 17 percent over that period. Coincidence? No.
But then Ole Miss has compensated Kiffin royally for his success. He makes nearly $10 million a year, more than twice what any Ole Miss coach has made before him. The university has raised his assistants’ salary pool to a point where it is competitive with any. Ole Miss has been on the cutting edge in NIL compensation for its football athletes. Ole Miss held its nose and abided Kiffin’s well publicized dalliance with Auburn three years ago – one that ruined another promising season – and has given Kiffin almost a blank check for what he needs to compete with the nation’s football powerhouses. What’s more, Keith Carter has pledged to provide even more. And yet Kiffin’s family has made quite public visits to Gainesville and Baton Rouge to check out schools and neighborhoods. Said one of my most loyal friends, a zealous Ole Miss fan for more than six decades, “I just wish Lane wouldn’t rub our faces in it.”
Kiffin, however, is oblivious.
One person, whose opinion I highly value, tells me I am overreacting to Kiffin’s public waffling. He says the Ole Miss-Lane Kiffin situation is the new normal in college athletics. He says the coaches are mercenaries and the players are mercenaries, as well. Get used to it.
Further, he says, “The days of college coaches and athletes caring for the school as much as the fans and alumni are over, gone forever.“
The more I think about it, the more I realize he is correct. But I don’t have to like it. And I don’t.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21135351/AP25290045208644.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

But at least in Comey’s case, in which charges were brought on the eve of the statute of limitations expiring, that appeared unlikely.120-day clockU.S. attorneys are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, but the attorney general can appoint someone on an interim basis for 120 days. After that, the judges in the district are responsible for appointing an interim prosecutor.“Ms. Halligan was not appointed in a manner consistent with this framework,” Currie wrote.Bondi appointed Erik Siebert as the interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia in January, while his confirmation was pending in the Senate. After 120 days, the judges in the district allowed him to continue.Siebert resigned in September, reportedly under pressure from Trump and Bondi to bring charges against Comey. Bondi then named Halligan, at the time a White House aide who had also worked for Trump in a private capacity, as the interim U.S. attorney. But Bondi could not do that because, after 120 days, the responsibility for naming an interim U.S. attorney fell to the district court judges, Currie wrote.“The 120-day clock began running with Mr. Siebert’s appointment on Jan. 21, 2025,” she wrote. “When that clock expired on May 21, 2025, so too did the Attorney General’s appointment authority. Consequently, I conclude that the Attorney General’s attempt to install Ms. Halligan as Interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was invalid and that Ms. Halligan has been unlawfully serving in that role.”Quick indictmentHalligan, after gaining office in September, quickly secured a two-count indictment against the former FBI chief from a grand jury in Alexandria. Comey was accused of lying to Congress about whether he had authorized a press leak of information related to an FBI investigation of Russian actors’ involvement in Trump’s first presidential campaign. However, U.S. District Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick wrote last week that issues with evidence, testimony and statements to the grand jury in the case outweighed the usual heavily guarded secrecy of proceedings. He said “profound investigative missteps” could result in the dismissal of Comey’s indictment.Comey has pleaded not guilty.James won more than $300 million in a civil case against Trump related to business fraud, though a state appeals court later overturned the sentence as overly punitive.Trump has publicly blasted James and Comey as using the mechanisms of legal proceedings to persecute him. In an extraordinary public message to Bondi just before Halligan replaced Siebert, Trump complained that the prosecutions against both were not developing faster.The Justice Department did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday.",,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

(Photos by John Partipilo)With one week until the Dec. 2 special election for Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District, the money is pouring in, signaling both parties think the race is competitive. 
Former Tennessee General Services Commission Matt Van Epps, a Republican, was slightly favored by most political rating organizations to defeat state Rep. Aftyn Behn, a Democrat, in the special election to replace retired former U.S. Rep. Mark Green. The district was redrawn in 2022 to include parts of Nashville, Clarksville, and a swath of rural and suburban Tennessee counties with strong GOP leanings. Green won the district in 2022 and 2024 by nearly identical 20-percentage point margins. 
But as President Donald Trump’s approval rating has steadily dropped over the last few months because of the government shutdown, his handling of SNAP benefits and the impacts of tariffs on farmers and consumers, the Democratic Party has sensed an opportunity. 
Political action committees, PACs, tied to Democratic donors have spent almost $1.8 million in the race to help Behn, and Republican-tied PACs have spent $2.3 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings as of Nov. 24. The latest spending in the general election comes after nearly $3 million was mostly to help ensure a Van Epps victory. 
Of the $4.1 million spent so far, more than two-thirds has been spent on negative advertising about Behn and Van Epps. 
For Democrats, the vast majority of their PAC money has been spent by two groups: HMP and Your Community PAC.
The largest individual donors to HMP this year are Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, whose family owns the Hyatt hotel chain, and Reed Hastings, the founder of Netflix. The HMP PAC also received a significant contribution from the House Majority Forward, a campaign arm of U.S. House Democratic leadership. 
Your Community PAC’s money doesn’t link back to an individual donor but to a group called North Fund, whose donors are untraceable. The North Fund, as of 2024, was run by a Washington, D.C. consultant named Jim Gerstein, who has served as a pollster and independent expenditure campaign organizer in support of several Democratic Party candidates. 
For Republicans, MAGA Inc. has spent nearly $1.2 million in the race, with Club for Growth and  Conservatives for American Excellence spending a combined $1 million. 
MAGA Inc. is Trump’s primary PAC, whose largest individual donors this year are Jeff Yass, a billionaire investor who most notably owns a significant stake in Chinese social video company TikTok, and Kelcy Warren, the billionaire owner of Energy Transfer Partners. 
Conservatives for American Excellence spent around $600,000 in the primary to help Van Epps. The organization has received most of its donations from Ken Griffin and Paul Singer, billionaire owners of two hedge funds.
Club For Growth’s main backers are Yass and Virginia James, a long-time conservative donor and supporter of private school vouchers. Club for Growth also funds the School Freedom Fund, which spent around $850,000 to help Van Epps in the primary and spent more than $3.3 million in 2024 to elect a slate of pro-private-school voucher supporters to Tennessee’s state legislature.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/behn-vanepps.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, visits Normandy, France, in 2023 to commemorate the 79th anniversary of the D-Day invasion during World War II and to pay respects to 9,386 American soldiers buried at Normandy American Cemetery. (Submitted)TOPEKA — The U.S. Senate passed a bill introduced by Kansas Republican Sen. Jerry Moran to establish a 10-year program to identify Jewish-American servicemembers interred in cemeteries overseas with markers that didn’t properly indicate the individual’s religious heritage.
The measure sent to the U.S. House would allocate $500,000 annually to the American Battle Monuments Commission for research on members of the armed forces who could have been mistakenly memorialized. The commission would be responsible for contacting surviving descendants to determine whether the family was able to confirm an error and, if so, decide whether to have the grave marker replaced.
Operation Benjamin, a nonprofit organization working to preserve memories of Jewish-American men and women who gave their lives in World War II, estimated at least 600 had been incorrectly buried overseas under a Latin cross rather than a Star of David.
“All veterans, especially Jewish-American veterans who have served and sacrificed for our nation’s freedoms, deserve to have their faith accurately represented at their final resting places,” Moran said. “This legislation makes certain that the religious heritage of those who have died for our country is rightfully represented at their gravesites and gives their families the lasting comfort of knowing their loved one’s faith is recognized and memorialized with dignity and truth.”
The legislation was introduced in April by Moran, chair of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, and U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nevada. The bill was cosponsored by 18 Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, but not U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican.
“I’m glad to see that our bipartisan legislation to make sure our servicemembers and their faith are correctly reflected at their gravesites has passed the Senate,” Rosen said.
Rosen said the nation should make certain fallen veterans were honored with “dignity and and accuracy at their final resting place.”
Under the Senate’s version of the Fallen Servicemembers Religious Heritage Restoration Act, the battle monuments commission wouldn’t conduct a rededication ceremony and replace a marker without permission of a decedent’s next of kin.
During World War II, soldiers were given the option of having their religious affiliation noted on U.S. military dog tags. A soldier could have a “C” for Catholic, “P” for Protestant or “H” for Hebrew. In some instances, Jewish-American servicemembers misrepresented their religious faith when issued a dog tag or defaced the identification tag before combat because of concern German soldiers would treat captured Jewish troops harshly.
Another issue was injuries to deceased soldiers could be so significant that military personnel couldn’t be identified or their religious background was obscured.
In 2022, the American Battle Monuments Commission, in coordination with Operation Benjamin, engaged in the kind of remedy the Senate bill was designed to support. The commission and organization replaced Latin cross headstones marking graves of seven Jewish-American service members with Stars of David during services at Epinal American Cemetery in France and three other American cemeteries in Europe.
The commission said the group included Army Private Marvin Ashkenas, a Bloomfield, N.J., native killed in action Oct. 3, 1944. He was born in New York City to Russian-Jewish immigrants and enlisted in 1942. His tags were lost and he was placed in a temporary grave during a nondenominational ceremony. When he was moved to Epinal American Cemetery his religion was listed as “unknown” and his gravesite incorrectly marked with a Latin cross.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Moran-photo-normandy-2023.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

He truly embodies the Iowa Award, and I look forward to honoring him next month.”
Branstad holds the title of longest-serving governor in U.S. history, having held office from 1983-1999 and 2011-2017. He also served as ambassador to China from 2017-2020 and is currently a partner in the Branstad Churchill Group, a consulting firm that works with companies seeking to do business in the U.S. and China, according to its website.
Other recipients of the award include former President Herbert Hoover, physicist James Van Allen, former first lady Mamie Eisenhower, Nobel Peace Prize recipient Norman Borlaug, Gallup Poll founder George Gallup, suffrage movement leader Carrie Lane Chapman Catt and entrepreneur and philanthropist John Pappajohn, according to the release.
The former governor and ambassador said in an interview he has “great respect” for every person who has received the award, including the late philanthropist Bill Knapp, and he’s honored to join their ranks. Branstad said he loves the state of Iowa and is proud of the progress it has made, and of his service.
“It’s a great honor to be associated with these very distinguished people,” Branstad said.

Phil Murphy's final energy master plan maintains the state's commitments to cutting fossil fuel sources and focusing on renewables. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy’s vision for New Jersey energy policy remained mostly unchanged in a new version of the state’s energy master plan released Monday.
Though the new plan places less emphasis on wind energy than the 2019 master plan it succeeds, the document unveiled Monday continues to urge New Jersey to build renewable generation and slowly phase out fossil plants to meet energy and emissions goals over the coming decades.
“This report is the culmination of our no-regrets strategy to tackling the challenges of energy affordability, supply and demand, and climate change,” Murphy said in a statement. “I am proud of all that we’ve been able to achieve to make our energy sector cleaner and more efficient over the past eight years. This report’s recommendations will help guide energy policy to new heights in the future.”
Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office on Jan. 20 after two terms as governor, and another Democrat, Mikie Sherrill, is set to succeed him.
The state’s energy master plan is a policy document whose drafting is mandated by law, though it has no force of law on its own. Its recommendations and framework do not bind lawmakers, but legislators have previously advanced bills to enshrine parts of the 2019 plan in law.
The new plan maintains Murphy’s goal of having New Jersey generate 100% of its electricity from renewable or low-emitting sources by 2035.
That includes a planned phase-out of natural gas plants, which accounted for about 48% of the state’s energy generation in 2023. Mirroring some past proposals, the energy master plan calls for the state to bar the creation of new gas plants and allow existing ones to shut down rather than be renewed.
The plan allows natural gas plants using renewable biofuels under some scenarios, and some gas plants would persist through at least 2050.
Republican lawmakers — and even some Democrats — have criticized the administration for shuttering some of the state’s existing fossil fuel plants without replacements on hand. They said natural gas should be a part of New Jersey’s energy mix.
The plan’s call for renewables differs somewhat from the one issued in 2019. Mainly, the more recent plan places less emphasis on wind generation.
Murphy made wind a key pillar of his energy policy, but the projects not killed by economic headwinds are stalled following a federal permitting and leasing freeze instituted by President Donald Trump’s administration.
Eric Miller, executive director of the state’s climate action and green economy office, said the administration wanted to be sure the new master plan “was responding to the world as it is, not as we want it to be.”
The plan urges New Jersey to continue advocacy before PJM Interconnection, which operates the grid that serves New Jersey and 12 other states. Democrats have said delays in PJM’s interconnection queue are to blame for recent electricity price increases.
Those increases are tied to surging demand spurred by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth energy needs following decades of largely level electricity demand.
The plan says New Jersey could help offset those increases by raising income limits on certain utility assistance programs, raising caps on some existing programs’ awards, and potentially tying electricity prices to the time of day.
The plan says New Jersey could continue to weigh the benefits of levying additional fixed charges based on ratepayers’ income, but stops short of proposing that the state do so.
It also maintains dramatic goals for building electrification. Each of the plan’s scenarios would require full electric heating by 2050 in the residential and commercial sectors, though the plan would allow at least some amount of gas heating.
Likewise, it maintains ambitious goals on vehicle electrification. Under each scenario, New Jersey would maintain an existing policy that seeks to phase out the sale of new gas-burning light-duty cars by 2035.
“We are doing everything within our control to expand state programs. We work closely with the utilities so we can expand their programs so that we can continue to expand our EV incentives, expand EV adoption, and most importantly, enhance a lot of the EV infrastructure development that we’ve already started on,” said Preethy Thangaraj, the climate action office’s deputy director.
Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in New Jersey, accounting for 35% of state emissions in 2021, according to the Department of Environmental Protection. That level at least doubled emissions from other sources apart from electricity generation, which accounted for 18% of 2021’s emissions.",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3N2A6964-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486
,DC,2025-11-24 20:16:41+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Press access to Oval Office argued in case involving Trump and wire service,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/press-access-oval-office-argued-case-involving-trump-and-wire-service,,"WASHINGTON — A three-judge federal appeals panel grilled lawyers for a former White House official and The Associated Press Monday in a case that could significantly overhaul press access to the Oval Office and Air Force One.The two sides sparred over whether the president, in this case President Donald Trump, has sole discretion over which reporters can take part in the press pool in certain White House spaces, based on a journalist’s or their employer’s viewpoint.The dispute between the Trump administration and the AP erupted earlier this year after the wire service refused to use the term Gulf of America, designated by Trump, for the body of water the AP continued to call the Gulf of Mexico. Judges Robert L. Wilkins, Gregory G. Katsas and Neomi Rao, for the U.S. Appeals Court for the D.C. Circuit, poked holes in each side’s arguments on whether the First Amendment stops at the Oval Office doors or the tarmac outside Air Force One, and if the president can decide who’s included or excluded.The press pool is a small, rotating group of reporters, specified in advance, who travel with or attend events hosted by the president. They then send dispatches to hundreds of other journalists, and often publish quickly about the president’s activities.The Department of Justice’s Yaakov Roth argued that because of legal precedent, the administration cannot ban a larger group of “bona fide journalists” from using White House media passes to access the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room, where press secretary Karoline Leavitt and other administration officials take questions from reporters.However, he argued, the president is well within his bounds to exclude reporters from his “personal spaces,” including the Oval Office or Air Force One, which are strictly “by invitation only.”Katsas, appointed during Trump’s first administration, asked, “Do you really want a room-by-room, space-by-space, jurisprudence? It’s really about access to the president. Is it really different if an event is moved from the Oval Office to the Rose Garden?”“If the president did an event in the (Brady) briefing room, we wouldn’t be having the same argument,” replied Roth, principal deputy attorney general for the DOJ’s civil division.Wilkins, appointed in 2014 by President Barack Obama, pressed further and asked if the White House is permitted to “revoke” a journalist’s media pass.Roth answered that “viewpoint discrimination is not permitted” when issuing passes and opening up access to the Brady room.“The question here is does that carry over (to the Oval Office or Air Force One)? I think the answer to that is no,” Roth said.The Oval Office doorIn his opening statement, AP attorney Charles Tobin argued, “The First Amendment does not stop at the Oval Office door” and that a “system” has been established in which the president cannot ban a reporter from spaces where the press pool is permitted. For example, recent Cabinet meetings and Oval Office visits by foreign leaders have been open to the press pool.“If it’s a pooled event, then the president cannot pick and choose,” said Tobin, of the firm Ballard Spahr.Katsas pressed back, asking, “How does the president get to pick who will come to the Oval Office for (a private) event?”Tobin replied with the hypothetical example of Trump inviting conservative media personality Tucker Carlson for a one-on-one interview. “It’s not a pooled event,” he said.Tobin continued his argument that the pool system was established under President Dwight Eisenhower and has since become “a defined government program.”Rao responded skeptically to Tobin, “you’re resting your whole argument” on the White House not having any say over the pool who follows the president.“It’s not some fixed thing. It’s changed over time,” said Rao, who was appointed by President Joe Biden in 2019.“It’s a government program. It must be administered in a viewpoint neutral (manner),” Tobin replied.“Does the White House determine whether an event is a press pool event?” Katsas followed up.“They do that all the time, your honor. It’s a defined government program,” Tobin replied.Katsas pushed back: “If you win on that theory, then the next day the White House can stop designating events as pooled events.”Wire service banThe Associated Press sued the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Taylor Budowich and other press staff for banning the wire service from events in the Oval Office and other spaces after Trump disagreed with an editorial decision by the wire service.Shortly after Trump renamed the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America, the AP issued style guidance instructing journalists to continue using the body of water’s established name, but to add a note that the president had changed it on U.S. maps and government documents.The AP sets style standards for journalists across the industry.The case has been winding through the federal courts since February.Budowich left the administration in September.The White House began denying the AP entry to the Oval Office, East Room and other places on Feb. 11.Leavitt announced in late February that White House officials would take over pool rotation decisions from the White House Correspondents Association, a member organization that has self-governed journalist rotations and briefing seats placement since the Eisenhower administration.",,,,2025-11-24 15:56:54.504486

In August, WyoFile profiled a Cuban man being held in the Natrona County jail during a grueling imprisonment by ICE. A reporter recently caught up with the man, who is now in Mexico. 
The post From a Casper jail to an unknown land, a Cuban man’s deportation saga continues appeared first on WyoFile .","Josue Rodriguez Perez, a Cuban immigrant who spent 40 days in the Natrona County jail during his months-long imprisonment by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement, was deported to Mexico in September. 
Today, he is sharing an apartment in the seaside vacation destination of Cancun alongside other deported Cubans. But Rodriguez is on no vacation. The federal government cast him into Mexico, a nation to which he had no ties, and he has essentially become a man without a country. His legal status in Mexico is in question, the career he built as a commercial truck driver with a valid U.S. work permit is over and he is separated from his wife and family.
Sharpening that separation is Rodriguez’s inability to enter the United States, while his brother fights an aggressive cancer that has spread throughout his body, Rodriguez said during a recent phone interview with WyoFile.  
Rodriguez spends much of his days walking around in a foreign land, trying not to let his mind wander, he said. “Every day I feel sad,” he said, “it’s hard to think.” 
WyoFile profiled Rodriguez in late August during his time in the Natrona County Detention Center, where ICE deposited him while they tried to find a country that would take the Cuban immigrant.
ICE agents detained Rodriguez at a federal office in Miami when he went to renew a work permit that had allowed him to live and earn in the United States since 2017. Rodriguez and his father fled Cuba, where an authoritarian government squashes independent political activity, tightly controls the press and limits freedom of speech, in 1993 and were granted legal U.S. residency.
But after a tragic car accident upended Rodriguez’s life and led him down a path of addiction, the Cuban man went to a Louisiana state prison in 2012. The felony ruptured his legal residency, but since Cuba won’t accept most deportees from the U.S., a diplomatic antagonist, the federal government allowed Rodriguez to stay. 
He served his sentence and emerged from prison reformed. He married and became a truck driver who criss-crossed his adopted country. He has not been charged with any new crimes. 
President Donald Trump’s second administration upended that life. Though the Trump administration says it’s targeting undocumented immigrants who are committing crimes and are public safety threats, the federal government has, in reality, been seeking to deport broad swathes of immigrants, including by changing laws and policies to categorize some groups in the country legally as subject to deportation. 
Unlike past presidents, Trump wants to deport people to third-party countries like Mexico. When Rodriguez showed up to renew his work permit, he was detained and moved around the country in shackles, in what seemed to him like cruel randomness. He spent time at ICE detention centers in Florida and Texas before landing in Aurora, Colorado, and then Casper’s jail. 
He does not remember his long stay there fondly. “That was hell for me,” Rodriguez said. 
ICE brought Rodriguez to the Natrona County jail on July 18 as part of a group of more than 40 detained immigrants. As of Friday morning, 12 of those people remained incarcerated there, four months later. 
Fearing interminable imprisonment, Rodriguez signed an agreement allowing him to be deported to a third country — but for weeks, the federal government seemed unable to find a place to send him.

He never went before an immigration judge during his detainment, he told WyoFile. In June, the United States Supreme Court overruled a lower federal judge and allowed the Trump administration to pursue third-country deportations. The high court’s decision came via its emergency, or “shadow,” docket, through which the court issues brief, often unexplained orders on requests from the president for legal permission to proceed with a policy despite unresolved legal challenges. 
In late August, as WyoFile was preparing to publish a story about Rodriguez’s imprisonment, ICE moved him and other Cuban detainees again, this time to El Paso, Texas. On Sept. 9, he was taken across the Mexican border. Rodriguez described a harrowing journey, including two men on his bus into Mexico who refused to get off in the strange new land and were beaten by a security contractor. 
There were kind guards, too, Rodriguez said. He remembered one guard in Aurora, an employee of the private prison company GAO, who told Rodriguez he had already served his time for the crimes he committed in 2012 and did not deserve to be in prison again. 
After months in the hands of ICE, Rodriguez described his reception by Mexican authorities as welcoming, and a deep relief. He got a hot meal and a hot shower. Though he stayed in a jail cell, the door was unlocked. But then, he was released into Mexico, without a passport or identification. Instead, he was provided t a piece of paper that gave him 10 days in the country. He still has not been able to secure an identification. 
Rodriguez and the other Cubans who made their way to Cancun faced exorbitant prices from locals capitalizing on the influx of confused strangers arriving in their country. Amnesty International has decried third-country deportation as a denial of due process and a human rights abuse that is placing people in unsafe conditions. The human rights organization reported in September that the U.S. has deported more than 5,700 non-Mexicans to that country this year. 
At one point, Rodriguez said, he and his now roommates were defrauded out of $2,000, money mostly sent by relatives they had left behind in the United States, as they tried to find housing. 
His wife has visited him in Mexico, and they spent four days and nights together, he said. But she is employed in the U.S., and it’s not realistic for her to uproot to Mexico and be with him more permanently. 
“It’s hard to think that we’re not going to be together anymore,” he said. The sharper pain today, he said, is the fear that he won’t get a chance to see his brother alive. Rodriguez, for now, is trying to figure out where he can safely stay in the long term and what he will do for work. He is buoyed in part by fellowship with his roommates, the other displaced Cubans. “We take care of each other,” he said, “we respect each other and we love each other.”
He has dim hopes of being able to return to the United States. The big rig truck he sunk tens of thousands of dollars into has been repossessed by the bank he had taken a loan from to start his career, he said. 
Perhaps the president who follows Trump will “want to make up for what Trump did,” Rodriguez said. It’s his best hope for a legal pathway back to Florida and his family, he said. “We were good,” he said of himself and other Cubans in his situation. “We were working, we were paying taxes, we were helping.”

A 30-year-old political newcomer, who acknowledges that he’s skipped voting in past Republican primaries, entered the GOP primary for governor Monday by comparing the President Donald Trump-endorsed candidate Byron Donalds, who is Black, to a “slave.”
James Fishback met with reporters shortly after filing his paperwork and tore into Donalds, a U.S. representative from Naples, as someone beholden to corporate interests, including those in the tech sector. 
He called Donalds — who could become Florida’s first Black governor — a “slave” and spotlighted his arrests when he was a college student more than 20 years ago.
“Bryon Donalds is a slave. He is a slave to his donors. He is a slave to the corporate interests, to the tech bros that want to run our state into, in his own words, a financial capital,” said Fishback, an investment firm founder and the son of a bus driver. He lives in Madison.
“Why not be an agricultural capital? Why not be a farming capital? Why not be a citrus capital? Again, why do we have to become a financial capital? He wants turn Florida into Dubai, Singapore, or Hong King. We like Florida just the way it is.”
Fishback runs Azoria Capital, which made news recently when two of its exchange-traded funds were liquidated following a lawsuit against Fishback by his former employer, Greenlight Capital. 
A fourth-generation Floridian who grew up in south Florida, Fishback shone a spotlight on the differences between himself and Donalds, a transplant from Brooklyn, New York, who came to Tallahassee to attend college.
Fishback accused Donalds of spending the past week in Washington, D.C., meeting with “tech bros” and promising to speed up construction of artificial intelligence data centers and quantum computing in Florida. By contrast, Fishback promised that as governor he would “cancel and stop the construction of any AI data center.”
“I have yet to find a Floridian, whether it’s in Marianna, Miami, Pensacola, or Pahokee, who has pulled me aside and said, ‘Please work with Byron Donalds to speed up the data centers. We want our water supply to be intoxicated [sic]. We want to pay double for our electric bills,” Fishback said.

In addition, Fishback’s platform includes clamping down on Blackstone Inc. and Airbnb’s Florida homebuying; abolishing homestead property taxes across Florida; and eliminating the use of H-1B visas. Those go to overseas candidates with college degrees who don’t intend to immigrate permanently but could take highly skilled positions that U.S. companies struggle to fill. 
Gov. Ron DeSantis last month said the Board of Governors should fully “pull the plug” on the visas.

“I’m going to completely and totally end the H-1B scam. The H-1B scale and the corresponding alphabet letter soup of immigration visas allows foreigners from India, China, anywhere in the world to come here and to steal jobs from qualified Floridians. That ends on Day One,” Fishback said.
He promised to build upon the governor’s immigration enforcement efforts and work “hand in hand with President Trump “to ramp up mass deportations.” Fishback alleged there are 1.4 million people illegally in Florida “occupying homes that Floridians could occupy and they need to leave.”

Fishback focused on what he called his affordability agenda but also took repeated shots at Donalds, highlighting a 1997 marijuana charge that was dismissed as part of a pre-trial diversion program and a bribery charge in 2000 that was later expunged from his record.
“It was right here in Leon County that he was arrested and charged with selling marijuana and it was right here in Leon County where he was arrested and charged for bribery. So, I’m sorry. Byron Donalds is utterly disqualified. The people of Florida know that. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be losing in the polls to undecided even though he’s been in the race now for nine months,” Fishback said. 
Fishback referenced a poll from The American Promise that shows 43% of 800 respondents support Donalds, while half of those polled, 51%, remains undecided. 
(Fishback drew less than 1% support in the poll of 800 respondents conducted Nov. 17-19. Former House Speaker Paul Renner had 2% support and Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who has not announced his candidacy, had 1% support.)
“You know what that tells me? Floridians are hungry,” Fishback said, “and Floridians want a real fighter. They want a fighter like President Trump, like Gov. DeSantis, who’s not going to make excuses.”
Fishback called Trump the “greatest president in U.S. history” and said he still hopes to earn Trump’s support in the August 2026 Republican primary, as well as the support of Gov. DeSantis, who will be term limited out of office, and First Lady Casey DeSantis.
Ryan Smith, chief strategist for the Byron Donalds for Governor Campaign, dismissed Fishback’s assertions that Donalds won’t win.
“Byron Donalds will be Florida’s next governor because he is the proven conservative fighter endorsed by President Trump. Anyone running against him is an anti Trump RINO [Republican in name only] and will get crushed in the Republican primary,” Smith said in a text to the Florida Phoenix.
Fishback’s Monday press conference came as a news report surfaced that he unsuccessfully pressed the Trump administration for an appointment on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.

(Photo by Russ Taylor/National Park Service)Alaska commercial fishers caught much more salmon in 2025 than they did last year, but the money they earned was modest, according to the statewide harvest report.
The state commercial salmon haul totaled 194.8 million fish, the 12th largest since 1985, according to the Alaska Department of Fish and Game’s preliminary annual summary, released this month.
Measured in pounds, the 2025 harvest was about average compared to the last 40 years the agency has been keeping an all-species record, the Fish and Game summary said.
But the amount of money paid to harvesters delivering their fish – known as ex-vessel value – was the 13th lowest since 1975, when adjusted for inflation. This year’s total was $541 million, the department said.

This year’s totals represent a big improvement from last year, when only 101.2 million salmon were harvested. It was the third lowest haul since 1985 and the ex-vessel value was $304 million, the third lowest since 1975 when adjusted for inflation. In weight, the 2024 harvest totaled 450 million pounds, the lowest on record.
Alaska salmon, particularly Chinook, have been shrinking in size over the past decades, a trend that scientists attribute to a variety of factors, including climate change and ocean conditions.
This year, sockeye salmon accounted for the most value among Alaska’s five salmon species, continuing the long-term pattern in the industry. A little over a quarter of the landed fish were sockeye, but they made up 58% of the value, according to the Department of Fish and Game’s summary.
Pink salmon, the most plentiful and cheapest of the Alaska species, made up 61% of the total fish harvested and 21% of the total ex-value. The pink salmon harvest was about 14% less than expected at the start of the season, the department said.
At the other end of the volume spectrum, the statewide Chinook harvest, which accounted for only 181,892 of the 194.8 million total, was 26% higher than predicted in the preseason forecast, the department said.
Chum salmon accounted for 10% of the harvest and coho accounted for 1%, the department said.
The harvest totals are preliminary and subject to revision as more information is received, the department said.

Mark Kelly after he appears in video blasted by Trump,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-investigates-arizona-sen-mark-kelly-after-he-appears-video-blasted-trump,,"WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense announced on social media Monday it's looking into “serious allegations of misconduct” against Arizona Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, one of several lawmakers who posted a video last week telling military members they are not required to follow orders that violate the law. The video spurred anger from President Donald Trump, who posted, also on social media, that he believed the video from six Democratic lawmakers represented “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”The claim led to safety concerns on Capitol Hill, especially after a year that included numerous acts of violence against lawmakers and key political figures. The Defense Department announcement didn’t detail exactly how Kelly may have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice but stated that “a thorough review of these allegations has been initiated to determine further actions, which may include recall to active duty for court-martial proceedings or administrative measures.” It was unclear how the military review and threat of court-martial proceedings would fit with the constitutional protections held by members of Congress for speech and debate.Kelly wrote in a statement the Defense Department’s post was the first time he’d heard about the inquiry. “If this is meant to intimidate me and other members of Congress from doing our jobs and holding this administration accountable, it won’t work,” Kelly wrote. “I’ve given too much to this country to be silenced by bullies who care more about their own power than protecting the Constitution.”Kelly military backgroundKelly served as an aviator in the United States Navy from 1987 until 2012. He was deployed as part of Operation Desert Storm during the first Gulf War. He received several awards throughout his military career, including the Legion of Merit and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Kelly reached the rank of captain before his retirement from military service. Kelly, who was also a NASA astronaut, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in November 2020. The Defense Department’s post announcing an investigation into Kelly said military officials wanted to remind people that “military retirees remain subject to the UCMJ for applicable offenses, and federal laws such as 18 U.S.C. § 2387 prohibit actions intended to interfere with the loyalty, morale, or good order and discipline of the armed forces.”The statement added that all service members “have a legal obligation under the UCMJ to obey lawful orders and that orders are presumed to be lawful.  A servicemember’s personal philosophy does not justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise lawful order.”The statement appeared somewhat similar to the one Kelly, Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin, Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, Pennsylvania Reps. Chris Deluzio and Chrissy Houlahan, and New Hampshire Rep. Maggie Goodlander gave in the video they published Nov 18. The Democrats, all of whom served in the military or worked in intelligence agencies, said they wanted “to speak directly to members of the military and the intelligence community who take risks each day to keep Americans safe.”They said that Americans in those institutions “can” and “must refuse illegal orders.”“No one has to carry out orders that violate the law or our Constitution. We know this is hard and that it’s a difficult time to be a public servant,” they said. “But whether you’re serving in the CIA, in the Army, or Navy, or the Air Force, your vigilance is critical.”Broad constitutional protections for CongressMembers of Congress are broadly protected under the speech and debate clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that unless a lawmaker is involved in treason, felony and breach of the peace, they are “privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.”The annotated explanation of the clause on Congress’ official website says the Supreme Court has “broadly” interpreted its applications over the years to ensure an independent legislative branch. “Despite uncertainty at the margins, it is well established that the Clause serves to secure the independence of the federal legislature by providing Members of Congress and their aides with immunity from criminal prosecutions or civil suits that stem from acts taken within the legislative sphere,” it states. “As succinctly described by the Court, the Clause’s immunity from liability applies ‘even though their conduct, if performed in other than legislative contexts, would in itself be unconstitutional or otherwise contrary to criminal or civil statutes.’ This general immunity principle forms the core of the protections afforded by the Clause.”A report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service states the judiciary’s “immunity principle protects Members from ‘intimidation by the executive’ or a ‘hostile judiciary’ by prohibiting both the executive and judicial powers from being used to improperly influence or harass legislators.”",,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)About three dozen protestors rallied outside the Kentucky Capitol Annex Monday to call on lawmakers to support food and health care assistance for low-wage workers and people in poverty.
The “Moral Monday” protest was part of events held across 16 states by Repairers of the Breach, a national organization that focuses on social justice. In Frankfort, those who attended the protest held signs focusing on Kentuckians who are at risk of losing Medicaid coverage and SNAP, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, benefits as a result of the Republican-backed spending bill approved by Congress earlier this year. 
Speakers included faith leaders from around Kentucky. At the end of the event, the protestors dropped off letters to state lawmakers and planned to follow up with emails and phone calls. 
While legislators are not currently meeting, the Kentucky General Assembly will reconvene in January. Lawmakers must then decide the next two-year state budget, including how to fund various programs and resources. 
Sandra Scott, a leader with VOCAL-KY, said she and others attended the rally to raise awareness about the cuts to SNAP and Medicaid. 
“We are all equal. Let them walk a day in our shoes and see how much they keep cutting all these benefits that are helping to protect us,” Scott said of politicians who supported the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Pastor Rich Gianzero, the incoming executive director of the Kentucky Council of Churches, said, “we have an unjust and unrighteous situation going on in the country right now and in the commonwealth.” Asked what kind of message he hoped lawmakers took away from the protest, Gianzero said they should stop “the obsession with the culture wars” and focus on solutions to help people who are experiencing poverty in Kentucky. 
“For so many legislators here in the Capitol who go to church or will quote a Bible — and in January, they’re going to quote Martin Luther King Jr. — and I’m asking myself and asking them to start doing the things that Jesus of Nazareth and Martin Luther King Jr. talked about,” Gianzero said. “Take action. Be about something.” 
Gianzero encouraged Kentuckians to “pay attention” to elected officials at the state and local levels “and speak out if you are troubled or bothered by different things you’re seeing or hearing.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5440-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

In 2016, anti-LGBTQ+ extremists broke into the apartment of Bangladesh’s only LGBTQ+ magazine editor, Xulhaz Mannan, and murdered him and friend Mahbub Rabbi Tonoy. Tara Asgar was there, but she managed to escape.
She needed to get out of Bangladesh.
“I was a queer, gender-nonconforming person with no institutional protection, navigating state systems that were openly hostile toward people like me,” Asgar said. “Leaving Bangladesh became less a decision and more a fight for survival.”
It was three difficult months before Asgar got a one-year visa to the United States. She fled to Maine. The move was complicated. It likely saved her life, but she was entering a country on the brink of electing Donald Trump after a presidential campaign based on hostility to immigrants, one that was starting to debate if transgender and gender-nonconforming people should be allowed in public spaces.
“The American discourse around trans rights was fracturing along partisan lines; visibility was increasing at the same time as backlash,” said Asgar. “This country is not a uniform ‘safe haven’ for queer or trans people. It is a place where safety is uneven and always entangled with race, class, immigration status, and geography. Visibility here carries its own risks.”
Accurate historical data on LGBTQ+ immigrants is scarce. Today, it is estimated that approximately 1.3 million queer immigrants live in the United States, and that 3 percent of all immigrants identify as LGBTQ+.
But immigrating to the United States as an LGBTQ+ person has never been easy. In fact, for most of American history, officials have used sexual orientation and gender identity to exclude large swaths of migrants.
The official ban on LGBTQ+ people migrating to the United States was struck down 35 years ago this month. But LGBTQ+ people remained largely blocked for the next four years due to homophobic laws and policy, according to Karma Chávez, professor of Mexican American and Latina/o Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. Still, many LGBTQ+ people have held up the United States as a beacon of hope, regardless of anti-gay laws.
“You know, I think people find things are very different when they get here, but the idea of a certain kind of freedom that Americans supposedly enjoy looms large,”  Chávez said.
Tracing exactly how long the United States has blocked LGBTQ+ migration is a little trickier, she said. That’s partly because the laws preventing queer immigration were not explicit. Moreover, immigration officials have long relied on LGBTQ+ stereotypes in determining if an applicant is queer, say experts, making it hard to determine if a person who is not allowed into the country truly identifies that way or has just been perceived as such by officials.
 The 1800s

Many experts say the first attempt to block LGBTQ+ people came in 1875 with the Page Law. The Page Law barred women deemed “undesirable,” such as convicts and laborers, and specifically targeted Asian women.
“A big part of the restrictions in the Page Law was to keep out ‘sexually promiscuous’ Asian women who were likely to become public charges because they didn’t have men to take care of them, and then they were going to engage in deviant behavior to survive,” Chávez said.
Though not specifically about LGBTQ+ people, language that was sexually specific was seen as the first snag that might catch LGBTQ+ immigrants trying to enter the country.
 Through the 1980s

The Immigration Act of 1917 barred “people with abnormal sexual instincts,” a convoluted way of saying gay and lesbian people. Chávez and others said this was the first law that directly targeted sexual minorities.
The government would more strongly reiterate these views in 1952 during the Cold War with the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to Aaron Morris, executive director at Immigration Equality, a nonprofit that fights for LGBTQ+ immigrants.
“Thinking about 1952 and where America was at the time, fast forward to 1965 when we’re looking at the civil rights movement, the gay liberation movement, women’s movements, there’s a lot happening in the 60s, and then the law becomes much more focused to ban people who are suffering from ‘sexual deviation,’” Morris said.
Queer people were again barred entry in 1965 by the Immigration Reform Act as “aliens afflicted with sexual deviation.” But 1972 brought relief because the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders.
By 1980, the United States was finally ready to change its rules when it came to LGBTQ+ immigrants
Two things happened that year. The first was that the Refugee Act expanded the legal definition of refugee to include people being persecuted because they were part of a protected group. This did not explicitly include queer people, although some would argue that it should. The other thing that happened was the Mariel boatlift, a mass migration of 125,000 Cuban asylum seekers to the United States.
“Many of the people that came were transsexuals, homosexuals, people who would be considered sexual deviants,” Chávez said. “In the U.S., we sort of opened the flood gates, really testing out our core Cold War values when it comes to asylum.”
The LGBTQ+ people who won asylum from the crisis got asylum based on their persecution by the Communist Party, not their sexual orientation or gender identity, Chávez said.
“But this [claim of asylum based on being LGBTQ+] begins to get tested in a bit more formal sense throughout the 80s,” said Chávez. “And there are some cases of people who do attempt it.”
The results were mixed, with some prevailing and others failing.
 Lifting the ban

The Immigration Act of 1990, signed into law by President George H. W. Bush, would mark the most significant stride for LGBTQ+ immigrants yet. The law officially repealed the ban on queer migrants. But it fell short of allowing most queer people to seek safety within the United States, noted Jenny Pizer, senior attorney at Lambda Legal.
That’s because the law required that family sponsors be related by blood or marriage, something many queer families didn’t have.
“Allowing a lot more people to come as immigrants was not helpful to members of our community with a relation where the family relationship required marriage,” said Pizer.
 The cases that made the law

That same year, the Board of Immigration Appeal awarded humanitarian protection to a man by the name of Fidel Armando Toboso-Alfonso, who faced abuse in his native Cuba for being gay.
Four years later, in 1994, Attorney General Janet Reno issued an order stating that his case set a precedent. From that moment on, the order said, a person who had been persecuted by their government for being homosexual may be eligible for asylum in the United States. That opened the door for LGBTQ+ people to immigrate to the United States and seek asylum.
Three years later, another watershed moment came in the case of Pitcherskaia v. INS. Alla Konstantinova Pitcherskaia sought asylum relief in the United States after Russian authorities tried to “cure” her of being a lesbian using electric shock therapies. Though the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed that the shock treatments were meant to “cure” her, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed that decision and Pitcherskaia prevailed in her claim.
Another precedent-setting case came in 2000 when Geovanni Hernandez-Montiel, a 21-year-old gay man from Mexico, won his asylum claim in the United States, bolstering similar claims by other LGBTQ+ immigrants. Still, it would be another 15 years before the Supreme Court affirmed marriage equality in 2015, allowing queer spouses to sponsor each other for immigration purposes.
For transgender immigrants, the journey to legal entry in the United States was more complicated.
As Morris put it, “the Board of Immigration Appeals, which was doing more marriage-based stuff, was having a hard time deciding when someone was in a same-sex marriage or was in a different gender marriage,” Morris said.
The board’s first solution was to effectively ban transgender people from claiming asylum in the United States, Morris said. Asylum lawyers countered, saying the ban was discriminatory and overly broad. The board struck down the ban in 2004, although a policy allowing trans people to legally enter the country didn’t take effect until 2007.
It took, however, four more years for the United States to remove its mandate that trans migrants get gender-affirming surgery before migrating in their lived gender or sponsor opposite-gender spouses.
 The reality now

Today, LGBTQ+ people enjoy marriage equality and other federal benefits, but some worry that those laws face challenges in the courts, imperiling queer immigration rights.
In a recent opinion piece in Time, Fernando Chang-Muy, a professor at Pennsylvania Carey Law School , and high school senior Sebastian Irausquin-Petit argued that the country has abdicated its responsibility to queer asylum seekers by pursuing homophobic and transphobic policies under the Trump administration.
The authors point out that Trump ordered transgender and nonbinary identities erased from federal documents.
“Because the asylum process demands consistency across forms, nonbinary refugees now face an impossible choice: misrepresent themselves on paper or risk rejection for ‘inconsistency,’” they wrote.
Asgar still lives in that reality. Nearly 10 years after immigrating, she is still waiting for an asylum interview.
“Outside the U.S., there is a persistent belief that being queer or trans can act as a kind of exceptional category, that transness itself fast-tracks one’s journey to citizenship,” she said.
But being an immigrant has been like a second closet for her, one where she must prove over and over again that her story is tragic enough to earn her entry into the United States.
“As a trans migrant, my body is already a site of border-crossing: between genders, between cultures, between systems of recognition and misrecognition,” she said. “For me, the experience of being a trans migrant is shaped by this tension, between the freedoms I chase and the limits I confront, between the borders that confine me and the borderless kinship I come from.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/conversion-therapy-SCOTUS.jpg,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — A maternal and infant health advocacy group ranked Oklahoma low in several categories on an annual state scorecard that measures access and outcomes for perinatal health care.
March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on research and advocacy for maternal and infant health, ranked Oklahoma as 46th in infant mortality, with 341 babies dying before their first birthday in 2023. 
This rate is 1.7 times higher in Oklahoma for babies born to Black mothers. 
Leading causes of infant deaths include birth defects, low birth and preterm birth weights, sudden unexpected infant death and accidents, according to the report. 
The state ranks 31st for maternal mortality, with more than 27 births per 1,000 resulting in the death of the mother within six weeks of the pregnancy ending due to complications related to the pregnancy or childbirth. 
Oklahoma is one of 12 states with no change from last year in preterm births, but still ranks 37th in the U.S. in this category. The state’s preterm birth rate was stagnant at 11%.
Oklahoma is one of 16 states to receive a “D”. Eight states and Puerto Rico received an “F.” 
The United States overall received a “D+” grade, according to the national report card. 
Oklahoma City, with an 11.2% rate of preterm births, was given a “D-” and Tulsa had an “F” with an 11.9% rate. 
Over 14% of births received inadequate prenatal care, meaning mothers began seeking prenatal care at their fifth month of pregnancy or had less than half of the appropriate number of health care visits. 
Nearly 50% of births in Oklahoma, about 23,700 in 2024, were covered by SoonerCare, the state’s Medicaid program. 
The report found that Oklahoma is currently implementing most of the “supportive maternal and infant health initiatives” recommended by March of Dimes to improve outcomes. 
The adopted policies include expansion of Medicaid and Medicare, reimbursing doula care with Medicaid and using a state level maternal mortality review committee. 
Requiring employers to offer paid family leave and requiring providers to screen Medicaid-insured patients for postpartum depression are policies the group recommends that Oklahoma has not adopted.

Marjorie Taylor Greene retirement launches speculation about congressional pensions,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-retirement-launches-speculation-about-congressional-pensions,,"WASHINGTON — Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s upcoming resignation from Congress set off a series of questions and misinformation about what health care and pension benefits lawmakers receive once they leave public service. The system is a bit complex and determined by when a lawmaker entered Congress as well as how long they stayed. Members must serve at least five years, putting Greene just over the eligibility line when she officially steps aside in January. Members of Congress elected after 1984 are covered under the Federal Employees’ Retirement System. The four House lawmakers and one senator elected before then may be under the Civil Service Retirement System, so their benefit may be calculated differently than that of their colleagues.  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service explains in a report about lawmakers’ retirement benefits that “pensions, like those of other federal employees, are financed through a combination of employee and employer contributions.” “Under both CSRS and FERS, Members of Congress are eligible for a pension at the age of 62 if they have completed at least 5 years of service,” the report states. “Members are eligible for a pension at age 50 if they have completed 20 years of service, or at any age after completing 25 years of service. The amount of the pension depends on length of service (as measured in months) and the average of the highest three years of salary. By law, the starting amount of a Member’s retirement annuity may not exceed 80% of his or her final salary.”All members also must pay into Social Security, and how much in taxes they pay and benefits they receive are the same as for all beneficiaries.Members of Congress, except for leadership, are paid $174,000 a year.Greene, who began her congressional career on Jan. 3, 2021, will be just over the five-year requirement when she formally resigns on Jan. 5. Greene will receive about $8,700 in pension benefits per year for the rest of her life, after she turns 62. She is now 51.Former U.S. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was first sworn in on June 2, 1987, after winning a special election, will receive considerably more in pension benefits given that she was a member for decades longer than Greene and had a higher salary during her time in leadership. The National Taxpayers Union Foundation expects Pelosi will receive an annual pension of $107,860 after she retires in January 2027. Health insurance benefitsMembers of Congress who retire or resign are eligible to purchase health insurance from the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program as long as they had health insurance from the District of Columbia’s Affordable Care Act marketplace “for the five years of service immediately prior to retirement,” according to a different CRS report. While in Congress, lawmakers are eligible to have some of their health coverage offset by their employer — the federal government — as long as they purchase it through the D.C. marketplace, known as DC Health Link. Like others in the states, it was created by the Affordable Care Act.As with group health insurance plans, the amount subsidized by the federal government depends on whether a lawmaker selects a health plan that covers themselves or themselves plus eligible family members.",,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Energy has been playing keepaway with its customers on prospective bill discounts: proffered, then abruptly pulled away. 
But ratepayers can at last secure possession of alternative cost savings approved by state regulators Monday. 
The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission’s unanimous decision dips into existing pots of money from utility customer charges for energy efficiency and storm preparedness measures, while temporarily suspending those same charges from customers’ electric bills for the first three months of the year. The end result is an estimated $32 in monthly savings from January to March for electric customers, based on the average residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, according to calculations submitted by Rhode Island Energy.
“The combination of the credits and rate reductions are intended to align with Gov. McKee’s laser-focused effort to encourage rate relief for Rhode Islanders for this winter,” Ronald Gerwatowski, commission chairman, said during the meeting.
The three-member utility panel first sought public feedback in July on how to mitigate the winter spikes in electricity prices amid growing fury from lawmakers, community advocates and residents struggling to afford rising winter bills. 
The same day the commission published its notice seeking ideas, Rhode Island Energy executives unveiled its own discount plan. Credits to customers were required by state regulators under the 2022 sale of state gas and electric operations from National Grid to Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, PPL Corp. But company executives and Gov. Dan McKee hatched a plan to speed up and concentrate the credits over the next two winters, rather than dispersing smaller discounts over a much longer period of time.
The proposal would have slashed customers’ electric bills by $20 to $30 per month, and cut gas bills by $40 to $50 per month, from January to March 2026 and again in the same three months of 2027 — the coldest and most expensive time of year. 
But on Nov. 14, the day before a hearing on its proposal, Rhode Island Energy yanked the plan, citing “unexpected and unwarranted opposition.” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office accused the company of “lowballing” its customers by undervaluing the mandatory discounts, while state utility regulators demanded more information. 
The sudden withdrawal put the prospect of rate relief in limbo, with McKee blasting the company’s about-face as “flat-out unacceptable.”
McKee maintained that Rhode Island Energy’s plan was better because it extended the discounts for two winters, not one, and also helped with gas bills. And the best solution would have been both for both discount plans to advance simultaneously.
“That is what should have happened to provide broader and more significant relief to Rhode Islanders,” McKee said in an emailed response Monday.

‘Sizable’ rate hikes loom
Rhode Island Energy will still have to fulfill the state-imposed requirement to credit customers for tax and accounting changes tied to the 2022 sale, referred to as the “hold harmless” proposal. Company representatives signaled in a hearing last week they intend to file an alternative plan by early next year, which Gerwatowski saw as fortuitous timing given what he expects will be a “sizeable” rise in gas and electric bills next year. 
That’s because Rhode Island Energy can finally request an increase in the amount of money it collects from customers to support its distribution costs and services following a three-year moratorium. PPL agreed not to ask for a rate base increase until 2026 as a condition of the acquisition in 2022. This is separate from usage rates, which are determined directly by prices set by third-party suppliers.
The company is expected to submit its proposal to increase revenues by the end of the year. New rates, if approved, would take effect in September 2026 – the first time since 2019, when the utilities were under National Grid’s ownership. 
“I am very worried about the rise of electric and gas rates,” Gerwatoski said. “A renewed, revised hold harmless proposal would prove a valuable tool in the regulatory toolbox as we look to avoid or lower the impact of rising electric and gas rates in the fall of 2026.”










The combination of the credits and rate reductions are intended to align with Gov. McKee’s laser-focused effort to encourage rate relief for Rhode Islanders for this winter. 


– Ronald Gerwatoski, chairman of the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission


Michael Dalo, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, confirmed that the company will submit its rate review proposal “in the near future,” but declined to provide specifics.
“We are committed to providing safe, reliable, and affordable service to our Rhode Island customers,” Dalo said in an emailed response on Monday.
McKee also pledged to make lower utility costs part of his fiscal 2027 budget proposal, which will be unveiled in January.
In the meantime, alternative discounts will more than offset the seasonal spike in winter electricity prices, which rose 16% as of Oct. 1. Jennifer Wood, executive director at the Rhode Island Center for Justice, stressed the need for immediate relief for low-income families reeling from temporary suspension of federal food assistance and other social safety nets during the government shutdown.
“Funding one-time bill credits from existing sources in the winter of 2025-26 to mitigate the exceptional harm being experienced by the most vulnerable Rhode Islanders in the aftermath of the longest government shutdown in the nation’s history is an appropriate exercise of the PUC’s police power to protect the public good,” Wood wrote in a Nov. 17 letter to utility regulators.”
Authority in question
The Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, the administrative arm to the politically appointed commission, did not agree. The division argued the commission lacked the legal authority to dip into funds meant to support energy efficiency programs and storm preparedness and recovery.
“It seems clear that the Commission may certainly review the Company’s administration and implementation of the energy efficiency program and its funding,” Margaret Hogan, an attorney for the Division, wrote in a Nov. 17 filing. “However, no statute authorizes the Commission to reach in and access the funds for residential electric bill credits.”
Hogan noted that depleting the funds, and simultaneously suspending the customer charges that fund the programs for the first three months of 2026, will not save ratepayers in the long term because the charges will need to be increased later on to make up for the lost money. She also referred to the environmental consequences of draining funds meant to help with home weatherization, energy efficiency upgrades and other measures necessary to meet Rhode Island’s decarbonization mandates. 
A spokesperson for the Division did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.
Similar criticisms followed in Massachusetts earlier this year after the Commonwealth’s utility regulators forced natural gas companies to temporarily suspend delivery feeds for energy efficiency programs and capital infrastructure improvements to lower customers’ bills.
Gerwatowski did not address potential environmental consequences Monday, but rebuffed questions over the commission’s authority. Rhode Island Energy has not challenged the panel’s power to tap into its funding, instead signaling support for the plan. 
“No credit is perfect but I think the approach you described is in a long line of commission decisions that prioritize customer relief,” Commissioner Abigail Anthony said Monday.
The commission recently approved a separate proposal that offered $64 million in refunds to Rhode Island Energy natural gas customers starting Nov. 1.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A Rhode Island federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from dismantling four congressionally-created agencies that fund cultural institutions, aid minority-owned businesses, mediate labor disputes, and fight homelessness.
In a permanent injunction issued Friday, Rhode Island U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. wrote that President Donald Trump exceeded his constitutional authority when trying to lay off nearly all of the workers from those agencies.
“By now, the question presented in this case is a familiar one: May the executive branch undertake such actions in circumvention of the will of the legislative branch?” McConnell, an Obama appointee, wrote. “In recent months, this court — along with other courts across the country — has concluded that it may not. That answer remains the same here.”
Trump in March issued an executive order calling for the elimination “to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law,” of seven government entities. That included four mandated by Congress: the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Minority Business Development Agency, the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services, and the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha along with Democratic attorneys general from 21 other states sued the administration in April arguing that the order violated the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by attempting to override Congress.
The two other lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Attorney General Letitia James of New York and Attorney General Anne Lopez of Hawaii. Joining the lawsuit were attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Neronha on Friday celebrated McConnell’s final ruling.
“In courts across the country and here in Rhode Island, we continue to find that we are right on the law and right on the principle,” he said in a statement. “Each of these agencies serve a vital role that the president cannot simply erase with the stroke of a pen.”
White House spokesperson Kush Desai Monday said in an emailed statement to Rhode Island Current that the Trump administration “will continue using the full powers of the executive branch to prevent government waste” and that officials look forward to “ultimate victory” in court on the matter. But Desai did not say the administration would appeal the ruling.
“The president has a duty to ensure that American tax dollars are not being wasted or spent on illegal or unconstitutional programs,” Desai said.
It’s the same argument attorneys for the administration had tried to make in Providence court, stating in filings there was no particular statute limiting an agency’s discretion to make independent staffing decisions.
McConnell contended that the decision to eliminate agency programs, terminate grants, and implement large-scale staff reductions undermined their ability to perform functions as mandated by Congress.
“This is clearly not an action committed to agency discretion by law, and many courts have reached the same conclusion in similar cases,” he wrote.
Federal attorneys also tried to make the case that plaintiff states had failed to demonstrate any irreparable harm they would face should the court fail to intervene. At most, the Trump administration argued that state issues amounted to contract disputes .
McConnell pointed to the evidence submitted by the 21 states as proof that the dismantling of agency duties will have a significant impact.
New Mexico, New Jersey, Maine, and Oregon said in court documents that their public libraries would have to close branches, implement hiring freezes, and stop providing services that aim to foster literacy and support learning if the Institute of Museum and Library Service was dismantled.
Rhode Island’s Office of Library and Information Services received nearly $1.5 million from the institute in 2024 — funding that supported 50 percent of its staff, according to an April statement from Neronha’s office.
Without funding from the Minority Business Development Agency, plaintiffs had argued state universities in Hawaii, Maryland and Arizona would have to eliminate their student programming, default on contracts, and fire many of their employees.
Michigan, New York and Wisconsin all claimed their research into helping unhoused communities would come to a halt without assistance from the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness.
Without federal meditators, McConnell wrote that Rhode Island, Illinois and Minnesota face the very real prospect of strikes and negotiation impasses should they be unable to tap into Federal Mediation and Conciliation Services.
At the time the lawsuit was filed, Neronha’s office noted the Rhode Island Department of Children Youth and Families avoided a strike from one of its unions because of federal mediation.
“All this to say: The injuries alleged are to the states themselves and are far more than merely economic or speculative,” McConnell wrote.

(Photo by BetterPhoto/iStock/Getty Images)While the text of the Iowa Constitution lacks the prominence of that adopted by our nation’s Founding Fathers, people from Ackley to Zwingle and points in between should track down a copy and give it a read.
Buried away in the document adopted by Iowa voters in 1857, they will find Article III, Section 31, or what has come to be known as the public purpose requirement. That section says, in essence, that state and local governments are barred from spending public money unless there is a public purpose for those expenditures.
My public-school education tells me that section prohibits the use of taxpayer money to continue to pay someone for work after their performance ends unless the government entity provides justification of the public purpose served by those payments.
Where I come from, going-away gifts do not serve a public purpose. And this brings me to the Des Moines Public Schools and last week’s news headlines.
On Nov. 18, the school board convened a closed session. The purpose, its agenda stated, was “to evaluate the professional competency of an individual whose appointment, hiring, performance or discharge is being considered when necessary to prevent needless and irreparable injury to that person’s reputation.”
At the conclusion of that private discussion, the board voted to accept the already-tendered resignation of Robert Lundin, the district’s chief academic officer, effective June 30, 2026.
Lundin was a “strategic consultant” before joining the Des Moines schools in May 2024. For reasons it never been made public, the district placed him on paid administrative leave last Oct. 6. He has not worked since then.
As part of a “separation agreement” that was made public the day after the board “evaluated” Lundin and accepted his resignation last week, the public learned his paid administrative leave will continue until the school year ends next June 30.
For those keeping track of dollars and cents, Lundin pocketed six weeks’ salary while on administrative leave and now will continue to collect a salary at an annual rate of $195,658 for seven more months.
So, between now and June 30, the district will give Lundin approximately $114,200 to do work that ended Oct. 6. That is roughly equivalent to what two Des Moines teachers are paid for working the entire school year.
The school board has given no explanation why it will pay this money to an administrator who will have only worked about three months of his 12-month contract — or how he has earned that compensation for days he will not work or provide services to the Des Moines Public Schools.
The board offered no explanation of its rationale — or of the supposed public purpose for that expenditure.
Phil Roeder, the director of communications and public affairs for the DMPS, said in an email to me, “This separation was a mutual decision and not based on any discipline or misconduct by Dr. Lundin.”
OK. But if a $50,000-a-year teacher asks to be released from a contract in the middle of the school year, the district will not pay the teacher through the end of the school year the way Lundin will get paid. Instead, the district’s master contract and policy manual warn teachers the district will assess those who resign early a $1,500 fee for breaking their contracts.
This is not the first time the school board has embarrassed itself with a lack of transparency and candor with taxpayers. In 2022, when Tom Ahart resigned as Des Moines superintendent with one year left on his contract, the board entered into a similar separation agreement. In that instance, the Ahart agreement cost the taxpayers nearly $400,000 in compensation for the year he did not work.
Beyond the public-purpose requirement of the Iowa Constitution, a few other factors in Lundin’s departure should concern Iowans.
State law requires government employers to make public what are called “the documented reasons and rationale” for the demotion of a government employee, for the person’s termination or for the employee’s resignation in lieu of termination.
If Lundin’s resignation truly was voluntary, as DMPS leaders claim, then why give him a lucrative goodbye present?
Why did the school board need to meet in closed session to discuss his job performance, since his resignation was dated four days prior to the board meeting? No reasonable employer evaluates the performance of an employee who has quit.
Was the board going to refuse to accept his resignation — even though the separation agreement had already been written and signed by Lundin?
And if his departure was not his decision alone, then where are the “documented reasons and rationale” that lawmakers said must be made public when a “resign or else” directive is given?
Without facts and openness, only the school board members and Robert Lundin know what led to his administrative leave and then his resignation. Only the board knows whether it was as cavalier as it looks to fork over a $114,000 gift from taxpayers as he departed.
Almost 50 years ago, W. Ward Reynoldson, Osceola’s folksy Supreme Court justice, wrote about a “plain judicial intent to permit the concept of ‘public purpose’ to have that flexibility and expansive scope required to meet the challenges of increasingly complex social, economic, and technological conditions.”
But in tough economic times and tight budgets for public schools, it hardly seems possible that complex conditions support stretching the term “public purpose” to encompass parting gifts paid to highly compensated public employees, especially when they are allowed to ride quietly into the sunset without completing the work they were hired to do.

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)When Charlotte’s City Council met last Monday, members confronted a reality shared by cities and counties across North Carolina: immigrant communities shaken by recent federal immigration raids, and local governments with little room to respond.
The meeting came as federal agents carried out operations in several parts of the state, including Durham and Raleigh. The arrests prompted parents to keep children home from school, workers to miss shifts and families to avoid public spaces.
As council members described fear rippling through neighborhoods, they also acknowledged the limits of their authority.
“The city of Charlotte only has as much power as is explicitly granted or inherently granted by the General Assembly’s general statutes,” City Attorney Andrea Leslie-Fite told members. “So when it comes to things of this magnitude, or anything else for that matter, we first have to look to the authority that’s been granted … and the limitations.”
Those limits stem from North Carolina’s strict interpretation of Dillion’s Rule, which gives cities only the powers the legislature explicitly approves. Unlike “home-rule” states, where municipalities have broad authority to pass local ordinances without seeking state approval, North Carolina municipalities cannot set their own immigration policies, restrict cooperation with federal agents or adopt “sanctuary” ordinances.
“It’s like two different types of parenting,” said Rick Su, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law who studies the intersection of cities and immigration. “One is like, you do whatever you want, but when you do something wrong, then I’m going to punish you. The other is like, don’t do anything, and ask me for permission before you do anything.”
Lawmakers in Raleigh have repeatedly moved to shape immigration policies in the state, passing bans on sanctuary policies and backing measures that would require sheriffs to cooperate with federal authorities. As a result, cities from Raleigh and Durham to Greensboro and Winston-Salem operate under the same constraints as Charlotte, regardless of local political consensus.
Even so, Charlotte officials outlined several steps they believe fall within their authority. The city will require judicial warrants for federal agents seeking access to nonpublic city facilities. Other measures include protecting confidential data where possible and scrutinizing public-record requests. Officials also debated direct funding for community organizations assisting immigrant families.
On the policing side, the city’s police officers will not participate in immigration arrests but can verify the identities of federal agents, respond to reports of possible immigration activity and investigate any criminal behavior.
Still, immigrant advocates say municipalities could do more. “There’s so much creativity and wisdom in local government,” Andrew Willis Garces, a senior strategist with Siembra N.C., told NC Newsline.
“If officials got in rooms across jurisdictions and asked, ‘What would it take to make this state the safest for immigrants in the South?’ they could make a list of things to do now,” Garces told NC Newsline in an interview.
Garces said municipalities could hold public hearings on how federal actions are affecting communities, direct city managers to produce reports on what they learn, and adopt local resolutions protecting workplace rights and Fourth Amendment guarantees. He noted that Durham, Chapel Hill and Greensboro have already committed to the “Stand Up for Greensboro, Chapel Hill, Durham” resolution.
Su agreed. He said that while the state’s framework is narrow, many cities interpret it even more restrictively than the law requires. Municipalities, he said, often underestimate the authority they do have.
“I think sometimes city attorneys and politicians in North Carolina imagine themselves as having even less power than they do,” he said. Cities still possess regulatory tools they routinely use in other contexts — and those tools can apply to federal agencies as well.
For example, Su said North Carolina cities can use zoning and safety reviews for buildings used by federal authorities, audits of contracts or land-use agreements for shared facilities, and standard identification requirements for anyone operating in nonpublic, city-controlled spaces. These are not immigration policies, he said, but ordinary exercises of municipal authority that apply to everyone.
“These are not about obstructing immigration enforcement,” he said. “They’re about cities exercising the powers they already have — zoning, property control and general regulatory authority — which they use in every other context.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_4603-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 14:58:05.956999

(Getty Images)New Mexico legislators on Friday expressed concerns that judicial rulings in a longstanding education equity case might interfere with local and statewide decision making.  
The 10-year-old Yazzie/Martinez lawsuit established that the state education department had not been providing equitable educational opportunities to at-risk students, identified as Native American students, English Language Learners, students with disabilities and students from low-income households. Earlier this year, the parties returned to court because the plaintiffs remained unsatisfied with the state’s progress. First Judicial District Court Judge Matthew Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to complete a remedial action plan.
The state submitted the first draft of that plan to the court on Oct. 1, but stakeholders quickly rejected it as too “vague.” The Public Education Department then had another month to make revisions before submitting the final draft on Nov. 3.
On Friday, Legislative Finance and Education Study Committee members met during a joint meeting at the Roundhouse to hear the latest update on the plan.
PED Secretary Mariana Padilla outlined the four critical needs identified in the plan, including equitable access to “high-quality instruction;” high-quality teachers who are culturally and linguistically responsive; services relating to academics, social well-being and behavioral needs; and “effective” funding and accountability. 
“The plan has changed dramatically,” Padilla said, noting that much of the feedback the department received asked for more detail. “People wanted to know what we meant by each action. Give us the details of what this entails. They wanted to know who was responsible for implementing it; how we were going to actually operationalize that action item; and then how are we going to track that for outcomes.”
Padilla said other revisions involved expanded support for English language learners, alignment with the “tribal remedy framework” for meeting Native American students’ needs, expansions to out-of-school time and clearer accountability measures.
Padilla’s presentation also highlighted several proposed legislative actions for next year’s January session, including requiring structured literacy and numeracy in elementary schools; creating a permanent Office of Special Education; and amending the state’s laws around attendance to ensure suspension and expulsion practices are not disproportionately directed at at-risk students.

“These pieces of legislation will help us to improve our educator preparation efforts, they will help us really target our efforts in math and literacy. [They] will also help us improve our supports for our students with disabilities, as well as address [the] Attendance for Success Act,” Padilla said. 
The department also is seeking increased compensation for personnel and a larger overall budget.
“We are really utilizing funding that the Legislature has already provided to us and we have a lot of that base funding that we need in the public school support request, however there will be some additional needs,” Padilla said.
Padilla also noted actions the PED is currently taking toward implementing the remedial action plan, such as developing “linguistically and culturally relevant” assessment measures and ensuring Native American representation for special education advisory panels.
Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces), a former educator, said the original court finding in the Yazzie/Martinez case was primarily based on low literacy and math scores of at-risk students. He said the state has made strides in addressing those two areas and funding supports, but questioned what the goal of the case is now, whether the court’s initial concerns were addressed and how the state is measuring progress toward those ends.
“I think this whole thing comes down to ‘how do we balance Legislative control, department control and local control?’ So much of what needs to be done is at the local district and local school boards,” Soules said during the meeting. “Do we really want to balance or have the Legislature or the department micromanaging everything in a budget? And at what level does the department step in because they clearly are not meeting the goals and targets of the Martinez/Yazzie lawsuit.”
He added that the two major needs to address the court’s findings can be whittled down to funding and support. Rep. Tara Lujan (D-Santa Fe) shared similar concerns over the “autonomy” of local schools and school boards. 
“Ten years, we’re not done. We’re not done, but how long is this going to be in the court system? Our policies and what we are tasked to do, why we exist as a branch of government, is going to be allocated to the judicial system. I’m concerned with that.”
Padilla told committee members that she does not believe the judge’s intent is to have “oversight” over the department or the state for “decades,” but that these questions should be directed to the court.
The Yazzie/Martinez plaintiffs must submit their response to the final draft plan to the court by Dec. 1, then the PED has the opportunity to respond in mid-December. The court will then set a hearing date to discuss the developments.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-1088179758-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 13:57:40.451625

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-internet-expansion-bead-program/,A 2021 program was intended to expand internet access. But federal eligibility changes could exclude roughly 80% of CT’s in-need locations.,"Four years ago, when the Biden administration tasked states with creating plans to drastically expand broadband in the U.S., there was a question of what the call would mean for Connecticut, already one of most well-connected states in the country. 
Still, early federal maps identified thousands of places that needed help, suggesting there were more than 15,000 places — ranging from households in rural and geographically isolated communities, to small businesses struggling to afford better connections — in need of reliable high-speed internet. 
In the years since, the state has launched a variety of initiatives aimed at improving connections. The ConneCTed Communities Grant Program has provided some $34 million in state grants to help internet service providers build out broadband infrastructure, connecting thousands of locations. Internet providers have also worked to improve service, further reducing the number of households in need. 
The federal government’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program, a $42.45 billion initiative launched in 2021 and aimed at providing additional financial support, was intended to help states move even further toward achieving the goal of “Internet for All.” Connecticut is set to receive some $144 million under the program, money intended to bring high-speed, affordable broadband to the state’s unserved and underserved areas.
[RELATED: CT to receive $144 million as part of push for high-speed internet]
After a significant delay, the state received good news last week: Connecticut is one of 18 states to receive federal approval for the final version of its BEAD plan. Connecticut won’t immediately receive the $144 million it has been awarded, but federal approval is seen as a key step in the process, indicating that the state has done enough to receive its funding in the near future. 
The announcement was quickly met with praise by state officials. 
“Access to fast, affordable, reliable high-speed internet is a requirement of life today, whether it be getting medical care, paying bills, or finding work and educational opportunities,” Governor Ned Lamont said in a statement. “Improving residents’ access to broadband has been a priority of mine since we enacted Connecticut’s first broadband bill in 2021, and this authorization marks another significant step toward that goal.”
But the conditions for the money — the BEAD program initially required multiple application rounds, assessments and administrative requirements — have changed significantly in recent months.
The Trump administration restructured the program, issuing a June policy notice that removed guidelines supporting climate change resilience, workforce diversity and broadband affordability. 
The administration instead pushed states to prioritize what it called the “benefit of the bargain” — a call to build broadband infrastructure at low costs, despite states already crafting detailed plans on how the broadband money could be used.
The administration also encouraged a “technology neutral” approach — abandoning the Biden administration’s preference for more expensive fiber connections in favor of a broader range of broadband technology, including satellite programs like Elon Musk’s Starlink and Amazon’s Leo.
Those changes — following years of challenges to federal broadband maps, internet access expansions and regulatory updates — further reduced the number of locations that still qualify for the BEAD program. By the summer of 2025, Connecticut had just 885 locations that were expected to still be served by BEAD, a more than 80% reduction from the initial numbers. 
The recent policy changes reduced that number even more. In its updated plan, the state expects to serve 717 locations, leaving some the most expensive and hardest-to-connect locations off of the list.
Now, with the BEAD money on the way, state leaders say they are prepared to use the broadband money as soon as possible.
“We are ready to expand critical infrastructure across the state that will empower our workforce, drive economic development, support healthcare, and advance education,” Department of Energy and Environmental Protection Commissioner Katie Dykes said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing every corner of the state benefit from this program as Connecticut closes the gap on internet access.” 
But the federal broadband program is about to launch in a national landscape that is very different from when it was first enacted. And as efforts to close the digital divide shift, changes to the once lauded initiative may render it less effective. 
A shift in federal priorities 
From the beginning, the BEAD program set out with an ambitious goal: connecting as many people as possible to the internet.
In the past few years, states put together plans outlining how they would accomplish the task. Connecticut first released drafts of its two part broadband plan in 2023 and received federal approval for its initial proposal early in 2024. 
The plan was detailed, calling for the state to promote affordability, expand broadband services and provide support to ensure that people didn’t just have internet access, they also knew how to use the internet and could navigate digital tools. 
The federal funds were a crucial part of that effort. “BEAD is an infrastructure program,” said Reid Sharkey, a community broadband specialist and researcher with the Benton Institute for Broadband & Society, a national organization that supports expanded internet access. “The first goal is getting broadband service to all of the locations that need it in the country. But then beyond that, the remaining funds are used for sort of maximizing the potential of those networks.”
But the BEAD program has dragged in its rollout. More than three years after it was first announced, the vast majority of the money allotted under BEAD has gone unspent, frustrating broadband advocates and digital policy experts. 
The delays in the BEAD program are a key reason why the Trump administration argued that it needed to restructure the initiative. But the new changes to the program are complicated and have raised their own concerns in recent months. 
The administration says it is squarely focused on one thing: cost. During the summer, the federal government pivoted to telling states to focus on building broadband for less money, drastically reducing the spending expected under the program. One analysis, completed last month by experts at New York Law School’s Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute, suggests that states are on track to spend around just half—roughly $21 billion — of the available BEAD funds. 
A separate analysis from the institute found that as many as one million locations may still lack high-speed internet after the BEAD program completes distributing funds. The organization has suggested that the leftover money could be used to fund an additional round of BEAD to help close any gaps. 
But that solution isn’t currently being backed by the federal government. The administration has instead suggested that it may pull any remaining “non-deployment” funds back from the states, framing the reduced state BEAD spending as “savings” in recent discussions of the program. 
“With so much money left over, some people have argued why not spend a little bit more, give them fiber or cable or terrestrial network and not have to give them satellite service,” said Michael Santorelli, the director of the Advanced Communications Law and Policy Institute. “Under the Trump rules, that’s not how it works.”

Connecticut’s plan will expand broadband, but some communities will be left out
For the most part, Connecticut managed to avoid needing to overhaul its BEAD plan. The state still intends to primarily install fiber connections, which are more expensive than satellite-delivered internet, but are generally seen as having better longevity. And the state has used its own money to help establish additional broadband connections in recent years. 
But the BEAD changes will affect how Connecticut works to reach more expensive and geographically-isolated areas. In its final broadband plan submitted earlier in the fall, officials noted that the new cost requirements made fiber a financial non-starter in some areas, adding that it was difficult to find an affordable satellite provider that could fill the gap. As a result, some 119 unserved locations, and an additional 49 underserved locations, cannot be helped with BEAD. 
In both cases, the state argued that the costs of connecting these areas would be “unreasonably excessive. ” 
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, the agency tasked with overseeing the BEAD application process, acknowledged in an email to the Connecticut Mirror that the new federal guidance affected the state’s plan to connect these areas. 
But the agency maintained that the funds will still have a significant impact on communities in the state. 
“We intended to finish the job of connecting everyone to the degree possible with BEAD, and are doing so, connecting another 717 program-eligible residential and small business locations in 76 towns throughout the state,” said agency spokesman Will Healey. 
“Ultimately, even with the Restructuring Policy Notice, Connecticut has been successful in meeting our key goals for the deployment phase of the program,” he added. 
The BEAD program is just one way that the federal government has altered Biden-era broadband initiatives in recent months. Earlier this year, the administration terminated funding that was going to be allotted under the Digital Equity Act, a $2.75 billion proposal that would help states fund efforts to improve digital literacy and related skills in vulnerable communities. 
The changes cost Connecticut $20 million, a loss that has frustrated advocates who hoped the money would support workforce development, digital navigation and community education efforts around the country. 
“People are still getting scammed every day. People are still not able to apply for jobs, people are still not able to talk to their doctors. All of those things are still happening,” Angela Siefer, the executive director of the National Digital Inclusion Alliance, told the Connecticut Mirror in June. “What’s changed is that we don’t have this federal investment that would allow us to figure out what works.” 
Months later, those concerns remain. “A lot of the folks that are going to get service through BEAD have never had access at their home to the Internet,” said Sharkey. “The Digital Equity Act was going to ensure that those folks had an opportunity to really maximize the impact that broadband access could have on their lives.” 
And those changes mean that even as the digital divide narrows across the country, broadband advocates and policy experts say that more work will need to be done to ensure that people are able to take advantage of internet access and devices. 
The exact impact of Connecticut’s BEAD investments will not be clear until the remaining locations are connected. But for now, state officials say they remain optimistic about the state’s work and what comes next. 
“We’ve also prioritized getting the best technology, long-term scalable broadband connections for residents as possible so that the infrastructure investment lasts well into the future,” Healey, the DEEP spokesperson, said in an emailed statement. “ We’ve been able to achieve that end.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP21223106132981-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 13:57:40.451625

(Photo courtesy of the Indiana Public Retirement System)More than 6,000 members of the Indiana Public Retirement System have collectively left behind millions of dollars in benefits — but a new database aims to connect them to their cash.
It’s the centerpiece of INPRS’ “reclaim your retirement” campaign.
“The creation of this database was driven by our commitment to protecting the financial well-being of our members,” spokeswoman Carolina Rodríguez told the Capital Chronicle.
As of October, about 3,700 INPRS members were eligible to request their earned retirement benefits, with median monthly payments ranging from $545.50 to $783.50. They may also have defined contribution accounts waiting, with balances averaging $14,451 to $33,342, according to INPRS.
Nearly 2,400 other retirees, survivors, and beneficiaries had funds issued to them but the money went unused, according to a news release.

“We have identified that many individuals have earned retirement benefits but were unaware they had funds available or had lost contact due to changes in address, employment, or personal circumstances,” Rodríguez said. “In some situations, benefit checks were delivered as intended but never deposited into the recipient’s account.”
The information is hosted securely in a database outside of INPRS member accounts. Visitors must enter a first name, last name, and date of birth.
“Everyone is invited” to search the database, the news release says. “… for themselves, friends, family members, former colleagues, and the like for a match. When a search for someone other than yourself is successful, let that person know right away.”
If there is a match in the database, instructions will pop up for what to do next. If there’s not a match, INPRS’ website offers, “you may still have a retirement benefit with us but you’re just not on our list for this initiative.”

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)The governors of multiple Western states touted their willingness to work across the aisle as they met with members of the Trump administration in a wealthy Phoenix suburb Thursday to discuss issues ranging from powering data centers to Congress’s farm bill.
“We work together in service of the region and the nation as a whole,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox told reporters Thursday morning at a press conference prior to the start of the Western Governors’ Association’s winter meeting at the Omni Scottsdale Resort and Spa in Paradise Valley. “Working together actually still works.”

Cox was joined by Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green and Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, all of whom touted the “bipartisan” nature of the WGA gathering, which featured Trump cabinet officials Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, and Doug Burgum, who heads up the Interior Department.
The WGA’s winter meeting also featured three panel sessions dedicated to issues impacting Western states: data center energy demands, the upcoming reauthorization of the farm bill and the growing need for broadband internet in rural areas.
The meeting comes as many of the Western states present have failed to meet a deadline on an agreement on how to share Colorado River water.
“We know that we all are going to have to work together and make sacrifices,” Cox said when asked by reporters about the recent water woes, adding that the states are “working closely together” to avoid federal intervention. Hobbs, who has been sharply critical of Upper Basin states like Colorado and Utah for refusing to accept cuts in their water supply, noted that she had a meeting scheduled with Burgum to discuss the negotiations.
 Western governors talk federal budget cuts

That facetime with Trump administration officials was something all the governors touted as a major positive for the gathering Thursday, adding that it allowed them the ability to voice their concerns about a number of issues facing their states.
That includes the impending cuts to Medicaid that will cut health care spending for the state-managed programs by $1 trillion over the next decade and kick an estimated 12 million people off their health insurance.
Policymakers plan for ‘energy superabundance’ at Western governors conference

Cox and Gianforte, both Republicans, said they feel they’ll be able to “absorb those cuts” when they hit their states.
Green and Hobbs, both Democrats, were less optimistic. Green said Hawaii will look at using its rainy day fund to supplement money lost from the cuts, while Hobbs said her administration is looking into how Arizona will mitigate the impacts of the federal cuts when the state legislature begins crafting a budget in January.
But the state doesn’t have the money to replace what the Trump administration is taking away, she said.
“We cannot backfill the cuts,” Hobbs stressed to reporters.
 Officials face policy changes to agriculture, water managment and data centers

One issue of particular importance to Western states is the proliferation of data centers used to drive the artificial intelligence industry, and the unprecedented energy demands that have come with them.
With the AI boom, there has been an explosion in the number of data centers — facilities that can be hundreds of thousands of square-feet large and are filled with computer servers — that run and operate the AI systems. They require a large amount of power and are straining energy providers, resulting in higher rates for residents in many cases.
“We’re trying to do more faster,” Cully Cavness, president and COO of Crusoe Energy, an AI data center startup that recently raised $1.3 billion, told the governors.
To Cavness and others on a panel discussing data center expansion, local permitting is the primary reason more data centers haven’t already been built. The panelists, which included businesses with billions invested in AI and data centers, all agreed that speeding up the permitting process for data centers is key to creating more.
Cox and others see building out more data centers as integral into an “AI arms race” with China, an argument that Burgum echoed later during his keynote speech.
 Congress is still debating new farm bill in D.C.

While technology took up a majority of the conversations Thursday, panelists also discussed with governors another pressing issue: food.
“It seems like the support is there, but it is being piecemealed, and it can’t be piecemealed,” Geri Byrne, a supervisor in California’s Modoc County and chair of the Rural County Representatives of California, said about the ongoing congressional debate around the farm bill.
The farm bill, a package of legislation that is passed every five years, governs the ways agriculture and farming is done in the United States. The current bill expires in September 2026.
Byrne said she is worried that partisan gridlock in Congress means the favored strategy has been to “piecemeal” parts of the legislation to win approval on easier components of the policy package. But that means negotiators will have a difficult time getting the support needed to get a “clean” version of the bill next year.

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE

“I’m sorry to get political,” said Stanley Dick, a commissioner from Cavalier County in North Dakota, voicing a concern that the Trump administration will not agree to a five-year version of the bill because it likes “short-term things.”
“Things change politically real quick right now,” he said, adding that a “skinny bill” is something he has been hearing about that has been resonating more than a long-term fix with people in Washington, D.C.
And while Dick, a farmer himself, said he found the discussions around data centers fascinating, he was more concerned about trends among farming. Half of the farmers in the United States are over the age of retirement and the cost of entry into the field is often high.
“I mean, how long can we go without food?” Dick asked the attendees.
 Secretaries Burgum, Kennedy provide keynote at Western Governors Association meeting

The day’s work ended with a pair of keynote speeches from Burgum and Kennedy.
Burgum told the governors about the administration’s plans for “energy dominance,” which has included moving away from renewable energy and moving back towards fossil fuels. During his time at the Interior, Burgum has helped fast-track fossil fuel extraction on public lands, uranium mining permits and looked to speed up permitting for nuclear power.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum testifies before a House Appropriations subcommittee on May 20, 2025. (Screenshot from committee webcast)
“It is innovation, not regulation, that has led to American greatness,” he said.
Burgum defended the administration’s decisions as being imperative to keep pace with China, claiming that if environmentalist groups are worried about pollution, then they should be wanting the United States to be engaged in drilling for oil and mining and not other countries.
“We should be insisting this all be happening here,” Burgum said.
Burgum also decried environmental groups who he claimed use the Endangered Species Act to delay and stop projects simply to “raise money.” He also claimed that environmental assessments, which are required to ensure projects do not impact sites, take too long so his office has been using AI to speed up the process.
While Burgum drew a considerable crowd, it was Kennedy who brought the most people into the ballroom.
Kennedy, who repeated a number of false claims during his keynote speech, received pushback from Green, who was a family physician before becoming governor.
“If (people) see us fighting, the doubt itself can be harmful,” Green said during a back-and-forth between the two men about vaccines.
Kennedy has been an outspoken crusader against vaccines, and Green had asked how he could ensure that the agency he oversees does not create undue harm or panic with the messages they are putting out in regards to vaccines. (The day before the WGA meeting, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which Kennedy oversees, changed its website to say there is a link between vaccines and autism. Such connections have been pushed by Kennedy and other anti-vaccine activists, but have been long debunked by a large body of high-quality scientific research.)

Earlier this year, multiple states began issuing standing orders for the COVID-19 vaccine amid moves by HHS to make the vaccine only available via a prescription to certain individuals.
“I’m not trying to take away anyone’s vaccines,” Kennedy said to Green. “What I want is to make sure vaccines are properly tested.”
Vaccines, especially childhood vaccines, undergo rigorous scientific testing. They are safe and have virtually eliminated many childhood illnesses that left children disabled or dead.
Both Green and Kennedy, though, could agree that having the government be open and honest to the best of their abilities is something to aim for. They also agreed that Washington D.C. is dysfunctional.
“I am pessimistic about finding common ground on Capitol Hill,” Kennedy said. “No one is even talking to each other.”

While there is no single solution to our many transportation challenges, the growing popularity of Bluebikes is showing that the region’s public bikeshare program can play an important role.   The Boston Globe recently reported that annual Bluebikes ridership jumped from 2.1 million trips in 2020 to 4.7 million trips in 2024, with the spike attributed to an increase in docking stations, new discount programs, and the addition of electric bicycles—or e-bikes—in early 2024. E-bikes are equipped with a small, battery-powered electric motor that helps riders reach speeds of up to 18 miles per hour when pedaling, effectively shortening distances and flattening terrain.  Bluebikes aren’t just riding a wave of popularity—they are redefining how Greater Boston moves. A recent A Better City report comparing Bluebikes ridership between 2023 and 2024 found that e-bikes powered 25 percent of all rides in 2024. With roughly 700 e-bikes in the system, compared to the more than 4,000 classic bikes, each individual e-bike made almost twice as many trips on average as each classic bike. Even though e-bikes are slightly more expensive—there is a per-minute fee levied on each e-bike ride—many riders are opting for e-bikes when available.   The Bluebikes system is collectively owned and operated by 13 municipalities—Arlington, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Chelsea, Everett, Malden, Medford, Newton, Revere, Salem, Somerville, and Watertown. Thanks to the stewardship of sponsor Blue Cross Blue Shield, the coordination of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, and local, state, and federal investments marshaled by the participating municipalities, the Bluebikes system is expanding. 
Regional planning is underway to double the system by 2030, and the City of Boston is in the middle of a 100-station expansion. A Better City’s full report includes more detailed recommendations for improving the reliability and capacity of the system, such as expanding the e-bike fleet, integrating charging infrastructure into bike docks, and prioritizing co-location with transit and filling gaps in the network when siting new stations.    Importantly, it’s not just the Bluebikes network that is growing—our regional bike infrastructure is growing too. Safe, separated infrastructure—like the Somerville Community Path, Northern Strand, and Neponset River Greenway—are drawing more commuters and recreational users alike. To help manage this growth, A Better City, with support from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, launched the Guided Ride Series last April to provide riders with the knowledge and confidence to navigate this new urban bike infrastructure. We teach best riding practices, rules of the road, safety tips and tricks, and publish routes accessible for free via smartphone. As our bike infrastructure continues to evolve, so must our education campaigns.   Greater Boston has what most major metros do not: a comprehensive public transit network that is increasingly integrated with our Bluebikes system. The connectivity between the two has the potential to provide tremendous flexibility in how people can get around. More than 70 percent of the MBTA’s rapid transit stops, including the Blue, Red, Orange, Green, and Silver lines, have at least one Bluebikes docking station within 200 meters. With this overlap, a Bluebikes ride can cover the first or last mile of a multimodal commute to extend the range of MBTA trips, save time on trips via transit, and make traveling without a car convenient where it otherwise wouldn’t be feasible.   What does all this mean for the future of transportation in Greater Boston? The expansion of the Bluebikes network (powered by e-bikes), and bike infrastructure demonstrates the massive potential for people to shift some of their short trips away from cars, alleviating our worst-in-the-nation traffic and reducing vehicle carbon emissions. The MassDOT Statewide Bicycle and Pedestrian Plan estimates that 57 percent of trips taken across all modes in Massachusetts are three miles or less. That’s a 12-minute bike ride, on average, if you’re riding a Bluebikes e-bike.   
For those who haven’t ridden a Bluebike yet, there are mutiple ways to give an e-bike a try. Casual riders can unlock a single ride for $2.95 plus $0.25 per minute, or purchase a day of unlocks for $10 plus $0.25 per minute. Membership options offer free unlocks and a reduced per minute rate of $0.10 for monthly and annual options, and $0.07 for income eligible riders. For employers who want to offer this type of mobility to their workers, there are several levels of subsidy available, all of which include free unlocks and discounted per minute rates on e-bikes. A Better City built a Bluebikes Calculator to demonstrate the low-cost, high-impact nature of such a benefit, which is less than 28 cents per day for an annual membership.  
With e-bikes supercharging the Bluebikes system, they are demonstrating how bikeshare can be part of the solution to address our traffic crisis and to achieve our climate goals.

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
In a letter to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi last week, Michigan Republicans asked the federal government to provide “comprehensive oversight” of the state’s 2026 election.
But the letter doesn’t specify what “comprehensive oversight” means. And it’s not clear that the people who signed the letter agree on the meaning either.
A total of 22 Republican state legislators from both the Senate and the House signed on to the letter, including Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, Sen. Ruth Johnson — a former Michigan secretary of state — and Rep. Rachelle Smit, who leads the House Election Integrity Committee.
The letter asks the U.S. Justice Department to “deploy official election monitors and provide comprehensive oversight for Michigan’s 2026 primary and general elections.” It cites a number of concerns about Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s administration of the election, from the fact that she is running for governor in the 2026 election to her alleged violations of election law.
It is not unusual for secretaries of state to oversee elections they are candidates in. Benson ran the 2022 election that won her a second term, for instance, and Johnson oversaw two separate elections as secretary in which she was also on the ballot. In Michigan, while the secretary of state sets rules and regulations, it is local clerks who typically work with voters more directly, creating a layer of separation between the state’s highest election official and the voters who may or may not be supporting them.
It’s not clear if the Justice Department will take the matter on, but Johnson told Votebeat on Thursday that department officials were already meeting on the request. She said she didn’t know who specifically was involved, and a spokesperson for the department did not respond to a request for comment.
 Nebulous views of ‘oversight’

The first part of the Republicans’ request — federal election monitors — isn’t unusual. Monitors watch polling places and vote-counting centers to ensure workers are following processes appropriately. Under President Joe Biden, the Justice Department sent monitors to 27 states in the 2024 general election, including Michigan, and sent monitors for Michigan’s primary election as well. Under President Donald Trump, it sent monitors to California and New Jersey earlier this month after similar requests from members of the GOP in both states, but those monitors were uninvasive and may not have visited certain jurisdictions at all.
“Comprehensive oversight,” though, is a more abstract idea.
To Johnson, oversight in 2026 would be “something that has to be worked out, because you always have to balance everything.” In an interview with Votebeat, she did not go into specifics about what type of intervention she might welcome in Michigan, although she offered one example of something she hopes federal involvement could accomplish: ensuring people don’t vote twice.
That’s already rare in Michigan. Attorney General Dana Nessel, a Democrat, pursued charges against several people in an investigation of double voting last year. Charges were dropped against most, while one was sentenced to probation this year.
But a 2022 statewide audit found that, out of more than 11.7 million votes cast from May 2019 to March 2021, 99.99% were not duplicate votes.
Nesbitt didn’t offer much detail about what federal oversight could look like, either.
“We aren’t leaving any options off the table,” he said in an emailed statement. “The level of federal intervention in Michigan’s election is going to depend entirely on Jocelyn Benson’s willingness to cooperate with the DOJ and follow the law. I’m confident the DOJ will do whatever is necessary to ensure our next election is free of any manipulation.”
Nesbitt said that Benson “should welcome DOJ oversight” if elections are as secure as she claims. Johnson, meanwhile, said she would primarily like to see oversight from someone independent.
Johnson argued that circumstances are different from when she was secretary of state and administering elections in 2014 and 2018. “I was nonpartisan in every single way,” she said. “I got in trouble with some people in my own party because of it.” Benson, she said, has not been the same.
The Michigan Department of State argues that isn’t true. Elections in Michigan “are among the most transparent, secure and accessible in the nation,” Angela Benander, a spokesperson for MDOS, said after the letter was released last week.
“Next year’s election will be no different,” Benander continued. “Yet by pouring gasoline on our democracy and asking the DOJ to light a match, these lawmakers ignore these truths. They instead use dangerous, false rhetoric to encourage President Trump to illegally interfere in our state’s ability to hold fair and free elections.”
 Federal intervention has few precedents

Experts say the federal government’s ability to intervene in elections is limited. The Constitution is very clear, for example, that states get to establish “the times, places and manner” of elections.
Historically, when the federal government has gotten involved in elections, it has usually been through legislation. During Reconstruction, for instance, Congress passed a series of Enforcement Acts that made it a federal crime to interfere with elections. However, that was at a time when Ku Klux Klan members were using violence to prevent Black voters from casting ballots — a radically different circumstance than the ongoing lawsuits and alleged conflicts of interest Benson faces today.
The timing of the letter is also unusual, said David Becker, an election lawyer who worked in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and now leads the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation & Research — the general election is nearly a full year away.
“I don’t know of a single instance in all of DOJ history where a jurisdiction that wasn’t previously monitored had monitors assigned more than a few weeks before,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Accompanied by a blazing turkey and — by his own estimation — fireable dad jokes, Florida Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia hosted a fried turkey safety demonstration Monday ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Ingoglia, who also serves as state fire marshal, was joined by the Tallahassee Fire Department to caution Floridians against the danger of home fires on Thanksgiving and teach them the “don’ts” of frying turkeys.
“Thanksgiving is the peak day for home-cooking fires,” Ingoglia said, thanking the firefighters and noting Thanksgiving cooking is responsible for three times the daily average of home fires any other day of the year.
“Be safe this holiday season. Take heed, take caution, and make sure we don’t have any mistakes that will land you guys in the hospital room.”
Floridians should set up the turkey-frying station far away from their homes at ground-level, completely thaw the bird before frying it, never overfill the pot, keep children far away, and always have a fire extinguisher nearby, Ingoglia said.

“We have a demonstration for you,” the Spring Hill Republican added, stepping back as firefighters in heavy protective gear moved to purposely fry a turkey incorrectly.
Holding a long beam between them hoisting a hefty turkey on a string, two firefighters lowered the bird into an overfilled pot of boiling oil.
Within seconds, a massive fire erupted in and around the pot.
In his closing words, Ingoglia told three Thanksgiving-themed dad jokes written by his communications team that he claimed to have not seen before. His team bet him $100 dollars he wouldn’t read them, he added.
“I don’t know if they’re funny,” he warned.
“How can you tell if a local government politician carved a turkey? Half went to special interests and the other half went missing,” the first one read, touching on Ingoglia’s months-long mission to examine alleged overspending by local governments.
Appearing unsure, he read the next:
“What did the fried turkey say when the oil overflowed? Well that escalated crispy.”
Begrudgingly, he read another — “What’s the difference between a well-fried turkey and a badly-fried one? One’s dinner and the other is a story at Thanksgiving that your mother-in-law will tell for the next 20 years.” — before joking that he would soon have an opening in his communications team.

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)In a letter sent last week, Democratic New Mexico U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) pressed United States Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins for more details about her recently announced plan to require food benefit recipients to reapply.
Rollins first mentioned the possibility that Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program beneficiaries would have to reapply to the program during an interview on the right-wing Newsmax network.
The letter, signed by 30 Democratic U.S. senators, including Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, notes “serious concern” about a proposal to have people reapply to the program and says, “these changes appear to be duplicative of existing SNAP rules and designed to create more red tape for families seeking to put food on the table.”
The letter continues on to describe the disruption to SNAP that occurred during the 43-day government shutdown that ended Nov. 12. 
In New Mexico, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham allocated $30 million in emergency funding to stopgap SNAP shortages, and state lawmakers held a special session and passed $162.5 million more to cover SNAP payments if needed. Food banks across the state also saw sharp increases in need.
“This reapplication requirement comes after repeated efforts to deny Americans in need of essential nutrition assistance,” the letter reads. “In addition to unprecedented cuts to SNAP enacted earlier this summer, decisions to disrupt food assistance during the shutdown have created additional uncertainty. We are therefore troubled that the Administration could choose, at this moment, to add additional red tape that creates duplicative and unnecessary barriers to accessing nutrition assistance for families.”
The letter asks Rollins to explain how the “reapplication” plan would differ from the current recertification process in which states assess recipients’ eligibility each year; how the plan would remain “consistent” with the program’s existing rules; and when the USDA planned to issue “rulemaking or guidance” on its reapplication plan.
In response to questions about the reapplication proposal, a USDA spokesperson previously said: “Secretary Rollins wants to ensure the fraud, waste, and incessant abuse of SNAP ends” and that “using standard recertification processes for households is a part of that work.”
New Mexico state Republicans also recently voiced concerns about SNAP fraud, and called upon the Legislative Finance Council to expand an audit of the program to include investigation fraud.

Luján, the ranking member of the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Food and Nutrition, Specialty Crops, Organics, and Research, last week, along with Klobuchar and the whole Senate Democratic Caucus, introduced a bill to repeal all SNAP-related changes in the recently enacted “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/boxesoffood-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 12:57:23.769835

The move furthers Gov. Ron DeSantis’ mission to remake the school, located in a heavily conservative part of the state, in a more conservative light.
Diaz has been interim president at the university since July. Before that, he was the education commissioner under DeSantis and before that he was a Republican state senator and House member representing Hialeah.

“After reviewing all of the applicants and conducting in-person interviews, it became clear that Interim President Diaz’s experiences of working in higher education, shaping education policy in the Florida Legislature, and serving on the State University System of Florida Board of Governors — while also serving as Florida’s Education Commissioner — have uniquely prepared him to be UWF’s next president,” presidential search committee chair Zack Smith said in a news release.
UWF will host a community forum with Diaz, followed by a trustee vote on his presidency. Trustees’ approval would be subject to Board of Governors confirmation.
DeSantis in May called for “big changes” at UWF. Former President Martha Saunders resigned before her contract expired and the governor has remade the board of trustees with conservative figures.
Monday, DeSantis posted to X that Diaz “has hit the ground running – the sky is the limit for UWF!”
Although final contracts are negotiated by the UWF board chair, Diaz can expect between $800,000 and $1.2 million in total compensation, the Phoenix previously reported after trustees approved presidential search criteria. Trustees said at the time that they preferred that candidates hold a relevant graduate degree, although that was not required.
Diaz holds a bachelor’s degree from St. Thomas University and a master’s in educational leadership from Nova Southeastern. He’s previously served as chief operating officer at Doral College, an online school focusing on dual enrollment courses for charter school students.
As education commissioner, Diaz held a seat on the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees the State University System.
The desired candidate will have a “record of successful leadership in a complex organization, preferably in higher education, government, or a large nonprofit entity,” according to the criteria decided by the committee.

State law exempts university president searches from public scrutiny, so there’s no public record of who else had applied for the position.
Board of Governors regulations state that search committees are responsible for “recommending an unranked list of final applicants.”
“The search committee is required to submit more than two qualified applicants, selected by a majority vote of the search committee, to the board of trustees for consideration, other than in exceptional circumstances making fulfillment of this requirement infeasible, in which case the committee must discuss why fewer than three applicants are being recommended and whether additional applications should be considered,” BOG regulations state.
UWF is not the only school to interpret “unranked list” as a single candidate. The University of Florida named Santa Ono as its sole finalist earlier this year. Ono was later rejected after some conservatives expressed disfavor about his past diversity stances.
At Florida International University, three finalists were selected, according to the university, but two withdrew after discovering they were not the sole finalist, making former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez the sole finalist.

This is Stories From The States. I’m Chris Fitzsimon. Here at States Newsroom, we know there’s a lot going on around the country every week, in every state. This week, we’re talking about mid-decade redistricting. Texas and California have grabbed most of the headlines in the battle. Now, GOP led states like Indiana are facing pressure from the president to redistrict. All while some states like Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio and Utah already have enacted new maps for the 2026 midterm elections. But Utah’s case is unique. That redistricting fight was spearheaded by Utah voters who ultimately won. Firstm that’s where we’re heading, and we’ll hear from one of the plaintiffs in the case.
Katharine Biele  
All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Then we’ll check in with the Brennan Center for Justice to find out if all this mid-decade redistricting business is actually normal. Up first is a Utah News Dispatch reporter. We’ll hear from her in just a moment.
Chris Fitzsimon  
A Utah judge recently approved a redistricting map that would give Democratic candidates a good chance at winning one of the state’s US House seats in the 2026 midterm elections. This redistricting dispute started back in 2018 though, way before the Trump administration started pushing for mid-decade redistricting to rig the maps to try to keep control of the US House in 2026. Katie McKellar, a senior reporter from the Utah News Dispatch, has been closely covering this for years. She joins us now. Hi, Katie.
Katie McKellar  
Hi. Thanks for having me.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thanks for being with us. All right, let’s jump in. Tell us about this. This case, it nowhere near started just this year. Give us a little bit of background on what’s at stake here.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, there’s a long history here in Utah. So back in 2021, that year, the Republican majority Utah legislature repealed and replaced a ballot initiative that was narrowly approved by Utah voters in 2018. And that ballot initiative  driven by anti gerrymandering groups called Better Boundaries, sought to implement an independent redistricting process here in Utah, meant to guard against gerrymandering, and they argued that there were too many Democratic, independent and even more moderate Republican voters here that were being dispersed or cracked through the redistricting process. And so they put Proposition 4 on the ballot for voters to decide whether it should become law, and it passed. But Republican leaders here have long believed that they have the final say when it comes to ballot initiatives, and so they repealed and replaced Prop Four with a law known as SB 200 and essentially, what that law did was water down Prop Four and turn the independent redistricting commission that was supposed to draw the state’s maps into an advisory body that could ignore those maps.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So basically, the voters decided they wanted to do this with the independent commission. The Republican legislature said, ‘No, thanks’. We’re going to turn this into an advisory commission, even though the voters didn’t want that?
Katie McKellar  
Exactly, exactly. And so instead, they repealed and replaced that law with one that that turned into an advisory body that they could ignore. And so even though that independent commission drew a set of maps that year, lawmakers do their own and they adopted those maps and that congressional map and that set created four solidly Republican congressional districts, and that prompted pro democracy groups like the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who felt disenfranchised by that new congressional map to get together and sue. And they alleged that that 2021 map was a blatant gerrymander, and that lawmakers violated their rights to reform their government through a ballot initiative.
Chris Fitzsimon
So really, the lawsuit was about the ballot initiative as much as it was the districts. Sounds like.
Katie McKellar  
Absolutely it was about both. It was about gerrymandering and lawmakers overstepping on a ballot initiative. And so after that case spent several years winding through the courts. Ultimately, the Utah Supreme Court, on an appeal, sided with the plaintiffs on the claim that lawmakers violated their right to alter and reform their government, and that led a district court judge to deem the 2021 map the result of an unconstitutional process. So she didn’t rule, she didn’t weigh in on whether it was a gerrymander, but she did say it was an unlawful map because it was the result of repealing and replacing a ballot initiative. And so she she voided that 2021 map and ruled that Utah must go through a court ordered redistricting process to put in place a lawful congressional map to be used next year in the 2026 elections, and that’s how we got where we are today.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Thank you. It’s not a simple topic. I think you did a great job explaining it for us. And so tell us when the Trump administration got involved and people thought that they were going to have some role in this.
Katie McKellar  
So while mid, mid decade redistricting is is a debate happening all over the country right now, Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process right now is unique, because this was court ordered this was a judge saying Utah lawmakers overstepped, we need to fix it. And so it’s very unique compared to the other conversations happening in states like California and Texas.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Right. And so now tell us what happened. The map that was chosen does appear to give Democrats a chance at winning one of these districts. From what I’ve read, a lot of this revolves around Salt Lake County, which is the most populous county in the state.
Katie McKellar  
Yeah, so over the last several a couple of months, really, this court ordered process took a long time. The judge took several weeks to hear from both sides, the legislative attorneys and attorneys for the plaintiffs and each side. She gave an opportunity to submit some maps to consider. So the legislature voted on a map known as map C that lawmakers contended abided by Proposition Four’s criteria, and that would be fair. And you know, looking at that map compared to the 2021 map, it is true that it was a bit more competitive for Democrats, but it would still result in four pretty solidly red congressional districts, and then the plaintiff submitted two options. One map was a lease change map based off of the map that the lawmakers approved to just kind of tweak the boundary so it didn’t split as many cities. Or they also submitted another one that was drawn with an algorithm that was created based off of Proposition Four’s criteria, and that map is the one the judge ultimately picked. And in that map, there’s the first congressional district is concentrated around the northern part of Salt Lake County, which is a very populated part of Utah. And the result is three pretty, like, really safe Republican districts, and one pretty safe Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon
Somebody described to me that the old maps that they were under and some of the proposals that weren’t adopted look like a pizza cutter had done them that they divided up most of the population into into pizza slices so the Republicans could maintain control.
Katie McKellar  
Oh yeah, that has been a strategy for a long time. And you know, the plaintiffs in the lawsuit alleged was blatant gerrymandering Republicans here, they like to describe it as pizza slice, or mixing urban and rural voices, so that urban and rural voices in each district are represented on the federal level. Well, the plaintiffs allege, you know, that’s just cover to crack Salt Lake County into four different pieces so that there would not be a Democratic district.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction there, when the court chose the map that gives the Democrats a chance to claim one of the districts?
Katie McKellar  
Oh, the the plaintiffs in the case were thrilled. They thought that was a great win, because that map, to them, was based wholly off of Propositions Four’s criteria. Democrats were thrilled, Republicans were angry. There’s been a ton of backlash from Republicans. I mean, even before the judge picked that map, some Republican lawmakers began saying, if she didn’t pick their map that they submitted to the court map see that they would argue it would amount to malfeasance, because they still firmly believe, despite all the court rulings, that the Utah constitution ultimately gives them and only them, the ability to pick maps in the redistricting process. And so couple of things have been happening. Republicans and a group called Utahns for Representative Government are pursuing another ballot initiative to repeal Proposition Four to go on the ballot in 2026 for voters to consider. And in the meantime, I think we can still expect plenty of court appeals, legislative attorneys saying they’ll be willing to take it all the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. But you know, barring some crazy upset, because we’ve already hit the deadline for a map to be used in 2026 even if they went on appeal. I don’t know if there’s even time to put a different map in place for 2026 but 2028 who knows? We’ll just have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon  
The judge has been attacked, right? And there’s even been like talks of impeaching the judge. It really has gone to a new level it seems like.
Katie McKellar
We’ll have to see if those threats are just threats, or if, if lawmakers actually try to carry that out. One lawmaker has said he’s open a bill file to do articles of impeachment, but I haven’t been able to get the senate president or the house speaker on record solidly saying yes, we’re going to try to impeach her, so we’ll have to see.
Chris Fitzsimon
Right. Well, we will check back with you. Katie, thanks for all your great reporting there, and thanks for being with us. Thanks. Chris. Katie McKellar is a senior reporter at the Utah News Dispatch. That outlet is a part of state’s newsroom. Since chatting with Katie, the Utah judiciary has issued a statement addressing threats to Judge Diana Gibson, who ruled on the maps. They addressed the heated political reaction as well as the threats of violence to Judge Gibson saying, “threats of violence against judges or court personnel are unacceptable, dangerous and may violate state of federal laws”. As Katie mentioned, the approved map drawn by the plaintiffs of Utah’s redistricting lawsuit was a collective effort of nonpartisan groups, faith based organizations, a legal center, and a handful of Salt Lake County voters who all said they just wanted fair maps. In a moment, we’ll meet one of the plaintiffs from that case. We’ll be right back.

After almost seven years of a legal battle against a GOP led state legislature in Utah, a broad coalition of plaintiffs finally had their congressional district map approved by federal judge. It wasn’t easy, and has involved a referendum that lawmakers ignored, legal machinations and now calls to impeach a judge. Joining us now with one of the people who was part of this redistricting fight, Katharine Biele is the President of the League of Women Voters of Utah. She joins us now. Hello, Katharine. Thanks for being here.
Katharine Biele  
Thank you so much Chris.
Chris Fitzsimon  
So Katharine, your group was one of the plaintiffs in this case, and now a judge has approved the maps you and other Utahns had sought, right.
Katharine Biele  
They did. I mean, we were thrilled.
Chris Fitzsimon
You were thrilled. I was gonna ask your reaction. Were you surprised?
Katharine Biele  
Not completely. We had very good arguments. I mean, our arguments were based in the Utah State Constitution, Article One, Section two, which gives the citizens the right to change the form of government. So we had a very good argument. We were never trying to leave the legislature out of it. We totally expect the legislature to draw the maps. All we require is that they draw them fairly.
Chris Fitzsimon
Just to be clear, the maps that had been drawn or that were drawn by the General Assembly, or the ones that they were were promoting, really, I always hear it as an outsider to Utah, hear it described as like pizza slices, which keeps sort of all the parts of Salt Lake City separated in effect.
Katharine Biele
And it’s not just Salt Lake City, but Salt Lake Salt Lake County. This is where the hub of the population lives. They divided the county into four slices going down to the very tip of Southern Utah, St George, so we in urban Salt Lake have the same representative as those down in southern Utah.
Chris Fitzsimon  
And what was the reaction from the legislature and the proponents, or the I guess the people who wanted to continue to draw the maps the way they had been drawn.
Katharine Biele  
The legislature is up in arms. They will not stop this should have been easy. I mean, how hard is it to draw a fair map? It’s not a partisan thing. It is. Just look, this is these are communities of interest. Salt Lake County is one community of interest. Southern Utah is another. The rural, rural areas are another. So it’s just really not that hard. They were furious because they thought we were taking away their responsibility, which we are not.
Chris Fitzsimon  
You know, Utah has a reputation, I think, from afar, and I think I’m sure it feels that way a lot of times in Utah you have Republican governors in the past have reached across the aisle. There’s been a lot of national publicity. They’ve been the leaders in sort of a different kind of campaigning. So I think there’s a perception that politics in Utah hasn’t gotten to the bitter level that we’ve seen around the country. And yet it feels like in this case, maybe that has changed some.
Katharine Biele  
I will say that it may be changing a little. This is all based around the national politics and the kind of national politics that are coming down to Utah. There are many people here, many legislators who think that whatever Trump says and whatever he does, they should do however. We also have enough. I mean, we respect the legislature, and the legislators do have good intentions. They just have to get away from the whole idea that only Republicans can be in charge of everything.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Do you have trouble as a citizen activist or a member of an organization, getting some voters to understand really what’s at stake. I think sometimes, even when I’m talking to folks about redistricting battles, and we’ve had a lot of them in states that I’ve been in, people sometimes their eyes glaze over and they want to talk about a lot of other issues. But this feels like a in some cases, a technical thing.
Katharine Biele  
Well, and this is it’s hard, it is very difficult, and I think the legislature has made it even. More difficult on purpose. They want the citizens to be confused and to say, ‘Okay, we’re going to leave it to the legislature, because we don’t get it.’ It’s not that hard. All you have to do is make a map that is fair to everyone. Everyone’s voice should matter. We don’t all win. We just need to have a voice. I have heard as a league of women voters. We register voters all the time. What they say to us is, why should we vote? We know what the outcome will be. This at least gives those voters a chance. Is it over? No, it probably will never be over. I mean, the legislature has talked about appealing. You know, if they appeal to the Supreme Court, that is really a delaying tactic, because our Supreme Court ruled unanimously in our favor. So it’s unlikely that they would do anything different. But I can’t say I’m not a lawyer. They have talked about running an initiative, which is ironic, a citizens initiative to overturn a citizens initiative. And that is exactly what you said. It’s because people are confused, and they think, Oh, well, we can confuse them more, and they will just vote our way to get rid of Proposition Four.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Well, I really appreciate you being with us, and thanks for all your efforts for democracy there in Utah. Thank you very much.
Katharine Biele
Thank you too.

This week, a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 2026 election. Texas was the first state pushed by the President to take part in this unusual mid-decade redistricting scheme. This move has led state lawmakers across the country to talk about redistricting when they only discuss it every 10 years. Is all this mid decade redistricting now going to be the new normal nationally? Coming up, an expert from the Brennan Center for Justice will help us figure that out. Then Evening Wrap newsletter author Danielle Gaines will join us about the story she’s looking out for. We’ll be right back.

Congressional district maps are generally redrawn every decade after the US Census, unless a court intervenes and orders state lawmakers to redraw them to settle a lawsuit. But the Trump administration has been pushing GOP led states to redistrict this year, purely for political reasons, to make it harder for Democrats to take over control of the House in the 2026 election. What are the long term effects of the break from precedent, and what happens if it becomes the new normal and maps are drawn every two years instead of every 10? We spoke with Kareem Crayton. He’s the vice president of the Brennan Center for Justice’s Washington DC office, and he has a doctorate in political science. Just a note. We spoke with Kareem before the news broke in Texas this week where a federal court blocked Texas from using their new congressional maps for the 26th election. Now they have to go back to their 2021 maps, which, by the way, are already gerrymandered by the Republican controlled General Assembly. He joins us now, Kareem, thanks for being here. Delight to be with you. Thank you. Well, what do you make of this overall? I think if we were sitting here a year ago, it’s hard to imagine the pressure being brought on so many states to dramatically change the way they draw district lines.
Kareem Crayton
Yeah, about a year ago, I think most of us thought that the only movement was going to be in the courts, with things that were already on the table. I think it is hard to have predicted such a massive number of states jumping into the pool and that most of the disruption and chaos is coming really at the instigation of the White House.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It puts a good government advocates like folks at the Brennan Center in a bit of a tough place at the beginning of all this national mid-decade redistricting discourse, after Governor Greg Abbott announced that he was doing that in Texas, there was a lot of discussion about, should states that have commissions or states that are committed to trying to drawing on gerrymandered districts also play what did you make of that sort of the machinations there?
Kareem Crayton  
Well, I would say the tough position that we’ve been in is actually one that preceded Governor Abbott’s move, and it is where the Supreme Court of the United States failed to adopt a national standard. In the absence of that, notwithstanding the fact that the Supreme Court said it had no particular opinion about political gerrymandering, number of states saw that as an invitation. And I think what we’re seeing is the result of that. So both. For what Texas has done, and California and other states have done, in reaction, is in some ways not surprising, if also quite lamentable.
Chris Fitzsimon  
To have a legislature, for example, Texas, who already gerrymandered the districts with their own majority come back and, in effect, re gerrymander them. Is this? What is this unprecedented? Had you seen anything like this before?
Kareem Crayton  
I think, writ large, it is unprecedented. It is fair to say that states have gone back to the well in the past, first time where we’ve seen, you know, the legislature in Texas at least go back and say, Oh, we didn’t gerrymander enough. And certainly, when you add to that, the National reaction where some states are going back to say, the public, we want to do a re gerrymandering of this state, is that okay, in light of all the other things that you’ve seen, and in California, the people said, Yes,
Chris Fitzsimon  
I covered redistricting in North Carolina for a long time. And what do you make of this? For the voters? I think it’s already sort of hard to explain to folks who don’t do this for a living, who are just living their lives trying to make ends meet, and now they can’t vote for the person they used to their districts are different. How do you communicate this effectively, the importance of this to folks who aren’t really involved in the political process.
Kareem Crayton  
The people that are supposed to be served by the redrawing of districts are the people who are supposed to be represented, and those are voters, and not the electeds. And what you see with these changes, in the absence of a national standard is that people who live right next to each other, who share the same city, who understand the same sets of issues that affect them all are now divided by essentially arbitrary lines, and they’re done really for no other purpose than to serve a political interest, and in fact, an interest that might not even be in the state that’s supposed to be represented. So I think all of these, you know, line drawing and re line drawing efforts are bringing people farther and farther away from power and democratic system. People aren’t supposed to be, particularly in elections, the source of power, and that’s of real concern.
Chris Fitzsimon  
We also had some news recently from the Indiana Capitol Chronicle, despite visits from the vice president and pressure from the president, many Republicans there are choosing not to participate in this mid cycle redistricting.
Kareem Crayton
Well, we’re seeing a lot of folks, I think, look at this and say, one, what does it cost us to try to do this? Yes, maybe the White House really wants us to do it, but what do we lose by going back to the will and redrawing the map? And frankly, it is probably not off of anybody’s mind. The fact that we had elections in November that I think, surprised a lot of people. And so if you’re doing these redraws, you’ve got to think about the world, not just as it exists right now, but what it’s going to look like a year from now and beyond. And in places where, if you’re a Republican you’re looking at, you know, what was pretty much a clean sweep behind the Democratic Party. And you got to wonder, is there a line at which and pardon the pun, but yes, if you cross that line in drawing new district maps, do you make yourself less likely in a democratic wave year to be competitive? Again? This is sort of done from the perspective of partisanship. But what is lost in all of this is the people ultimately are going to want to choose. And I think the real challenge that a lot of people are grappling with is, well, look, we might want a certain political outcome, but if the public overwhelmingly sees us as grabbing more power than we’re due, it might be that there’s a wave so big that we can’t gerrymander our way out of it.
Chris Fitzsimon
You mentioned a national standard. Is there some, some world, ideal world, where all this publicity and frustration leads us back to a conversation about how everybody should do redistricting in some fair and open and honest way?
Kareem Crayton
Well, I certainly hope so. The Congress of the United States still has the ability to say to the public, you know what? We hear you. And there should be a national standard, and we’re going to carve one. To carve one out that might not be true, that may or may not be true of this existing Congress, but the public is frustrated enough. It’s entirely possible that, you know, the public votes for people who will step into the breach. And by the way, it’s important to note you now hear both Republicans and Democrats, often, many of them on the losing end of a redistricting fight. Say, though there should be a national standard. So I think the more that becomes, as you point out, a priority for the public as a whole, but also for the elected to recognize. You know, in the main, this may or may not be a matter of whether or not I gain from a particular line drop, or whether the country gains overall from a system that makes sure that people at the forefront of how districts get drawn
Chris Fitzsimon
Well more to come, for sure. Dr Crayton, thank you very much for being with us. We appreciate your insights.
Kareem Crayton  
Great pleasure. Thank you for having me
Chris Fitzsimon  
Coming up. We’ll check with evening rap newsletter writer Danielle Gaines, stay with us.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Joining us now is Danielle Gaines. She writes States Newsrooms, daily newsletter called The Evening Wrap Danielle, it’s great to see you. Let’s let’s jump in. Talk about the big things this week and what’s coming up. First of all. What big stories Did you notice this week?
Danielle Gaines
Well, we’ve had some coverage about the changes that are coming to programs in the United States who have typically assisted refugees when they arrive here, and so our reporter in Rhode Island spent some time at the refugee Dream Center there, and she was talking with women in a class that’s meant to improve their English skills, but it’s also about so much more for them. So it’s like cultural, emotional, social. It was a really beautiful story just getting to know the women, but it also kind of touched on the fact that this was a place that is meant to be filled with love help these people feel at home, and instead, a lot of the emotion there has been replaced with fear, which is all too familiar to this group of people and uncertainty the folks who go there are among hundreds of 1000s of lawful immigrants who will soon lose food benefits in the US, as provisions of the one big, beautiful Bill act take effect. And in addition to food benefits, there are other things coming up that are big changes for programs that we established to help people get on their feet so the work requirements and Medicaid are going to be a problem. These are folks who aren’t working because they’re trying to gain proficiency in English so they can work, and they’ll lose support during that process. The story also had an economic analysis of refugees and immigrants in Rhode Island that I found really interesting. So 15% of the state are immigrants, and $5.5 million in annual food benefits will be gone under these provisions, and soon child tax credits will be gone as well, to the tune of $30 million so it’s a big shift on a family level, but also, you know, on a state economic level,
Chris Fitzsimon  
Yeah, I think that bill still feels like it’s hanging over so many people. When the when those provisions take effect?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, one of the coordinators there said that’s going to be, quote, disastrous, once it all kind of takes shape together.
Chris Fitzsimon
What about coming up next? What about things to look for?
Danielle Gaines  
Yeah, so this week, I’ve been featuring a special mini series from our reproductive rights reporting team on the state of state shield protections for abortion medications. And so there’s a lot that has been going on with that, and a lot that is going to be going on with that. So over the series of stories, our team looked at the status of state shield laws as well as efforts to puncture them, as well as challenges to mifepristone in lawsuits and the federal regulatory level. So there is an ongoing lawsuit related to the federal regulations The ACLU is seeking information, kind of just looking at what is the Trump administration’s FDA actually looking at with these long established medications, and who are they talking to as they’re looking at it. So that’s a lawsuit to be on the lookout for. And then on the state side of things, shield laws that protect abortion providers have been established in lots of states to protect them from out of state lawsuits, but a new bill is taking effect in Texas, and that aims to kind of puncture the durability of those laws. It’s was described as the first bill in the country to explicitly target shield laws and shield providers, and it gives any Texan the power to sue anyone involved in mailing an abortion pill to the state. So we’ll have to see what unfolds there.
Chris Fitzsimon  
It seems like then, I mean, it’s been ongoing, but the next frontier of the whole abortion debate seems like the battle over these, this medication and access to it. Yes, agreed. Well, what about one last thing? What shall we leave us together with?
Danielle Gaines
Well, just a time for Thanksgiving. I figured that we’d talk about food waste, not to be a downer, timely, but our friends at the Iowa capital dispatch covered a study by the State Department of Natural Resources, and that study found that Iowans throw away, on average, 200 pounds of food each year. When you account for industrial food waste. On top of that, it’s about 300 pounds. Wow. And that’s actually less than what the EPA estimates for the country as a whole, which is between 492 pounds and more than 1000 pounds. So this study was just a way to look at how to cut down on food waste, how food waste can be diverted, how to avoid it in the first place. So I thought I’d share some of the tips that I gleaned from it. You know, the first one is to purchase your food thoughtfully, and then, in terms of disposal, you can seek ways to donate something that you don’t want, share it with a neighbor, a friend, compost it instead of sending it to the landfill. My personal favorite is to just immediately freeze. So if you have a veggie tray at Thanksgiving, like, don’t just shove it the back of your fridge to let it waste away. Cut it up right away, put it in a baggie, and then some night, you’ll want soup, and it’ll be right there, ready cut up for you.
Chris Fitzsimon  
That’s a great idea. It does seem at every party, the veggie tray is the last to go.

I know it’s such a shame. I also think you could waffle iron just about anything. From Thanksgiving, which is a great way to use up leftovers.
Chris Fitzsimon  
Wow, I haven’t thought of that one. I might try that. Do I really appreciate you as always you being with us.
Danielle Gaines  
Yes, thank you so much.

Kevin Ryan dies in hospice at 73,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-state-rep-kevin-ryan-dies-in-hospice-at-73/,"Rep. Kevin Ryan, a Montville Democrat who served in the state House of Representatives through the tenures of five governors, died Sunday.","Rep. Kevin Ryan, a Montville Democrat who served in the state House of Representatives through the tenures of five governors and found redemption after a mid-career struggle with alcohol, died Sunday night, two days after entering hospice care in West Hartford. Ryan was 73.
Ritter House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed the death of Ryan, who had been in treatment for cancer. Ryan had made no public disclosure about his illness and was relatively circumspect with many colleagues and staff, finally consenting to a steady stream of visitors.
Ritter and his father, former House Speaker Thomas D. Ritter, visited Ryan on Sunday. The elder Ritter was elected speaker by the class of lawmakers elected in 1992, Ryan among them. At his death, Ryan was serving the younger Ritter as a deputy speaker. 
Ryan was elected in 1992 from the 139th House District of Ledyard, Montville and Norwich, a year after the tumultuous 1991 session that produced the state income tax under the leadership of a third-party governor, Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
He arrived in Hartford with a multiple degrees from Villanova and a doctorate in optometry from the Pennsylvania College of Optometry. He had a keen sense for detail that made him valued as a bill screener. He later earned a master’s degree in community psychology from the University of New Haven.
But he also had a blue-collar sensibility and affinity for working-class struggles and served for eight years as the co-chair of the Labor and Public Employees Committee.
“He and his father worked for a living, delivering wholesale groceries throughout New England,” said Michael Caron, a former Republican House member. “He was a man of faith, integrity, resilience and redemption.”
“Kevin never failed to stand up for the working families of our state, helping to shape Connecticut’s public health and labor laws,” said Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, who served with Ryan in the House. “And, whether it was by educating our college students in his day job or entertaining my own children when they visited the legislature, Kevin was deeply committed to enriching the lives of our youngest residents.”
Ryan had taught physics at the University of New Haven.
Growing up with a father who ran his own business was a lasting influence, Ryan said in a profile published by the Council of State Governments, a group he led last year.
“It reflects in a lot of my decisions,” Ryan said. “I keep in mind the small business owner since that’s who I’m most familiar with, and really recognizing [that] a lot of people consider business owners to be honest. A lot of them are very hardworking individuals who are just trying to be able to pay their bills and take care of their families.” 
The legislature became family to Ryan, who was unmarried. Ryan would be a frequent holiday dinner guest Caron’s home. He was godfather to Caron’s son.
As he ended the first of his three decades in the House, Ryan’s struggles with alcohol became public. He was sentenced to 120 days in prison in 2001 after a third conviction for driving under the influence. He promised to respond to constituents from prison.
“I have always taken great pride in providing service to the good people of the 139th District and that will continue during my absence,” he said then.
Friends rallied around him. Ryan entered rehab, and Caron said his friend had no further troubles with alcohol. His political rehab was similarly successful: Ryan easily was reelected in 2022, winning by 1,000 votes.
“He would not let it define who he was,” Caron said. “He never had another problem. He did his penance.”
Ryan had a sarcastic sense of humor, evident to anyone who passed his desk on the aisle in the House.
“If he didn’t jab, he didn’t like you,” Caron said.
Ritter described Ryan as someone who spoke bluntly in private yet viewed himself as a team player. 
“He told you what he was thinking,” Ritter said. “For all his fierce independence, Kevin was loyal at the end of the day.”
Funeral arrangements were incomplete. A service is expected after the Thanksgiving holiday.
The state flag over the state Capitol was lowered to half-staff Monday at the order of Gov. Ned Lamont.
“He loved public service and was always ready and willing to listen to the views of the people he represented and take action to support their interests,” Lamont said. “Throughout my tenure as governor, Kevin has been one of the friendliest legislators that I’ve had the opportunity to work with, and I am going to miss his clever, sharp and humorous personality.”
Ryan missed the special session in November, but he served throughout the annual session that ended at midnight June 4. He cast a vote at 11:52 p.m., the final act of the House in its 2025 regular session.
Ritter and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, noted in a joint statement that Ryan “took great pride in being the only person in the building who pronounced Norwich correctly.”
In Ryan’s view, there was no R in the city’s name.
“The Capitol will feel emptier without him,” they said, “but the impact he made on his community, on this institution, and on each of us will endure.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2024_0501_SR_LastDaySession_105-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-24 11:57:57.257274
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 16:50:00+00:00,CT Mirror,PODCAST: Is nuclear energy the future in CT?,CT Mirror's Long Story Short,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/podcast-ct-nuclear-energy-future/,WSHU's Ebong Udoma and CT Mirror's Jan Ellen Spiegel discuss her article about whether nuclear plays a role in Connecticut's energy future.,"Connecticut has some of the highest energy prices in the country, and experts and lawmakers are in a race to find a cheaper, environmentally friendly option.
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Jan Ellen Spiegel to discuss her article, “Could CT have a nuclear energy future? Not if you’re in a rush,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Jan’s article here.
WSHU: Hello, Jan. Policymakers have been discussing small modular nuclear reactors as a more accessible and faster way for Connecticut to increase power production, particularly in the wake of the Trump administration’s limited support for new wind and solar energy projects. What prompted you to write this particular story?
JES: What prompted me to do this particular story is, in a sense, exactly what you said, that they were not putting any emphasis on other forms of carbon-free energy, and states like Connecticut have laws on the books where they have to do a certain amount of that. So what are the alternatives here? And I wanted to look at a whole series of things to really understand what’s out there, what’s real, and do some reality checking on what all this actually can mean. And nuclear gets talked about, as you just pointed out, all the time. And I knew enough, I guess, to be dangerous to know that that probably wasn’t quite an accurate way of looking at it. And it turns out it is not quite an accurate way to look at it.
WSHU: So basically, you found out that small modular nuclear reactors don’t actually exist.
JES: For the most part, no. They have been talked about for quite some time. Various sorts of newer reactor technology have been out there, and it’s not so new, because it’s been around somewhere between 50 and 70 years. Countries, various companies have been working with this, and they really haven’t got it to a point where it’s going to work very well, so there’s going to be a very long time before any of these can really get built.
WSHU: You found out that they’re not that small either.
JES: There’s a category called advanced nuclear energy. It’s kind of what I refer to as a garbage pail term, in which you put a whole bunch of stuff in there. There are these supposed small modular reactors, which can be, you know, 300-400 megawatts. They can go smaller than that, but at this point, that’s pretty big for a power plant. Then there are also these micro reactors, which can be very, very, very small. They exist even less than the small modular reactors do, and have really been used anywhere. But they’re kind of a different sort of animal, and there’s still a whole lot of action that would need to happen in the US and other countries as well, before these things can really come into existence. They also cost a ton of money.
WSHU: Okay, let’s talk a little bit about cost. We haven’t had a nuclear reactor built in years in the U.S. The last one was built in Georgia. How long ago was that?
JES: There were two reactors that were added to some existing reactors in Georgia, and those were finished in 2023 and 2024. They are a new type of reactor, but they’re full-size reactors. They were more than double their original budget. They were seven years late. They were developed by Westinghouse, which has been in the nuclear reactor business for a long time. Prior to that, it had been like 30 years. A lot of it has to do with the various nuclear accidents that happened over time. And there was a lot of, hey, let’s think twice about doing another one of these. But those reactors, what I was hearing from a lot of different people, and uniquely in this story, I was hearing the same things over and over again from people. Usually, you get a certain amount of nuance and slightly different opinions, but I was hearing the same thing over and over again, the big reactors that were built down in Georgia, they feel are actually a really good technology. Now, whether you can take those big reactors and make them into a smaller one would remain to be seen. We don’t know that yet.
WSHU: Now, even in Connecticut, Millstone, the operator of Millstone, doesn’t appear too keen on this, although there was talk about having some modular reactors set up at the same site where the Millstone reactor is right now. You talked to them, and they didn’t seem too keen on the idea of these modular reactors. Could you talk a little bit more about that?
JES: Yeah, what I need to do first is kind of explain the pricing issue on this, because this is where their reluctance comes in. Yes, the upfront costs of building a smaller reactor are going to be less. They’re smaller. They may take up less space. The front-loaded price is just going to be lower. But if you look at the long term, and I heard this over and over and over again, if you look at the price per unit of power produced, it will actually be more expensive. And it’s basic economies of scale. The bigger you go, the smaller the price per unit. I mean, this goes for nuclear plants. It probably goes for toilet paper too. That is where the issue comes down for Connecticut, where we have a deregulated utility system, where rate payers will bear the costs of power development of any sort.
And as I’m sure everyone is aware, there have been tremendous concerns about this over the last, well, forever, but you know, really seriously over the last 10-15 years. So it’s that deregulated system that we have that concerns the owners of Millstone Dominion, which is looking at potentially developing a small modular reactor down in Virginia. And, you know, frankly, it was a surprise to me when I got a comment back that what the spokesperson said, we’re not opposed to an SMR at Millstone, she said, but it might not have the regulatory environment for run, for one, the upfront costs of an SMR, though less expensive than traditional nuclear, are significant enough that Connecticut’s deregulated market might not support such a project. Now, I have been hearing that. I heard that from her, and I heard that the commissioner of unsolicited from the Commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said the same thing. Various nuclear experts said to me, Well, you know, Connecticut has a deregulated utility. It might be really tough to do there. So this kept coming up over and over again, and that might be the issue for Connecticut, at least the way things exist right now.
WSHU: Now, also, you have a situation here where Katie Dykes, the Commissioner, also spoke with you about the fact that you need a lot of lead time for any of this new technology and energy generation, and there’s a lot of money, so you have to plan years ahead. And she gave the example of the wind power that ran into some problems from the Trump administration this past summer, which took quite a while to get to where we are with wind. And so this is energy that will not be available in the very near future.
JES: Yeah, and again, it is something I heard from everybody. There are two components. Number one, just planning ahead on a technological basis, with that much of a lead time, the actual technology, the odds of it potentially changing, are extremely high. We see that happen all the time. You know, think about your computer, as soon as you take it out of the box, it’s dated, right? This stuff changes. The other piece of it is the need for additional power. Seems to be more of a now thing, not 10-15, years in the future, and in talking to a former chair of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Allison McFarlane, she basically said, if you’re looking to address climate change or address the needs from AI, something like that, which is, you know, presumed to use up a lot of power, she said, it means you have to address it immediately, like yesterday. And none of these technologies are available, even if they were available this very second, you’re still talking 10-15 years down the road. Everyone has said, don’t even think about this stuff before, sometime in the 20-30s, that is not going to do a whole lot of good if you need the power now.
WSHU: I like the quote you ended your article with, which is a quote from MacFarlane herself, and she says, to put all our treasure in nuclear energy right now is not very smart.
JES: This is someone who ran the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a while, but you know, again, it’s what you also hear from all kinds of people who are looking at various forms of power. And what you go with, what you often hear them say, is, we want an all of the above strategy, and that is what goes. For nuclear, it goes for wind, it goes for solar, it goes for all those things. And the notion that you would go entirely nuclear is really not in keeping with that, or in keeping with any kind of strategy that would really be able to keep your grid stable.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1002_SR_MillstoneTour_237-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 16:57:51.257148

The new report also shows that wealthy Idahoans in the top 1% of earners – those with an annual income of $738,300 and above – benefited the most from the income tax cuts. 
The report, “2025 Update: Idaho’s String of Income Tax Cuts Continues to Jeopardize Investments in Public Services,” was published by the Boise-based Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy. 
“The report found that over the past five years since the income tax cuts started, those tax cuts cost the state almost $4 billion in lost revenue during that time,” Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy Policy Director Kendra Knighten said in an interview Friday. “Those are dollars that could have been invested in public education, or that could have gone into improving our roads and public safety. They could have gone into helping support Medicaid to help keep Idahoans healthy. Those are all dollars that the Legislature chose to provide tax relief with instead of investing in our communities, and that is something that we are really concerned about.”
“Beyond that, those are also dollars that we don’t have available to use to respond to in times during a recession,” Knighten said. 
The report was issued just as the state of Idaho is grappling with 3% budget holdbacks, revenue shortfalls and a projected state budget deficit of $58.3 million for the current fiscal year 2026, the Idaho Capital Sun has previously reported. 
In simple terms, revenue is the amount of money the state takes in. The largest sources of state general fund revenue are taxes – specifically the individual income tax, sales tax and corporate income tax. 
This is important because the Idaho Constitution requires the Idaho Legislature to pass a balanced budget every year and prohibits the state from spending more in its budget than the state collects in revenue. 
Cutting taxes has the effect of both reducing the amount of money Idahoans and companies pay in taxes, as well as reducing the amount of revenue available to the state. 
 Idaho income tax cuts benefited wealthy Idahoans, companies, report finds

The new Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy report found that the top 1% of earners making more than $738,300 per year received an average annual tax cut of $20,407 through the income tax cuts.
Meanwhile, the lowest 20% of earners – those with an annual income of less $31,100 – benefited the least from the income tax cuts. The lowest 20% of earners saw their incomes taxes cut by an average of $33 per year, according to the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy report. 
A new report from the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy found that income tax cuts passed by the Idaho Legislature benefited the wealthiest Idahoans the most. (Chart provided courtesy of Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy)
Officials with the policy center warn that reducing state revenue by such large amounts reduces the amount of money the state of Idaho has to invest in core public services like public schools, transportation, public safety and infrastructure.
May Roberts, a policy analyst for the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy, said that if the state cuts budgets during times of economic hardship or uncertainty, it can be difficult to recover from those cuts.
Roberts published a report earlier this month that showed – when adjusted for inflation – Idaho’s per-pupil funding for public schools still lags behind funding levels reached prior to the 2001 recession. Funding levels have recovered from the 2008 recession, Roberts found, but still lag behind where they stood more than 20 years ago, once adjusted for inflation.
“Budget cuts that happen during times of economic hardship have long-lasting effects on the budget,” Roberts said Friday. “It can be difficult to bounce back and reach the level of investment we had in the past once those budgets are cut.” 
 Idaho House Speaker Moyle, conservative orgs say tax cuts benefit Idahoans

Each of the tax cuts tracked in the new report was supported or co-sponsored by House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, the powerful, longest-serving and highest-ranking member of the Idaho House of Representatives.

Efforts to reach Moyle on Friday were unsuccessful.
But for years Moyle has led the charge to reduce income tax rates and championed the benefit of tax cuts.
“This is the people’s money, not ours in government,” Moyle said in a written statement issued in March following the passage of House Bill 40 in the Idaho Legislature. “Today, we are delivering the single largest income tax cut in state history, and we are just getting started. Giving back the people’s money has always been and will remain a top priority of mine as Speaker.”
On April 4, the day the 2025 legislative session adjourned, Moyle predicted the 2025 legislative session would be remembered for tax cuts.
“We have over $400 million in tax relief this year,” Moyle said in an April 4 press conference. 
“We touched income tax. We touched property tax. We touched sales tax. We did a good job of adjusting all of those in a downward trend, which is good for the state of Idaho.”
The conservative Mountain States Policy Center has also championed tax cuts in Idaho.
“While we wait to see which taxes are reduced and by how much this year in Idaho, we should appreciate the good economic policies and fiscal discipline that make this debate possible,” Mountain States Policy Center officials wrote in a newsletter issued Jan. 9, during the first week of the 2025 legislative session. “The ‘Idaho Way’ of prioritizing tax relief leads to a much brighter economic future than the tax-and-spend mentality of our neighbors to the West.”
Idaho Gov. Brad Little, who signed the tax cuts into law, has vocalized both support for cutting taxes and concerns about reducing state revenues.
“Idaho families and businesses need and deserve to keep more of their hard earned money,” Little said in a written statement issued March 6. “It is the right thing to do. Idaho’s continued strength comes from our focus on good government and the Idaho taxpayer. I appreciate my partners in the Legislature for sharing our goal of prioritizing tax relief while taking care of the needs of a growing state. As we continue to deliver historic tax relief, we must ensure our budget balances as the Idaho Constitution requires.”
Efforts to reach Little for comment on Friday were unsuccessful. However, during a February breakfast with Idaho reporters, Little expressed concern about the Idaho Legislature reducing revenue by $450 million during the 2025 legislative session. The $450 million went to paying for new tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses outside of the public school system, including tuition at private, religious schools.
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little told reporters Feb. 25.
 Which laws and tax cuts were analyzed for the new budget report?

For the new report, the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy Center analyzed five years of tax cuts.
Those tax cut laws include:

House Bill 380, 2021 legislative session: The law reduced all income tax brackets, reduced the number of tax brackets from seven to five and reduced the top corporate and income tax brackets to 6.5%
House Bill 436, 2022 legislative session: The law reduced the number of tax brackets from five to four, reduced individual income tax rates, lowered the corporate income tax rate to 6% and provided a one-time tax rebate.
House Bill 1, 2022 special legislative session: The law created a flat income tax system by reducing the number of tax brackets to one, reduced the corporate and income tax rates to 5.8%, provided a one-time tax rebate and provided funding taken from sales tax collections for the public school income fund.
House Bill 521, 2024 legislative session: The law reduced the income tax rate from 5.8% to 5.695% and provided additional money from sales tax collections to funds for public schools.
House Bill 40, 2025 legislative session: The law reduced the income tax rate from 5.695% to 5.3% and made other tax changes.

Sober Ride vouchers are available to help make that decision easier, and officials hope the added convenience encourages more people to take advantage of the program.
Jamie Kleman Contributing Writer Delaware Live | November 2025
The Delaware Office of Highway Safety has officially launched its annual holiday road safety campaign featuring the Sober Ride Vouchers, an effort designed to reduce crashes during what is consistently one of the most dangerous travel periods of the year. With more cars on the road, celebrations that involve alcohol, unpredictable weather and increased foot traffic, state officials say the timing could not be more important.
The campaign features two major components. The first is the popular Sober Rides program, which provides up to twenty dollars in rideshare credits through Lyft and Uber. The program is meant to give residents a simple and reliable way to choose a safe ride home. The first voucher window opens on Thanksgiving Eve, Wednesday, November 26, beginning at 3 p.m. and running through 3 a.m. the following morning. Additional voucher periods will roll out through the holiday season, including New Year’s Eve, which historically brings a spike in impaired driving.
The second component, Safe Holiday Travels, focuses on five core safety areas: impaired driving, speeding, occupant protection, distracted driving, and pedestrian awareness. Through community outreach and informational materials, the initiative encourages drivers and pedestrians to stay alert, slow down, and make intentional, responsible choices.
OHS Director Sharon Bryson emphasized that the holiday season brings a unique blend of risks. She noted that festivities often involve alcohol, families travel between gatherings and crowded shopping areas significantly increase the number of pedestrians. She said the goal of the campaign is to keep the holidays safe for everyone by offering tools, information and accessible alternatives to unsafe driving.
Between 2020 and 2024, Delaware recorded 641 fatal crashes, with 39 percent involving alcohol or drugs. In 2024 alone, the state saw 1,033 impaired driving crashes. Officials say these numbers reinforce the need for programs that not only educate but also provide practical solutions for residents.
As part of the outreach effort, street teams will be positioned across all three counties. Teams will visit bars, restaurants, liquor stores, YMCAs, DMVs, and other high-traffic areas to distribute educational materials in both English and Spanish. Messaging will focus on simple reminders to plan ahead, buckle up, avoid distractions, and be mindful of pedestrians.
For Delaware residents heading out to celebrate this week, the reminder is straightforward. Make a plan, know your options, and choose the safest way home. The Sober Rides vouchers are available to help make that decision easier, and officials hope the added convenience encourages more people to take advantage of the program",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sober-ride-campaign.png,,,2025-11-24 11:57:57.257274

One by one, the prisoners — all immigrants — appeared briefly over video before a special panel of the Louisiana parole board.
The August hearings were unusual in a state that, under Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, has made it increasingly difficult for most prisoners to get early release.
Unlike normal parole hearings, the board didn’t grill the prospective parolees about their crimes — ranging from car theft to vehicular homicide — to gauge their remorse. Nor did it review their disciplinary records to determine if they posed a threat to public safety. And no one was present to represent or speak on behalf of their victims.

In fact, most of the nine men, clad in black-and-white-striped jumpsuits or plain orange ones, did not say a word besides their names and inmate numbers. Only one was even eligible for parole.
But in each case, the three-member panel voted unanimously for release after just a few minutes of consideration.
“Today you’ve been paroled,” panel chair Steve Prator said at the end of every hearing, “to go straight into an ICE facility for deportation from the United States.”
Some thanked the board. Others sat stone-faced or simply nodded.
These days, a 100% grant rate is unheard of for the Louisiana Board of Parole. Where annual parole rates previously stood around 50%, in the two years since Landry became governor, less than a quarter of those eligible have been paroled.
Landry, a former police officer and sheriff’s deputy who served as Louisiana attorney general until 2024, has blasted early release programs as an insult to crime victims, insisting that anyone who is convicted in Louisiana should serve the entirety of their sentence. He pushed Republican lawmakers to eliminate parole entirely for those arrested after Aug. 1, 2024, and to impose strict eligibility requirements for those already in prison.
But this year the same Legislature tossed all of that aside for one category of prisoner: immigrants without legal status. With mass deportations a key policy priority for President Donald Trump, Republican-led state and local governments have taken aggressive steps to deliver. In May, Landry signed an order seeking to “crack down on criminal illegal aliens” by granting the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections and other state agencies the authority to conduct certain Immigration and Customs Enforcement duties. In June, Louisiana lawmakers created an expedited “alien removal process” through the special parole panel that passed with little notice during the last legislative session.
“They have the ability to release a lot of people to parole, and they’re choosing to only do it for this specific group because it’s politically popular,” said Bridget Geraghty, senior counsel with the MacArthur Justice Center, a Chicago-based legal nonprofit focused on prison reform.
At least two other Republican-led states have recently put in place similar initiatives to parole and deport prisoners without legal status. South Dakota paroled 10 immigrant prisoners to be deported over the summer. In Oklahoma, Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt announced in February that the state had identified about 525 prisoners subject to deportation.
Since the Aug. 27 hearings in Louisiana, at least two of the nine men paroled have been deported, while two others from Vietnam are being held at a newly designated immigration detention facility on the grounds of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, according to ICE. Neither ICE nor the Landry administration would answer questions about the locations of the five other parolees or whether they are being deported to their home countries of Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua.
On Sept. 21, ICE’s regional office in New Orleans posted a photo of one of the parolees, Samuel Lara Garcia, handcuffed in front of a staircase leading to a plane. The agency identified Garcia as a citizen of Honduras.
“HOMICIDE DEPORTATION,” the X post blared.
Garcia, 36, had pleaded guilty to negligent homicide and obstruction of justice in a 2022 shooting after an argument at a Baton Rouge house party. He was sentenced to 13 years in 2024 but had served less than two years in prison before being paroled.

A U.S. citizen convicted of the same crime — or any crime — in Louisiana today would not be eligible for release under the new parole laws championed by Landry.
ICE declined an interview request with Madison Sheahan, a former Landry administration official who as deputy ICE director signed the partnership agreement between the agency and the corrections department. The Landry administration did not respond to questions about the new parole panel or the governor’s broader executive order, which was named Operation Geaux.
One member of that task force is Keith Conley, police chief of Kenner, a New Orleans suburb and one of the first Louisiana cities to formally partner with federal immigration authorities during Trump’s second term. He praised the legislation that created the deportation panel in a recent interview. Paroling and deporting prisoners who are illegally in the United States frees up jail space and saves tax dollars, Conley said, “so it just seems like a win, win.”
Under the new law, the deportation panel operates unbound by the restrictions and responsibilities placed on the regular parole process. A parole board is normally tasked with deciding whether prisoners are ready for release based on a number of factors including their behavior behind bars, efforts to rehabilitate, whether they pose a risk to the public and victims’ opinions.
During the August hearings, however, the board was not required to abide by the eligibility restrictions imposed by the Legislature last year, including the requirement that prisoners have clean disciplinary records for at least three years and low-risk scores as determined by an algorithm.
“Parole granted for the purpose of deportation is fundamentally different from discretionary parole granted to individuals who have demonstrated readiness for community supervision,” Francis Abbott, executive director of the parole board, told Verite News and ProPublica. “In these cases, the individuals are present in the United States unlawfully and have been convicted of criminal offenses.”
To be eligible to appear before the new panel, prisoners must have a federal deportation notice and not have been convicted of a sex offense or a violent crime that carries a sentence of more than 10 years. (Louisiana law does not consider negligent homicide to be a violent crime.)
Christopher Walters, deputy executive counsel with the Landry administration, said at a May legislative hearing that the state has identified about 390 prisoners who might be eligible to be paroled and deported. The corrections department would not verify or update that number.
“It’s an ongoing process to determine eligibility for this specific legislation,” Derrick Ellis, the department’s deputy secretary, said in a recent interview.
There are no more hearings scheduled for the remainder of the year, according to the parole board.
Unlike typical parolees, who are required to check in regularly with their parole officers and prohibited from unauthorized travel, those paroled to be deported are not placed under any supervision. Once deported, they are released with one stipulation: Do not return to the United States.
Louisiana law says those who do return will be forced to serve the remainder of their sentences. But that may not be enough of a deterrent. Margaret Hay, first assistant district attorney with the Jefferson Parish District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted one of the deported men, said prosecutors are concerned parolees convicted of violent crimes “may, very quickly, just be right back in this country.”
“There’s no guarantee that our border will remain as secure as I believe that it might be right now,” said Hay, who nevertheless said she supports the initiative.
ProPublica and Verite News contacted the embassies and consulates for Mexico, Nicaragua, Honduras and Vietnam to learn how those countries manage the repatriation of deportees whose U.S. prison sentences were cut short. None responded to multiple phone calls and emails.
Another issue at play is that Louisiana law requires the parole committee to notify victims about upcoming parole hearings, provided they are registered with the Louisiana Victim Outreach Program, a state initiative that provides support services. Many victims of crime, especially those who are undocumented, fail to register or are aware of the state program. The parole board said there were no registered victims in the nine cases that appeared before the deportation panel in August.
Several local prosecutors said they tried reaching the families of the six victims who had been killed by four of the paroled men, three of whom were charged with vehicular homicide, but had trouble making contact. ProPublica and Verite News could not reach any of the victims or family members of deceased victims in the cases involving the nine men.
Landry, a Trump ally, has long been an immigration hard-liner. During his eight years as attorney general, which began a year before Trump’s first term as president, Louisiana’s capacity for detaining immigrants expanded from two facilities in 2016 to eight. That positioned the state to become a key partner in Trump’s mass deportation agenda during his second presidency.

In September, Landry and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unveiled a ninth immigration detention facility, known as the Louisiana Lockup, located in the former solitary confinement wing of the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola. That is where Hoang Huy Pham, one of the nine men paroled in August, is being held as he awaits deportation to Vietnam, the country his family said he fled as a child refugee during the Vietnam War.
Pham’s daughter Theresa, who asked to be referred to by only her first name because she works for the federal government and fears retaliation, said her father called her in June to tell her he was going to be paroled at the end of August after spending 20 years in prison for a long history of car theft. He told her he would live in a halfway house before rejoining the family in Baton Rouge, Theresa recalled. She said her elderly grandfather — Pham’s father — was looking forward to him finally getting out of prison to help with his care.
Then in September, Theresa received another call from her father. This time, he told her he had been transferred to Angola to await deportation. That five-minute call was the last time Theresa said she heard from him.
“You finally got out, but you’re going somewhere else where you’re not supposed to be,” Theresa said. “It’s a false hope.”
Hervin Pineda was the only prisoner to tell the parole board in August that he wanted to be deported back home. He wished to return to Nicaragua to be with his ailing, elderly mother in her final days, he told the board through an interpreter.
Pineda, who had previously been deported while on probation, had served less than a year of a seven-year sentence on charges of cocaine possession.
Nevertheless, the board granted his request.
“You’re a serious dope dealer,” Prator, the panel chair, told him. “We don’t want you back.”
ICE took him into federal custody that day and deported him to Nicaragua on Sept. 12.

Last weekend 12 teams competed for a chance at making it to the DIAA football state championship game in their respective class. Here’s a summary of the results from the semi-final games played across the state Friday, November 21, and Saturday, November 22.
 
1A
Newark Charter defeated Brandywine, 35-0, Friday: The Patriots scored two defensive touchdowns in the first half and added three rushing scores in the second half to punch their ticket to the class 1A state championship game in their first varsity season. Running back Austin Gbadegbe accumulated over 100 rushing yards and two scores in the win. Ajay Bonis scored the Patriots’ other offensive touchdown.  
Seaford defeated McKean, 41-0, Saturday: Seaford will play Newark Charter for the second time this season in the class 1A state championship game after defeating McKean in the semi-finals. Seaford scored six offensive touchdowns in the game, three of which from senior Brendan West. Seaford’s defense earned its fourth shutout of the season and has yet to give up a single point in the postseason. In the last meeting between the Patriots and Blue Jays, Seaford held the Patriots to just seven points. 
2A
Indian River defeated Lake Forest in overtime, 14-7, Friday: Indian River kept its undefeated season going, winning in overtime against the Spartans to advance to the class 2A championship game in their first year in the division. The Indians fell behind in the second quarter following an Andrew White score for the Spartans. In the fourth quarter, Indian River quarterback Dylan Grise connected with Michael Peranteau tying the game. Darnell Stokes ran the ball for a touchdown in the overtime period providing Indian River with the game winning score.
Red Lion defeated Howard in overtime, 41-40, Saturday: Red Lion pulled off a spectacular upset against the previously undefeated Howard Wildcats to earn its spot in the class 2A championship game. Red Lion Quarterback Evan Budinger threw four touchdowns helping the program reach its first 2A championship game since the expansion to three divisions in 2021. Red Lion will play Indian River for the first time this season in the championship game.  
3A
Middletown defeated Appoquinimink, 28-20, Friday: The Cavaliers will make their third appearance in the class 3A state championship game since 2021, after defeating Appoquinimink for the second time this season. Middletown scored twice in both halves with two passing touchdowns and another pair on the ground. The Cavaliers and Sallies will compete for the state title a year removed from a 30-27 overtime win by Middletown in last year’s championship game. 
Salesianum defeated Smyrna, 43-20, Friday: Sallies scored 28 points in the second half to defeat the Eagles for the second time this season. Five different Sallies players scored and all but one of Salesianum’s touchdowns came on the ground. The lone touchdown to come from the air was a 40-yard completion from quarterback Brady Nabb to junior Tysir Jones. Sallies will play Middletown in the 3A state championship game for the second year in a row.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gemini_Generated_Image_rqj1jurqj1jurqj1.png,,,2025-11-24 11:57:57.257274

One of the most visible and prolific voices for progressive policy change in 21st Century North Carolina is UNC Professor of Law Gene Nichol. Since taking up residence here three decades ago, Prof. Nichol has taught, written and advocated with remarkable energy and clarity for public policies that promote economic, social and political justice. He established a center at UNC that worked to document and combat poverty and inequality, and he’s long served as one of the state’s toughest and most unapologetic public critics of the conservative politicians who’ve dominated state policymaking in the last 15 years.
Now, Nichol is out with a new book in which he documents the relentless right-wing political and policy crusade that’s being waged by the state’s conservative legislature leadership and speaks directly to caring and thinking North Carolinians about how they can fight back. The book, which is published by the folks at Blair Publishing, is entitled “Now what? How North Carolina Can Blaze a Progressive Path Forward” and this past week, we caught up with the author to learn more.

The Detroit school district began offering yellow bus service to students at two high schools this year in an effort to improve attendance. But three months into the school year, few students are hopping on the buses.
At the start of the year, about five high schoolers were riding each of the eight buses in the pilot program, despite efforts by the Detroit Public Schools Community District to notify students and families of the new option, officials said during a community meeting this month. On average, 15 students now ride on each bus every day.
The district is investigating ways to increase ridership, Machion Jackson, a deputy superintendent overseeing transportation, said during the meeting. Colder weather in the coming months and potential adjustments to bus stops draw more students, she said.
“We have significantly increased ridership, and we’re hoping to (continue) to do so,” she said.
DPSCD officials did not respond to requests about the cost of bus pilot or answer questions related to the program.
The pilot program began as an experiment to improve attendance at two schools with high rates of chronic absenteeism. Officials chose Henry Ford High School and East English Village Preparatory Academy at Finney, which had absence rates of 82% and 77% respectively in the 2024-25 school year.
The district’s overall rate was 60.9%.
Students are considered to be chronically absent if they miss 10% or more of days in a school year.
Currently, the district does not provide yellow bus service to most high school students. Exceptions are made in some cases, including for students with disabilities and those experiencing homelessness. Around 1,400 high schoolers rode yellow buses so far this school year, according to numbers presented at the community meeting.
City buses are the main mode of transportation for most Detroit high schoolers. So far this school year, more than 3,780 high schoolers got free city bus passes from DPSCD.
Small vehicle transportation, passenger van rides, and gas card reimbursements from the district also help get kids to school.
 Why aren’t more students riding yellow buses?

Both Henry Ford and East English enrolled more than 600 students in 2024-25, meaning an average of around 10% of students at each school are riding the pilot buses each day.
Superintendent Nikolai Vitti said at a board meeting last month the pilot is “not having a scaled impact” on chronic absenteeism at either school. There may be a positive effect on attendance for individual students, he added.
The district has offered student incentives to boost ridership on the pilot buses.
The pilot is plugged during daily announcements in the schools, through lunchtime engagement sessions, and robocalls to parents.
The four pilot buses make between 35 and 42 stops on their routes, Jackson said.
“We chose the stops based on kind of like a heat map,” she said. “We looked at the density of where the majority of the students who attend those schools live in a neighborhood feeder pattern where they lived, and we strategically placed stops so that those students would not have to walk far.”
Anthony Peete, a student representative on the board who attends Henry Ford, said last month that his classmates don’t find the yellow buses convenient.
Some students said they had to walk farther to the yellow bus stop than for the city bus. Others didn’t know how to check where the bus route went, he said.
Vitti said the district should look at ridership numbers again in January and consider whether the pilot should continue.
The district could expand transportation services with additional state funding that was not anticipated in the district’s adopted budget, Vitti said, adding that he would recommend paying for ride shares for small groups of students rather than adding more yellow buses.
The district allocated more than $57.2 million for transportation in its budget for 2025-26 – an increase of nearly $5 million compared to the year before.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The head of the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the agency would roll out a relief plan for the country’s agriculture sector in December, offering potential good news in a year of uncertainty for Kansans.
Secretary Brooke Rollins did not give details about the plan but indicated the USDA has been analyzing and building a “formula” around the current situation, Bloomberg News reported. 
That situation includes the effects of tariffs and trade policy, the lack of a farm bill and the high cost of inputs, factors that are making it difficult for Kansas farmers and ranchers to plan for the future.



Crop farmers and cattle ranchers in the Sunflower State have shared vastly different experiences this year, according to a Kansas State University professor and economist.
Across the board, the agriculture industry has experienced general inflationary pressures on production expenses, said Jennifer Ifft, Kansas State University extension specialist on agricultural policy.
“But once you get beyond that, I think this year, more than ever, you really have to look at crops and livestock separately,” she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “The beef cattle prices are high, historic highs for the cow/calf side. They’re finally making money after some pretty long rough spells.”
However, crop farmers are seeing low prices and high expenses, Ifft said, along with weather pressures.
Kansas’ net farm income looks good, a measure that Ifft likens to the gross domestic product because it incorporates revenues and expenses from crops and livestock. 
The Fall 2025 Farm Income Outlook for Kansas, a study completed by Kansas State University and the University of Missouri, shows an 88% increase in Kansas net farm income in 2025, while it also projects a slight decrease in 2026.
Net farm income swings quite a bit, going down to $2 billion and up to $9 or $10 billion, Ifft said.
The 88% increase this year can be tied to strong beef cattle prices and also to government payments made in 2025 but attributable to 2023 and 2024, she said.
“Those payments for 2025 are mostly disaster payments, either for low profitability for crop farms or disaster payments, and those cover losses from 2023 and 2024,” she said. “You can see much smoother income if you assign those payments into the year that loss was incurred.”
However, that’s not the way net farm income is measured, she said. The value of determining net farm income is that it always incorporates the same factors, giving a measurement that is easily comparable year over year.
Projections for decreased net farm income in 2026 are tied in part to uncertainty about government payments, Ifft said.
“Government payments are projected to come down,” she said. “We don’t guess about programs that we don’t know about. It’s only about what we know about today.”
Kansas crop receipts are projected to rise by about 8%, or $559.18 million in 2025, with increases expected across all the major commodities despite lower prices, the report said.
“This is because yields are estimated to recover from recent lows as the state recovers from persistent drought,” the report said.
Cash receipts for cattle and calves are expected to be up 24%, or $3.54 billion for a total of $18.33 billion in 2025, the report said.
Overall, the state is projected to see total crop and livestock receipts and government payments increase $6.52 billion in 2025, of which livestock and crop receipts account for 58% and 9% of the change, respectively, the report said.
As farmers plan for the upcoming year, policy uncertainty challenges them to make decisions, and many would like to see the farm bill move ahead.
Although Ifft calls farmers and ranchers the best risk managers around, failure to pass a long-term — typically five years — farm bill makes it difficult to plan. Crop insurance and other programs they depend on are included in the farm bill, she said, whereas ad hoc payments, such as for disasters, are part of the farm safety net and aren’t something that can be incorporated into farm planning.
She gave an example of a crop producer, making decisions in mid-November for the upcoming year. Many have already paid for some of their inputs, such as seed, for the coming year.
“If you pay early, either in cash or through early financing, you can usually get a lower price. It’s a farm management strategy,” she said. “Let’s say your crop producer margins are tight this year, but that there’s some advantage to prepay. You have to work with your lender.”
But the federal government has been talking about $12 to $15 billion of trade aid for crop producers, which could help pay for those inputs.
“You have to make this risk management decision, which, again, it’s very personal, no right or wrong,” Ifft said. “Do you ignore that you could be getting a substantial payment, maybe in a month, maybe in six months, and make that decision, or do you hold on, wait?”
Ifft and her K-State colleagues offered a webinar this year about farm management in the era of ad hoc payments, how to take into account these uncertain payments and how to use them to better position your operation in the coming years, she said.
Ifft said K-State is offering agricultural profitability workshops throughout the state, in collaboration with commodity organizations and others. The workshops are for producers and focus on the difficulties of “tighter margins and tougher decisions.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stockyard-Dodge-City-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Laura Gunderson, president of the Child Care Providers Coalition of Kansas, says the state’s child care system is broken and providers need more support. 
With the creation of a new child care law, advocates are now grappling with a system that will streamline departments into the Office of Early Childhood while also loosening regulations for child care providers. 
The Legislature passed House Bill 2045 earlier this year, changing regulations for child care providers at both home day cares and child care centers. Now, an unlicensed individual can provide care for up to four children for up to 35 hours per week, in addition to their own children. Before, an unlicensed provider could only care for two children for 20 hours per week.
“We are home educators. We understand that quality care can look multiple ways,” Gunderson said. “ However, with unlicensed care, our concerns are that there’s no background checks. There is no CPR or first aid being required. With these little ones, CPR and first aid should be basic.”
The Office of Early Childhood was created to streamline various services, including some from the Department of Health and Environment and the Department for Children and Families, with the office set to be operational by June 2026. 
The goal is to make the child care process easier for parents with nearly every resource in one place, said Christi Smith, executive director of Child Care Aware Kansas. 
“We are a huge supporter of the Office of Early Childhood,” Smith said. “I think it will be a game changer for the system. It’s been a long time coming.”
However, Kansas Action for Children released a statement earlier this year about the bill, emphasizing “last minute” provisions that could jeopardize child safety. 
“The possibility of harm to children from the last-minute additions that reduce the quality of care may outweigh the good Kansans see in the long term,” the statement said. “The child care community was unable to weigh in and advise on the risks to children if it became law.”
The 2025 Kansas Speaks survey, published by Fort Hayes State University in October, revealed that 91.4% of respondents say affordable, quality child care is important for families regardless of having children of their own. 
Gunderson and the Child Care Providers Coalition of Kansas were vocal against Gov. Laura Kelly’s concessions to achieve creating the new office. With reduced provider regulations, Gunderson said, the state isn’t moving toward the quality families need.
“ When you’re caring for someone else’s child, their safety is the utmost importance. We are home educators. We’ve put so much time into our environments and preparation for these kids,” Gunderson said. “There’s so much into it. And to have someone unlicensed, able to essentially do similar work, it made us all kind of feel like what are we putting so many hours in for?”
For rural Kansas, finding any child care at all can be a challenge. Smith said she approves of the bill because it can allow providers to care for children without a license, which was intended to help reduce barriers for potential providers in small communities.
“It’s not always about a person not wanting to be a licensed child care provider. They may not truly have the ability to be,” Smith said. “For a small community that has zero options, that may have been the only option.”
Smith said parents should look at it from both perspectives to choose what’s right for their family, whether that’s licensed or unlicensed care.
“It wasn’t designed to be one wrong over the other. I’ve never heard a legislator tell me we don’t care about the health and safety of infants and toddlers,” Smith said. 
New child care legislation means this is a critical time for parents to do their research when looking for child care, said Emily Barnes, education policy adviser for Kansas Action for Children. 
“It’s important to focus on educating parents about what they need to be aware of so that they can ask the right questions,” Barnes said. “Educating parents and the general public that when you have a licensed provider, you’re more likely to have a situation where health and safety standards are being followed.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_9760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

Sharing personal journeys takes courage, and we appreciate the effort and energy devoted to telling these VSAC stories.
In the spirit of the season, we’re sharing a selection of excerpts from some of these profiles. The experiences of these four Vermonters represent just a small sample of our Spotlight features. Together, these stories highlight the community of support that helped each student pursue educational and career goals.
“I know my dad is talking about me finishing my school and that pushes me a lot.”
When Pascaline Furaha was about to enroll in Early College at the start of her senior year at Winooski High School, she knew the college work would be a challenge. But she also believed she could do it. “I’ve watched other people who came from Africa before me go on to earn degrees. I can also be the one to keep going and go that far.”
Pascaline was born in a refugee camp in Burundi and arrived in Vermont in 2019, at the age of 12. She spoke Swahili and a little Kurundi. Learning English was challenging, but she persisted and is now multilingual. 
In the ninth grade, she began VSAC’s GEAR UP college and career readiness program with VSAC Outreach Counselor Stevya Mukuzo. GEAR UP offers support to students who wish to continue their education after high school by providing financial assistance, scholarships, and college and career counseling.
Having watched her two older brothers struggle with the transition from high school to college, Pascaline took a different path to help build more resilience. VSAC introduced her to the Early College program at Community College of Vermont (CCV), and Pascaline was all in.
“I went for Early College because I didn’t want to jump right into university. I wanted to learn more about college first,” she explains. “I made the best decision. I’m now confident I can go to college and be ready for it, because I’ve already experienced it.”
Pascaline will complete her associate’s degree at CCV this year and plans to apply to school so that she may continue, and earn her bachelor’s. 
While she’s had to work hard in school, she’s felt a wealth of support, from her teachers to her VSAC counselor, to leaders of her family and her faith. Her father’s pride has been a major source of encouragement. “I know my dad is talking about me, continuing my school, and that pushes me a lot,” says Pascaline.
“I couldn’t have done this alone.”
Jeff Isabelle of Barre has been fascinated with paleontology—the study of dinosaurs—for as long as he can remember. While his lifetime hobby connects him to the earth’s distant past, Jeff has also kept his focus strongly on the future throughout his time at Spaulding High School in Barre. Hoping he could go on to college, he worked hard to keep up his grades. He also participated in the VSAC TRIO Talent Search program, an initiative to help students from modest-income backgrounds apply to and pay for college. 
Jeff was accepted to the geology program at Norwich University. By March of his senior year at Spaulding, Jeff had earned enough scholarship awards to cover two-thirds of his college costs. Then, in mid-April, he learned he had won the prestigious Ronald York Scholarship from Spaulding, which further reduced his annual expenses.
Jeff’s hard work is a big part of the story, but he gives a lot of credit to his VSAC counselor, Chelsea Martin, for pushing him to apply for so many opportunities, and to his family for helping him out so much with all the forms. “I couldn’t have done this alone,” he said.
“Receiving the VSAC Advancement Grant was so helpful for me, and it’s also been a huge step forward in making drivers’ ed more accessible to people.”
Earning your driver’s license is an American rite of passage. Aden Haji, founder of Haji Driving Academy, is building his business on helping newly arrived people earn those licenses, bringing them one step closer to merging into American culture.
Haji Driving Academy specializes in working with diverse populations whose cultural and linguistic needs are often overlooked in driver’s education. One obstacle is the language barrier, which Aden understands firsthand. He can communicate with his clients in his additional languages—including Somali—and his experience as a one-time newly arrived person, himself, often sets clients at ease. 
But Aden had to jump through a few hoops of his own to open Haji Driving Academy. He already had a degree in anthropology from the University of Vermont when he started researching what it would take to open a driving school, and he was surprised to learn how much training was required. He ended up accomplishing his dream to open his own education organization with the help of VSAC.
“There are courses I had to take in order to become certified,” Aden explains. Thanks to financial support from VSAC’s Advancement Grant—which supports adult students by funding short-term training opportunities that lead to job or career growth—Aden was able to complete those courses faster than he might have otherwise, had he financed the tuition entirely on his own.  
“Receiving the VSAC Advancement Grant was so helpful for me, and it’s also been a huge step forward in making drivers’ ed more accessible to people who need that support,” says Aden, adding that, in a full-circle moment, several of his students have also received funding for his driving course under the same grant program.
“VSAC saw through me when I couldn’t see anything for myself. And I’m really, really, glad they did.”
Julia Gosselin is a self-proclaimed “outdoors kind of kid.” What was true in her childhood stuck with her through college and beyond, and in 2022, she graduated from Castleton University (now Vermont State University Castleton) with a degree in Wildlife and Forest Conservation. Today, at 27, she’s staying connected to conservation through seasonal trail work with Audubon Vermont and landscaping jobs that support wildlife, while she works at one of Vermont’s only emergency veterinary clinics.
Julia was part of VSAC’s Talent Search program. And Julia’s VSAC Outreach Counselor, Monda Kelley, saw her enormous potential.
“She pushed me,” Julia says. “I tried to push her away, and she came back. She reminded me of who I used to be, this kid who loved being outside and in the trees, and who loved nature. Monda showed me that I could turn that love into a career and she showed me how to do it. Without her, honestly I don’t know if I would have gone to college.”
“VSAC helped me open doors,” she says. “They saw through me when I couldn’t see anything for myself. I’m really, really glad they did. And, Monda’s been my reference on every job I’ve had. Even when I didn’t want to listen to her, she kept nudging me forward.”
Now, armed with a college degree and a strong support network, Julia is looking ahead. Her dream job? Working with Vermonters to design gardens, lawns, and landscapes that support pollinators and wildlife, perhaps with a focus on forestry and conservation. 
The Vermont Student Assistance Corp. was created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency. We advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they have the tools they need to achieve their education and training goals. We create opportunities for all Vermont students, but particularly for those—of any age—who believe that the doors to education are closed to them. Growing families save for education with VT529, Vermont’s official 529 savings program. To help Vermonters plan and pay for college or job training, our counselors work with students in nearly every Vermont middle school and high school, and are also available to work with adults. Our grant, scholarship, and workforce development programs create opportunity, help students re-skill or learn new skills, and grow the economy.

Delaware is elevating its statewide strategy to protect farms, forests, and rural communities from the effects of climate change, with new funding streams, expanded cost-share programs, and a series of innovative projects rolling out over the next year.
Jimmy Kroon, Chief of Planning with the Delaware Department of Agriculture, says these initiatives signal a major step forward. “We’re increasing support for the practices that have the greatest impact on resilience—cover crops, no-till, precision agriculture, clean energy, and land preservation,” he said. “These investments are bigger and more targeted than anything we’ve done previously.”
Forestry Programs Grow: A New Focus on Resiliency
State Forester Kyle Hoyd said the Delaware Forest Service is introducing several new efforts, with the goal of strengthening forests and protecting communities from climate-related threats like storms, heat, and pests.
One of the most notable additions is the Forest Resiliency Fund. This $1.5 million cost-share program for private landowners will be available over the next three years. Hoyd explains it is specifically created to support forests with adapting to future conditions.
The state is also increasing technical assistance for afforestation and reforestation, boosting prescribed fire programming, and enhancing educational outreach to encourage participation from landowners.
Urban communities will receive further support as well, including new street and park tree plantings to combat heat islands and flooding. Hoyd said the Forest Service is “diversifying forest resources on state-owned lands to account for future climates and serve as the showcase for private landowners.”
Other forestry initiatives include:


Added forest protections and mitigation banking during land-use changes


New tools to help all 57 Delaware municipalities better plan and fund tree projects


Expanded cross-agency collaboration with developers, planners, and local governments


Increased monitoring for insect and disease outbreaks linked to changing climate patterns


Cover Crops, Carbon Sequestration, and Innovative Research
The state’s largest investment remains in climate-smart crop strategies—especially cover crops, which minimize runoff, stop  soil erosion, and store carbon.
Kroon said Delaware is significantly expanding this level of support. “We increased our funding request to $10 million for FY27,” he noted. The department is also backing research into innovative cover crop practices and boosting adoption of no-till and low-till farming.
Although cover crop cost-share is funded by the Department of Agriculture, it’s implemented locally. “Those interested should contact their conservation district,” Kroon said.

Lowering Emissions on Chicken Farms
As one of the state’s largest industries, Delaware’s poultry sector will see more help reducing energy use and emissions.
Specifically, Kroon emphasized new efforts to transition to alternative energy sources, made possible through partnerships with organizations like Energize Delaware.
Farmers are encouraged to seek energy audits and farm-specific programs through Energize Delaware to find opportunities for cost-effective upgrades.
Precision Agriculture: Doing More With Less
Another major focus for Delaware is precision agriculture—leveraging technology to minimize fertilizer, fuel, and water use while improving yields.
Kroon said the state is supporting improvements in this area through “research, demonstration projects, and workforce development.” Precision agriculture tools can go a long way in helping farms reduce emissions, lower energy costs, and minimize nutrient runoff into waterways.
Protecting Farmland From Development Pressures
The state is also aiming to preserve more farmland, particularly with development pushing into rural areas.
Kroon said the department is working closely with the Office of Statewide Planning to promote smart-growth strategies and prevent low-density sprawl. He pointed to research from American Farmland Trust, indicating that rural residential development produces emissions significantly higher than farmland or dense urban areas.
Plus, he added that preserved farmland offers long-term climate benefits. “Owners of preserved farmland are also more likely to implement further conservation practices,” Kroon said.
More information on the state’s preservation program can be found via the Delaware Department of Agriculture.
Preparing for Future Climate Risks
Delaware farmers are currently dealing with frequent flooding, hotter summers, intense rainfall, and shifting pest pressures. These new programs were designed with those challenges top-of-mind.
The expanded initiatives, Kroon said, are created to equip farms with the right tools to stay productive long-term. From resilient forests to carbon-sequestering croplands, each investment is part of a larger statewide strategy.
How Farmers and Landowners Can Get Involved
Farmers and landowners can stay up-to-date through several channels:


Cover crop and soil health programs: Contact local conservation districts.


Energy efficiency and alternative energy for poultry farms: Reach out to Energize Delaware.


Forestry cost-share, tree planting, or community forestry programs: Contact the Delaware Forest Service.


Land preservation opportunities: Visit the state’s agricultural land preservation program website.


A Statewide Effort
Kroon said Delaware’s approach reflects close cooperation across agencies, sectors, and local governments. “We’re supporting practices that reduce emissions, build resilience, and keep Delaware agriculture strong,” he said.
Hoyd agreed, pointing out that the forestry component is designed not only to protect forests, but to serve as a model for climate-ready landscapes throughout the state.
Together, the programs represent one of Delaware’s most comprehensive climate-resilience investments to date, positioning the state as a leader in climate-smart agriculture.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/corn-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

(Contributed photo).The younger children of Mohammad Ali Dadfar believe their father is away, working. That’s what they’ve been told.
Only the oldest, an 11-year-old girl, and Dadfar’s wife know the truth.

The father of four, an immigrant from Afghanistan who helped the U.S. military fight the Taliban, is in a Springfield, Missouri, jail — held with other immigrants picked up in nationwide sweeps.
Dadfar is 37 and an asylum-seeker with work authorization and a job as an over-the-road trucker.
He’s been held in the Greene County Jail since early October and fears being sent back to Afghanistan.
“They feel the lack of their father now,” said Dadfar’s wife, speaking with the help of a translation app. “And every time their question is, ‘When will father come home?’“
The Beacon is not naming her due to privacy concerns for the minor children.
A Kansas City-based immigration attorney has filed a federal lawsuit challenging Dadfar’s warrantless arrest and detention as unlawful.
Dadfar’s case is among a spate of federal lawsuits contesting warrantless arrests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and is part of continued legal attempts to hold the Trump administration accountable to a 2022 consent decree.
The Department of Homeland Security can arrest people without a warrant, but only in limited circumstances, such as when there is a fear that the person will escape before a warrant can be obtained.
Dadfar, the lawsuit argues, was not a flight risk.
Dadfar is represented by Rekha Sharma-Crawford in the case, which alleges that his detention is a violation of the 2022 Castañon Nava federal consent decree.
Dadfar’s case was filed Oct. 12 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.
Named as defendants in the complaint are Greene County Sheriff Jim C. Arnott, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem and ICE’s Chicago Field Office Director Samuel Olson.
The Greene County sheriff’s office was not aware of the filing and declined to comment further.
The Department of Homeland Security did not reply to a request for comment.
The Trump administration says it wants to remove dangerous immigrant criminals from the country, what officials often call “the worst of the worst.”
But 97% of the more than 600 undocumented immigrants arrested during the recent Operation Midway Blitz around Chicago had no criminal record, according to reporting by NPR, citing the Department of Homeland Security’s records submitted in ongoing cases involving the consent decree.
The lawsuit also asks that Dadfar not be transferred out of the jurisdiction of ICE’s Kansas City field office.
“Despite over 100 courts having determined that the government’s interpretation of law is incorrect, and the government not appealing those cases, people continue to be unlawfully denied due process and denied their freedom,” Sharma-Crawford said. “It’s un-American.”
 Fighting the Taliban

Dadfar is among thousands of Afghans who assisted the U.S. military during the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the longest war in U.S. history.
The U.S. entered Afghanistan in retaliation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Afghans helped as part of the Afghan military, as translators, drivers and intelligence operatives and helped with logistics and understanding the country’s culture.
Dadfar, his wife said, was a security officer with the Afghan military and moved around the country with U.S. troops.
Ultimately, the U.S. and allied efforts failed and the Taliban retook the capital of Kabul in 2021.
Dadfar was left behind in the highly criticized, chaotic final withdrawal of U.S. troops under the Biden administration.
Because he had helped the U.S. military, Dadfar was targeted by the Taliban, his wife said.
Subsequent years were treacherous for Dadfar, his wife and their children, who are all under the age of 12.
Their journey to the U.S. took three years, with stays in Iran and Brazil.
A toddler daughter nearly drowned as the family crossed the roadless jungle of the Darien Gap, a dangerous passage between Colombia and Panama.
In June 2024, Dadfar and his family made it to the U.S. southern border. They had an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, made through an app set up by the Department of Homeland Security.
At the border, they began the process to apply for asylum.
Dadfar was released on a parole that is valid until June 17, 2026.
Dadfar’s work permit is also valid through June 17, 2026, according to the lawsuit.
 Operations Guardian and Midway Blitz

Dadfar’s Oct. 10 arrest at an Indiana weigh station came just three days after ICE had been found in violation of the original consent decree.
He was stopped there as part of his route as a commercial driver.
On Oct. 7, a federal judge for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, ruled in favor of a group of immigrant workers, including 11 employees who had been apprehended during a raid at a Mexican restaurant in Liberty earlier this year.
The Liberty workers were already out on bond. But their cases were part of a class action challenge to how ICE is operating under the Trump administration.
The judge also agreed that immigration officials were concocting details for warrants after they had made arrests, rather than having the necessary warrants ahead of actions.
The 2022 consent decree is named for one of the original plaintiffs, Margarito Castañon-Nava, and covers six states — Missouri, Kansas, Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin and Kentucky.
Additional rulings by the same judge have ordered the government to release more than 400 immigrants it is holding under warrantless arrests or probable cause, placing the detainees on monitoring programs.
A stay on the order was issued by an appeals court on Nov. 20, and a hearing will be held in early December.
Dadfar might have come under scrutiny through Operation Guardian, an effort by ICE to target undocumented immigrants working as truckers.
A trucker from Uzbekistan, accused in his native country of being a member of a terrorist organization, was arrested Nov. 17 as he drove in Kansas, according to DHS. The man was living in Pennsylvania.
Operation Midway Blitz targeted immigrants in the Chicago area, an effort that coincided with Dadfar’s detainment.
Indiana State Police held Dadfar for five hours without providing a reason or a warrant, according to the lawsuit.
He then was sent to Chicago and held by ICE officials there for two days, again without reason, the suit said.

DHS paperwork filed with the lawsuit said Dadfar was detained without bond and would be held in ICE custody pending his immigration proceedings.
His next hearing before an Denver immigration judge on the asylum application is Feb. 3, 2026.
The lawsuit alleges: “Mr. Dadfar was present … under his valid grant of parole, and there existed no justification for his detention or arrest during a routine matter. He was paroled into the U.S. for the purpose of seeking asylum, which he did timely. He was awaiting his court hearing and was not a flight risk.”
Sharma-Crawford said that she had spoken with Dadfar by phone.
He is represented in his asylum case by a Colorado immigration law firm.
The Missouri suit also questions Homeland Security paperwork that states Dadfar denied having a fear of being deported to Afghanistan.
But Dadfar was never asked by immigration officials about his fear of returning to Afghanistan, Sharma-Crawford said.
Attempts to help Afghans who were left stranded after the U.S. withdrawal are ongoing and increasingly difficult.
Thousands have a claim that they aided our military. And some were separated from their families as they tried to board planes after Kabul fell to the Taliban.
President Donald Trump suspended the U.S. refugee program shortly after taking office, leaving immigrants who had already been approved for travel without a route to enter the U.S. And the State Department suspended funding to help resettle Afghan refugees already in the U.S.
Dadfar’s wife said she is grateful and prayerful for the many people who have stepped forward to help her family resettle and, now, to challenge her husband’s detention.
But as time passes, the family’s distress builds.
“Every time Ali calls, he tells them (the younger children) that he is at work and that he is trying to finish work as soon as possible and return home,” she said.

Charlie Baker, talks with CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas about the yearlong series of essays he wrote for CommonWealth Beacon on the need for civil discussion of often controversial issues in an era of polarized debate.","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Michael Jonas
GUESTS: Jim Peyser







POLITICAL DEBATE THESE days looks more often like trench warfare than reasoned discourse on the pros and cons of important policy proposals. In our age of hyper-polarization, political adversaries are treated more like blood enemies, and issues are often characterized in absolute terms as black-and-white matters of right and wrong, even when they’re often far more complicated than that.  
Jim Peyser says a healthy, well-functioning democracy depends on us getting out of this cycle of vitriol and restoring a measure of civil discourse to our debates. His day job for all eight years of Charlie Baker’s tenure as governor was secretary of education. But Peyser, whose dad was a congressman from New York in the 1970s and early 1980s – and showed serious bipartisanship by switching parties during that time, from Republican to Democrat – has a deep interest in civic life and in finding ways to bridge some of the divide that has turned political debate into winner-take-all blood sport.  
“We’re essentially shouting at each other across the divide,” says Peyser, who joined CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas this week on The Codcast. Our positions on issues have been reduced to bumper sticker slogans, he said, “which is essentially crowding out or making it impossible to have an actual conversation around the issues themselves, the problems we’re trying to solve, and what some of the solutions might be.” 
Over the past year, Peyser has written a dozen issue briefs for CommonWealth Beacon in which he tries to show just what he means – taking on contentious issues facing the state that range from rent control to natural gas pipelines and proposals for a prison construction moratorium. He shows how arguments often come down to balancing trade-offs rather than the moralistic right-or-wrong framing used by those pushing each side most vehemently. (Read Peyser’s concluding essay here, which has links at the end to all 12 issue briefs as well as the two essays he wrote to launch the series that described the polarized state we are in – and how we might begin to chart a course out of it.)  
As to whether Donald Trump is the cause or consequence of our poisoned polity, Peyser says “both.”  
“He’s an accelerant. But he didn’t come from nowhere,” Peyser says, dating the coming apart to at least the 1990s. 
Peyser says we are in a more polarized time. But he also agrees with the arguments being made that the center of political gravity nonetheless is in, well, in the center. (A recent New York Times editorial made that case, as does a national report issued last month by a center-left group of Democrats, co-authored by Massachusetts activist Liam Kerr.)  
“I do think that the large majority of people are closer to one another than they think,” Peyser says, “and that the extent to which they can’t talk to each other or see each other or see the other side as the enemy – it has to do with some assumptions that are made about who’s saying what and what underlies their positions as opposed to actual engagement in a particular subject on a particular topic.” 
Voters’ view on a particular statement, for example, will be different if they are told it was said by Trump or by Joe Biden, Peyser notes.  
As for what it will take to shift the political discourse toward a healthier give and take, “I don’t think there’s a quick fix or silver bullet,” Peyser says. He thinks there are some “structural reforms” that might help. “I am intrigued by the idea of open primaries as a way of limiting the impact of the extremes of either party in terms of driving the candidates that the general election tends to ultimately get to choose from,” he says. (Open primaries are the subject of one of the ballot questions being proposed for the 2026 Massachusetts election.)  
“By the same token,” Peyser says, “I think it’s a cultural shift that’s just going to have to happen over time. There’s some efforts underway to try to stimulate some of that, some discussions across difference and across party lines. And those are all good. They’re all small-scale now and hopefully they’ll get bigger and have bigger impact. But I think, in some ways, it’s unfortunately hard to see a path through this other than sort of the day-to-day slog of trying to be more reasonable, both in terms of how we talk about issues, but, importantly, how we talk to and relate to one another.” 
During the episode, Jonas and Peyser discuss how robust debate can take a turn for the toxic (3:00), the genesis of Peyser’s series on bridging divides (11:30), and how so many voters seemed to hit “burn it down” on both sides of the aisle (23:30).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 10:58:57.344193

The lawmakers have all served either in the military or the intelligence community. Their message sparked a furious response on social media from President Donald Trump, who called the legislators’ action “seditious behavior, punishable by death.”
One of the lawmakers, Sen. Elissa Slotkin, told The New York Times that she had heard from troops currently serving that they were worried about their own liability in actions such as the ones in the Caribbean.
This is not the first time Trump has put members of the military in situations whose legality has been questioned. But a large percentage of service members understand their duty to follow the law in such a difficult moment.
We are scholars of international relations and international law. We conducted survey research at the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Human Security Lab and discovered that many service members do understand the distinction between legal and illegal orders, the duty to disobey certain orders, and when they should do so.
 The ethical dilemma

With his Aug. 11, 2025, announcement that he was sending the National Guard – along with federal law enforcement – into Washington, D.C. to fight crime, Trump edged U.S. troops closer to the kind of military-civilian confrontations that can cross ethical and legal lines.
Indeed, since Trump returned to office, many of his actions have alarmed international human rights observers. His administration has deported immigrants without due process, held detainees in inhumane conditions, threatened the forcible removal of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip and deployed both the National Guard and federal military troops to Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, Chicago and other cities to quell largely peaceful protests or enforce immigration laws.
When a sitting commander in chief authorizes acts like these, which many assert are clear violations of the law, men and women in uniform face an ethical dilemma: How should they respond to an order they believe is illegal?
The question may already be affecting troop morale. “The moral injuries of this operation, I think, will be enduring,” a National Guard member who had been deployed to quell public unrest over immigration arrests in Los Angeles told The New York Times. “This is not what the military of our country was designed to do, at all.”
Troops who are ordered to do something illegal are put in a bind – so much so that some argue that troops themselves are harmed when given such orders. They are not trained in legal nuances, and they are conditioned to obey. Yet if they obey “manifestly unlawful” orders, they can be prosecuted. Some analysts fear that U.S. troops are ill-equipped to recognize this threshold.
 Compelled to disobey

U.S. service members take an oath to uphold the Constitution. In addition, under Article 92 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the U.S. Manual for Courts-Martial, service members must obey lawful orders and disobey unlawful orders. Unlawful orders are those that clearly violate the U.S. Constitution, international human rights standards or the Geneva Conventions.
Service members who follow an illegal order can be held liable and court-martialed or subject to prosecution by international tribunals. Following orders from a superior is no defense.
Our poll, fielded between June 13 and June 30, 2025, shows that service members understand these rules. Of the 818 active-duty troops we surveyed, just 9% stated that they would “obey any order.” Only 9% “didn’t know,” and only 2% had “no comment.”
When asked to describe unlawful orders in their own words, about 25% of respondents wrote about their duty to disobey orders that were “obviously wrong,” “obviously criminal” or “obviously unconstitutional.”
Another 8% spoke of immoral orders. One respondent wrote that “orders that clearly break international law, such as targeting non-combatants, are not just illegal — they’re immoral. As military personnel, we have a duty to uphold the law and refuse commands that betray that duty.”
Just over 40% of respondents listed specific examples of orders they would feel compelled to disobey.
The most common unprompted response, cited by 26% of those surveyed, was “harming civilians,” while another 15% of respondents gave a variety of other examples of violations of duty and law, such as “torturing prisoners” and “harming U.S. troops.”
One wrote that “an order would be obviously unlawful if it involved harming civilians, using torture, targeting people based on identity, or punishing others without legal process.”

 Soldiers, not lawyers

But the open-ended answers pointed to another struggle troops face: Some no longer trust U.S. law as useful guidance.
Writing in their own words about how they would know an illegal order when they saw it, more troops emphasized international law as a standard of illegality than emphasized U.S. law.
Others implied that acts that are illegal under international law might become legal in the U.S.
“Trump will issue illegal orders,” wrote one respondent. “The new laws will allow it,” wrote another. A third wrote, “We are not required to obey such laws.”
Several emphasized the U.S. political situation directly in their remarks, stating they’d disobey “oppression or harming U.S. civilians that clearly goes against the Constitution” or an order for “use of the military to carry out deportations.”
Still, the percentage of respondents who said they would disobey specific orders – such as torture – is lower than the percentage of respondents who recognized the responsibility to disobey in general.
This is not surprising: Troops are trained to obey and face numerous social, psychological and institutional pressures to do so. By contrast, most troops receive relatively little training in the laws of war or human rights law.
Political scientists have found, however, that having information on international law affects attitudes about the use of force among the general public. It can also affect decision-making by military personnel.
This finding was also borne out in our survey.
When we explicitly reminded troops that shooting civilians was a violation of international law, their willingness to disobey increased 8 percentage points.
 Drawing the line

As my research with another scholar showed in 2020, even thinking about law and morality can make a difference in opposition to certain war crimes.
The preliminary results from our survey led to a similar conclusion. Troops who answered questions on “manifestly unlawful orders” before they were asked questions on specific scenarios were much more likely to say they would refuse those specific illegal orders.
When asked if they would follow an order to drop a nuclear bomb on a civilian city, for example, 69% of troops who received that question first said they would obey the order.
But when the respondents were asked to think about and comment on the duty to disobey unlawful orders before being asked if they would follow the order to bomb, the percentage who would obey the order dropped 13 points to 56%.
While many troops said they might obey questionable orders, the large number who would not is remarkable.
Military culture makes disobedience difficult: Soldiers can be court-martialed for obeying an unlawful order, or for disobeying a lawful one.
Yet between one-third to half of the U.S. troops we surveyed would be willing to disobey if ordered to shoot or starve civilians, torture prisoners or drop a nuclear bomb on a city.
The service members described the methods they would use. Some would confront their superiors directly. Others imagined indirect methods: asking questions, creating diversions, going AWOL, “becoming violently ill.”
Criminologist Eva Whitehead researched actual cases of troop disobedience of illegal orders and found that when some troops disobey – even indirectly – others can more easily find the courage to do the same.
Whitehead’s research showed that those who refuse to follow illegal or immoral orders are most effective when they stand up for their actions openly.
The initial results of our survey – coupled with a recent spike in calls to the GI Rights Hotline – suggest American men and women in uniform don’t want to obey unlawful orders.
Some are standing up loudly. Many are thinking ahead to what they might do if confronted with unlawful orders. And those we surveyed are looking for guidance from the Constitution and international law to determine where they may have to draw that line.

His promise to restore trust and accountability in City Hall wasn’t hard to sell. But Van Campen has a tough act to follow, despite DeMaria’s scandals.","IN FEBRUARY, Everett City Hall was thrown into the spotlight when the Massachusetts inspector general announced that longtime mayor Carlo DeMaria had been improperly paid $180,000 for “longevity” bonuses – payments he helped to draft and pass via city ordinance.  
The investigation found that DeMaria, who led the city for 17 years, intentionally hid the overpayments from Everett City Council, as well as the public. In March, the City Council passed a unanimous, symbolic vote of no confidence in DeMaria after he refused to pay the money back. DeMaria called the report a political attack and sued the state inspector general in August, shortly before an independent audit uncovered more improper spending. 
With annual longevity bonuses of $40,000 paid between 2018 and 2020, the Boston Globe reported that DeMaria had become Massachusetts’ highest-paid mayor, surpassing even the mayor of Boston’s salary.   
It wasn’t the first time DeMaria had been the subject of unflattering headlines. In 2022, then-US Attorney Rachael Rollins launched a federal investigation into multiple allegations of racism in Everett’s city government that was later dropped. In 2023, the superintendent and deputy superintendent of Everett Public Schools filed a lawsuit against the mayor, accusing him of racial and gender discrimination. 
Still, DeMaria declared he would seek reelection this year, claiming his work in Everett wasn’t finished. But on November 4, residents decided it was.  
In a closely watched upset, City Councilor Robert Van Campen beat DeMaria by 9 percentage points. His promise to restore trust and accountability in City Hall wasn’t hard to sell to residents who had grown tired of a mayor prone to lining his pockets, according to investigators. But Van Campen has a tough act to follow, despite DeMaria’s scandals.    
The defeated mayor presided over a massive development boom in the city of 50,000, anchored by his welcoming of the $2.6 billion Encore Boston Harbor casino, which Wynn Resorts opened in 2019 on the Mystic River. Changes to zoning under his tenure paved the way for thousands of housing units and many mixed-use projects to be built, and he has nearly completed a deal with the Kraft Group that would land a New England Revolution soccer stadium in Everett.  
The growth has been nothing short of transformative for the once-scrappy industrial city just north of Boston. Now, Van Campen will inherit both the good and the bad of DeMaria’s legacy. 
I spoke with the mayor-elect at his home in Everett to learn more about his plans for the city and how he will repair the shaken trust in City Hall while also keeping DeMaria’s legacy of development alive. What follows is an edited transcript of our conversation. 
COMMONWEALTH: Coming from City Council, you’re a familiar face to many Everett residents. But for those who may not know you, talk about your background.   
Robert Van Campen: I am a city kid at heart. My parents were renters for a big chunk of their married lives, and they had an opportunity to, like many, live out the American Dream, better their lives, and buy a house, which they bought here in Everett. My house is literally 100 yards away from where my 84-year-old mother still lives. That’s kind of the family homestead. That’s where we still celebrate big holidays – big Italian Christmas Eves and all that stuff. I am very much rooted in our community. I have two children, and my wife Lisa and I are raising them in this house. My daughter is at the University of Connecticut right now. My son is a sophomore in high school. Professionally, I’m a labor and municipal attorney. That’s what I’ve done for about 25 years. I represent public sector workers, private sector workers, and I have been on the City Council for the last two years. I had an earlier stint on the City Council when I was in law school. I was elected in 2000 and served for 14 years. I ran unsuccessfully for mayor at that time against Mayor DeMaria. After that, I left office, enjoyed private life, enjoyed being with my family, enjoyed practicing law, and decided in 2023 that there was this growing need for some different voices on the City Council. I was lucky enough to get elected to ward council. My colleagues apparently saw something, because they made me president of the City Council at my first meeting. I just wanted to be a freshman city councilor, but I was happy to take a leadership role and work with the City Council to drive forward our agenda. 
CW: Why did you decide to get into this mayoral race?  
Van Campen: Earlier this year, it became apparent to me that there was a tremendous appetite for change in our community – not just to change the name on the mayor’s door, but to bring real improvement to people’s lives. Whether dealing with school overcrowding or overdevelopment in our neighborhoods, restoring transparency and accountability to City Hall – it appeared that the rudder started to get a little too loose at City Hall, so I decided to enter the race.

CW: Everett City Hall was thrust into a scandalous light this year. How do you plan to pick up the pieces from that? 
Van Campen: We ran a campaign on restoring trust, transparency, and accountability to City Hall. My plan is to do that on day one. The first part of that is to hire an exceptional professional leadership team, which I am in the throes of doing as we speak. That’s not to say there aren’t professional staff at City Hall today, but I think bringing that in and trying to heal the divisions that we’ve had in our community for the last couple of years is the first step. One of the things I’d like to do is create what I would call a municipal academy, which is nothing more than an opportunity for the various department heads, led by my leadership team, to bring in the people of Everett and have them maybe better understand: What does the chief financial officer do? What is his or her role in the city? What is the city solicitor’s role? What does the assessor do? What does the treasurer do? How does the school budget get funded at City Hall? And ultimately, what is the mayor’s role and the City Council’s role, and who ultimately are they responsible to? They’re responsible to the people. Bringing those kinds of transparent programs and initiatives forward I think will also help heal some of the division and restore some of the trust that has been broken. I want to bring in a far more superior budget tool. I’ve been looking at other municipal websites recently, and I think we could do a much better job throwing open the doors to the city budget. Full transparency. You should be able to go online to the city of Everett’s website and drill down into every line item as a resident and as a taxpayer.  
CW: Do you think residents have lost trust in their city government after the inspector general revealed Mayor DeMaria’s longevity bonuses?  
Van Campen: I don’t want to say they’ve lost trust in the entire government. I think their confidence was shaken in what happened, and their confidence is shaken, perhaps, in whether our systems can ensure that something like that doesn’t happen again, and that what they’re being told is the truth. We’re living in an age today where the truth is under attack at all levels right now. When this issue broke in February, I questioned whether the administration could continue in office, because folks had lost confidence in its ability to navigate, and I think the people of Everett agreed with that sentiment.  
CW: You’re following a big personality in office. What style of leadership will you take on, and how will that differ from the current administration? 
Van Campen: My kids always say that I’m a combination of serious and goofy around them, and that’s just who I am. I’m really comfortable in my own skin. I will set my own leadership style. I don’t walk in anyone’s shadow. I’m going to very much set my own path as mayor. My style will be more collaborative, more constituent-focused right out of the gate, and I think the people of Everett will see a dramatic shift in the political culture of Everett and the view that people outside of Everett have of our community. 
CW: Is there anything about DeMaria’s legacy that you hope to continue as you enter office? 
Van Campen: What can’t be disputed is that Mayor DeMaria has a legacy of transformation in our community. There is absolutely no question about that. After nearly 18 years in office, you see it. You see it particularly in South Everett. You see it on lower Broadway. You see it with Encore. You see it with a potential soccer stadium at the foot of South Everett, and all the development potential that could happen down there. I am committed to making sure that projects that can transform our community continue to go forward. The difference between the mayor and me is that I have a more focused view to ensure that the developers aren’t dictating these projects, and that the people of Everett are the ones in the driver’s seat. For example: the proposed Kraft soccer stadium. I really want to drill down into the potential impacts that stadium will have on both vehicle and pedestrian traffic in that area. I want to make sure those impacts are addressed to the satisfaction of every person in the city of Everett.  
CW: Under DeMaria’s tenure, zoning changes allowed for a development and real estate boom unlike any other the city has seen. Some people might be concerned that the boom is going to stop with you. What would you say to that?  
Van Campen: False rumors. I want to continue our progress while prioritizing the people of Everett and prioritizing our neighborhoods. What I don’t want to see is development that strangles neighborhoods and tears the fabric of those neighborhoods apart. We’ve seen that in recent years. But in our blighted areas, and in the areas where we have transit-oriented hubs, I have no objection to responsible, reasonable development happening there. 
CW: What kind of development does Everett need to see more of that you hope to usher in?  
Van Campen: What I would really like to see is developers starting to focus on our downtown area. Everett Square has remained relatively unchanged for the last 20 years. There’s been no meaningful investment there. I want to change that. I want developers to start noticing the real potential. We have some thriving restaurants, but we can take this to new heights. I’m going to need partners in the private sector to make that happen. They realize that South Everett is such a valuable, dynamic place to invest, but I hope they realize that if they come up the street just half a mile, Everett Square and all of our downtown businesses are too. That is a priority that is a shift from the current administration. 
CW: Something that many Gateway Cities struggle with, including Everett, is how to attract the right mix of both market-rate and affordable housing development that simultaneously brings revenue to the city, is welcomed by most residents, and is something developers are actually incentivized to build. It’s a tough balancing act. How do you plan to manage it? 
Van Campen: The issue is that rents are going down across the country, but they’re going up in Boston. It’s a real challenge to not overbuild while creating enough housing to start to bring prices down. One of the initiatives I’m going to explore as mayor is to create, in City Hall, an office of housing affordability to try to figure these issues out, provide expert guidance to folks who are looking for affordable housing options, and, more importantly, to use the leverage of City Hall to have meaningful conversations with developers. But I do think that is probably the most critical challenge – not just for me as mayor of Everett, but I’m sure for my friends in Somerville, Malden, Medford, Revere, and Chelsea – that we are all going to face over the next couple of years.

CW: You’ve said that you plan to carry forward with plans DeMaria laid for a soccer stadium to be built in Everett. How might that project fit into your residents-first approach to development? 
Van Campen: The New England Revolution has been kind enough to have some community meetings recently, and there’s going to be a whole [Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act Office] process that has to be followed at the state level to ensure that any environmental concerns are mitigated. I will simply take a more aggressive approach to make sure that the voice of the people of Everett is the primary voice at the table when those issues are discussed. Even folks in our state delegation have said that if the infrastructure is not built, the stadium cannot happen. That infrastructure has to happen, and I want to make sure that the people of Everett have a voice in designing what it looks like.  
CW: DeMaria had a vision to turn Everett’s lower Broadway district into an entertainment and hospitality center. Is that a vision you plan on continuing? 
Van Campen: I’ve had initial conversations with some of the larger investors in that part of the city. I understand and acknowledge the boom that has happened down there. That’s something I would like to see continue forward. The real question for me at this point is what does it look like? I haven’t been participating in any of these conversations up to date, so I don’t want to get myself ahead of the curve here. But is it progress I’d like to see continue? Yes, it is.  
CW: Wynn Resorts has put a $400 million expansion on hold at its Encore casino in Everett, saying it has reached an impasse with the city over how much it should pay if the project is built. As you enter office, what kind of relationship will you have with Wynn when it comes to development? 
Van Campen: I’m a negotiator by training, so I think we’ll have a mutually respectful relationship. I want Wynn and Encore to be successful, because if they are successful, the local economy here in Everett is successful, and the people of Everett have greater opportunities for jobs. I think the issue with phase two of that project also relates to the online gaming legislation [which would make online gambling legal in the state and has been criticized by Encore] that is pending at the State House right now. Hopefully the Legislature can dispose of that issue and allow that type of an investment to go forward. 
CW: DeMaria was the highest-paid mayor in Massachusetts, and it drew a lot of controversy. Will you continue to have the highest salary of any mayor in the state? 
Van Campen: I will follow the ordinance that sets the mayor’s compensation. We repealed the ordinance that afforded the mayor a longevity bonus. But the mayor’s compensation, according to city charter, is to be set by city ordinance. That ordinance remains in effect, so I’m going to follow the law. 
CW: Do you think the city ordinance could change under your tenure?  
Van Campen: It could. In terms of all the different priorities in the city, it’s not something that has really been at the forefront or discussed. I do think chief executives, particularly in our current times, deserve fair compensation if we’re going to attract seasoned, experienced municipal executives. Obviously, like any other job in the industry, you have to provide a competitive rate to do that. But that issue hasn’t been discussed. I am not sure it will be discussed anytime in the first six months of my term, simply because there are so many other priorities. But for purposes of today, I’m going to follow the ordinance and have the finance division implement whatever the terms of the ordinance require. 
CW: What is one thing you hope to work on with state lawmakers during your tenure that would benefit Everett? 
Van Campen: First and foremost, I’d like to see them defeat the online gaming legislation as a way to allow for greater investment in lower Broadway. I think that is critical. Another thing I’d like to work with state lawmakers on is a solution to our housing affordability crisis and trying to find a way to incentivize the creation of more, not less, affordable units.

CW: Many Gateway Cities in the Commonwealth could only dream of the amount of development Everett has seen in the last decade. Going forward, what do you think is the city’s role in Greater Boston and the Greater Boston economy? 
Van Campen: I think we are driving the bus right now. It is breathtaking, not only what has happened, but what will happen in the next five to 10 years. I want to see Everett become an urban model for Greater Boston and beyond. I want to make the schools an urban model of excellence and success. Those investments that are going to be made in the next five to 10 years – the job creation that’s going to happen – we’re really putting Everett on the map and taking it to new heights. Our greatest asset in the city of Everett is our geography. We are right on the border of the city of Boston, a world-renowned city. We should be a world-renowned city too, and we can see it happening right before our eyes. I’m blessed that I will be the man who has the privilege to hold the pen to write that next chapter.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/everettmayor-3-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067

(Photo provided by SC250)COLUMBIA — Nearly 250 years ago, 56 men signed the Declaration of Independence following its adoption in Philadelphia. Four were South Carolinians.
At the South Carolina State Fair this year, more than 10,000 people signed it.
The number of signatures on an enormous replica of the historic document underscored the popularity of an exhibit all about the Revolutionary War, said Molly Fortune, the executive director of the commission in charge of promoting South Carolina’s role in the country’s birth.

The exhibit was so successful, the SC250 Commission is considering ways to make it permanent, or at least keep it open a little longer, Fortune said.
For the past four years, the statewide agency and local commissions have hosted events across the state in preparation for next year’s 250th anniversary of the country’s founding. Those events, which often take place at museums or historical sites, tend to attract history buffs, Fortune said.
Setting up an exhibit at the State Fair, which drew nearly 400,000 people this October, brought the nation’s story to a whole new demographic of people, Fortune said.
While walking through the exhibit, the most common refrain Fortune heard was, “I didn’t know,” she said.
People meant that about all sorts of facts.
Some didn’t realize the contributions Black and Native American people made during the war. Others didn’t even realize next year is the 250th anniversary of the colonies declaring independence from Britain, which didn’t officially recognize the new nation until the 1783 Treaty of Paris.
“You can hear the wonder in their voice,” Fortune said.
Snacking on corndogs and fried Twinkies, fairgoers this year stepped into one of the fairground’s warehouses to find a representation of an 18th century South Carolina swamp. The sound of crickets chirped over the intercoms as visitors wound along a wooden walkway, reading plaques surrounded by foliage.
A fake log cabin and backdrop provided a background of photographs, including for visitors who wanted to put on a historic Overmountain Man uniform, with a linen shirt, a cap and a fox pelt. Reenactors gave dance lessons, period-accurate speeches, and demonstrations of how to write with a quill.
“It really did totally bring to life so many aspects,” said Diana Watson, spokesperson for SC250.
The commission didn’t expect the exhibit to become such a huge hit, Fortune said. She had to get the Declaration of Independence reprinted twice because it ran out of space for signatures during the State Fair’s 12-day run, she said.
The declaration was Fortune’s biggest concern going into the fair.
Though the document explaining the colonies’ fight for freedom says “all men are created equal” with the God-given rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” the authors at the Second Continental Congress fell far short of that ideal in reality. They were referring to white men.
Fortune knew some people have complicated relationships with the founding document. So, when fairgoers told her, “It’s not for me,” she talked with them about what it means to recognize every part of history, even the ugliest.
One of the commission’s goals is to highlight the stories often forgotten in the history of the country’s founding. Displays showed the lives of Black and Native American soldiers, as well as women, during the war.
Alongside the stories of those often forgotten was a memorial to a widely known war figure: Gen. Francis Marion, often called the “Swamp Fox” for his guerilla tactics in South Carolina’s backcountry. Some of his correspondence, which the commission is working to compile and make available to the public, was on view for guests to read.
Other displays came from the commission’s grant-funded partners and fellow historical organizations, Fortune said.
The Ninety Six National Historic Site lent the commission some of its displays while its museum undergoes renovations. The Lee County American Revolution committee contributed a traveling display about Black soldiers.

Fortune heard from teachers who said they’d like to use the displays in their classrooms. Fortune told them to come back after the fair ended, and they would work something out.
The exhibit, which cost between $150,000 and $200,000 in state taxpayer funds, is still intact on the state fairgrounds, Fortune said.
Once the commission figures out the logistics, teachers will be able to “go in there and go shopping,” she said.
How they’ll “check out” parts of the exhibit for their classrooms remains in the works. Commissioners also are brainstorming ways to offer off-season tours of the exhibit for people who missed it during the fair or want to see it again, Fortune said.
“It was so well-received,” Fortune said. “We want to know that more people have the opportunity to see it, to see pieces of it.”
SC250 is planning to put on another exhibit at next year’s State Fair with different information about what was happening in South Carolina 250 years ago.
The fair’s organizers jumped at the chance for a second year of working with the commission, considering how much people enjoyed this year’s display, said Nancy Smith, general manager of the State Fair.

(U.S. Coast Guard photo by Lieutenant Christopher Butters)On a dreary November day in Seattle, the U.S. Coast Guard put its past and future on display.
Within sight of the Space Needle, three eye-catching red icebreakers towered over Pier 36. It was the first time since 2006 that the Coast Guard has had three active icebreakers in the same place at the same time.
In the coming years, that scene will become more common, and not just in Seattle. After years of underfunding, the Coast Guard’s icebreaker fleet is undergoing a massive expansion, with almost $9 billion for new ships.
On Tuesday, the U.S. government signed the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort — or ICE Pact — a three-nation agreement with Finland and Canada that will see some of those ships built in Finland, whose shipyards will train Americans to build more. 
“It’s an exciting time to be a polar icebreaker sailor,” said Capt. Jeff Rasnake, commanding officer of the Polar Star, America’s only heavy icebreaker.
So many ships are about to join the Coast Guard’s fleet that the agency isn’t yet sure where it will put them all. The Coast Guard has earmarked millions for a port expansion in Seattle to accommodate three heavy icebreakers, plus another $300 million for Juneau to serve as a port for a medium icebreaker.
More space will be needed on top of that, and Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, said his intent is to have as many of the new ships based in Alaska as possible. 
“We want home port decisions on these icebreakers sometime in early 2026,” he said. “That is my goal.”

The need for new icebreakers is clear: As the Earth warms amid climate change, no place is warming faster than the Arctic. Melting ice is opening new routes for shipping, places to mine and drill, and seas to fish or view from the deck of a cruise ship. 
In many cases, control of those new routes is being disputed among nations.
“Right now, things are heating up in the Arctic, and not just on the ice,” said Capt. Kristen Serumgard of the icebreaker Healy.
Russia is expanding its military presence in the Arctic, including with icebreakers, and as NATO confronts Russian aggression in Europe, there’s been international concern that the United States and NATO should be prepared to match Russia in the Arctic as well.
China is operating significant numbers of icebreakers in the Arctic, as are European nations, each interested in maintaining their right to access the area.
“It’s a geopolitical hotbed up there,” Serumgard said. 
Rasnake, who typically works in the comparatively calm Antarctic, said that “with lines being drawn and a lot of different contested (seafloor) land claims, it’s — I wouldn’t say the wild, wild West, but maybe the wild, wild North.”
Shipping traffic through the Arctic Ocean is on the rise, with more ships traveling Russia’s Northern Sea Route and the Canadian-American Northwest Passage each summer.
As yet, the Northwest Passage isn’t regularly used by commercial shipping, said Steve White, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Alaska, which monitors the area for safety risks.
While that’s the case, “we are seeing a trend of more and more traffic, though, going through the Bering Straits, both on the US side and on the Russian side,” he said.
With more ships comes more risk. On Sept. 6, the Dutch cargo ship Thamesborg ran aground in Franklin Strait, part of the Northwest Passage. The accident didn’t release any pollution and no one was injured, but it took 33 days for the ship to be freed and sent on its way.
The Northwest Passage and the Northern Sea Route each funnel through the Bering Strait, which is split between American and Russian control. 
“The reason this is so important for people to understand is that the Bering Strait — you’ve only got about (51) miles between the US and Russia, and you have the biodiversity, the wildlife that’s there,” White said. “This comes at a time where we’re getting more storms, the communities are struggling up there with food security and the top priority, the salmon returns … the fabric of our Alaskan communities up there is under threat, and it’s under threat from what’s going on with the weather changing and increased traffic.”
The U.S. Coast Guard is the federal government’s nautical Swiss Army knife — it performs rescue operations, enforces fishing laws, stops drug smugglers, runs border patrols, performs safety inspections, anti-pollution patrols, counter-piracy patrols, and enforces America’s maritime laws.   
The U.S. Navy runs submarines under the Arctic ice, but it doesn’t operate icebreakers. It leaves the Coast Guard to do that — on the Great Lakes, on American rivers, and in the Arctic and Antarctic. 
But for years, the national icebreaker fleet has been underfunded.
When Nome, home to the endpoint of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, ran short of fuel in 2012, the U.S. Coast Guard struggled to muster a single icebreaker, the Healy, to escort a Russian icebreaking tanker to the town. 
At the time, the Healy was the Coast Guard’s lone operating icebreaker. Soon afterward, it reactivated the Polar Star, which had been mothballed because it was old and needed maintenance.
While both ships continue to operate, they’re less capable than modern ships and have suffered mechanical breakdowns, some significant. 
Last year, the Healy caught fire and had to abbreviate its summer patrol. While it returned to service in the fall and went on to discover a volcano-like mountain on the Arctic seafloor, it’s now due for an extended period of maintenance.
“She’s 25 years old and been breaking ice for 25 years, right? That is hard on a ship,” Serumgard said.

Two American icebreakers in the Arctic Ocean in 2025
If America’s icebreaking fleet is near a low ebb, this summer saw the first steps toward the planned resurgence.
As a stopgap until new ships arrive, Congress last year ordered the purchase of the Aiviq, an oilfield services ship designed to work in the Arctic Ocean. 
Eight years ago, following a disaster that saw the Aiviq lose control of a drilling rig during a storm, the Coast Guard deemed the ship “not suitable for military service without substantial refit.”
Since then, the ship has been overhauled and the Coast Guard’s opinion has changed. 
After Congress appropriated the money, the Coast Guard purchased the Aiviq, quickly converted it, and in August this year, commissioned it as the icebreaker Storis.
At the time of that commissioning, commanding officer Capt. Corey Kerns said the ship and its crew would “need to learn to crawl” before they could get fully up and running.
In addition, there were unanswered questions about how well the Storis would handle the kinds of storms that troubled the Aiviq. 
In October, Kerns sat down for another interview after returning from the Arctic.
“One of the things that kind of surprised me was that it went smoother than maybe I would have expected,” he said. 
“She was able to perform, get through the whole thing without any major issues,” Kerns said of the ship’s first patrol.
As a result, Kerns felt confident enough to guide the Storis into the Arctic Ocean, where it worked with the icebreaker Healy to shadow two Chinese research ships in parts of the ocean that the United States claims.
The presence of those Chinese ships and others that have operated in conjunction with Russian ships has alarmed some American officials. 
If China and Russia are present in the region, it behooves the United States to be there too, Kerns said in August.
“The ability to be present guarantees your ability to to maintain sovereignty. And that’s what we’re trying to get at here in the Arctic. We need more icebreakers to be present in our waters and be clear what is our waters,” he said.
The Coast Guard cutter Waesche, a “thin-hulled” ship, also monitored the Chinese ships. Both it and the Storis participated in Arctic Edge 2025, a military training operation near the Russian border that also included Canadian forces.

There’s still work to be done with the Storis, Kerns said. It hasn’t been certified to host Coast Guard helicopters yet, and it hasn’t done a full icebreaking test.
“We got into the ice and we showed that she could break flat ice to some extent, at certain speeds, but … probably not a fully worthy test of capability in the ice, so we’re discussing that now,” he said.
Thirteen years ago, the Aiviq lost control of the drilling rig Kulluk, causing it to run aground on Kodiak Island. That disaster took place after rough seas flooded the Aiviq’s fuel tanks and caused it to lose power. 
This summer, as the Storis sailed across the Gulf of Alaska, it again encountered rough seas. 
“There were a few nights where you didn’t sleep as well, but it was perfectly safe,” Kerns said.
He said his crew are already overhauling equipment and preparing for next summer in the Arctic, working in conjunction with the Healy.
That ship spent 129 days at sea this summer, primarily focusing on science, according to an official Coast Guard description of the patrol.
“We know more about the surface of the moon than we know about the seafloors, so it’s kind of a really amazing area of exploration,” Serumgard said.
En route back to Seattle, the Healy was diverted to help search and rescue efforts in Southwest Alaska following Typhoon Halong, which devastated the region and left hundreds of people homeless. 
In Seattle, the Polar Star was preparing to leave on a five-month roundtrip to Antarctica, where it will help supply research outposts across that continent.
Rasnake said he believes the Polar Star is in the best shape it’s been since being reactivated in 2013, and he looks forward to it possibly breaking the record of the most Antarctic missions by any Coast Guard icebreaker. That would come — if all goes well — in December 2026 or January 2027.

A huge expansion of the fleet is on the horizon
If the Polar Star does break that record, it may not have many opportunities to expand on it. The Coast Guard’s first new heavy icebreaker since the Polar Star is now under construction in Mississippi.
Named the Polar Sentinel, it’s expected to be complete by 2030. The Republican-backed budget plan that President Donald Trump nicknamed the “Big Beautiful Bill” includes funding for two other heavy icebreakers after the Sentinel.
Thirteen other icebreakers were funded in that bill, said Sullivan, the Alaska senator.
“There’s funding for three to four Arctic Security mediums. Those are the target ones for our state. And then there’s 10 light icebreakers. Those are smaller. Those do work in the Great Lakes and other things like that,” he said. 
The medium icebreakers, known as “Arctic Security Cutters,” are among 11 planned ships being built by two separate industry groups. Canada’s Davie Shipbuilding is planning to build five ships — two in Finland, and then three at a to-be-expanded Texas shipyard.
The second group, which includes American, Canadian and Finnish firms, will build two ships in Finland and a third simultaneously in the United States, then build three others in the United States.
The first five ships are expected to be delivered to the Coast Guard within 36 months of a contract being signed, meaning they could be patrolling the Arctic Ocean before the end of the decade.
The newly commissioned Storis will also need upgrades to complete its conversion from a civilian ship. First on the docket may be additional military communications gear, but Kerns said the Coast Guard is also considering how to fit more crew aboard.
In the longer term, Kerns — who has a nautical engineering background — is working with his crew on plans for a deeper refit that could allow the Storis to serve as a kind of “logistics ship.”
As currently built, it carries several large holds originally intended for drilling mud and other materials needed for oil wells at sea. Those could be repurposed, he said this month, and his crew is coming up with ideas for the ship’s first major refit, expected sometime after summer 2026.
The new ships and the changes to the Storis are only part of the Coast Guard’s plan in the coming years. Each ship will also need people and equipment ashore for maintenance and support. The Coast Guard is involved in an ongoing struggle to acquire acreage to expand its Seattle base, which the port authority is reluctant to cede.
Pier space at the Coast Guard’s Alameda base, in California, is also constrained. 
“We’re looking for space in all possible areas,” said Capt. Brian Krautler, chief of operations for the Coast Guard’s Pacific Area. 
The Big Beautiful Bill included $300 million to build a base in Juneau to host the Storis. Other places in Alaska — Seward, Kodiak, Nome, or Dutch Harbor — might also accommodate one or more of the new Arctic Security Cutters. Kodiak is home to the largest Coast Guard base in the country.
Speaking this week at the signing of the so-called ICE Pact, Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said that the Trump administration sees the expansion of the icebreaker fleet as a top priority. 
“Today is a major milestone in the race to secure the Arctic for all of our countries,” she said. “The Arctic is the world’s last, most wild frontier, and our adversaries are racing to claim its strategic position and its rich natural resources for their own. If we give up that high ground, then we will condemn future generations to permanent insecurity, and we’re not going to let that happen on our watch.”

Following the mass shooting at Michigan State University in 2023, state lawmakers advanced a number of gun safety policies, including requiring universal background checks of firearms sales, instituting safe storage requirements, and permitting judges to issue extreme risk protection orders to confiscate firearms from individuals at risk of harming themself or others, a policy sometimes referred to as a red flag law.
Months after these laws took effect in 2024, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order creating the task force, charging its members with improving how those laws are implemented alongside maximizing resources and strengthening coordination across government sectors to reduce gun violence and save lives.

Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian, the state’s chief medical executive and the task force’s chair, explained that the group utilized a public health approach to addressing gun violence in the state.

“There are a lot of issues here that have not historically been thought of as public health issues, and only when we’ve taken this really comprehensive public health approach have we been able to implement real change,” Bagdasarian said. “Gun violence is one of those issues.”
While people often view gun violence as a political issue, a legal issue, or a constitutional issue, it is also a health issue, Bagdasarian explained, noting that gun violence is the leading cause of death among children and teens. 
She pointed to car accidents, which were previously the leading cause of death in children, as another example.
“They are no longer the leading cause of death. They have been declining year upon year, decade upon decade, and it took this whole of government, really comprehensive public health approach to do this,” Bagdasarian said. “There was no single law, there was no single change, but it was years of incremental change.” 
This is what the task force is looking to do for gun violence, she said. 
The report offers several recommendations which can be addressed directly by government agencies, legislative action, through changing government policy, collecting data, supplying funding, or raising awareness. 
It also offers recommendations on reducing the rates of firearm injury and death in specific instances, including suicide, community violence, school safety and firearm related intimate partner violence. 










Because at the end of the day, I think we all have a common goal, and that is to keep our community safe, to keep our families safe and to keep our children safe.


– Dr. Natasha Bagdasarian - Michigan's chief medical executive


On top of the state’s existing policies, the task force also recommended requiring waiting periods for firearm purchases, increasing the age requirement for purchasing a firearm to 21, banning large capacity magazines as well as the sale, purchase and possession of assault weapons and ensuring the gun industry can face legal accountability.
To address gun violence in schools, the report calls on lawmakers to strengthen school safety legislation to protect students and ensure struggling students have access to the help they need. It also recommends standardizing training for school safety officers, promoting a statewide school safety tip line and supporting community violence intervention initiatives aimed at addressing the root causes of violence.
Several of the task force’s recommendations aligned with policies already introduced in the Legislature, including requiring licensing and inspections for gun dealers, barring weapons from government buildings, banning devices to convert semiautomatic weapons into fully automatic weapons and banning ghost guns – firearms without a serial number that are assembled from kits or 3D-printed parts.

To improve the effectiveness of the state’s red flag laws, the task force called for clear guidelines for firearm relinquishment. It also encouraged officials to remove barriers to filing extreme risk protection orders and personal protection orders and improve enforcement. They also called on leaders to strengthen victim support services to address the harms of domestic violence.
The task force also recommended more public education on the state’s secure storage laws and expanded access to gun locks. 
When assembling the task force and its various issue-based subcommittees, Bagdasarian said it was really important to the group and the governor’s team that all the right voices were at the table. 
The task force brought in folks with backgrounds in suicide prevention, community violence intervention, individuals with backgrounds in school safety, members of law enforcement, members of the Department of Education, hunters, gun owners and firearm safety experts, she explained. 
“It was multiple departments across the state, but also people who represented the voices of communities – of urban communities and rural communities – and different personal backgrounds,” Bagdasarian said.  “Because at the end of the day, I think we all have a common goal, and that is to keep our community safe, to keep our families safe and to keep our children safe.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_2451-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067

On Monday, the Emmett Till Interpretive Center announced that it had purchased the barn, thanks to a $1.5 million gift from TV producer Shonda Rhimes, who was moved to donate after reading about the barn, saying, “My hope is that this story never gets lost.”

Dave Tell, author of “Remembering Emmett Till,” said the barn was “written out of history by the very men who committed the crime there — erased from public memory as part of a broader effort to bury the truth and protect white perpetrators. Preserving it now is an intentional act of restoration.”
About 2 a.m. on Aug. 28, 1955, J.W. Milam, his brother, Roy Bryant, and others abducted the Black Chicago 14-year-old from the home of his uncle that he was visiting and took him to the barn, where they beat and killed him.
Till’s mother, Mamie, insisted on an open casket “to let the world see what they did to my son.” Thousands streamed past his body. Some wept. Some fainted. All were moved.
Mamie Till is held by Gene Mobley, who would later marry her, while she stares at the brutalized body of her son, Emmett Till. She opened the casket, and more than 50,000 saw his body. This photo taken by David Jackson, now in public domain, appeared in both the Chicago Defender and Jet magazine.
The brothers admitted to authorities they had kidnapped Till, but claimed they had released him unharmed. A month later, they went on trial for murder, but an all-white jury acquitted them.
Months later, the brothers admitted in Look magazine that they had indeed beaten and killed Till, but authorities were unable to prosecute the brothers again because of double jeopardy.
That Look magazine article also concealed the existence of the barn because that would implicate the others involved, some of whom worked at the barn, Tell said. “Till was killed because of racism. And the barn was pushed out of public memory because of racism. It’s all part of the same story.”
For Keith Beauchamp, producer of the “Till” film and director-producer of “The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,” the barn’s preservation brings mixed emotions.
“On one hand, it’s significant that a physical site connected to Emmett Till’s story will be preserved for future generations,” he said. “On the other hand, it’s also a place that represents deep pain and injustice. Regardless, it is a part of American history that must be acknowledged rather than forgotten, because remembering helps us understand and avoid repeating past mistakes.”
Beauchamp thanked Rhimes for her “generous gift to help preserve this history, especially during a time of debate over how our past should be remembered.”
He praised Jeff Andrews, who bought the property that included the barn in 1994. After learning about the barn, Andrews began to let Till’s family and other visitors spend time at the historic site.
Beauchamp praised his care, “maintaining the barn and welcoming the public, kept the site meaningful long before any official preservation began.”
In 2007, a group of Tallahatchie County citizens, Black and white, gathered outside the courthouse in Sumner — the same courthouse where Till’s killers walked free — and publicly apologized.

An open letter published Monday on the Emmett Till Interpretive Center website says, “That act of honesty became a moral compass for our work. Since then, we have restored the courthouse where justice failed, commemorated the riverbank where Emmett’s body was found, and replaced the signs that hatred tried to destroy. Every project has carried the same conviction: a nation does not grow stronger by forgetting; it grows stronger by telling the truth. The barn is the next chapter in that conviction.”
On its website, the center said, “We did not want to have to pay for sacred ground. We understand that many other people also feel that even $1 is too much to pay for a site where such deep harm occurred. It’s an obstacle we wrestled with every step of the way. We explored every possible alternative to purchase, including asking for the owner to donate the property and exploring legal options including easements and eminent domain, but none were viable.
“The turning point came when we asked ourselves: What happens if someone else buys it? We could not risk this site — one of the most sacred in American history — falling into the hands of speculators or even hate groups. The barn is simply too important to leave to chance.”
The center, which has partnered with the National Park Service, will hold the title to the barn: “We chose preservation over risk, and truth over silence — because you can’t put a price on our history.”
Davis Houck, the founding director of the Emmett Till Archives at Florida State University as well as the Fannie Lou Hamer Professor of Rhetorical Studies, said the fact the money to purchase the barn came from private philanthropy “makes this a most generous gift — to the community of Drew, to the state of Mississippi, and ultimately to the entire nation.”
The center’s director, Patrick Weems, told Mississippi Today that buying the barn is just the start of this major project for the nonprofit. “Now we’re working to raise the resources to transform it into a sacred site,” he said.
By the 75th anniversary of Till’s lynching in 2030, the center says it plans to open the barn “as a part of a larger public memorial — a place of truth, creativity and conscience. Visitors will come not to look at tragedy, but to confront their own role in the ongoing work of democracy.”
The center says its role “is not possession, but protection — serving as caretakers on behalf of the community and the nation.”
The center says its work “has always been shaped by the truth, courage and moral vision of the Till family, especially Mamie Till-Mobley’s charge that ‘let the world see.’ … We will continue to listen to and engage family members, descendants, and community elders as we transform this site of trauma into a sacred space for remembrance, healing and collective conscience.”
Till’s cousin, Deborah Watts, co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, echoed the center’s sentiment. “We consider that area sacred ground where Emmett was murdered,” she said.

She welcomes further conversations with the center and wants to learn more about the upcoming plans, she said. “Will the family’s concerns be in consideration?”
Possible plans include creating a welcome center for visitors in nearby Drew. “For too long, people in the Delta — especially in places like Drew — have carried the weight of this story without the world truly seeing us,” said Gloria Dickerson, founder of We2Gether Creating Change, a nonprofit based in Drew. “The barn’s preservation means our voices, our land and our legacy will finally be part of how the world remembers Emmett Till — and how it learns from him.”
Another welcome center may be built in Mound Bayou, Mississippi’s first all-Black town, where Medgar Evers once sold insurance for his mentor, civil rights leader and surgeon Dr. T.R.M. Howard.
Both men worked on the Till case, tracking down witnesses for the historic trial that drew international attention. The injustice of the killers getting away with murder helped propel the modern civil rights movement.
Author Wright Thompson, who wrote “The Barn” about this historic piece of soil, called the purchase “the most important thing to happen to the Delta in generations because history is most accurately told here, and most reliably erased, through the land. Who owns it, who farms it, who lived and died on it, whose ghost is trapped in it. The Delta remains a place where power is tied to ownership of the dirt.”
He praised Rhimes for stepping “into the breach and through her generosity, the dirt has been reclaimed, and once reclaimed, the slow process of cleaning the blood from it can begin. This is a place people will visit for generations.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/06093116/IMG_4926-scaled.jpg,,,2025-11-24 09:57:02.864067

Will migrant and undocumented immigrant workers return to California farms next year?
As the harvest season comes to a close, that question looms over Central Valley — raising concerns about the region’s economy and the state’s agricultural industry, reports CalMatters’ Nigel Duara.
In addition to California’s overall economy and the economies of its big cities, some of the state’s small farm towns are feeling the fallout of President Donald Trump’s aggressive campaign to conduct the largest deportation operation in U.S. history.
Total taxable transactions in Fresno County’s Firebaugh, for example, were down 29% in the second quarter of this year compared to the same time last year. In nearby Chowchilla, total taxable receipts were down 21%. The food bank in Firebaugh also used to serve about 50 families — now that number is up to 150.

Ben Gallegos, Firebaugh City Manager: “We need those individuals to drive our community. They’re the ones that eat at our local restaurants, they’re the ones that shop at our local stores. Without them, what do we do? They’re scared to come out because of the color of their skin.” 

Migrant and immigrant labor also help power the state’s $60-billion agricultural industry. In an October notice, the U.S. Department of Labor rang the alarm about how losing farmworkers across the country could threaten the nation’s food supply and cause “significant disruptions” to “prices for U.S. consumers.”
Though it’s difficult to know both the number of farmworkers currently employed and how much the fear of deportation is affecting the industry’s employment, some say California farmworkers are weighing the risk of staying or self-deporting. 

Jesus Ibañez, a Fresno immigration attorney who works with farmworkers: “My clients say this country’s not for them anymore. They feel like they’re on borrowed time here. That sentiment is not one I heard a lot one year ago.”

CA prisons go over budget

California’s multibillion-dollar prison system is on track to exceed its budget, despite prison closures and trimmed payroll expenses, writes CalMattes’ Cayla Mihalovich.
This year the state budget set aside $17.5 billion for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. But over three years, the department is expected to overspend by about $850 million — and contribute to the state’s overall projected budget deficit — according to a new report from the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office.
Part of the projected overspend is because costs are rising. In May the department received $357 million in a one-time allocation from the general fund because it didn’t have the money to cover workers’ compensation, overtime and food for incarcerated people.
The department’s budget woes come despite Gov. Gavin Newsom’s closing prisons in an attempt to save the state money. Next year Newsom aims to close the fifth prison under his governorship, a facility in Riverside County. His administration estimates each prison closure saves about $150 million a year.

Let’s dive into some election news:

New gubernatorial contender: California U.S. Rep. Eric Swalwell unveiled his candidacy for governor on a late-night show last week. The seven-term congressmember is an outspoken critic of Trump and helped lead the second impeachment of the president following the Jan. 6, 2021 attack. Though Swalwell’s initial campaign launch offered no specific policy details, Swalwell said “no one will keep California safer” than he will. He also cited his experience as a planning commissioner and city councilmember for his California hometown of Dublin. Read more from CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.


San Diego shakeup?: San Diego may lose its only Republican in Congress if Proposition 50’s voting maps are ultimately held up in court. California’s 48th Congressional District currently covers conservative East County San Diego communities, and is represented by U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa. But 11 Democrats are vying to unseat Issa in next year’s midterm elections now that the district has been redrawn to give Democrats an advantage. Read more from CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.

California nursing homes affiliated with Shlomo Rechnitz are facing lawsuits alleging that patients were raped, ignored and unnecessarily exposed to COVID-19. Rechnitz’ companies deny the allegations. Read the key takeaways from the special report by CalMatters’ Jocelyn Wiener.






California Voices
When political leaders ignore the sovereignty of Native peoples, they encourage citizens to see them as part of the country’s past — instead of governments that still exercise authority in the present, writes Kerri Malloy, assistant professor of Native American and Indigenous Studies at San José State University and enrolled member of the Yurok Tribe.
Museums and universities still resist returning cultural items to Native American tribes, but through repatriation agreements tribes can regain legal control of the items and decide how their cultural heritages are used, writes Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán, tribal archives, collections and repatriation manager for the Yuhaaviatam of San Manuel Nation in Highland.

,California,2025-11-24 13:31:00+00:00,CalMatters,How fear of Trump’s immigration blitz is changing life in California farm towns,Nigel Duara,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/11/immigration-california-farms/,"Tax receipts are down almost 30% in one California farm town, where immigrants are afraid to go out and some longtime workers are weighing self-deportation during the second Trump administration.","Trailing in the shade of a tractor-pulled harvester, a small huddle of people in broad hats trawl the ochre rows of a green field. Every six or so feet, someone squats down and pulls into the morning sunlight a bright, spotted watermelon. 
Walking a dozen yards behind this crew of pickers is their supervisor, Raul. He has done this for 21 years, since he was 18. 
He, better than anybody, knows that perfectly ripe watermelons aren’t just pulled off the vine, they’re chosen. And the choosing still relies, as it ever has, on workers who are delicate with the fruit and severe with the choice. The job requires years of repetition: seeing the right melon, bending to heft it, cutting its root and placing it carefully on the harvester bed or a bag hanging off the back. 
Rookies have trouble. They pick a melon before it’s ready, or they fumble the blades and cut themselves, or their bodies simply inform them after a day or a week of bending and lifting and bending and lifting that they will not be getting out of bed that morning. 
Raul knows this land. He raised his kids in the farmland around the town of Firebaugh, 38 miles west of Fresno. 
He points to a grove of full-grown almond trees near the Del Bosque melon farm where he works. 
“We were putting in those trees when they were young, my first year,” Raul said in Spanish.
For the last two decades, Raul would drive north when the melon harvest ends to work in the vineyards and then the apple and cherry orchards. 
But this year is different, and Raul, who didn’t want his last name used in this story because he is in the country illegally, is not sure how much longer he can stay in the United States. 
As this year’s harvest ends, the small Central Valley towns that rely on migrant or undocumented labor to survive are themselves forced to imagine the end of a way of life. 
The worry here is the workers might not return next year, at least not in the numbers that sustain local economies and power the state’s $60 billion agricultural industry, which grows three-fourths of the fruits and nuts consumed in the U.S.
The second Trump administration has pledged to carry out the largest deportation program in American history. They have, so far, mostly left the agricultural industry alone. But Trump and his advisers have wavered on whether to protect farms from immigration raids, so the seasonal workers and their employers will have to wait and see.
In the meantime, what connects tiny truck stop towns and big cities of this part of the valley is fear: of tightened water allocations, of market turbulence and, this year, of immigration agents.

Small farm towns in the Central Valley are similar in their seasonal economics to a beach town on the East Coast: Both swell in summer with a population boom, then dig in for a slow winter. Firebaugh City Manager Ben Gallegos said the town of 4,000 grows to 8,000 people in the summer, then empties out after the harvest. 
The story plays out in the numbers, but already this year’s numbers tell a different tale.
In the second quarter of the year, which runs from April 1 to June 30, total taxable transactions in Firebaugh were down 29% from the same quarter last year, according to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration. In nearby Chowchilla, total taxable receipts are down 21% in the second quarter of this year compared to the same period last year.  
People don’t want to shop or go out to eat, Gallegos said. The city of Firebaugh is staring down cuts to its police force, its parks and its senior center. In September, the appearance of county probation officers dressed in green fatigues caused waves of panicked Whatsapp texts. Some people went into hiding. 
The food bank in Firebaugh used to serve about 50 families. Today, at weekly distributions behind city hall, that number is up to 150. When it’s over, volunteers take the remaining food boxes to families who are too afraid to leave their homes.  
“We need those individuals to drive our community,” Gallegos said. “They’re the ones that eat at our local restaurants, they’re the ones that shop at our local stores. Without them, what do we do? 
“They’re scared to come out because of the color of their skin.” 
Raul and his crew of six pickers will have to choose, too. Will they come back?

Borrowed time
“My clients say this country’s not for them anymore,” said Fresno immigration attorney Jesus Ibañez, who works with farmworkers. “They feel like they’re on borrowed time here. That sentiment is not one I heard a lot one year ago.”
The choices to stay or self-deport come down to money, but also the futures those farmworkers want for their children born in the United States, Ibañez said. 
Sometimes the choice is more complicated – the U.S. isn’t as safe for them as it was, but its school districts still offer things like mental health care and physical therapy that migrant workers fear they won’t get in their home countries. Balanced against that is the possibility of one or both parents being deported, leaving the children with no legal guardians in this country. 
Statistically, it’s difficult to even know the number of farmworkers employed today, let alone how much the fear of deportation is affecting employment in the industry. In late October, Ag Alert, a publication of the California Farm Bureau, broke the news that both the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Labor canceled annual farmworker labor surveys. That means that, for the first time since the late 1980s, there is no federal documentation of farmworker hours, wages or demographics. Historically, about 40% of farmworkers in the last decade were undocumented. 
The nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that more immigrants left the country or were deported this year than the number who arrived. If the trend holds until the end of the year, 2025 will be the first year since the 1960s that the population of immigrants in the U.S. falls. 
For Raul, the question of returning is simple. He will need to earn money so he can support his kids, so he plans on coming back. 
“Que quisiera un padre? Raul said. “Quiere que sea lo mejor para los hijos.”
What would a father want? He wants what’s best for his children.

A town shaped by a river
The road into Firebaugh rolls up and over a wash, next to the spot where Andrew Firebaugh founded a ferry across the San Joaquin River that became an important stop on stagecoach routes. The river has always been what kept this town alive, first as an obstacle around which they built a settlement and later as the lifeblood of its farms and fields.
Just outside of town, the pavement has fractured and buckled. The street signs are tiny and faded on the broad grid of roads bounded by fields that push right up to the street. You orient yourself with both cardinal directions and crops. 
Prunus amygdalus, also called almond trees, look like they’re raising their arms. Pistacia vera, the pistachio tree, look like they’re shrugging. Uncovered truck bed bins spill ripe red tomatoes on tight turns. Tractors with their tillers raised trundle slowly down the highway. On the side of the road bobs of lettuce heads peek out of the ground, followed by a massive pile of unhulled almonds, and then a series of palm trees, some very tall and some a little squat.

At the corner of one of these roads, just before it meets the interstate, is the melon farm owned by Joe Del Bosque, Raul’s employer of 21 years. And the first thing people inclined to these kinds of questions will ask Del Bosque is why he hires undocumented labor. 
He begins explaining his trouble hiring people on the federal H-2A visa, which permits employers to hire foreign seasonal workers. It’s not just that he has to pay them $3 more per hour, Del Bosque said. It’s that he must also pay for their transportation to and from the farm every day. He must pay for the rooms where they sleep and the food they eat. It is, he said, economically impossible to rely on the visa program. 
The next suggestion is hiring local people. Del Bosque laughed and said he tried that. The locals made it a week, at the most, and then found some other way to make money that didn’t leave them sore all over. 
He knows that one day soon, he’ll likely have to turn over operations to the only family member active in the business, his son-in-law. But that’s only if there’s still a farm to hand over. 
“I don’t have a lot of confidence that the future of our farm and a lot of farms is looking very good right now,” Del Bosque said.

The U.S. Department of Labor is already sounding the alarm on losing farmworkers and the threat that poses to the nation’s food supply in a notice in the Federal Register in October. 
“The near total cessation of the inflow of illegal aliens combined with the lack of an available legal workforce, results in significant disruptions to production costs and threatening the stability of domestic food production and prices for U.S consumers,” the department said in a rule-making proposal that would allow employers to pay H-2A workers less than they are paying now. 
“Unless the Department acts immediately to provide a source of stable and lawful labor, this threat will grow,” the notice said, citing the likelihood of enhanced immigration enforcement under the budget bill Trump signed earlier this year.
Those longer-term consequences in the labor market won’t be felt evenly.
This is Trump country
Fresno County and the rest of the Central Valley went for Trump in the 2024 election. Del Bosque calls himself a conservative, though he donates to both parties – Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and former President Barack Obama have both made public visits to his acreage. 
Next to his farm – right up on the property line where everyone will see it – is a massive Trump 2024 sign, erected by his neighbor. No one driving to the Del Bosque Farm will miss it. Del Bosque laughs about it, but it’s also a reflection of how their differing crops help define their politics.

Del Bosque grows melons, which are labor intensive and require lots of people to work long hours. He supports an easier path to employment for undocumented workers. Next door, his neighbor grows almonds. They only require one person to drive a “shaker” to get the nuts out of the trees and another to operate the basket that catches them as they fall. His neighbor, whom CalMatters was unable to contact, doesn’t require much labor at all. 
“Here’s the thing, not all farms are the same, not all farmers are the same,” Del Bosque said. “I’m concerned about these people. (The neighbor) is not concerned about that, because he has almonds. He manages his almonds with just him and one or two more people. 
“He can do his whole farm with two, three people. So this immigration (enforcement) does not affect him at all.”
Author and Central Valley farmer David Mas Masumoto wrote about neighborly tension in his 1995 “Epitaph for a Peach.”  
We depend on labor from Mexico, part of a seasonal flow of men and families. Many come here for the summer, return to Mexico during the slow winter months, and return the following year. They’re predominantly young men with the faces of boys. We’re dependent on their strong backs and quick hands. And they are hungry for work.… 
This September, farmers drive down the road staring straight ahead, steering clear of a chance meeting with a competitor who was once a neighbor. Eyes avoid eyes, hands hesitate and refrain from waving. It’s an ugly September.
Politics out here can make it a whole ugly season.

‘Big and rapid change’
What if they don’t come back? 
“We don’t have a precedent for trying to understand that major of a disruption to our state’s economy and demographics,” said Liz Carlisle, an associate professor in the Environmental Studies Program at UC Santa Barbara. 
Something is changing in one of the world’s most productive agricultural regions. Wine grapes are going unharvested, rotting in the fields, as exports to Canada collapsed under new tariffs and younger consumers started shying away from alcohol. Land values are cratering in places with limited water, leaving farmers in multi-million dollar debt. Water costs are skyrocketing in part because of a 2014 conservation law that seeks to regulate years of agricultural over-pumping. 
“I do think we’re looking at the potential of really big and rapid change to California’s agricultural sector and all of the workers and everything that touches the economy,” Carlisle said. “It’s kind of a perfect storm because you have major shifts in trade policy at the same time as you have major shifts in the workforce at the same time you have major shifts in climate and potential regulatory responses to those climate impacts.
“So that’s a lot of huge transformations for people in the agricultural sector to try to manage at once.” 
This year, the problems were the usual problems: Five or six big storms clobbered the Central Valley with rain and hail, hitting young crops just as they were approaching maturity. But larger battles loom. 
During the first Trump administration, the labor market for Central Valley farmers tightened significantly, said California Fresh Fruits Association president Daniel Hartwig, when migration numbers plummeted and farms would lose workers to a neighboring operation that offered an extra 25 cents per hour. 
During this second go-round with Trump as president, those concerns seem almost archaic. Now, Hartwig said, he’ll spend a couple hours every week running down rumors of immigration enforcement: an unmarked white van in Madera County that turned out to belong to a carpet cleaning business; a cluster of cars outside a health clinic that turned out to be a local police operation; a shaky TikTok of unknown provenance showing men in green fatigues that sent farmworkers rushing back to their homes. 
“If you did let your imagination run wild, especially if you were undocumented, everywhere you look, around the corner, is somebody that’s you’re fearful is going to try and get you and deport you,” Hartwig said. 
Now these towns in the lower basin of the Central Valley hunker down for an anxious winter, on the farms, at the food bank, in Firebaugh’s City Hall. 
They are dependent on so many factors out of their own control. Executive impulses in the White House. Cloud formations and wind speeds. Commodity prices set globally. Water prices set locally. And in the winter there is time to think and there is time to ask questions. 
Will the federal government increase immigration enforcement at farms? Will it rain enough early in the season? Will it rain too much when the fruit is in the fields? Could there be a repeat of last year’s heat wave? Or this year’s storms? What if the water gets costlier? What if the commodities get cheaper? 
And a question perhaps more crucial than any other: What if they don’t come back?

Guest Commentary written by

Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán
Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán is the tribal archives, collections, and repatriation manager for the Yuhaaviatam of San Manuel Nation in Highland, CA.


Imagine your relatives’ bones stored in the basement of an unfamiliar university or museum. 
Boxes of ancestors and artifacts are often stacked on top of each other, for use in research, education or just curiosity. Mostly they are ignored or forgotten, left to collect dust.
When I first started working in museums, I thought they were magical places full of history, and that universities stood for truth and learning. But I soon realized that for Native people, these places can be painful. 
What I saw as saving history, others saw as losing it. What I thought was education, others felt was misrepresentation.
Ever since museums and universities were created in the U.S., Native peoples’ stories have been told by those who colonized their lands and spread harmful ideas. 
This led to more than 100 years of taking their heritage from them without permission. Museums and universities took hundreds of thousands of Native American human remains and millions of cultural items.
The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, enacted in 1990, challenged these practices. It gave Indigenous communities a legal path to reclaim their ancestors and cultural belongings. California passed a similar law, the California Native American Graves Protection Act of 2001. 
Yet decades later, too little has been returned to tribes, and some institutions still resist, saying the items are needed for education or research.
I’ve worked in museums and universities for 25 years as a curator and collections manager. I’ve seen how cultural collections are treated. 
Museums only display about 1% of their collections; the rest is hoarded away in substandard storage. Universities have boxes of artifacts that haven’t been opened or studied since they were first collected.

Jeannine Pedersen-Guzmán 
I often had to fight for the basic care of collections. My concerns were ignored. I worked in storage rooms with leaking pipes. I’ve removed cultural materials from mold-infested containers. And I’ve tried organizing a warehouse of 5,000 boxes of archaeological material that had been ignored for years. 
At one museum, collections storage was removed from a new building plan, leaving the collection without a proper home.
So why do these places want to keep their collections? Many don’t have the money, interest or cultural knowledge to care for them. Most of the public will never see these things. 
And how can scientists understand this material if they don’t work with tribes?
Change is afoot. New rules for the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act passed last year. They make things clearer, remove roadblocks and require tribes to be consulted before items are shown or studied. 
Some scholars feel the changes are a threat to knowledge, but they are long overdue.
Today, repatriation doesn’t always mean removing items. Sometimes tribes work with museums and universities through “hold-in-trust” agreements. This means the institution keeps the items, but the tribe has legal control and decides how their cultural heritage is used or shared.
Each tribe has different views: Some are okay with display and research; others are not. Some items can be used for teaching; others cannot. It is about pausing to ask, listen and ideally work together.
Tribes are saying: “Nothing about us, without us.” They want to tell their own stories but are also willing to collaborate. It is here that knowledge can be transformed.
After the new regulations passed, many museums reassessed their Native American galleries. They are now actively consulting with tribes to tell authentic stories through Indigenous voices and perspectives.
The law also has led to more community-based archaeology. For example, in 2018, during the construction of their new museum in Palm Springs, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians halted work after noticing a patch of dark soil. 
Thousands of artifacts were unearthed, and archaeologists helped identify the site as the oldest in the Coachella Valley. The tribe published a book about the discovery and now shares the story in their museum.
After years of trying to improve collections care, I chose to leave museums and universities, to help Native American tribes bring their ancestors and cultural items home. Today, I find meaning in watching tribal citizens connect with returned cultural items or helping rebury an ancestor held in storage for 100 years.
In my heart, I know this is the right thing to do. I hope as the new federal administration sets its priorities, this bedrock law remains in place.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/041424_Native-American-Exhibit_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

Guest Commentary written by

Governor Gavin Newsom and President Donald Trump rarely agree on anything. Their feud has played out for years on immigration raids, wildfire relief and the moral direction of American democracy. 
Yet this month, their rivalry produced an unlikely harmony. Within days of each other, one issued a message and the other a proclamation recognizing Native American Heritage Month.
Trump’s message wrapped its praise of Native peoples in patriotism and national unity. “As we prepare to celebrate 250 glorious years of American independence, we honor the generations of Native Americans whose service have strengthened our country,” the White House statement reads.
Newsom’s proclamation used the language of empathy and inclusion: “As Californians navigate federal policies impacting our communities …  we shine a light on the first people of this nation — often relocated to this state by force through similar federal policies throughout history — who have nonetheless found ways to persist, resist, and thrive.”
Despite their opposing tones, both rely on the same story: Native peoples exist within the United States not as nations whose sovereignty predates it. 
Each statement celebrates endurance but ignores the political relationship that defines it. Both portray Native peoples as contributors to the American project, not as governments that still hold authority over their lands and citizens. 
In different registers, the progressive governor and the populist president perform the same act of erasure, turning the first peoples of this land into symbols of American virtue.
Newsom’s proclamation goes further than most. He describes the forced relocations, boarding schools and assimilation policies that targeted Native peoples, and he honors their cultural revival. 
Yet by merging California’s original Native nations with Native peoples who relocated here from other states, the text blurs a critical distinction: California’s tribes are not guests the state has “embraced;” they are sovereign governments on their own land. 
The proclamation’s tone of benevolent inclusion allows California to appear enlightened without addressing its continuing responsibilities — from unrecognized tribes, to land and water rights still under contest today.
Trump’s statement takes a simpler route to the same destination. 
By thanking Native Americans for strengthening “our Nation’s greatness,” it folds them into a single patriotic narrative that leaves no space for self-determination. It praises survival while reaffirming U.S. dominance — the familiar pattern of celebrating diversity while denying power.
These messages matter, because political statements shape how the public understands California’s and the nation’s relationship with its Native nations. 
When political leaders talk about “heritage” but not “sovereignty,” they encourage citizens to see Native peoples as part of the past instead of as governments still exercising authority in the present.
That misunderstanding has practical consequences. Across the state, tribal governments manage forests, restore rivers, operate education and health systems and lead climate adaptation projects that benefit all Californians. Yet when sovereignty is ignored, those partnerships are treated as charitable collaboration, rather than as government-to-government obligations.
For non-Native Californians, this is not only about history; it is about how our state governs itself today. Building fire-resilient landscapes, addressing drought and managing growth all depend on respecting tribal authority and knowledge. Recognition without power is not reconciliation; it is continuity by another name.
If Native American Heritage Month is to mean anything, it should mark a shift from ceremony to accountability. California can honor Native peoples not by congratulating itself for inclusion, but by deepening partnerships with the sovereign nations whose lands make this state possible.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/092223-Native-American-Day-MG-CM-10.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

Here are takeaways from our special report.,"In summary
CalMatters recently reported on a cluster of lawsuits against nursing homes owned by Los Angeles entrepreneur Shlomo Rechnitz. Here are takeaways from our special report.


The chain of California nursing homes owned by Shlomo Rechnitz and his companies has faced state scrutiny for years. Now, a series of recent lawsuits is bringing renewed attention to his companies. 
Elder care advocates say Rechnitz’ companies are Exhibit A in how regulators at the Department of Public Health are failing some of California’s most vulnerable citizens.  
In 2021, a CalMatters investigation documented that the state Department of Public Health allowed Rechnitz and his companies to operate 18 nursing homes while delaying a decision on granting licenses to them. The state had kept the license applications in a “pending” status for seven years after he acquired them. Rechnitz and his companies were allowed to continue operating five additional homes even after the state denied licenses to them. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law meant to address the issue, but state regulators in 2023 granted Rechnitz’ companies the licenses to operate the homes just before the measure took effect.
Here are key takeaways from CalMatters’ most recent coverage:
Newly licensed homes now subjects of patient lawsuits
Several homes that received licenses in 2023 are now being sued by patients and their family members. 
In February 2024, a Los Angeles County jury awarded $2.34 million to an 84-year-old nursing home resident named Betsy Jentz, finding that Country Villa Wilshire had violated her rights on 132 occasions, at times leading to serious injuries.
This coming February, a jury in Shasta County is scheduled to hear a case against Windsor Redding, which is accused of negligence in the 2020 COVID-19 deaths of 24 patients. 
Another upcoming case involves 78-year-old Barbara Pendley, who allegedly died after suffering severe dehydration at North Point Healthcare & Wellness Centre in Fresno. 
And trial is scheduled to begin next spring in the case of a 79-year-old dementia patient, referred to as Cheryl Doe, who was allegedly raped twice at Windsor Healthcare Center of Oakland; a second case against the same facility alleges that excessive sedation of 64-year-old Alando Williams led to his death.
Rechnitz and his companies have denied allegations in all of these cases. 
“It is accurate that nursing homes are the target of abusive lawsuits that accomplish nothing but depleting resources for patient care,” said Mark Johnson, an attorney for the facilities and their holding company, Brius.
On average, more citations at Rechnitz homes
A CalMatters analysis of data from both the state health department and the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services found 78 California facilities in which Shlomo Rechnitz or his wife, Tamar, were listed among the owners. On average the facilities fared poorly on several key quality metrics compared to the state overall. 

In the past three years, these 78 nursing homes received an average of 12.4 citations for facility-reported incidents, compared with 6.1 for all nursing homes statewide.
A higher proportion of the facilities has received a federal fine in the last three years than the state’s overall rate. Two-thirds of these facilities received at least one federal fine in the last three years, compared to half of all facilities across the state.
The facilities have been fined an average of $47,897 during the last three years, compared to an average of $29,573 for all California facilities.

Johnson, the attorney for Rechnitz’ facilities, said in his email that a large percentage of these facilities are located in Los Angeles County, which issues deficiencies at a higher rate than any county in California, many of which are overturned on appeal.
He also said that “Mr. Rechnitz’s facilities self-report at a significantly higher rate than other comparable facilities,” which, in turn, could lead them to have a higher number of deficiencies.
Rechnitz is wealthy
In August 2024, an Alameda County jury found that Alameda Healthcare & Wellness had violated the rights of  71-year-old James Doherty, Sr. more than 1,400 times. That included seven instances in which staff failed to transport him, causing him to miss chemotherapy treatments, court documents said. Doherty died following the development of a large pressure sore. His family was awarded $7.6 million.
Another key revelation from that case: Rechnitz and his wife disclosed their net worth. According to financial documents filed in court, it comes to $786 million. 
Tony Chicotel, a senior staff attorney for California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, said that dollar figure hasn’t been divulged publicly before.
 “At least in some of these chains, the money that was meant to go for patient care is being stripped away and sent up top to the ownership,” he said.
Advocates say the state is not doing its job
Elder care advocates say the state Department of Public Health could push for greater accountability, including withholding licenses from owners they deem to be bad actors.
Wendy York, a Sacramento attorney specializing in nursing home abuse, said that watching elderly and disabled residents repeatedly suffer the same types of injuries in these facilities “feels like a broken record. It feels like Groundhog Day.”
There are “government agencies who are responsible for their oversight,” York said, but “at the end of the day, it feels like we’re the ones who are doing the enforcement.”
Department of Public Health spokesman Mark Smith said in an emailed statement that the department “remains committed to transparency and accountability for all providers, and to the health and safety of all nursing home residents in California.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/102525_NursingHomeEmpire_FM_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker has pre-filed a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would require those convicted of rape and incest that results in a pregnancy to get a vasectomy or be castrated.
HB 46, sponsored by Rep. Juandalynn Givan, D-Birmingham, would also allow a mother to get an abortion under the same circumstances. Givan said in an interview Wednesday that the bill is more about the broader conversation of bodily autonomy.
“We have already set a double standard,” Givan said. “Have you seen a bill crafted that tells a man what he cannot, what he can’t and cannot do with his body? You have not, outside of the standard laws that speaks to rape and incest, and we already know that that is definitely a crime.”

Robin Marty, a longtime abortion advocate and executive director of a clinic that was once Alabama’s largest abortion provider, opposes the bill.
“As somebody who spends all of her time helping people access reproductive health care, It is just as terrible to create a bill that would take away the reproductive autonomy of a man as it is to have no abortion allowed for a person who can become pregnant,” Marty said in an interview Wednesday afternoon.
In 2020, Rep. Rolanda Hollis, D-Birmingham, sponsored legislation that would require a man to get a vasectomy within a month of his 50th birthday or the birth of his third biological child. It was not considered. The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union opposed the legislation, though it did not cite a specific reason for opposition.
ACLU referred comments to the Southern Poverty Law Center, who did not have an expert available. 
Givan’s bill would apply the punishment regardless of the defendant’s age. She said that there needs to be more accountability on those convicted of sex crimes.
“If we can certainly tell a woman what to do with her body, then we should be able to tell a man he should be held accountable for what he does with his,” Givan said. 
Marty agreed with Givan’s sentiment on accountability, but said that can’t be achieved by causing more harm.
“That’s not a wrong that can be fixed by saying ‘here, look, we’re going to harm you as well,’” Marty said.

Trump is constitutionally prohibited from running for reelection in 2028. (Photo posted on Trump's Truth Social account)As the United States approaches its 250th birthday, the tethers that bind it to the principles of democracy, enshrined in the Constitution by its founders, are being tested in unprecedented fashion. President Donald Trump, wielding power in a manner “like no one has ever seen” as the president likes to say, is riding roughshod over the tenets that have come to define the nation. 
Some of Trump’s acts, such as eviscerating cultural and civic norms – rewriting history by editing exhibits at the Smithsonian Museum, commandeering the Kennedy Center Honors, and holding a cage match at the White House to celebrate a national milestone – are extreme, though not illegal. 
Others, such as demanding voter rolls from states, seeking the prosecution of political enemies, and unilaterally raising taxes on Americans via tariffs, appear to violate the law.
Less than a year into his second term, Trump has: 

Issued false emergency declarations in order to deploy military troops to Los Angeles, and the National Guard to Washington, D.C., Memphis, Chicago, and Portland, Oregon;
violated federal law at least six times by withholding funding previously authorized by Congress;
called for the arrest of Democratic lawmakers who urged service members and intelligence officials to disobey illegal orders, calling it ““SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!” on his social media platform; and,
welcomed to the White House the Saudi crown prince, who the U.S. found to be responsible for the dismemberment of an American journalist. 

Americans, lulled into complacency by Trump’s “truly masterful flood the zone with shit strategy,” have been slow to awaken to the panoply of threats posed by the president, says UNLV Associate Professor of Political Science, Rebecca Gill. “It is just too much for any one person to keep track of the ways in which this administration is flat out violating laws.”
The resulting exhaustion and complacency have invoked the metaphor of the frog who remains in gradually heating water, unaware of its impending doom. 
“Many Americans — including people in positions of power — remain far too complacent about the threat,” the New York Times wrote in an opinion piece. 
An assessment of America’s journey toward autocracy from the Steady State, a group of more than 300 former intelligence officials who once trained their expert eyes on foreign regimes, finds “unmistakable warning signs at home.” 
The report concludes that “absent organized resistance” the United States “is likely to continue along a path of accelerating democratic erosion, risking further consolidation of executive dominance and a loss of credibility as a model of democracy abroad.”
Pathway to autocracy
“Countries that slide from democracy toward autocracy tend to follow similar patterns,” says the New York Times piece that gauges whether democracy is eroding in America, based on a dozen markers. “The sobering reality is that the United States has regressed, to different degrees, on all 12.” America is “still not close to being a true autocracy, in the mold of Russia or China. But once countries begin taking steps away from democracy, the march often continues.” 
The Steady State analysis identifies five trends that indicate America is moving toward autocracy. 
The first is the consolidation of executive overreach “through governance by decree and weaponization of the state, combining sweeping executive orders and expansive emergency claims with politicized control of the civil service and oversight bodies, the targeting of perceived opponents via justice and intelligence functions, and preferential protection of allies.”
Trump has publicly directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to prosecute political foes, including former FBI chief James Comey, former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and New York Attorney General Letitia James.

“He is attempting to put people in jail for either prosecuting him or for defecting against him,” says Gill of UNLV. “The big targets are either people who attempted to hold him accountable legally, or they are current or former Republicans. He is much more willing than most to go very hard on co-partisans that betray him.”
Retired Nevada Supreme Court Justice Michael Cherry says he’s not convinced the president is targeting political foes. 
“What he went through when they indicted him on all this stuff. It’s tough. Who knows? He’s a human being,” Cherry said during an interview. “He’s got constitutional rights, not only as a human being, but as the president. I don’t know. That’s up to the courts.”
Cherry notes that James “ran on ‘I’m going to prosecute Trump.’ And she did, and now he responds with ‘Well, I’m going to get Letitia and some others.’ So it’s a tough question.”
Federal and state prosecutors have resigned in protest or been fired for refusing to do Trump’s bidding. 
On Wednesday, Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s former personal attorney who was handpicked by the president to charge Comey when other prosecutors declined, was grilled by a judge regarding her failure to follow basic criminal procedures in procuring an indictment against Comey. 
Comey and James, who is also being prosecuted by Halligan, argue that her appointment violates the law. 
Federal judge rules Chattah is ineligible as Acting U.S. attorney to prosecute cases

A similar issue plagues Trump’s Nevada appointee, Sigal Chattah, who has remained in office, jeopardizing prosecutions, even though her appointment as U.S. attorney expired in July. 
Trump has doled out commutations and pardons, based more on fealty than merit. He commuted the sentence of former Congressman George Santos, noting that in the House, he voted Republican. He has not ruled out pardons for Jeffrey Epstein’s accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, who vouched for Trump’s gentlemanly behavior, or former acquaintance and convicted domestic abuser Sean Combs. 
On his first day in office this year, Trump pardoned more than 1,500 Jan. 6 insurrectionists.
The president granted federal pardons to Nevada’s fake electors, although they faced no federal charges.
Also on his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order declaring there are two sexes.
“They’re building a society without transgender people,” says Rockathena Brittain, a transgender woman. “This was all done in Nazi Germany. They’re saying ‘hey, you’re stuck with the gender assigned at birth.” 
The Trump administration, she says, “has restricted our existence. It’s untethered from reality, and terrifying when you think of the implications.” 
A compliant court
Another sign of eroding democracy, according to the Steady State, is the erosion of judicial independence, “not only through partisan appointments, but through strategic reliance on the Supreme Court’s ‘shadow docket,’ efforts to curtail judicial remedies and intimidate the legal profession, and selective compliance with court rulings.”
The Supreme Court’s ‘shadow docket’ consists of rulings on motions for emergency relief from lower court rulings. They are necessary, says Gill, to accommodate true emergencies, such as a stay of execution. 
“The cases getting decided are no longer emergencies, at least not in any recognizable sense,” says Gill. “The administration has essentially turned this necessary emergency provision into a back door it can use to get lower courts to back off and to violate the law for a little bit longer.”
Gill says she’s most concerned about cases such as the one involving birthright citizenship, in which the courts are “precluding states from protecting these rights.” 
In the court’s  2024/2025 session, the shadow docket “swallowed the Court, both in terms of workload and even practical importance,” says former Solicitor General Gregory G. Garre.
“Precedent allows us to keep stability and predictability in the law,” Gill notes, adding the justices have substituted their own interpretation of the Constitution, which she says is “a very disingenuous way to read something into it like presidential immunity of the scope that they provided. It just isn’t there.”
“Our emergency docket should never be used, as it has been this year, to permit what our own precedent bars,” Justice Elana Kagan wrote in a dissent in September to the president’s effort to fire federal regulators without cause. “Still more, it should not be used, as it also has been, to transfer government authority from Congress to the President, and thus to reshape the Nation’s separation of powers.”
Shadow docket rulings have enabled the deportation of migrants without due process; racial targeting by law enforcement; access to citizen’s confidential data; the elimination of $4 billion in foreign aid, which is resulting in a resurgence of terror; the rejection of transgender individuals from the military; the mass termination of federal employees; and the removal of Democrats from regulatory boards and commissions. 
“Perhaps the degradation of our rule-of-law regime would happen anyway,” Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in July. “But this Court’s complicity in the creation of a culture of disdain for lower courts, their rulings, and the law (as they interpret it) will surely hasten the downfall of our governing institutions, enabling our collective demise.”
The Supreme Court has ultimate responsibility to uphold constitutional checks and balances on Trump. Gill is skeptical about the court’s ability to hold the line, citing its presidential immunity ruling and what she calls the shadow docket’s misuse. 
Cherry says the shadow docket is not a burden on lower courts. “They’re not final decisions. They’re waiting to have sufficient briefing and argument on these issues, and I would assume that Trump’s going to win some and lose some. That’s what always happens,” he said. 
“While the orders are technically temporary, they have had broad practical effects, allowing the administration to deport tens of thousands of people, discharge transgender military service members, fire thousands of government workers and slash federal spending,” the NYT wrote in October.
Coequal branch?
The third sign that democracy is threatened is Congress’ abdication of its responsibility, resulting in a diminished capacity “to serve as a coequal branch, as delegation, obstruction, and polarization undermine effective oversight,” says the Steady State’s report.
Last week, the House and the Senate voted nearly unanimously to release investigative files on Jeffrey Epstein, after months of Republican efforts to keep the files confidential. The about-face came just days after Trump, who called the effort to release the files “a hoax.” gave Republicans permission to do so. The Epstein saga illustrates the impotence of Republican lawmakers who are beholden, out of loyalty or fear, to Trump’s edicts, some contend. 
Democrats, on the other hand, have waffled between vows to hold Trump and his acolytes accountable, and what critics call feeble efforts to appear bipartisan. 
Congress has been mostly silent as Americans drown in debt exacerbated by Trump’s tariffs, and face the loss of health insurance, thanks to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill. 
Bedrock of democracy
The fourth sign of eroding democracy, the Steady State writes, is the makeover of the electoral system by restricting voting, gerrymandering, contesting elections, and “undermining the expectation that elections will be fairly run and their outcomes accepted.”
Trump, who has long complained of rigged elections, attempted to squeeze a few more  Republican House members out of Texas by having congressional districts redrawn. The effort hit a wall last week when a judicial panel blocked the move, finding the maps were “racially gerrymandered.” 
The strategy could now backfire on Trump, as California voters gave that state their blessing to redraw districts to counter the threat posed by Texas.
In March, Trump issued an executive order requiring states to turn over their voter rolls to the Department of Justice, ostensibly in an effort to expose those registered in multiple states. 
In July, Nevada provided a version of its statewide voter registration list that is generally available to the public. In August, the Civil Rights Division again requested full access to Nevada’s complete statewide voter registration list, including sensitive personal information.
Forever obsessed with his 2020 loss, Trump’s trying to bigfoot all over Nevada’s election system

The next month, Nevada responded that it would conduct an analysis of the legal authority for the government’s request.  In September, Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar refused to share the complete voter registration list, contending the DOJ request was unjustified. 
“The DOJ has authority to ensure states have proper registration procedures and programs to ensure clean voter roles,” says Eileen O’Connor, a former attorney in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division and an expert for the Brennan Center, which is tracking states’ responses to the DOJ request. “I would say that sweeping up all of the voter rolls around the country far exceeds its authority.” 
Voter rolls, she says, provide a snapshot that is outdated before it could be of use to track down fraudulent registration.  The federal government “is attempting to play a role that it does not have and is not permitted to have, in running elections. This appears to be a concerted effort on the part of the current administration to sort of take over federal elections.”
Trump, who has floated the prospect of seeking a third term, even as he acknowledges he can’t, has made his tolerance for election interference apparent by pardoning the insurrectionists who rioted to keep him in the White House after his 2020 defeat. 
“Quiet, piggy.”
America’s greatest threat, Trump has repeatedly asserted, is “the enemy within” – non-adherents who are either Democrats, wayward Republicans, minorities, or LGBTQ+ individuals. He plans to use American cities as a training ground for the U.S. military to address the threat they pose. 
The undermining of public trust and knowledge “through attacks on the press, academia, watchdog institutions, and dissenting voices,” is the final threat identified in the Steady State’s assessment of eroding democracy.  “Together, these trends indicate a restructuring of the constitutional order around personal loyalty rather than adherence to law.”
“The strategy for authoritarianism is to get people to stop looking for the truth,” says Gill. 
“They try to obfuscate so much and tell so many different lies that often contradict each other. People give up believing in a knowable truth.” 
On the first day of his second term, Trump issued an executive order restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship. Since then, Trump has extorted law firms, universities, and media outlets for speech of which he disapproves. He has decried labels directed at him such as ‘authoritarian’ and ‘fascist’ while declaring hatred for Democrats at a rally and at a memorial service for slain podcaster Charlie Kirk.  
Trump’s tirades are often directed at journalists, who he openly maligns for asking questions. 
Earlier this month, on Air Force One, Trump cut off a Bloomberg News reporter who asked why he had not yet released the Epstein files.
“Quiet, piggy!” the president barked.
Last week, Trump berated an ABC reporter who asked about murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi during the Saudi crown prince’s visit to the Oval Office. Trump deemed her question as “insubordinate” and called ABC a “crappy company,” adding its broadcasting licenses “should be taken away” and that FCC chairman Brendan Carr, who regulates broadcasters “should look at that.” 
Carr is best known for using the language of a mob boss when he said the government could deal with late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s monologues about Trump “the easy way or the hard way.” Trump praised Carr’s threat, and said yanking the licenses of networks, who he says are “97% against me,” was up to Carr. 
“What a stupid thing for him to do,” says former Nevada Supreme Court Justice Cherry. “These are business decisions. The government should stay out of this stuff.” 
Last week, Trump called for NBC to fire Seth Meyers. 
While Trump appears to have forgotten his order to end government censorship, Attorney General Bondi was poised earlier this year to “target” Americans for hate speech. Bondi, informed that hate speech is not prohibited in America, backed off. The episode rankled the MAGAverse, as well as Democrats. 
Cherry, a seasoned jurist and a Democrat, finds merit in Bondi’s intention. 
“I’m a proponent of the First Amendment,” he said, adding that as “an American Jew, I’m worried about hate speech. It’s frightening for our kids to be bullied, and hate speech can cause bullying.”
Free speech, he says, should be protected. “But we’ve got to do something about hate speech,” including, he says, from Trump, who he says “gets carried away. It’s got to stop, period. No matter who you are. You’ve got to be kind to your enemies.”

Cracks in the foundation
By his own admission, Trump could “shoot somebody” and get away with it, or assault a woman by grabbing her genitals, because “when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything.” 
Trump, during his first term, and even more so in his second, has bathed in the warm waters of infallibility, extending the duration of his self-proclaimed dictatorship from its designated first-day to its 11th month.  
Congress and the Supreme Court, critics contend, have abandoned checks and balances in favor of furthering Trump’s agenda. But in recent weeks, chinks have appeared in the president’s armor. 
Last month, the long-silent Senate voiced disapproval of Trump’s tariffs in a series of votes. 
Trump’s use of his power to enrich himself, his family and friends is also grating on some Republicans, as is his penchant for living in luxury, even in the people’s house, where he took a wrecking ball to the East Wing to make way for an extravagant ballroom, and remodeled the Lincoln bathroom in marble and gold. 
Last week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, one of Trump’s fiercest defenders until now, apologized for “toxic” political behavior, called out Trump for falsehoods after he called her a traitor, and on Friday announced she was quitting Congress in January. “I refuse to be a battred wife,” she said, referring to Trump’s tirades. 
The break up preceded Trump’s capitulation on releasing the Epstein files. A majority of Republicans disagree with Trump’s handling of the issue, a rare instance in the MAGA world. By contrast, a majority of Republicans supported Trump’s handling of the Jan. 6 insurrection. 
Trump contends he is operating within the confines of the Constitution to carry out the will of those who elected him. Recent polls, however, indicate an increasing awareness and rejection of the president’s penchant for exceeding his authority. 
Even the Supreme Court, which empowered Trump with an unprecedented declaration of immunity, and has indulged his efforts to test the bounds of his authority, is signaling skepticism of the president’s authority to impose tariffs absent congressional approval.
Trump’s power grab could emerge as an issue in the midterms, when Gov. Joe Lombardo will be on the ballot. An Emerson College Polling survey indicates Trump’s approval rating in Nevada is 39%, and his disapproval rating is 54%,leaving the president with a net approval rating of -15. 
Lombardo announces reelection campaign, warns against a Democrat in power 

Lombardo gushed this month after receiving a second endorsement from Trump. His campaign did not respond when asked whether Nevadans’ concerns about Trump could cut into Lombardo’s votes. 
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, a Democrat who has joined attorneys general from blue states in filing 36 lawsuits against the Trump administration, is hoping to unseat Lombardo. 
Lombardo and Trump, he said in a statement “are Nevada’s biggest roadblocks to affordability. I will always put Nevada families first. That’s why I have sued both the Trump and Biden administrations and am fighting to lower costs and make Nevada more affordable.”
Washoe County Commission Chairwoman Alexis Hill, who is running in the Democratic primary against Ford, says the governor’s veto of a bill that would have allowed for open primaries is in line with Trump’s efforts to disenfranchise voters. 
“That’s 38% of the electorate,” she said. “He’s essentially saying that they can’t participate in the democracy of Nevada.” Voters rejected a similar measure last year. 
Hill says Nevadans she encounters are “worried about ensuring that we uphold democratic ideals, but are also worried about livability and affordability.” 
Trump, following Democratic election wins this month, retrieved from the back burner his own campaign promise to bring down prices. “The new word is ‘affordability,” he said during an Oval Office meeting Friday with New York Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani. Last week he hailed McDonald’s as a symbol of American affordability, and proclaimed he’s “normalized” inflation.
Trump’s end game is unknown, and may depend on the alacrity of a citizenry that is largely bleary-eyed and overwhelmed. The demise of authoritarian regimes, experts say, most often result from military defeat, economic collapse, or resistance movements that offer an alternative and capitalize on unrest.
Americans are beginning to notice the erosion of democracy as it “starts to impact their everyday lives in ways that they can’t rationalize, particularly when they cannot assign the blame anywhere else,” says Gill.  “Masked federal agents are kidnapping folks off the street. Citizenship doesn’t matter. We’re handing people over to terrorist prison camps in other countries with no due process. A lot of people have woken up to this.”
Turning that awakening into a movement could be challenging, she says.
Trump’s team “has done its homework” and studied similar transitions, like those involving Russian dictator Vladimir Putin and Hungary’s Viktor Orban. “They have started to gobble up alternative and mainstream media. They’ve essentially gone to war against any source of truth.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/trump2028-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697

The surprise for a modern reader (in Sophus Helle’s translation) is that Gilgamesh is clearly a tyrant and sexual abuser, even by the standards of the third millennium B.C.
Like the best poetry, you can find different meanings in the verses. You have a powerful man reaching his limits. And a thug getting his comeuppance. But either way, Gilgamesh learns there are boundaries not even the most ruthless can cross.

I also knew the arc of Beowulf. Monster eats Danes; Superstrong Dane meets Monster; Monster loses arm, etc. But I didn’t expect the poem to be so somber.
Beowulf flexes his might against beasts and dragons, but in front of a backdrop of loss and decay. The work ends not in triumph, but with a funeral, and Beowulf’s people mourning his death.  It’s an unsettling ending. Monsters are inevitable. Heroes are not.
But maybe subconsciously I’ve been drawn to these stories of powerful people encountering restraints. Just look around. Neither the law nor common decency seem to be holding our elites back these days.
Nor can I shake a sense of decline. Last year, I wondered where we would be on Thanksgiving 2025, as a new administration committed to attacking immigrants, gutting health care and undermining democracy took shape.
So, with the holiday near, let’s take stock of Alabama.
Our leaders and institutions, like many around the country, have all but knuckled under. No one should ever expect courage from this state’s congressional delegation. But the Republican members’ grovelling to this administration stands out.
It would be bad enough if all we had were their smiles at the terror unleashed on immigrants. But they’ve also kept their peace — and sometimes cheered — as Trump has pursued a trade policy ruinous to Alabama farms and businesses.
Gov. Kay Ivey has supported Trump’s efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, which feeds thousands of Alabama school children every day. The entire GOP leadership seems indifferent to the soaring price of health insurance, which leaves hundreds of thousands of Alabamians at risk of losing it entirely.
Our two flagship universities have been notably craven. The University of Alabama sat on its hands this spring as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents kidnapped Alireza Douroudi, a graduate student from Iran studying engineering, and left him to suffer in a Louisiana prison.
Auburn University fired multiple employees this September for alleged insensitivity to the killing of far-right activist Charlie Kirk. This concern for civility did not prevent Auburn from welcoming far-right U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville to campus, a man who has called city dwellers “rats” and immigrants “garbage,” and also claimed that Black Americans “do the crime.”
All this weakness would be enough to make one despair.
But then we see the courage of individual Alabamians.
Families of immigrants fight for their loved ones, often at great personal risk, against a system that does nothing but create suffering.
Librarians continue to battle for our right to read books in the face of official fearmongering and censorship.
And there are Alabamians who come out for their values. Whether they’re crowding a room to stick up for public broadcasting or gathering by the thousands in the name of democracy.
It reminds me of another poem I’ve read recently, by the early 19th century Irish bard Antaine Raiftearai. It’s not about immortality or dragons. It’s a long outburst of glee at Raiftearai’s preferred candidate winning a local election. In the middle of dunking on the vanquished, the poet wrote:
Is aimsir an chruatain gur sheas na fíréin. Roughly, “in the time of struggle stood the righteous.”
We will not emerge from this season of hardship because a hero came over the sea to beat someone up. The battles we face are in thousands of ordinary places, over values we once thought moot.
We will save what is good about America when thousands of people will draw lines against authoritarianism in their daily lives and refuse to budge. Democracy and the rule of law will prevail if Alabamians — as they have in the past — stand against those who would destroy both.
So I’m grateful to those who rise to fight, in battles big and small. They alone won’t bring the abuses or the suffering to an immediate halt. But they will put us on a path away from it, toward something better. Something more reflective of who we are.
The fight for democracy is the epic of our time. We see the monsters. And in the people standing for our ideals, we find the heroes.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ALR_NoKings_BHM_101825-34-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-11-24 08:56:35.517697
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-11-24 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What to know about CT laws relating to ICE interactions,Christina Lee,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/11/24/ct-ice-laws/,CT recently made changes to the laws governing how local and state officials interact with ICE and limiting what ICE can do in the state.,"The Connecticut legislature recently made changes to the laws governing how local and state officials interact with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and limiting what ICE agents can do in the state. The revisions to state law were made in response to residents’ concerns about federal immigration policy. Divided along party lines, state Democrats have worked to address immigrants’ assertions that they are living in fear.
Here’s what you need to know about what ICE can do in Connecticut. 
What changes were made in the latest state legislation?
In November’s special session, state lawmakers passed House Bill 8004 which included sections that limit ICE from making arrests at courthouses. The bill prohibits representatives of a local, state or federal law enforcement authority from arresting people inside state courthouses without a judicial warrant. ICE agents are also not allowed to wear masks on courthouse grounds without a medical requirement. 
There are also measures to protect immigrants’ personal information. State agencies are not allowed to share personal information such as dates and times of court hearings and appointments, home addresses, and workplaces. 
Gov. Ned Lamont signed the bill into law shortly after the special session.
Can Connecticut law enforcement turn immigrants over to ICE?
In 2019, Connecticut lawmakers passed the Trust Act, which specified the grounds on which local and state officials are allowed to turn over unauthorized migrants to ICE. The Act prohibits state law enforcement from arresting individuals solely on the basis of detainers — requests from ICE to hold someone for up to 48 hours so agents can then pick them up. 
Law enforcement officers may comply with detainers only if ICE has a judicial warrant to make an arrest, or if the individual in their custody has been convicted of a class A or B felony, or identified on a terrorist watch list. Class A or B felonies include murder, kidnapping, sexual assault, robbery, and first-degree manslaughter. 
The Trust Act was modified in May of this year. Now, individuals can sue cities and towns if the Act is violated. Further, the circumstances under which law enforcement must comply with ICE requests for detainment were expanded to include 13 more crimes and broaden who is considered a law enforcement official. 
What happens when ICE makes an arrest?
While the recent laws intended to make courthouses safer for immigrants in Connecticut, ICE agents can still make arrests in other public areas without a warrant if they have a reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual they are targeting is an unauthorized migrant, as per the Immigration and Nationality Act.
Further, aside from courthouse grounds, there are no laws requiring ICE agents to show their face, or prohibiting masks. This means that ICE agents may still approach an individual in a mask and make an arrest, without a warrant.
How does the state recommend state agencies respond to ICE visits?
In a document from Lamont’s office issued in January, the state provides guidance on how state agencies should handle visits from ICE to comply with state and federal laws while also protecting individuals’ privacy rights. 
The guide instructs state officials to request information on why the ICE agent is making a visit, notify legal counsel, and refrain from sharing any personal information or documents such as immigration status until a legal counsel reviews the request. 
ICE also has limited access to non-public areas. They are prohibited from accessing non-public areas of a state agency building without a judicial warrant. But there is no legislation to limit their movements in public premises of an establishment. For example, an ICE agent could make an unwarranted arrest on a sidewalk outside of the state facility.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AP-ice-arrest.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)The battle for retiring U.S. Sen. Gary Peters’s seat in the upper chamber of Congress is gearing up to include at least one potentially messy primary on the Democratic Party side and a potentially bruising fight on the GOP side if a new challenge to the party’s frontrunner causes intra-party friction.
Peters announced in January that he wouldn’t be running for a sixth term in the U.S. Senate, setting up an open seat and race that has invited big money and national attention. Republicans will be fighting tooth and nail to maintain their majority in 2026, and see Michigan as a big opportunity to either hold or expand their grasp on the chamber.
The race is currently rated as a toss-up.
Meanwhile, Democrats, coming off a big sweep of wins this November, are seeing the political tide rising against the administration of President Donald Trump and his most controversial policies affecting immigration, the wars in Israel and Ukraine, proposed new conflicts in Latin America and a failing economy. Holding on to Peters’ seat could be a key piece to standing the party’s ground and potentially taking back control of the upper chamber.
Here’s Michigan Advance’s breakdown of the race thus far, the support each candidate has received and current fundraising totals.
The Democrats
For the Democrats eyeing that prize, a hotly contested primary is on the horizon. In the race are U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak, Abdul El-Sayed, former director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, and research health specialist Rachel Howard.
Stevens has positioned herself as the frontrunner and much of the party’s political machine is supporting her bid for the Senate. But El-Sayed and McMorrow are both on her tail in terms of fundraising. Howard hasn’t gotten the same amount of attention, but could make some waves if she is able to stay in the race down the stretch.

Haley Stevens 
Stevens is the establishment party fixture in the race, and has routinely been noted as one of the most effective Democrats in Washington, D.C. Several top news sources, including Politico, Semafor and Axios, have all noted that she is being privately backed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and other top Democrats. That support has not been made public, however, as leadership and the party machine typically holds off boosting its candidates until after the primary.

Stevens has also received large sums of money through the years from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, and it’s likely that the group will spend on her behalf against her opponents. Stevens is one of the stronger pro-Israel Democrats in the U.S. House and now has the backing of the Democratic Majority for Israel PAC, or DMFI.
Stevens also has a long list of supporters, from former governors, her colleagues in Michigan; U.S. Reps. Hillary Scholten and Shri Thanedar, several sitting state representatives, the Michigan Black Caucus, UNITE HERE Local 24, UA Local 636 and the Teamsters Local 243.
Campaign finance disclosures in the Federal Election Committee database in the latest October quarterly report shows Stevens is leading the pack with $4.72 million raised, $2.1 million spent and $2.61 million cash on hand.

Mallory McMorrow 
McMorrow made a name for herself standing up to Republicans who have gone after Michigan’s LGBTQ+ community, namely state Sen. Lana Theis of Brighton, who evoked  anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in a 2022 invocation, which led to a Democratic walkout and criticism of Theis on social media. Theis accused McMorrow and other Democrats of “grooming” for their support for teaching kids about LGBTQ+ issues. 
Theis specifically named McMorrow in a fundraising email, to which McMorrow punched back in a scathing Michigan Senate floor speech. That raised McMorrow’s national profile, and she appeared as a speaker at the Democratic National Convention in 2024.
That helped McMorrow launch her U.S. Senate bid this year, where she has become one of the key alternatives to Stevens for Michigan Democrats seeking to support a less establishment candidate. McMorrow’s support has come from a long list of Michigan state representatives and senators, local officials, UA Local 370, Nurses for America and The Next 50, which supports young Democratic leaders in the making.
Campaign finance disclosures in the Federal Election Committee database in the latest October quarterly report shows McMorrow just behind Stevens with $3.85 million raised, $2.4 million spent and $1.45 million cash on hand.

Abdul El-Sayed 
El-Sayed is the stalwart progressive candidate in the race, a student of the game set in play by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, who regularly champions Medicare for All (of note, El-Sayed wrote a book on the policy). As the son of an Egyptian immigrant, he was also one of the earliest candidates in the race to call the actions of the Israeli government in its war against Hamas and the Palestinian people a genocide, which set him apart from his opponents before McMorrow also landed on the position.
The candidate previously ran for governor in Michigan in 2018, but ultimately lost in the primary to current term-limited Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Following that race, El-Sayed became the director of the Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services, focusing on the wellness of Detroit and its surrounding metropolitan areas.
El-Sayed has the support of Sanders, U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit, former Michigan congressman Andy Levin, party fixtures like Keith Ellison, the attorney general of Minnesota, progressive-minded sitting and former state legislators, and some local officials across the state. He’s also garnered the support from a swath of younger voters and key Michigan Democratic Party groups, like its grassroots caucus, the LGBT&A caucus and its progressive caucus.

Campaign finance disclosures in the Federal Election Committee database in the latest October quarterly report show El-Sayed with $3.57 million raised, $1.72 million spent and $1.84 million cash on hand.
Rachel Howard
Howard, who hails herself as a non-politican, is a combat veteran with the Michigan National Guard who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and a clinical researcher at Henry Ford Health. There has been no significant polling showing Howard in matchups against the others in the primary. She has raised $10,937 thus far, spent $6,171 and has $4,766 cash on hand.
Her policy positions appear to be that of a more moderate choice, like Stevens, in the race. She supports both Israel and Palestine in the conflict but said that while she backs peaceful coexistence, she does not support the Israeli government’s actions that have harmed civilians. She believes Ukraine has a right to its sovereignty. 
She believes abortion decisions should be between a patient and their doctor, but also has said reducing the need for abortions by addressing root causes was necessary. She also strongly supports the Second Amendment but would fight gun violence through safe storage laws, background checks, violence prevention and training. She supports a single payer healthcare system, much like McMorrow.
Howard has also called for banning corporate donations and keeping big money out of politics. 
The Republicans
Republicans in the state party and on the national scene have by and large thrown their weight behind former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers of White Lake, who has been endorsed by Trump, has money of his own to invest and is seeing the donor class rally around him. 
But his apparent coronation before primary season really begins could face some speed bumps. 
His biggest potential rival, if she can make the ballot and pull away grassroots voters, is former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Bernadette Smith, who resigned from the party earlier this month and officially launched her candidacy on Thursday. It is unlikely that Smith can pull away Trump World from Rogers, but if he seems vulnerable, things could change. Aside from Smith, dentist Kent Benham and activist Geneieve Scott are also eyeing to take down Rogers in the primary, but their chances are slim.

Mike Rogers 
Rogers is a well-known and battle-ready commodity in Michigan Republican politics. From 2001 to 2015, he represented his mid-Michigan district for seven terms, including ascending to the powerful chair of the House Intelligence Committee. In 2024, he sought to replace former U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Lansing when she decided to retire after a 24-year career in the upper chamber.
Rogers received strong support from Republicans in the 2024 primary with 60% of the vote and Trump’s endorsement, but he ultimately lost to current U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Holly in the general election. A year after his defeat, Rogers is back to try and claim a Senate seat and balance the scales after the Democrats have held both Senate seats since 2001.
Rogers strongly supports Israel, abortion policies left up to states and not federal mandate or law, and Trump’s tariff and immigration policies. He opposed key LGBTQ+ rights issues including allowing transgender girls to play in girl’s sports. He has the backing of key U.S. Senate Republican leaders like Majority Leader John Thune, several sitting state lawmakers, local officials, Americans for Prosperity and Associated Builders and Contractors.
Rogers and Slotkin slug it out on Social Security, guns, EVs and abortion in final debate 

Rogers has raised $3.41 million thus far, spent just $966,939 and has a whopping $2.7 million cash on hand.
Bernadette Smith 
Smith’s candidacy comes late to the race, and some have questioned whether she has the infrastructure, money or ability to make the ballot in order to be a player in the primary against Rogers. But with some within the party questioning whether Rogers could win against someone like McMorrow or Stevens, Smith could see an opportunity to make his race to the top a bit more difficult.
Since her campaign was launched Thursday, there is no polling that includes her and she has not had to submit any financial disclosures. She will, soon, however, and that could give Republican voters a better look at who is backing her and if she came to play.
Smith is a tried and true devotee to Trump and has links to Turning Point USA. She spoke at the party’s Capitol-lawn rally for the slain Charlie Kirk following his assassination in September.

Kent Benham 
A view into Benham’s policy positions background other than his dental practice are hard to come by. He does not have a campaign website; his only presence is a personal Facebook page that features his practice.
The FEC does not have any campaign finance data listed for him in its system.
Genevieve Scott 
Scott is a Republican activist who was prominent in the “Stop the Steal” movement furthering the 2020 election conspiracy that claimed, without evidence, that Trump won despite former President Joe Biden’s clear victory.
She also reportedly attended the rallies that led up to the January 6, 2021 riot and insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol building. Scott urged people to enter the Capitol, Michigan Public reported, but there was no evidence that she actually entered the Capitol during the chaotic event.
She has adopted a Trump-inspired “America First” policy platform, with a focus on promoting American excellence in schools, election integrity and has a “waste, fraud and abuse” mantra that runs like a current through the modern Republican Party in the era of Trump.
Scott has raised $35,544, spent nearly all of that to the tune of $30,636 and has $4,908, a massive burn rate for a candidate with limited funds.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolatnight-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey lawmakers are behind a push to ban federal and local law enforcement from wearing masks on the job, a move Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill has said she supports.
Sen. Benjie Wimberly (D-Passaic) said that as the number of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids has escalated in the last 10 months, he’s concerned both about the fear masked agents have instilled in communities with undocumented residents and the danger of criminals using masks to impersonate ICE agents.
“I’m sure somebody is working on a scheme right now about how they can rob some place, posed as ICE agents,” said Wimberly. “It’s very scary times.”

Since President Donald Trump took office and executed his campaign promise of mass detention and deportation, some immigration agents have shown up at schools, businesses, and courts with their faces covered and wearing no identification. It’s a tactic lawmakers said they haven’t seen under previous administrations.
Wimberly’s bill, introduced earlier this month, would bar any law enforcement officer who is interacting with the public from wearing a mask or disguise. Officers who are working undercover, wearing a shield that does not conceal their face, or wearing a medical mask would not be subject to the bill.
Officers who violate the provisions would face fines of $500 to $1,000, prison for up to six months, or both.
Sherrill, a Democrat, said during her campaign for the state’s top job this year that she supports banning police from wearing masks and requiring that they identify themselves during enforcement operations. A Sherrill spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on the bill.
She’s told stories of ICE agents looking like they’re “dressed for Afghanistan” who refuse to identify themselves, calling it “unacceptable.”
“We need to know who is on our streets here in New Jersey,” she said at a campaign stop in Newark last month.
California passed a bill in September that bars law enforcement officers from wearing most masks while carrying out their duties. The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the law last week, calling it an unconstitutional attempt to regulate federal agents.
Lawmakers in several other states, including Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, have introduced similar legislation.
The Trump administration has defended ICE agents for masking, claiming agents who show their faces during enforcement operations are harassed and doxed online. A U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment on ICE’s mask policy, though a spokeswoman has previously said it would “not abide by a state’s unconstitutional ban.”
Assemblywoman Verlina Reynolds-Jackson (D-Mercer), prime sponsor of the bill in the lower chamber, said the measure protects law enforcement officers by “honoring the person behind the uniform and the badge.”
“We want people to trust police officers. Police officers are supposed to be trusted people in the community,” she said. “You can’t do that if others are coming in under the cloak of protection and they’re really just undermining people’s basic human rights.”
While the bill would also prevent state, county, and local law enforcement from obstructing their faces while interacting with the public, lawmakers agree they’re more focused on getting ICE agents to stop masking.
Ron Chen, a professor of law and former dean of Rutgers Law School, told the New Jersey Monitor last month that a state law banning ICE agents from wearing masks would likely be struck down by courts because states are barred from regulating the federal government.
Wimberly conceded that a court challenge against the measure would be likely if it is signed into law.
“My hope is that, for where we’re at in America, I think we can create a template that should go across every state in America,” Wimberly said.

Every new classroom that opens needs a qualified early childhood educator to lead it.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Heather Duhamel and Kaitlin Northey: Vermont must protect and strengthen the programs that prepare early childhood educators.","This commentary is by Heather Duhamel and Kaitlin Northey. Duhamel is assistant professor and program director for early childhood education online at Vermont State University and higher education outreach coordinator for the Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children. Northey is associate professor of early childhood education at the University of Vermont.


The future of Vermont’s child care system depends on access to early childhood teacher education programs, clear and connected preparation pathways, and support for higher ed students to complete them.
Vermont’s child care future depends on the strength of its early childhood education workforce. We’ve made historic gains in expanding access for families, but the system still needs more well-prepared early childhood educators to give our youngest children the best possible start. 
Building a strong child care workforce starts with educating the early childhood educators. Long before caring for your child, your family’s trusted early childhood educator was training to teach young children.
Across Vermont, future educators begin their journeys in high schools, career and technical education programs, apprenticeships, community colleges, certificate programs and universities. This variety is a strength, reflecting the many ways people enter higher ed: as students, parents, mid-career changers and lifelong learners.
And these programs are popular — more high school students are taking ECE courses for college credit, and early childhood education courses are among the highest enrolled at Community College of Vermont.
In our work as teacher educators, we see every day how much these programs strengthen our workforce, and why it’s important to stabilize them in uncertain times. We also see where students stop their studies, and how we can help them continue.
The Vermont Association for the Education of Young Children recently released the first higher ed landscape study since 2017. The report, Higher Ed Pathways, Challenges, and Opportunities for Vermont’s Early Childhood Education Workforce, was researched and written by Heather. 
Her research finds that students need to see connections between today’s coursework, tomorrow’s credential, and how continuing their studies impacts their compensation and career.
There are many ways for early childhood educators to enter higher ed, but many stop credit-bearing coursework after two courses, or six credits. This pattern extends beyond early childhood education, yet because our intro classes are so popular, we have specific opportunities to retain students.
And this is important because Vermont needs more well-prepared early childhood educators. As a state, we’ve invested in helping families afford child care and expanding program access. But every new classroom that opens needs a qualified early childhood educator to lead it.
Institutions are adapting. Flexible scheduling, credit for prior learning and clearer advising tools all help ECEs continue their own education — especially the many who do coursework while working full-time. State investments in scholarships, apprenticeship programs and student loan repayment assistance for early childhood educators are crucial supports.
Yet bachelor’s and graduate-level programs remain fragile. Over the past 10 years, Vermont has lost several early childhood preparation programs, and faculty across the state told us that higher ed institutions are now making changes or reductions to programs in an effort to navigate federal funding uncertainties. 
Federal policy adds urgency. The 2025 national budget reconciliation bill introduced restrictions on federal student loan access for “low-earning” majors. Without action, many students could lose the very loans that make their education possible, jeopardizing both higher education programs and Vermont’s child care workforce.
This threat compounds the ongoing challenge of compensation: historically, early childhood educators earn low wages, while the cost of care for very young children remains high. Without public investment, families shoulder tuition costs and educators endure low wages. Vermont is leading the nation in changing this, but educator compensation is still catching up.
Vermont doesn’t have to accept this outcome.
Federal law uses state‑specific earnings thresholds to define “low-earning,” which means that ensuring early childhood educators are paid according to their qualifications — as in other professions — can protect students’ access to federal loans. This approach strengthens higher ed programs and pathways, attracts new students, and makes early childhood education a viable career choice. Ultimately, it supports stronger child care programs and better outcomes for children and families. 
Here’s what we recommend:

Stabilize early childhood education preparation programs at every level, from high school to graduate school, through consistent funding and policy support.
Make transfer agreements and pathway maps visible and easy to use for students, advisors and faculty.
Strengthen coordination between higher ed, workforce and licensing systems so programs and professional standards align.
Link compensation and advancement to preparation and credentials, so education in this field has tangible value.

These are not abstract policy goals; they’re the foundation of the workforce our child care system depends on. 
We’ve seen firsthand that progress happens when Vermont’s educators, higher ed partners and policymakers work together. Advocacy and partnership have already reshaped child care in Vermont. Now we must sustain that momentum by protecting the programs that support early childhood education careers.
We’ve worked hard to build higher ed systems that welcome aspiring and advancing early childhood educators wherever they are in their coursework and career. These systems show real promise. With the right support, they can grow and retain the child care workforce Vermont depends on.

McDonald,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/11/24/the-push-to-punish-a-nj-school-board-member-for-facebook-posts-is-foolish/,A Salem County school board member is the target of an ethics complaint for asking her Facebook followers about tax hikes.,"A Salem County school board member is the target of an ethics complaint for asking her Facebook followers about tax hikes. (Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)Why are New Jerseyans barred from hearing from some of their elected leaders about matters of public concern?
That’s the question at the heart of a new lawsuit filed by a school board member out of Alloway in Salem County who is facing ethics charges because she asked constituents on Facebook what they thought of a potential school tax hike.
“As a resident of Alloway, I am wondering what other residents think about a 9-15% school tax increase?” reads one post from the school board member, Gail Nazarene.
“My personal opinion is 3.3% is the max I can afford,” reads part of another.
Pretty milquetoast, if you ask me, especially if you consider the tons of AI slop and nasty political rants you can find on Facebook at any given moment. But they were enough to trigger an ethics investigation, with one of Nazarene’s colleagues filing a complaint with the state School Ethics Commission that says Nazarene’s posts violate the state School Ethics Act. The complaint, from Alloway school board member Sara Cobb, says Nazarene’s Facebook posts reference potential tax hikes that “were not formally reviewed, adopted, or confirmed by the Board.”
“The publication of these figures created confusion and concern among members of the public, and conveyed the impression that Ms. Nazarene was speaking on behalf of the Board without authorization,” it reads.
Cobb also took issue with another Facebook post where Nazarene asked, “I am ASKING this FOR MYSELF NOT the board. What if taxes went up 20% is that a number you will except (sic)?” Cobb wrote that this and other posts “appear to use the prestige of her Board membership to promote a specific budgetary narrative, potentially undermining official communications from the Board or administration.”
You know that old canard “you can’t shout fire in a crowded theater”? Apparently, New Jersey’s version is you can’t potentially undermine the Alloway school district’s communications department.
There’s no state law that explicitly bars school board members from speaking to the public, of course. But the School Ethics Commission has interpreted the School Ethics Act in a way that school board members risk violating it if they discuss any school matters with members of the public, even if they offer disclaimers that they are speaking for themselves as private citizens and even if the issue in question has yet to come before their school board but could at some point in the future. Even posting a link to public information — with no additional commentary — would not immunize a school board member from an ethics investigation, the commission says.
Indeed, the commission has reprimanded school board members for things like writing opinion pieces endorsing other school board candidates or posting on Facebook about school overcrowding. 
Nazarene’s lawyer, Daniel Zahn, said the state’s interpretation of the School Ethics Act plainly violates the First Amendment. Zahn sounded mystified that state bureaucrats would want to limit the type of communication elected officials have with their constituents.
“It seems that for democracy to thrive we should be encouraging posts such as these that are engaging with constituents, asking them questions, respecting different viewpoints, and for the state to threaten sanctions for this type of respectful, powerful communication between elected officials and their constituents not only damages the First Amendment and free speech values, but also damages democracy and broader American values,” Zahn told me.
Anthony “Skip” Cimino has some thoughts on this. Camino represented the 14th Legislative District in the Assembly from 1988 to 1992, and he sponsored the School Ethics Act. Cimino told me he thinks the commission has interpreted the law incorrectly in Nazarene’s case.
“The act was really geared toward dealing with conflicts of interest and, quite frankly, people of ill repute doing things inappropriately,” he said.
Nazarene is an elected official who should have the right to talk to her constituents about school matters without violating the School Ethics Act, he added.
I am not opposed to strong ethics laws. But this is New Jersey. Not too long ago we had a sitting U.S. senator issue a public threat to anyone who dared challenge him at the ballot box. Last year, a state senator told an obvious lie to drum up support for a bill to gut our public records law. The members of our Legislature voted to give themselves gigantic pay raises with almost zero public input or debate. Yet there’s a very real chance a school board member will get an official reprimand from the state for asking people on Facebook what they think about tax increases. This is asinine.

There are two sizes available with no minimum bid — the decommissioned 144-car Hyak and the 87-car Klahowya.
But before you get carried away with dreams of a palatial waterfront fixer-upper, or opening a floating restaurant, or making a quick buck off the scrap metal, be aware of the scrutiny you stand to receive.
“It’s more challenging than most people would have guessed,” said John Vezina, the deputy head of the state ferry system. “We’re not going to sign off on anything that isn’t ironclad that it can work.”
The Hyak and Klahowya have been sitting on the market unsold for more than a year since the state terminated a prior sales contract with an Ecuadorian middleman in summer 2024. 
Businessman Nelson Armas paid $200,000 with the intention of towing his purchases to Ecuador for scrapping. The deal went awry when the hired tugboat could not safely connect to two ferries, among other mishaps. The South American tugboat crew ended up deported.
“It’s incredibly difficult to sell decommissioned vessels,” Vezina said in an interview.
Steps to complete a purchase, he explained, include getting a Coast Guard-approved plan for towing and a Department of Ecology sign-off.
“There is a lot of superficial initial buyer interest,” Vezina said. “Most inquiries don’t go too far.”
Washington State Ferries retired the Hyak and Klahowya after it became too costly to keep them running. The Klahowya is an Evergreen State-class vessel built in 1958. The Hyak was one of four Super-class ferries built in San Diego. It was launched in 1966.
Vezina said maintenance workers have stripped key parts for re-use on other ferries. That makes it more difficult and expensive for any buyer to recertify the two ships for service. The vessels for sale no longer have their navigation gear, radars, radios or lifeboats. Even the Hyak’s horn was removed and reinstalled in Climate Pledge Arena as the goal horn for Seattle Kraken hockey games.

The state ferry system is relying on word of mouth to sell these two retired ferries, unlike in years past when it held public auctions. There is no webpage with details as of yet. Serious shoppers can request marine survey reports. Those 2025 inspections described the two ferries as structurally sound, but in fair to poor overall condition.
Vezina said the agency would like the pair of vessels gone as soon as a suitable buyer can be found. The ferries are taking up valuable space in the ferry system’s Eagle Harbor shipyard. 
Armas and the Ecuadorian steel company are still circling for a second chance to buy the aged boats (or get a refund, in Armas’ case), Vezina said. Washington State Ferries appeared reluctant to do business with them again. 
 Plan B
Leadership at Washington State Ferries has started to contemplate what to do if no viable buyer emerges. 
“If we can’t find anybody to take them off our hands,” said Steve Nevy, head of the state ferry system, “Plan B is to try to look at recycling facilities.”
The trouble with plan B is that there is no established shipbreaking facility nearby for large vessels like this. Additionally, WSF has no money in its budget currently to pay for disposal. The costs of towing, drydock time, labor and hazardous materials handling at a reputable shipbreaking yard likely far exceed the profit to be gained from the scrap metal.
BC Ferries has a similar problem and politicians from Vancouver Island are offering a possible solution. They are proposing that the provincial and federal governments pony up to expand and equip a private shipyard — or shipyards — in Port Alberni to handle large ship deconstruction. Mid-Vancouver Island Member of Parliament Gord Johns said up to 14 British Columbia ferries could be destined for recycling when their replacements enter service over the next decade.
“The 14 vessels that are at end of life will require recycling at a cost of between $10 [million] and $12 million each,” Johns told Nanaimo News Now. “In the case of the Queen of Burnaby [ferry] they’re spending just half of that cost just to tow it through the Panama Canal and up to Halifax where it can be recycled because we don’t have facilities here.”
The potential establishment of the Port Alberni shipbreaking facility to keep the money and jobs close to home comes with a long timeline. Federal and provincial subsidies are needed, and indigenous First Nations must be consulted. It’s unlikely to open in time to recycle the Hyak or Klahowya. But a British Columbia yard could figure into the disposal plans for Washington ferries that retire in the 2030s after the state takes delivery of new hybrid-electric vessels.
Cautionary tales
Anyone who buys a retired ferry in the Pacific Northwest will likely be dogged by the mixed record of successful repurposings, unrealized dreams and past purchasers’ fiascos, agreed Steve Pickens, curator of the ferry history website EvergreenFleet.com.
Sooner or later, the conversation returns to the most famous former Washington state ferry, the streamlined art deco Kalakala, aka “the Silver Slug.” In 1998, the historic ferry was rescued by a preservationist from its second life as a seafood cannery in Alaska. But a series of subsequent owners lacked the wherewithal to restore the Kalakala, leading to many public disputes, further decay and eventual scrapping in 2015.

“Darn that Kalakala,” said Bart Lematta, the third owner of the retired state ferry Evergreen State, during a spicy public discussion with the Port of Bellingham commissioners. Lematta’s ferry is now moored in Bellingham, awaiting conversion to battery-electric propulsion.
The port commissioners displayed mild irritation this past year with Lematta’s slow pace of progress to put the old ferry to a productive use on their waterfront. The 310-foot Evergreen State is a sister ship of the Klahowya that is now for sale. 
Lematta provided perspective on the cost of ownership of a retired ferry. He said moorage at the port pier cost him $72,000 per year and the price of vessel insurance through Lloyds of London was $139,000 annually.
A twin of the Hyak, the bigger ferry also now for sale, recently found a good home at an Everett shipyard. Everett Ship Repair purchased the retired ferry Elwha for $100,000 and converted it into a floating office and storage complex.
Other successful ferry re-use examples include the Hiyu and the Skansonia, which are now party and event venues moored on opposite sides of Seattle’s Lake Union.
The worst case is to see an old ferryboat left to decay on a beach. That’s happened multiple times on Puget Sound and in Alaska.

One ex-captain from Steilacoom even managed to abandon two ferries consecutively in Pierce County, one acquired from Virginia and the other a second-hand purchase of the former state ferry Olympic. Neither of those has budged to this day.
“We don’t want these boats abandoned on Washington beaches,” said the state ferry system’s Vezina, having the Pierce County outcome in mind. “Absolutely.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Klahowya-and-Hyak-ferries-1024x722.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

The traveling, the cooking, the shopping, and, of course, the airing of grievances. You — the lucky few — will have the opportunity to share with your loved ones what you’re thankful for this year and what you’re looking forward to in the year to come. It’s Festivus for the rest of us. 
Let’s make it the best one we’ve ever had! When the conversation turns to politics, you could take up where you left off last year.  When exactly did the country start going to hell, and which generation is to blame? It’s a classic, and there’s tradition to it. But of all the Charlie Browns in the world, it’s the Charlie Browniest. 
Instead, try something more productive. Maybe something fun and completely natural, like the merits of competing criminal justice policies. As you pass around the pumpkin pie, you could ask, “Grandpa, do you think it’s possible to reconcile our urge to punish with our limited resources and our constitutional duty to rehabilitate?”  
To get you started, here’s a rundown of criminal justice topics likely to grab attention at the General Assembly in 2026.
New crimes, enhanced penalties
Like Clark Griswold’s jelly-of-the-month membership, this is the gift that keeps on giving. Every year, new crimes and enhanced penalties are proposed. In the last three sessions alone, more than 30 changes to the Indiana Code have expanded the reach of the criminal justice system. Just as surely as the Hoosiers will keep the Oaken Bucket, there will be proposals to add more pages to the law books.
This overcriminalization is untenable. Changing times may require changes in the law. But steady expansion of the criminal code is, as Justices Kagan, Scalia, and Thomas put it, a “pathology.” With a 36% recidivism rate, incarceration isn’t particularly rehabilitative. And with roughly 3,000 ways to commit a crime, we’ve set plenty of traps and given the prosecution tremendous leverage. It all leads to more pressure to plead guilty and longer sentences.
And it’s unsustainable. Prison populations are growing, and capacity is hovering around 95%. Even when the new billion-dollar facility opens, the DOC plans to keep the 19th-century Indiana State Prison open indefinitely. New crimes and enhanced penalties are partially to blame.  
Preventive Detention
Pretrial release legislation is also a lock in 2026. From the White House to the local courthouse, some think we are presuming too much innocence.  
We will see the return of a proposed constitutional amendment to eliminate the right to bail for those who pose a “substantial risk.”  The term is loosely defined, with few guidelines and no due-process protections for those labeled too risky to enjoy their liberty.    
Fortunately, a broad coalition agrees that due process is not optional. So, alongside the amendment, we should see implementing legislation. If done correctly, this trailer bill could significantly improve the system.  
In a world with preventive detention and risk-based assessments, we can promote both safety and fairness without relying on an antiquated bail system. The dangerous can be detained, and the harmless can be released on their own recognizance. In between are conditions like house arrest, electronic monitoring, and frequent reporting, none of which speak to wealth or poverty.    
If this sounds like “bail reform” or “cashless bail” and makes you uncomfortable, try calling it “less cash bail.” Either way, preventive detention and reform are not mutually exclusive.                      
The Death Penalty
We are at a genuine crossroads with respect to capital punishment. A bipartisan group of legislators wants to abolish it. Some want to enlist firing squads. Others are somewhere in the middle. Legislation from these camps will likely surface in 2026.  
The death penalty is fundamentally flawed. It is impossible to apply uniformly across the state. Counties can’t afford it, and trading the executioner’s expensive syringe for a cheap bullet won’t solve the problem. It adds to the moral quandary and won’t meaningfully reduce costs. Most tax dollars are rightly spent on ensuring the trial is fair and the penalty appropriate.
Then there is the unacceptably high error rate. Beyond wrongful convictions, it is unclear whether we consistently apply medically informed standards when assessing the intellectual functioning of capital defendants.  
Suffice it to say, the conversation should continue — ideally without callous sloganeering.         
Mental Health
Of all the topics here, this might be the most suitable for your holiday gatherings. As Scrooge’s nephew put it, this is the time of year to think of people “as if they really were fellow passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.”  
Yet our jails and prisons remain the mental-health providers of last resort. State hospitals are filled with defendants receiving competency-restoration services, many of whom are charged with minor misdemeanors. And law enforcement officers are still being thrust into situations even trained medical professionals would fear to tread.        
The General Assembly has taken this seriously in recent years. Mental health advocates and providers will come calling again.  Hopefully, we can find the political will to invest in treatment and housing, rather than punishment and detention.    
I hope you get your shopping done early, soak up the sights and sounds of the season, and enjoy your time with your family and friends. At least you can’t deny that you’re prepared for the annual political dustup. It’s up to you to get ready for the feats of strength.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/prisoner-behind-bars-handcuffs-jail-prison-getty-e1673729426865-1.jpg,,,2025-11-24 07:58:23.423919

(Photo courtesy Freije & Freije Auctioneers)A year after his prison sentence, former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel’s belongings have sold for millions toward the $3.1 million in criminal restitution he owes.
The funds — now sitting in court-controlled escrow accounts — have come from sweeping liquidations of Noel’s properties, classic cars, firearms and various luxury items.
But civil judgements against Noel are rolling in, too. In October, he was ordered to pay back more than $900,000 — plus interest — to reimburse the county jail’s commissary fund. Another $122,000 was awarded earlier this month to resolve Noel’s mismanagement of his brothers estate. Numerous other civil cases are still pending and could result in other restitution mandates.
Noel pleaded guilty in 2024 to 27 felony charges — including corrupt business influence, theft, tax evasion and official misconduct — and was ordered to repay millions to New Chapel EMS, Indiana tax officials and state and local law enforcement agencies.

He’s currently serving his 15-year sentence at the New Castle Correctional Annex. Three of those years will be suspended to probation, and he could be released earlier with good behavior and programming credits.
Findings from a lengthy Indiana State Police investigation found that Noel used millions of taxpayer dollars from the Utica Volunteer Firefighters Association and New Chapel EMS to buy cars, planes, vacations, clothing and other personal luxury purchases. Investigators said public funds were also used to pay for college tuition and child support.
The disgraced former sheriff was additionally accused of tasking county employees with jobs related to his personal collection of classic cars. At least 40 vehicles were confiscated by law enforcement, including a bevy of classics, such as two 1970 Plymouth Superbirds, a 1959 Corvette and 1966 and 1968 Chargers, according to search warrant returns.
More than $2.7 million has been raised so far through a series of auctions and forced property sales overseen by the Clark and Washington county courts, with most of the proceeds held until a special judge determines how to divide the funds among criminal-restitution recipients and claimants in ongoing civil litigation.
Not all of that money is available for restitution due to outstanding mortgages, auction fees and other obligations.
Escrow accounts now exceed $1.2 million
Two escrow accounts maintained in Washington County hold the bulk of restitution dollars. As of Nov. 20, balances reached $1,171,415.10 in one account and $74,380.97 in another. Those accounts contain auction proceeds and other property-sale revenue tied to Noel’s criminal case.
Clark County also holds escrow funds from multiple pre-judgment property sales — including two Jeffersonville-area homes sold earlier this year.
Any funds deposited after liens, mortgages, taxes and fees will eventually be distributed once the Indiana Attorney General’s civil lawsuit — alleging years of financial misconduct surrounding New Chapel EMS, a nonprofit ambulance service that contracted with Clark and Floyd counties — is resolved.
Court records show judges have so far only authorized limited withdrawals from escrow to cover essential expenses on Noel’s remaining unsold property, the home at 3001 Old Tay Bridge Road in Jeffersonville. In July, Special Judge Roger Duvall approved the release of $2,000 to Lopp Realtors to maintain the property. In November, the judge approved another $1,000 for the same purpose.

Nearly all of Noel’s Indiana real estate has already been liquidated. 
A Utica-area property sold for $800,000 in January. Included in the sale were adjacent properties on Old Salem Road in Jeffersonville — a pole barn used to store dozens of vehicles and a log-cabin-style home where family members lived.
In March, Noel’s 7,982-square-foot Jeffersonville mansion sold for $635,000, less than the $699,000 the Noels paid in 2022.
Still unresolved, however, is the Old Tay Bridge Road home, which is the subject of a foreclosure case filed in October by MSR Asset Vehicle LLC. The property carries tax debt and a significant mortgage — more than $261,000 still owed, according to court documents.
Separately, Noel’s Naples, Florida, residence is under contract for roughly $570,000, though that property also has an outstanding mortgage. Once it closes, its net proceeds are expected to be added to the escrow holdings.
Car auctions generated more than $1.27 million
But the biggest single boost to Noel’s restitution came from the sale of 43 classic cars, which brought in $1,277,950 during a two-day auction in May. The auction took place in French Lick as part of Freije & Freije Auctioneers’ annual “Big Boy Toy Auction,” but the proceeds were supervised by Washington County’s special-judge appointed in the Noel case.
Among the highest-value sales were a 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon that sold for $160,000, two 1970 Plymouth Roadrunner Superbirds that fetched $162,500 and $175,000, and a 1969 Plymouth Roadrunner that brought $100,000.
Court documents describe how Noel used $52,504 from his brother’s estate to buy the Roadrunner, then reimbursed the estate by withdrawing nearly the same amount from New Chapel EMS the following month.

Vehicles seized from Noel’s pole barn — including a 1959 Chevy Corvette, a 1968 Dodge Charger and several restored muscle cars — rounded out the nearly $1.3 million total.
Earlier, in January, Freije & Freije auctioned off more than 150 of Noel’s firearms, dozens of custom suits and several Rolex watches. 
Many of the suits — some lined with sheriff’s emblems or embroidered with Noel’s name — sold for around $200 despite initial prices in the thousands. Auction officials said all items moved in less than two hours.
A later online auction in March brought in $72,425. More than 100 people previewed the items in person, and 404 bidders competed for nearly 300 lots, which included a heavy-duty tool chest that sold for $3,250, as well as sheriff’s plaques, furniture and personal items from Noel’s pole barn.
Court approves separate payouts
The escrow accounts are also being tapped to resolve civil cases lodged by Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, which seek to force Noel to pay back the state agencies he allegedly took public funds from to pay for personal spending.
In one lawsuit, Rokita argued that Noel should be required to reimburse the Clark County jail commissary fund more than $900,000 for “funds misappropriated, diverted, or misapplied,” which were cited in an audit report filed by the State Board of Accounts last year.
Duvall ordered last month that Noel must pay a sum of $918,000 as punitive damages, in addition to $122,500 in interest. The judge’s order noted that additional annual statutory interest of 8% will be applied until the judgment is fully satisfied, meaning the total balance owed could top nearly $1.5 million by the time Noel is expected to be released from prison in June 2033.
The amount is in addition to the more than $3 million Noel agreed to pay as part of his criminal case.
In wake of Jamey Noel investigation, lawmakers advance bill to increase oversight over jail funds

The judge also ordered payout in a separate civil matter filed by Noel’s three nieces and nephew, who alleged that he mishandled their father’s estate funds after being appointed executor.
On Nov. 6, Duvall approved a $122,000 mediated settlement — including damages and attorney fees — and authorized the money to be released from escrow. 
In the ruling, Duvall wrote that the children “join a long list of persons and entities that have been damaged by the unlawful acts of Jamey Noel and family members.” 
He emphasized that the money originated from the sale of estate property and that paying the children did not come at the expense of victims connected to the New Chapel EMS scheme.
Noel agreed to a plea deal nearly a year after he was arrested and state police investigators raided his home in southern Indiana.
His agreement requires him to pay back $2,870,924 in public funds to the Utica Volunteer Firefighters Association, which did business as New Chapel EMS; $61,190 to the Clark County Sheriff’s Department; $173,155 to the Indiana Department of Revenue; and $35,245 to the Indiana State Police.
Court documents further point to at least $33,000 worth of public funds used by Noel to make contributions to various Republican candidates and campaigns between 2020 and 2023. Some of the candidates and campaignshave since been returned or donated those dollars elsewhere.
It’s up to the court to decide how restitution payments should be prioritized and how to reconcile claims across Noel’s multiple criminal and civil dockets. 
Until then, court officials said all remaining escrowed funds will remain frozen except for court-approved costs and payouts.

And that means the integrated SNAP-Medicaid system won’t arrive anytime soon (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri’s social services department has in recent years been reprimanded by a judge for illegally denying food assistance and scrutinized by the federal government for massive Medicaid application backlogs.
And for more than a decade, the agency has vowed to tackle these problems by overhauling the computer systems that help determine whether people qualify for social safety net programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income people.
But needed technology changes are once again on hold, thanks to a barrage of deadlines mandated by Congress this summer as part of President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” —  most notably work requirements and more frequent renewals for Medicaid.
Instead of moving forward with a long-promised modernization of its eligibility software, the Missouri Department of Social Services must focus its time and staff toward meeting sweeping federal deadlines in Trump’s new law. And that means the integrated SNAP-Medicaid system won’t arrive anytime soon.
Plans to combine eligibility software for SNAP and Medicaid into a single, updated system will have to wait until at least 2028, said Toi Wilde, chief information officer for the Missouri Department of Social Services.
“You don’t want this type of huge, major policy shift that you have going,” Wilde said. “Going into a full implementation of a new system would be extremely challenging [during this shift].”
News of the delay inspired dismay among those who have been battling with the department for years to ensure eligible Missourians get access to benefits they are entitled to receive. What’s worse, advocates say, is that delays come as the department is trying to appeal the 2024 federal court decision that found its administration of the SNAP program illegally denied food benefits to Missourians.
Katherine Holley, an attorney for Legal Services of Eastern Missouri who defended plaintiffs in that lawsuit, said her organization’s clients are still struggling to get department staff on the phone to complete required eligibility interviews.
Clients call the department trying to complete their interview, she said, only to hear that there are hundreds of people in front of them in the queue. One client was recently terminated from SNAP, she said, when a document he submitted to the department online got lost.
“I reached out to the agency, and then they found it, and they opened his benefits back up,” Holley said. “But if he hadn’t reached out to us, he would just be without benefits.”
 System struggles

The Missouri Department of Social Services resource center located in Columbia, on April 18, 2023 (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).
The department’s attempt to combine its systems in 2013 ended earlier this year after a decade-long legal battle that cost the state $92.7 million, including interest.
The department contracted with the software company EngagePoint in June 2013 to build a system to meet requirements in the Affordable Care Act and handle eligibility and enrollment for SNAP and Medicaid.
Missouri didn’t expand Medicaid until 2021, but the 2010 federal law required states to make other changes. States had to start using a new method to measure income to determine Medicaid eligibility for most adults, and they had to update their eligibility and enrollment systems to exchange information with the federal marketplace.
The department had big ambitions for its tech upgrades: “a comprehensive, fully integrated, state-of-the-art automated human services eligibility, enrollment and case management system,” according to its January 2013 request for proposals.
But the state terminated the contract three years early, with the new system partially built. Missourians’ SNAP cases stayed in the old system, alongside Medicaid for elderly or disabled Missourians. Only the Medicaid cases subject to new federal income measurement were migrated to the newer system.
Advocates and experts say separate systems can cause problems.
Integrated systems allow people to take fewer steps to apply for and maintain SNAP and Medicaid benefits, which reduces the chance that they’ll be wrongly denied benefits. Well-integrated systems are also better at handling the complexity of overlapping but distinct federal eligibility rules for SNAP and Medicaid so state employees bear less of that burden.
Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said integrated systems make it easier for states to offer combined applications for Medicaid and SNAP and for information to carry over across programs when people complete annual renewals or submit changes.
Combined systems streamline state employees’ work, and the savings gets passed down to people accessing the programs.
“From a caseworker perspective, because so much of the eligibility determination keys off each other and uses the same information, you can touch a case much less often,” Wagner said. 
Holley said a lack of coordination between Missouri’s SNAP and Medicaid systems has caused clients to lose benefits, partly because annual renewals for Medicaid and SNAP happen on different timelines. 
A past client updated their address while renewing their Medicaid coverage, Holley said. The address didn’t transfer to the other system, so that when it was time for the client to recertify their SNAP eligibility, the paperwork was sent to their old address. The client lost their benefits.
“Those systems don’t talk,” Holley said.
 Barriers to access

Attorneys for the plaintiffs in the federal SNAP lawsuit said continuing challenges completing annual renewals are part of the reason it’s so important for the court not to let the department off the hook. 
While the department argued in its request for an appeal that it had already addressed the harms to the individual plaintiffs in the case by granting them interviews and benefits, the attorneys said plaintiffs are likely to encounter the same denials for failure to interview.
“All of these people want to keep their benefits and are trying their hardest,” Holley said.
One of the plaintiffs, Mary Holmes, lost SNAP benefits during the lawsuit because the department said she incorrectly filled out recertification paperwork, Holley said.
Data the department is court-ordered to submit to the court each month suggest improvements in the number of times people get disconnected when the call center is overloaded. It also shows fewer SNAP applications are being rejected only due to failure to complete an interview.

But Katie Deabler, an attorney from the National Center for Law and Economic Justice who is also representing plaintiffs in the case, said the department hasn’t been submitting data long enough to demonstrate improvements will last.
Deabler, who has worked on SNAP cases in multiple states, said application volumes often vary with the seasons. Applications tend to pick up in the summer and over the winter holidays, when kids can’t receive food in school.
Though the average time someone spends on hold waiting for an interview has decreased from 57 minutes in February to 23 minutes in October, average wait times were slightly up in July, August, September and October from a year ago. That’s in four of the six months where there are two years of data. 

The department has fallen short of a benchmark U.S. District Court Judge Douglas Harpool set in May of 90% of all callers spending no more than 20 minutes on hold. In October, that was true of 62% of people waiting for a SNAP interview. The longest anyone spent on hold that month, the department reported, was 2 hours and 22 minutes, down from a peak of 6 hours and 3 minutes in March.
“Agencies that are trying to fix these sorts of big, systemic problems,” Deabler said, “they really can’t just sit back and take a break just because there’s a few months that looked okay.”
 “A perfect storm in a terrible way”

Wagner, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the “Big Beautiful Bill” has created “a perfect storm in a terrible way.”
The law requires states next year to begin implementing sweeping policy changes to Medicaid with sharply reduced administrative funding for SNAP and under intense pressure to minimize errors in SNAP payments.
“That means less resources and a ton more work and a lot more severe consequences if the work is not done perfectly,” Wagner said.
Beginning in October 2027, states with SNAP error rates of 6% or higher will have to pay 5 to 15% of the cost of the food benefits they issue. States’ current performance will be used to determine if and how much they must pay.
“So states have not a short timeframe, but a negative timeframe, to affect the error rate that will determine whether the state can maintain the program or not,” Wagner said.
Missouri’s error rate was 9.42% in fiscal year 2024, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Wilde, the state social services department’s chief information officer, said that while the department focuses on implementing the federal law, it’s making changes to streamline staffers’ workflow while planning for the eventual replacement of its systems.
The department has developed a process to automatically transfer some information from SNAP applications into the eligibility system, Wilde said, without requiring “a bunch of manual touches” from staffers, saving about 400 hours of work so far.
“What we’ve been doing,” she said, “is reimagining, in the intermediacy, til different systems…are put in place, what are some low tech solutions that still have big, really good [impacts] and that can help the process?”
Wilde said the department has also upgraded its automated call center technology so Missourians can get more information about their SNAP and Medicaid cases without having to wait on hold. 
The department has also started work to allow its call center technology to feed more information to its eligibility systems, Wilde said, in anticipation of more frequent Medicaid recertifications next year.
For Missourians struggling to access needed assistance, the stakes are high. 
Deabler said that regardless of pressures from the federal government, the state has a legal responsibility to provide SNAP benefits to people who are eligible.
“States owe the same duty to the people who rely on this program to feed their families that they always did,” Deabler said.
Holley said she and others at Legal Services of Eastern Missouri, “keep see[ing] people cycling back through, needing our help again and again.”
“In theory, all of these systems should work to keep people who qualify for benefits…in receipt of them,” Holley said. “They should continue to receive benefits. They’re doing what they need to do. It’s frustrating.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/041623_swillum1-scaled-e1717605040418-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-11-24 06:57:03.498080

Aug. 1, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)FREMONT, Neb. — Former State Sen. Lynne Walz on Monday launched an exploratory committee to run for Nebraska governor in 2026, seeking to uplift Nebraskans’ concerns instead of their partisanship.
Walz, in an announcement interview with the Nebraska Examiner, said the state’s political system and economy are “broken.” She said she wants to hear from Nebraskans about their lives and work to find solutions together before formally launching a formal gubernatorial bid. Such arrangements let potential candidates raise money and gauge public support.
“This campaign is going to be a campaign for the people, and it’s my job, as far as I’m concerned, to go out and really listen to the people,” Walz said.
Walz said politicians, no matter their political stripes, are “no longer interested in fighting for the average person,” so she said it’s important to elect “average people” who know the real world. She’s a former fourth and fifth grade teacher, local church leader and mother of three who has worked various jobs to make ends meet, from sorting seed corn to working in a local deli.

Walz plans to travel the state in early December and hold listening sessions with taxpayers. She said she would incorporate those ideas into her campaign for governor, a decision she expects to finalize in early 2026. Non-incumbents must file by March 2.
“If we’re finding that we’re on the same page, that people, like me, are having the same struggles that I am with health care costs, with housing costs, transportation, day care cost, then I’m all in on running for governor,” Walz said.
Walz in 2018 ran as the Democratic lieutenant governor candidate for then-State Sen. Bob Krist, who sought to unseat then-Gov. Pete Ricketts. 
Ricketts received 59% support. Should she run, she would be seeking to be the state’s first Democratic governor since former Gov. Ben Nelson was term-limited in 1999. 
Campaign priorities
Walz served two terms as a Democratic state senator in the officially nonpartisan Nebraska Legislature, a legislative moderate representing Republican-leaning Dodge County and Valley.
The former teacher served all eight years on the Education Committee, which she chaired in 2021 and 2022 with the support of Republicans and Democrats. 
She lost reelection as chair in 2023 and 2024, when the body shifted in a more conservative direction.
This January, a term-limited Walz returned to being a realtor in Fremont full time.
Among Walz’s early list of priorities is affordability of health care, child care and housing; an eye toward education and a “laser focus” on economic development.
Walz said she would announce a property tax plan “soon” but that all Nebraskans need to work together. She said there have been opportunities to do so, such as a 2022 plan she worked on with then-State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha, a Republican running for Congress in the Omaha area.

Those plans were built on statewide feedback, but she said the then-Ricketts-led executive branch ran “interference,” in part, she argued, because of her political party.
“That’s a sad situation for 1.9 million people in Nebraska,” Walz said. “That’s not the way things should work.”
In 2024, Walz joined a small, bipartisan group of lawmakers developing a long-term school funding and property tax relief plan that phased in over a decade rather than moving as quickly as Gov. Jim Pillen’s competing proposal.
Walz said that those who know her know that party labels don’t matter to her, but the current system “forces” people to choose a letter behind their name. To her, she said, “Democrat” represents the values of her father: faith, hard work and family love. He provided for those around him, she said.
As governor, Walz said she would not care who brought property tax relief proposals so long as they’re responsible, intentional and don’t hurt people. She said property tax relief requires economic development through new and expanded businesses. 
Walz helped pass a bill in 2022 to more quickly build and improve the state’s expressway system at less cost. She said she plans to bring the business community together for a long-term strategic plan.
“Let’s just bring something, and let’s get it done,” Walz said.
 A swing vote
When she came to the Legislature in 2017, having unseated a Republican incumbent in a red district, she said she had to listen to all sides. Walz said she “absolutely” considers herself a moderate. 
“They don’t come in with preconceived ideas, and they don’t come in with somebody telling them how they have to vote and having to bow down to that,” Walz said. “A moderate can think for themselves, and that’s exactly what I do.”

In her first year, Walz passed a bill to prohibit cities and counties from canceling health insurance coverage for first responders injured while on duty for at least one year after the injury, giving families time to plan ahead. It earned Walz an award as legislator of the year from the Fraternal Order of Police.
In 2020, Walz was one of just four registered Democrats at the time to pass a bill banning a second-trimester abortion method known medically as dilation and evacuation. In 2023, she was eyed as a swing vote on a bill seeking to ban abortions after six weeks post-fertilization. The bill ultimately passed to ban most abortions after 12 weeks gestational age after one Republican balked at the stricter language.
Walz had tried to find middle ground when the abortion fight was attached to another contentious social issue that year: gender care for youths with gender dysphoria. She introduced a compromise amendment she had crafted with Republican input, focused on an abortion exception for fatal fetal anomalies and specifying gender care regulations. Her changes weren’t considered, and she voted against the final bill.
Education, affordability and economics
On education, Walz said it’s important for high schools to offer more students individualized opportunities to succeed, such as career and technical education, for which she said Fremont has been a model. She also wants the state to provide more resources to students at a “very early age.” 
The former teacher said she remembers young students who came to school abused or hungry. Many struggled to learn.
Walz in 2024 appropriated $10 million for school security infrastructure improvement grants in the wake of school shootings nationally.
On affordability, Walz said the state must focus on structural costs it can control, such as via housing grants or expanded down payment assistance for young families. She is also interested in child care provider incentives.

While there is a “moral obligation” to help those in need, Walz said the government can’t solve everyone’s problems, and she said it should work with businesses and workers to create opportunities so Nebraskans can improve their own lives.
Walz said she would work with the federal government and uphold the “will of the people” as indicated in recent ballot measures.
The 2024 statewide vote on school choice and state-funded school vouchers for private schools also solidified Walz’s opposition to the state subsidizing private school costs of attendance. She was “present, not voting” — which she described as a “soft no” — on the passage of a tax-credit based model in 2023 and a replacement direct scholarship model in 2024.
Walz said she and her husband, Chris, worked five to six jobs to put their three children through private school, because the couple wanted the faith-based education. However, Walz said they didn’t ask anyone to pay for them. She said she worries state funding could lead to more state involvement in private education and jeopardize the faith-based focus the Walz family wanted.
She said she doesn’t want to take away money that could go to public education and said vouchers often go to wealthy families already sending kids to private school.
Family and job experience
Walz grew up on a small hog farm north of Fremont in Fontanelle, Nebraska. She and her brother ran the farm while her father, a construction worker and union member, worked. Walz said it was “one of the best experiences,” that it taught her hard work, loving God’s creation and the importance of family.
After high school, while friends were packing bags to go to college, Walz said she moved in with and advocated for three ladies living with developmental disabilities. On bad days, the women gave Walz the hugs and support she needed.
“It taught me how to advocate for people,” Walz said. “It taught me that everybody has a gift.”
After meeting her husband, Walz said the couple had two boys and she went to college for teaching. She opened a day care to keep her kids at home. She later worked various jobs to make ends meet, from 3M in the evening to sorting corn seed as well as the Hinky Dinky deli.
She went back to helping families with developmental disabilities before becoming a fourth and fifth grade teacher at Northside Elementary School in Fremont. After having a third child, a girl, she earned a real estate license. 
‘Love your neighbor’
Walz said her faith remains the “center” of all of her decisions. She holds a leadership role in the Nebraska Synod Evangelical Lutheran Church of America and has been a Bible school teacher and Sunday school teacher.

She said her parents and grandparents taught her to love God and her neighbor. She said her parents helped people, including with food and basic needs, and took in her grandparents when her grandpa had cancer.
“When Jesus said ‘love your neighbor,’ there was a period at the end of that sentence,” Walz said.
She says love is unconditional whether Nebraskans look the same, have the same faith or share political views. 
“I’ll do everything I can to make sure that we are united and we all have common goals, because there are really more things that unite us than things that divide us,” Walz said.
‘Going to work furiously’
Should Walz decide to run for governor, she said she would run in the Democratic primary, set for May 12. She is only known Democrat considering a bid.  The Democratic primary winner would advance to the Nov. 3 general election, along with the GOP winner.
Pillen has announced his reelection campaign. Also running is Jacy Todd of York, a combat medic veteran, small business owner and notary for recent medical cannabis petitions. Charles Herbster, an agribusinessman 2022 Pillen opponent, is flirting with a 2026 rematch.
Walz said her focus is common good and positive impact with ideas rooted in listening to Nebraskans, not partisan fights.
“We’re not going to be pointing fingers,” Walz said. “We’re going to move ahead, and we’re going to work furiously and focus on what needs to be done to better the lives of the people who live here.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Like other Wisconsin law enforcement agencies, the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department (WCSD) uses Flock cameras for many reasons, though department personnel don’t always clearly document what those reasons are. Audit data reveals that staff most frequently entered “investigation” in order to access Flock’s network, while other documented uses are raising concerns among privacy advocates. 
Flock cameras perpetually photograph and, using AI-powered license plate reader technology, identify vehicles traversing roadways. Flock’s system can be used to view a vehicle’s journey, even weeks after capturing an image, or flag specific vehicles for law enforcement which have been placed on “Be On The Lookout” (BOLO) lists.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
As of March 2025, the company Flock Safety was valued at $7.5 billion, with over 5,000 law enforcement agencies using its cameras nationwide. At least  221 of those agencies are in Wisconsin, including the city of Waukesha’s police department as well as  the county sheriff . The Wisconsin Examiner obtained Flock audit data from the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department through open records requests, covering Flock searches from January 2024 to July 2025, and used computer programming to analyze the data.
Over that period of time, more than 6,700 Flock searches were conducted by WCSD using only “investigation”, as well as abbreviations or misspellings of the word. The searches, as they appeared in the audit data, offered no other context to suggest why specifically Flock’s network had been searched. Lt. Nicholas Wenzel, a sheriff’s department spokesperson, wrote in an email statement that “investigation” has a broad usage when Flock is involved. 
“A deputy/detective using Flock for an investigation is using it for a wide range of public safety situations,” Wenzel explained. “Flock assists in locating missing persons during Amber or Silver Alert by identifying their vehicles and has proven effective in recovering stolen cars. Investigators use Flock to track suspect vehicles in serious crimes such as homicides, assaults, robberies, and shootings, as well as in property crimes like burglaries, catalytic converter thefts, and package thefts. The system also supports traffic-related investigations, including hit-and-run cases, and enables agencies to share information across jurisdictions to track offenders who travel between communities.”
Widespread use of vague search terms 
Dave Maass, director of investigations at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, says that terms like “investigation” are too vague to determine whether or not Flock was used appropriately.  At least some responsibility falls on Flock Safety itself, Maass argues. “They’re setting up a system where it’s impossible for somebody to audit it,” he told the Wisconsin Examiner. “And I think that’s the big problem, is that there’s no baseline requirement that you have to have a case related to this…They say you have to have a law enforcement purpose. But if you just put the word ‘investigation’ there, how do you know? Like, how do you know that this is not somebody stalking their ex-partner? How do you know whether this is somebody looking up information about celebrities? How do you know whether it’s racist or not? And you just don’t, because nobody is checking any of these things.”
The audit also stored other vague search terms used by WCSD such as “f”, “cooch”, “freddy”, “ts”, “nathan”, and “hunt” which Lt. Wenzel would not define.“The search terms are associated with investigations, some of which remain active,” he wrote in an email statement. “To preserve the integrity of these ongoing investigations, no further description or clarification of the terms can be provided at this time.”

In August, Wisconsin Examiner published a similar Flock analysis that also found agencies statewide entering only the word “investigation,” with no other descriptor, in order to access Flock. At nearly 20,000 searches (not including misspellings and abbreviations), the term “investigation” was in fact the most often used term in that analysis, which relied on audit data obtained from the Wauwatosa Police Department. 
While data from the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department appeared in that first Flock story, that analysis focused on broad trends which appeared among at least 221 unique agencies using Flock in Wisconsin. This more recent analysis focuses specifically on the Waukesha County Sheriff Department’s use of the camera network. 
The August report found that the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department appeared among the top 10 Wisconsin law enforcement agencies that used Flock the most. The report also found that some agencies also only entered “.” — a period — in the Flock system field to indicate the reason for using the system. The West Allis Police Department led Wisconsin in this particular search term, followed by the Waukesha Police Department and the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office. 
In response to an inquiry from the Wisconsin Examiner, a Waukesha Police Department spokesperson  said that an officer who’d conducted nearly 400 Flock searches using only “.” as the reason had been provided extra training, and that the officer’s behavior had been corrected after the Wisconsin Examiner reached out. The West Allis Police Department,  on the other hand, did not suggest that its officers were using the Flock network improperly. 
Use of vague search terms is chronic across Flock’s network, Maass has found. He recalled  one nationwide audit that covered 11.4 million Flock searches over a six-month period. Of those some 22,743 “just dots” appeared as reasons for Flock searches. Searches using only the word “investigation” made up about 14.5% of all searches, he said. 
“So yeah, that’s a problem,” Maass told the Wisconsin Examiner. Reviewing a copy of Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department audit data, Maass saw the same vague search terms that have been reported by the Examiner. Although some terms can be reasonably guessed — such as “repo” perhaps meaning repossession, or ICAC, which usually stands for Internet Crimes Against Children — others aren’t so easy.

“‘Hunt’ can mean anything,” said Maass, referring to a term which appeared 24 times within the Waukesha Sheriff’s data. Maass points to the search term “f”, which the Wisconsin Examiner’s analysis found WCSD used to search Flock 806 times. 
Maass highlights that each search touches hundreds or even thousands of individual Flock networks nationwide. “If I’m one of these agencies that gets hit by this system, how am I to know if this is a legitimate search or not?” Maass said. “Now, maybe somebody at Waukesha is going through their own system, and like questioning every officer about every case. Maybe they’re doing that. Probably not.” 
Wenzel of the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department said that although some searches appear vague,  deputies and detectives are required by department policy to document their use of Flock in reports. Although a case number category does appear in the audit data, this column was rendered blank, making it impossible for Wisconsin Examiner to determine how often Flock searches had case numbers, or whether those case numbers corresponded with specific investigations the sheriff’s department had on file. 
“The Sheriff’s Office understands the concerns surrounding emerging technology and takes very seriously its responsibility to protect the privacy and civil rights of the community,” Wenzel said in a statement. “The use of Flock license plate recognition technology is guided by clear safeguards to ensure it is only used for legitimate law enforcement purposes.” 
The department’s policy, Wenzel explained, “prohibits any use outside of legitimate criminal investigations.” He said that deputies undergo initial and ongoing training to use the camera network. “All system activity is logged and subject to review,” said Wenzel.
Maass says the department can’t back-check the searches conducted by other agencies using the Waukesha Flock network, however. “Because when we’re talking about millions of searches coming through their system, you know, every few months…like hundreds of thousands at least every month…how are they actually quality controlling any of these?” Maass told the Wisconsin Examiner. “They’re just not.”

Wenzel said that “the technology is not used for general surveillance, traffic enforcement, or monitoring individuals not connected to an investigation.” The Wisconsin Examiner’s analysis, however, detected 43 searches logged as “surveillance” and 30 searches logged as “traffic offense.” The audit data also contained at least 357 searches logged as “suspicious” or variations of the word, as well as another 14 logged as “suspicious driving behavior,” 52 searches for “road rage” and 36 logged as “identify driver”.
There were also 62 searches related to evictions, which privacy advocates contend  go beyond the public safety roles that the cameras were originally pitched to serve.
“Evictions can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous situations,” said Wenzel. “The removal of individuals from a residence often creates heightened emotions, uncertainty, and sometimes resistance. For this reason, safety is the top priority for both the residents being evicted and the deputies carrying out the court order. Flock is utilized to determine if the former tenants have left the area or could possibly be in the area when the court order is being carried out.” 
Jon McCray Jones, policy analyst for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin, said in a statement that the Waukesha Sheriff’s use of Flock has extended “far beyond the public safety justifications for which these tools were originally sold.” McCray Jones told the Wisconsin Examiner, “These systems were introduced to the public as a means to reduce violent crime and aid in solving serious investigations. However, when they are used for non-criminal purposes, such as evictions, they cross a dangerous line.”  
Waukesha’s uses for evictions were particularly concerning for McCray Jones. “What’s happening here is surveillance technology, operated by taxpayer-funded public servants, being weaponized at the behest of private landlords and corporations,” he said. “That is exactly the kind of mission creep communities are most worried about when it comes to police surveillance. If Flock cameras can be repurposed to target tenants today, what stops law enforcement tomorrow from using facial recognition to track people who fall behind on rent, or phone location data to monitor whether workers are ‘really sick’ when they call off? We’ve seen documented cases where law enforcement misused surveillance systems to track down romantic interests. Once the floodgate is opened, the slide into abuse is fast and quiet.” 
Wenzel said that access to the Flock network is limited to personnel who are properly trained and authorized to use the software, and the department’s policy is regularly reviewed by those personnel. 
“Searches are limited to legitimate law enforcement purposes per department policy,” he wrote in an email statement. The department has conducted its own Flock audits, Wenzel explained, and no sheriff department staff have ever been disciplined or re-trained due to Flock-related issues. Although the Waukesha County Sheriff’s Department is part of the federal 287(g) program, in which local law enforcement agencies participate in federal immigration enforcement, Wenzel said that Flock is not used as part of the program, and the Wisconsin Examiner didn’t find any clear examples of immigration-related uses by the sheriff’s department. 
McCray Jones considers the Waukesha Sheriff’s use of Flock to be an example of why “surveillance technology in the hands of law enforcement must be tightly limited, narrowly defined, and rigorously transparent.” He stressed that every use “must be clearly logged and justified — not with vague categories like ‘investigation’ or ‘repo’, but with meaningful explanations the public can actually understand and evaluate. Without strict guardrails, audits like this reveal how quickly tools justified in the name of ‘safety’ turn into instruments of convenience or even private gain.” 
With the growth of surveillance technologies and the civil liberties implications they raise, McCray Jones said that the public “deserves clear proof that it is being used only to reduce crime — particularly violent crime — and not to serve the interests of landlords or corporations. Accountability and transparency aren’t optional add-ons; they are the bare minimum to prevent abuse.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Amid a bizarre crusade to eviscerate the line between church and state and a seeming zeal to rapidly expand school choice to all, the number of charter schools seems to be approaching a saturation point.
And it’s become a real headscratcher that our lawmakers aren’t willing to do the heavy lifting to better regulate this critical part of our academic infrastructure. Maybe that could include requiring these schools to meet certain academic performance thresholds to remain open or penalizing sponsors who aren’t providing adequate oversight. It could also include capping how many of these institutions can exist at once, setting enrollment minimums in order to operate, ensuring teacher qualifications and setting maximum student-to-teacher ratios.
Right now, state law inexplicably exempts these types of schools from most statutes relating to traditional school districts, including that they employ educators with valid teaching certificates.
At the very least, it certainly feels like we no longer need to provide any more of these schools with as much as $50,000 in start-up funding because we’ve stimulated the industry enough.
Reports show we have 26 brick-and-mortar charter schools and seven virtual ones.
At least one of these schools, which last week was placed on probation, is being allowed to operate at a ratio of 115 students to 1 teacher and had a financial deficit of over $274,000. Supporters say they don’t have enough students to pay the bills and had to lay off teachers.
There’s no way a student can learn with a ratio like that. 
The state’s largest virtual charter school, Epic, is under investigation after mismanagement led to mass layoffs and program cuts. In all, about 500 employees were laid off after administrators reportedly underestimated expenses while overestimating revenue. That has jeopardized the solvency of the school that serves over 20,000 students. That school had to take out a $30 million line of credit.
As the Statewide Charter School Board struggles to regulate what currently exists, eight more brick-and-mortar locations want permission to open, including one that was already rejected by Moore Public Schools and another that was rebuffed by Tulsa’s Union Public Schools. State law gives rejected schools the option to override local control by then applying at the state level. 
Meanwhile, a Florida-based Jewish organization wants to open a school here that would  become the nation’s first publicly funded religious charter school. That’s despite a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May that blocked another religious charter school from opening. Our nation’s highest court upheld a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that found the Statewide Charter School Board acted unconstitutionally when it tried to create a publicly funded Catholic school.
Still the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation has notified the board that it wants to use our tax dollars to operate the Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School. The group’s representative founded six non-religious English-Hebrew charter schools in Florida. Its school in Oklahoma would serve just 40 students.
Brian Shellem, the chair of the Oklahoma’s charter oversight board, isn’t dismissing the idea of another religious charter school. He says that he won’t “prejudge” the application.
Because the high court deadlocked 4-4, with one justice recusing, supporters of publicly funded religious charter schools believe this issue could easily head back to the U.S. Supreme Court and result in a different outcome. Following May’s deadlock, Gov. Kevin Stitt said the matter is “far from a settled issue” and that Oklahoma is in “overtime” and there would be another case.  Stitt appointed Shellem to the charter school oversight board, which pledged to respect the decision that barred St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School from operating.
Oklahoma doesn’t need to be the one that leads the religious charter school fight, and we don’t need to be the test dummy for every right-wing scheme that comes our way. We certainly don’t need to be the ones wasting even more precious resources tilting at windmills and sowing dissension over an out-of-state school that inexplicably has set its sights on Oklahoma.
We’re struggling to regulate what we do have.
There are some charter schools that do a good job educating their students, but virtual schools in particular have been criticized for their students scoring below statewide averages – in a state that already ranks near the bottom for student outcomes. 
It’s time to focus on ensuring the charter schools we do have are excelling and are financially stable. Once all of those are running well, then maybe we talk about adding more.

For a 60-year-old Wyoming resident earning $63K a year, the average monthly ACA premium costs are increasing by 421%.
The post ‘It’s terrifying.’ Wyoming leads country with highest jump in Obamacare costs appeared first on WyoFile .","With their Affordable Care Act insurance premium costs set to rise from the current rate of $600 a month to $3,000 starting next year, Elizabeth Aranow and her husband aren’t sure what to do.
“We haven’t purchased a plan yet, because I’m reeling from sticker shock,” Aranow said. The Lander residents could buy a cheaper marketplace plan, but at $1,800 a month, the least expensive plan available still more than doubles their costs while offering less coverage. The situation has spurred them to consider major life changes, like applying for new jobs with benefits or going without insurance. 
But “to me, not having insurance is not an option,” she said. Aranow has experienced injuries that required surgeries in recent years.
Health policy changes, a shifting market and expiring tax credits mean the roughly 45,000 Wyomingites who get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are experiencing the highest price jumps in the nation. 
In Wyoming, a 60-year-old person earning roughly $63,000 is facing a 421% increase in average monthly premium costs on the ACA marketplace, according to reporting by KFF, a nonprofit that writes about health care. No other state equals or tops that percentage. The same individual would face increases of 231%, 166%, 192% and 134% if he or she lived in Montana, Colorado, Utah and Idaho, respectively. 
“It’s pretty terrifying,” Eranow said. 
Not all patients are experiencing such dramatic rises; costs depend on factors like age and annual income. But health care advocates worry that sticker shock will cause consumers to either find private plans with cheap price tags but lousy coverage or abandon insurance altogether.

“I think that we’re going to see a lot of people just not buy insurance and take the gamble that if something happens, they’ll be able to figure out how to pay it off through the hospital,” said Jenn Lowe, executive director of Healthy Wyoming, which advocates for affordable health care. 
The consequences, Lowe thinks, will be more medical debt, more uncompensated care in hospitals, increasing insurance costs for everyone, rising health issues due to patients avoiding preventative care and higher stress — which also leads to worse health outcomes. 
“All of this should be very concerning to health care consumers in the state,” she said. “Now that the expiring tax credits are coming and people are seeing in real time what the increase in costs are going to be, I think a little bit of reality is hitting  that we have some of the most expensive [health] insurance in the nation.” 
The how and why 
The Affordable Care Act marketplace, created in 2010, is available to people who don’t qualify for Medicaid and don’t have insurance through an employer. 
In 2020, Congress created the Enhanced Premium Tax Credit during the COVID-19 pandemic to make marketplace insurance more affordable. That program provided subsidies that drastically reduced premium costs. For some low-income customers, monthly premiums went to $0.  
The program helped contribute to an all-time low in America’s uninsured rate, health advocates say. But they were not cheap — and fiscal conservatives argued they were unsustainable. Congress extended the credits in 2022, but did not extend them again this year. A deadlock over the tax credits played a significant role in the recent government shutdown. 
Expansion would have a $212 billion deficit impact on government spending over 10 years, according to a 2020 estimate from the Congressional Budget Office.
Ultimately, Congress struck a deal that did not include an extension. With the enrollment period opening Nov. 1, patients have only recently been able to log in to the system to see what their new plan options are. Open enrollment is the annual window when individuals and families can sign up for ACA health insurance, adjust plans or cancel coverage.

Insurance companies increased baseline plan costs this year. With the subsidy changes factored in, some became exponentially pricier. In addition, Mountain Health Co-op stopped offering health plans in Wyoming. That means the state is down to just two providers. 
Lowe’s organization has been holding forums around the state this fall to help educate patients about the changes. The most recent one, held last week in Casper, had the biggest attendance so far. She attributed that to people actually seeing what their increases will be.
“I heard from people who are having to make decisions about paying for rent, paying for food and being able to pay for their insurance,” Lowe said. “It’s definitely kind of scary times.”
Navigating 
The Lander Free Medical Clinic has also been hearing from patients it formerly helped set up with ACA plans. Audrey Zanetti, a medical assistant who supervises the clinic, brought up one who was on a $0 premium plan.
“It was going to auto-renew to a similar plan,” Zanetti said. Except that the new premium would have climbed from $0 to $650. That equates to about 40% of the person’s monthly income — and it doesn’t include co-pay and deductible costs. 
“And so if that individual hadn’t come in, they would have been locked into that plan, it would have autorenewed,” she said. “They would have seen the bill come January or February, and would have said, ‘I can’t afford that.’ They would have cancelled the plan, and then not been eligible [to re-enroll] because they’re outside of open enrollment.”
Health insurance is complicated, and the auto-renewal caveat is not a detail everyone is aware of. 
In the past, health “navigators” — trained professionals who guide customers through the open enrollment process — have been available largely thanks to federal funds. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services slashed that funding by 90% this year.
As a result, Enroll Wyoming, which offered free help to those seeking insurance, cut its staff from 10 people to just one full-time and one part-time employee.

To make up for some of the loss, the program has established a statewide network of organizations with health counselor training. 
“We wanted to set up a system where people could still get help,” said Enroll Wyoming Navigator Katelyn Befus. “We brought in the organizations and partners that we’ve been working with for years, and leaned on them a little bit to become certified.”
The Lander Free Medical Clinic is one of those places; VISTA Volunteer Stephanie Kohm recently completed the training. It is also holding free community sessions. 
As Enroll Wyoming’s only full-time navigator, Befus is “extremely” busy, she said. “I’m literally completely booked for appointments all the way through the first half of enrollment. So that would be all the way through Dec. 15.”
Befus has heard some frustrations from customers about prices going up. She’s done a lot of explaining about how the tax credits were designed to sunset, she said, and people are generally understanding.
However, Befus said, households that earn over 400% of the federal poverty level — $62,600 for a one-person household — are getting hit hard.
“They’re looking at extremely high premiums,” she said, like in the neighborhood of $5,000 a month for a four-person household. 
“So we’ve been having to recommend outside insurance to people over that 400% because for a lot of them, they just can’t afford that much money,” Befus said. 
Guidance and deadlines 
The deadline to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan starting Jan. 1 is Dec. 15. If customers enroll between Dec. 15 and the closing date of Jan. 15, coverage will start Feb. 1. 
Experts urge people to be deliberate. 
“I really encourage people to go to the [Healthcare.gov] website and use the ‘browse plans and prices’ tool to see what their expected tax credit and premium is before they jump in,” Befus said. 
Those who do not want to continue ACA policies need to be careful they don’t auto-renew, she added. And for people exploring private insurance, she recommends calling insurance companies directly and fully understanding plan provisions before purchasing. 
Befus stressed caution in shopping online. “There are a ton of fake and scammer websites out there,” Befus said. 
A different solution? 
Another thing people can do, Lowe said, is “Call your federal delegates and let them know that this is impacting you personally.”
In the tax credit stalemate this fall, Republicans were generally against extension while Democrats were in favor. Wyoming’s U.S. Sen. John Barrasso, a retired physician, told NBC’s Meet the Press that Obamacare is a failed measure and Republicans want to replace it with something that works to actually lower costs.

“I’ve always wanted people to get the care they need, from a doctor that they choose, at a price they can afford — and Obamacare basically destroyed that possibility,” Barrasso said. “We cannot just continue to subsidize a failing plan, which is causing more and more costs and hardship around the country.”
It’s easy to criticize Obamacare, Lowe said. What’s harder is coming up with a better solution. 
“Republicans committed to talking about health care insurance once the government reopened,” she said. “Well, guess what? The government is reopened. Let’s talk about health care insurance. You guys don’t want the marketplace. How are you going to be able to provide health care insurance to the people of Wyoming?”
Health insurance, Lowe said, creates longer and healthier lives. “It’s a policy solution that we know works.”
Now is the time to hold delegates accountable, Lowe said. “And say: ‘if not this, then what?’”

A critical deer migration corridor in western Wyoming shouldn’t be sold off for oil and gas, writes guest columnist Walt Gasson.
The post There’s some land too important to sacrifice on the altar of development appeared first on WyoFile .","Old Gus and I were coming out of the Big Sandy country in November of that year. It had been the last elk hunt of the season, and we had closed up the home place for the winter. Just in time, too. The snowstorm the night before had made the road around the north side of Little Prospect Mountain impassable, and we had to take an alternate road to hit the pavement at Farson. My hope was that we might reach the store before it closed and get an ice cream cone. I was 11, and as always, my dad’s outdoor adventure accomplice.

Opinion

We were chained up and grinding steadily forward, off the mountain and out into the land of gray and white. The wind was blowing, and there were patches of bare ground, but every big sagebrush had a mini-drift on the leeward side. There were mare’s tails of airborne snow drifting off the rockpiles of the Prospects and Little Prospect. My images of that day are in black and white, sagebrush and granite and sky. And mule deer.
They were everywhere that day, on the flanks of those cold desert mountain ranges. Little bunches, big bunches — hundreds of them. The bucks were strutting, with their big, swollen necks extended and walking that stiff-legged gait they adopt as the rut draws closer. Gus normally paid little attention to mule deer. He was an elk hunter, and a very effective one. In his world, deer were just rats with antlers. But even he had to stop the truck on the divide between Lander Creek and Little Sandy and gawk at the spectacle that unfolded before us that cold gray afternoon. 
We didn’t know it at the time — indeed, we wouldn’t know until 50 years later, when wildlife researcher Hall Sawyer opened our collective eyes — but we were witnessing the longest big game migration in the Lower 48. There were many more deer in the upper Green River country back in the mid-1960s, and the scope of this mass movement of mule deer was much greater. Thousands of deer were moving from summer ranges that extended all the way to eastern Idaho to a winter range in the desert east of Rock Springs. It was a wintertime Serengeti. 
They’ve probably been doing it for as long as their ancestors have been in the country. They leave the mountains beginning in October, moving along the west face of the Wind River Range, just about where the aspens meet the sagebrush. The does have fawns in tow, and it’s by this journey and their incredible memories that these young deer learn where to stop and rest, where to move quickly and how to surmount the obstacles in their way. Centuries ago, those obstacles were minimal. There were rivers to swim and predators to avoid or escape, but there were no fences or highways or 5-acre ranchettes.
That’s not the case now. These deer have a gauntlet of obstacles to face as they move south in the late fall, then back north in the spring. There are dozens of fences, including elk fences 8 feet tall. There are dozens of roads, some lightly travelled county roads and some high-volume paved highways. There are lakes and rivers, subdivisions and a host of other barriers. But the deer still find a way, with a little help from their friends. We’ve modified fences and created conservation easements. We’re building highway crossings and working with state, federal and private partners to keep this migration route intact. That’s the good news.
The bad news is President Donald Trump’s “national energy emergency” and the associated rush by the Department of Interior to lease parcels smack dab in the middle of this migration route for oil and gas development. For those of us who have been in the trenches of wildlife conservation in Wyoming, this is not our first rodeo. It’s not even our second or third. It’s just the latest one — the latest in a series of bad land management decisions driven by corporate interests and their friends in positions of political influence, the beneficiaries of their generous campaign contributions. When it comes to sacrificing mule deer to create corporate profit, we’re old hands here in Wyoming.
We sacrificed the deer on the New Fork Mesa — the Pinedale Anticline, to use its fossil fuel era moniker. They told us they could mitigate the damages. We sacrificed the country west of Baggs and south of Wamsutter. They told us the same thing, and it wasn’t true there either. We sacrificed the deer in the Powder River Basin to coal-bed methane and the mule deer of Star Valley to rural subdivisions. 
And the story was always the same: “We can mitigate it. They can move around it. We can impose stipulations to protect them and improve habitat off-site. Development doesn’t need to be bad for deer.” I have to say I was impressed recently with Steve Degenfelder from Kirkwood Oil and Gas. At least he was straight up honest when he said, “There’s no place that I’m going to say is a place that shouldn’t be leased.” I can grudgingly admire his chutzpah, if not his grasp of historical precedent.
Let me be very clear: I am definitely willing to say that there are places that shouldn’t be leased. There are places too special to convert from a deer migration route to a gas field. There are people like my family, four generations of Gassons, who believe that it’s more important to maintain this migration route than it is to add one more area to Wyoming’s long list of broken promises. No, Steve, there are indeed places that shouldn’t be leased, and this is damn sure one of them. 
Somewhere, on the other side of the Great Divide, Old Gus is looking at this and silently shaking his head in wonder.

(Laura Guido / Idaho Capital Sun)El-Ada Community Action Partnership has been operating since 1967 as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson’s declaration of War on Poverty. 
The nearly completely federally funded nonprofit, amid a grant shortfall and overall volatility with federal money, recently closed its Homedale food pantry. 
The southwestern Idaho food bank that had once served the city of about 3,000 residents was too expensive to maintain as a permanent physical location, said El-Ada CAP Executive Director Katrina Vincent. 
The organization on Nov. 18 began serving community members there with a mobile pantry, which will operate the first and third Tuesdays of each month. 
“We knew that we had to make a decision about our outer offices, just to be as efficient as we can,” Vincent said in an interview. “We’re committed to being good stewards of our taxpayer money, and we’re 98% federally funded. With our outer offices, and especially out in Homedale, we don’t serve a huge number of people to have it offset the cost of operating a brick and mortar location out there.”
The month that the nonprofit’s board considered the closure, the food pantry distributed 150 food boxes to Homedale residents, she said. It cost about $100,000 a year to operate the building. 
The nonprofit also provides assistance paying energy bills and for weatherization; the organization can still provide those services remotely to the community, Vincent said. 
 Federal Community Services Block Grant in question after $130,000 shortfall 

The organization uses the federal Community Services Block Grant to pay for much of its administrative costs, like rent and electricity. The money passes from the federal government to local organizations through the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
This year, the organization received about $130,000 less than the year before, Vincent said. While the state Health and Welfare officials indicated the group may get the rest of the grant funding later, Vincent said, no one could be sure. Congress must approve the funding quarter, she said. 
“As we’re doing our planning for program year 2026, they really couldn’t give us a definitive answer,” Vincent said. 
Closing the Homedale location was the “least impactful” decision that the organization could make, she said. 
The Homedale food pantry, located on Colorado Avenue, was closed in early November, amid spiking demand at Idaho food banks because of a pause on federal food assistance during the federal government shutdown.

El-Ada CAP Pantry Manager James Thompson said staff was met with a lot of concern from the community. 
“Today, we had a retirement community very concerned, the school district out there very concerned,” Thompson said in an interview earlier this month. “There were some tears.” 
He said some concerns were assuaged when residents were told that the mobile food bank would continue to travel there. 
Prior to the closure, the food bank operated 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Thursday outside a half-hour closure for lunch midday. The mobile pantry will still distribute food at the 15 W. Colorado Ave. address, now from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. the first and third Tuesdays of the month. 
The Owyhee County Mobile Pantry operates on the third Friday of each month from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. at 320 N. Sixth St. West in Homedale, and the Homedale Senior Citizens Center provides free meals for lunch around 12 p.m.  Tuesday through Thursday. The center recommends calling 208-337-3020 ahead to confirm hours, according to the Idaho Food Bank Food Assistance Locator.
 Other federal grants have been in flux amid DOGE and other Trump administration actions 

Over the spring, El-Ada CAP was one of a number of Idaho food banks affected by canceled shipments by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Orders that would’ve contained more than 370,000 pounds of products from American farmers, destined for food pantries statewide, were canceled, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.

A grant that goes toward helping residents in need with their heating bills, called the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and another that assists with weatherization for low-income households, were both in question earlier this year. 
In April, the administration under President Donald Trump fired the entire staff who administer the LIHEAP program, PBS reported.
The programs are reimbursable, meaning El-Ada Cap pays for the assistance and then gets eligible costs reimbursed through the federal grants. 
During the shakeup at the federal agency, reimbursement for El-Ada CAP’s program took six months, Vincent said. During that time, there was no guarantee the funding would ever come through, she said. 
“It’s been a precarious year, but because people have to have electricity and our programs help so many people, “ Vincent said, “we’re just kind of taking it day by day and being as efficient as we can.”

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Wisconsin State Senate passed SB 553 on Tuesday, Nov. 18, in their last floor session of the year. This bill, purportedly written to define abortion, is actually a covert attempt to exclude abortion from the broader scope of reproductive healthcare. 
Anti-abortion legislators pushing this bill are attempting to play to their religious base who voted them into office to promote an anti-abortion agenda. This is a failing strategy, however, when we’ve seen in countless elections around the country that abortion access is a winning issue, including in Wisconsin. 
The bigger problem, though, is how proponents of the bill are describing it as a way to allow physicians to safely provide care and clarify abortion restrictions, by excluding medical procedures intended to save a person’s life, such as C-sections, the removal of dead embryos, and treatment for ectopic pregnancy, to name a few, from the definition of “abortion.”
Lawmakers are misleading people into thinking that this bill will further define the nuances of care that physicians provide and actually allow, rather than restrict, the provision of care. 
This could not be farther from the truth. We have too many examples nationwide of physicians practicing in states hostile to reproductive rights who are unsure about what care is legal to provide, ultimately leading to unnecessary delays in caring for pregnant people. It is telling that physicians who provide miscarriage and abortion care were not called on to write the text of this legislation. 
Nationally, we have already seen pregnant people die preventable deaths while waiting for essential care for early pregnancy complications because lawmakers stirred confusion and meddled in healthcare decisions. This bill will amplify those dangers in our state, where 13.2 people out of 100,000 die in pregnancy, childbirth, or 42 days after termination of a pregnancy. A study by researchers at the University of Washington and Massachusetts General Hospital showed that these trends, across race, have been worsening in Wisconsin since 2010. 
Black birthing people in Wisconsin account for a disproportionate amount of the disparities in maternal mortality. Adding these racial and systemic inequities to a bill that will delay care for folks across the board, it’s nearly guaranteed that certain groups will have a greater share of these poor outcomes.
As a family medicine and obstetrics physician, I care for folks across the entire spectrum of pregnancy — including miscarriage and abortion. I want to emphasize the similarities in those two scenarios and how they significantly overlap. 
The procedure performed for abortion is identical to the procedure performed for a miscarriage. When a person has a miscarriage or an abortion in the first trimester, generally, a procedure called a “manual vacuum aspiration” or “MVA” can be performed to remove the pregnancy contents. For miscarriages or abortions that occur later in pregnancy, the procedure involves dilating the cervix and removing the pregnancy via a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) or dilation and evacuation (D&E), based on gestational age. 
Additionally, when managing a miscarriage with medications, physicians use mifepristone and misoprostol — medications that lawmakers and anti-abortion activists are actively seeking to restrict because they’re used identically in first-trimester abortions. 
That is the underlying, root issue here: amplifying and reinforcing stigma and criminalization around abortion. 
Carving out the definition of abortion doesn’t actually create medical clarity for providers; instead, it creates a stigmatizing health care space where patients have to disclose and justify why they need certain essential health care. People deserve care and compassion, not judgment or punishment. 
Whether due to miscarriage, abortion, or self-managed abortion, pregnancy loss is not a crime. People should not fear jail time for getting the health care they need. SB 553 aims to differentiate abortion based on intent — a dystopian concept where politicians are in the private space of a doctor’s office. Wisconsinites currently have an opportunity to combat this stigma and call out politicians who are actively harming patients and the patient/provider relationship. 
In my practice already I have seen patients who are hesitant to disclose their pregnancy history for fear that sharing a history of needing abortion care could get them in trouble. Imagine how that influences future decisions to engage with health care providers around miscarriage, abortion and pregnancy complications. 
Wisconsin already heavily regulates how medications for miscarriage are prescribed, including a mandatory in-person dispensing requirement. Those of us who offer this care should not need to feel we must pit our medical expertise against legal jargon when it comes to providing normal, essential care. We need people to be able to trust their health care providers, and we need politicians to stop making laws that pigeonhole physicians into even narrower definitions of care. 
Now that this dangerous bill has been passed in the Senate, it will next head to the Assembly before ultimately landing on Gov. Tony Evers’ desk. In his seven years in office Evers has consistently vetoed anti-abortion legislation, and he has vowed to veto any bill that would limit access to abortion, including SB 553. 
As a physician, it’s devastating to rely on a single individual to preserve my ability to practice safe and necessary health care for countless people and families across the state without political interference. 
There is no other type of health care that is regulated in the unique, stigmatizing, harmful way that abortion care is. Our state politicians need to understand that health care decisions should remain between a patient and their trusted provider. SB 553 ignores that and should not become law.

An hour later, the 19-year-old college student stood on the sidewalk outside alone, blinking back tears.
“They took my mom,” he said.
Yanim Lopez, Cogco’s mother, was one of five people detained at the courthouse after answering a summons to appear at the regular Wednesday General Sessions Court “trooper docket” reserved for traffic offenses.
All five appeared before a judge and paid their fines before being ushered into a private room, out of view. 
They reemerged about 15 minutes later, led single-file out the building’s front door by masked individuals in plain clothes who ignored a reporter’s question asking which agency employed them. All five, including Cogco’s mom, were restrained in leg shackles and handcuffs secured to chains around their waists. They were placed in a waiting white van.

Lopez is now in the custody of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she told her son in a phone call on her way to a Knoxville detention center later in the day. She said she was asked if she would voluntarily agree to be “self-deported” to Mexico, but refused. On Saturday, Lopez was transferred to a Louisiana detention facility after being denied the right to post bond, Cogco said.
“I want to bawl my eyes out, but I’ve got to stay calm for my little sister,” who is 12, Cogco said at the courthouse. 
Lopez, 38, was in the process of obtaining a “U visa” reserved for domestic violence and other crime victims when she received a citation for driving without a license, he said. Originally from Mexico, Lopez has lived in the United States since she was six-years-old, he said. 
Immigrants without legal status are ineligible to obtain a valid Tennessee drivers’ license.
In Robertson County, similar scenes of mass arrests have taken place on four or five different occasions in recent weeks immediately following the Wednesday trooper dockets, according to Roger Neil, the county’s public defender.
The practice has troubled local immigrant advocates and attorneys, who report witnessing similar arrests after misdemeanor traffic court appearances inside the Wilson County Courthouse in October. 
“All Tennesseans should be able to expect to be treated fairly when they show up to traffic court,” said Spring Miller, attorney for the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition.
“It is shameful that our local public spaces are being commandeered in service of the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, and in the long run it will make us all less safe.”
Heightened immigration enforcement in courthouses
The Trump administration in January ended a policy limiting immigration arrests in state and county courts.
In May, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Todd Lyons issued a memo citing advantages of making arrests inside civil and criminal court buildings that have already screened for weapons. 
Since then, reports of immigration detentions in courthouses around the country have increased, even as some Democratic-led states have challenged them.

Deportations of immigrants without legal status whose only offenses are traffic related have surged during the second Trump administration, according to the Marshall Project. The news organization reported the monthly number of people deported whose most serious offense was a traffic violation more than tripled in the first six months of this year. 
Whether federal immigration enforcement officials were alerted ahead of time to the immigration status of those scheduled to appear on the Robertson County traffic docket is unknown. 
A Robertson County clerk said she had received no requests from ICE about individuals scheduled to be in court. 
In Wilson County, the court clerk’s office sends daily docket lists to multiple agencies, including ICE, a practice that has been in place for several years, according to Kim Stewart, executive chief deputy.
‘Left this in God’s hands’
Cogco and his mother nearly left after seeing a white van parked near the court’s entrance when they arrived for the 9 a.m. hearing.
“We saw the van, and we were thinking of turning around. But if nothing happened, then she gets a warrant for arrest,” he said. 
“We were worried, but we just went ahead and left this in God’s hands to make sure she’s alright.”
Cogco’s mother, who cleans homes for a living, had been ticketed for driving without a license on her way home to Nashville from visiting relatives in Robertson County, he said.

Inside the courtroom, Robertson County General Sessions Judge Joel Perry called up individuals one by one to answer for traffic violations that included speeding more than 20 miles over the limit, using a cell phone while driving and driving without a license.
Lopez pleaded guilty to the driving-without-a-license violation, receiving the same penalty Perry meted out repeatedly that morning: a $50 fine, $10 in court fees, online traffic school and eight hours of community service on the county’s “trash van.”
“Take a seat in the front,” he instructed Lopez, directing her to sit beside others who had also just pleaded guilty to traffic violations.
Less than an hour into the hearing, with Lopez and four others who would soon be detained seated in front of the courtroom, Perry called a recess and left the room. 
A uniformed officer stepped into the courtroom and called out the names of Lopez and others seated beside her. The group was then escorted out to a pay window to pay their fines.
Perry did not respond to a message left with his office last week seeking information about his role in Wednesday’s detentions.
Lopez followed the court deputy to a payment window in the court’s hallway. After paying her fine, Lopez was escorted by an officer to another room, out of public view.
Cogco caught a brief glimpse of what happened next. 
“They took her to the room, and I couldn’t understand,” he said. “But then I saw that they had the handcuffs, and that’s when I knew.”
“All she said was ‘just to take care of my sister, let my family know, and just take care of my little sister,’” Cogco said. 
Lopez was last in the line of five detainees escorted in a line out the entrance door of the Robertson County courthouse about 15 minutes later in leg restraints and handcuffs, escorted by five plain-clothed individuals wearing neck masks hiked up to cover their nose and mouths.
Asked where their detainees were being taken, one masked woman responded “Homeland Security in Nashville. You can follow us if you want.”
‘It’s only me and my sisters’
Aurora Leao, 46, in court for a ticket for driving without a license, also emerged in the line of chained and shackled detainees brought to the white van.
Elizabeth Leao, her 21-year-old daughter, could barely speak between heaving sobs as she stood in the courthouse parking lot, trying to reach family members on her phone. 
“Oh God,” she said, sobbing uncontrollably.
“I wasn’t even expecting this,” she said. “I really thought that nothing was going to happen. It’s only me and my sisters.”

Aurora Leao, originally from Mexico, has lived in the United States for 22 years, her daughter said. She phoned her daughter later on Wednesday to say she was detained in Knoxville, Elizabeth Leao said.
“I’m not sure how long they’ll have her there before possibly being transferred to Louisiana,” Elizabeth Leao wrote via text Thursday. “I’m trying to find an attorney but it (is) hard to know which one to go with and if I should wait for her to be transferred and get a hearing there,” 
A spokesperson for ICE on Thursday declined to answer questions about the Robertson County courthouse arrests, citing “operational security.”
“As part of its routine operations, ICE arrests aliens who commit crimes and other individuals who have violated our nation’s immigration laws,” Angelina Vicknair, the spokesperson, wrote in an emailed response.
“All aliens in violation of U.S. immigration law may be subject to arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States, regardless of nationality,” she wrote.

All five of the individuals detained, including Leao and Lopez, had entered guilty pleas to driving offenses before being detained, adding a criminal mark to their record just before their immigration arrests.
Driving without a license is a misdemeanor criminal offense. So, too, are most traffic offenses in Tennessee, unlike most other states that classify traffic offenses as civil infractions, said Jerry Gonzalez, a Nashville criminal defense attorney unconnected to the Robertson County Court detentions last week.
“After they plead guilty to a traffic offense, the government can legitimately say they are ‘criminals’” he said.

Indiana’s Medicaid agency currently considers Brader “medically frail,” giving her access to an expanded set of benefits. (Chris Bergin for KFF Health News)Eliza Brader worries she soon will need to prove she’s working to continue receiving Medicaid health coverage. She doesn’t think she should have to.
The 27-year-old resident of Bloomington, Indiana, has a pacemaker and a painful joint disease. She also has fused vertebrae in her neck from a spinal injury, preventing her from turning her head.
Indiana’s Medicaid agency currently considers Brader “medically frail,” giving her access to an expanded set of benefits, such as physical therapy.
New federal rules will require more than 18 million Medicaid enrollees nationwide to show they’re working, volunteering, or going to school for 80 hours a month starting in 2027 to keep their coverage. Brader is exempt as long as she’s deemed medically frail.
But lacking sufficient federal guidance, states are wrestling with how to define medical frailty — a consequential decision that could cut Medicaid coverage for many people, said state officials, consumer advocates, and health policy researchers.
“It’s terrifying,” Brader said. “I already have fought so hard to get my health care.”
‘Incredibly High’ Stakes
President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act slashes nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over the next decade, with much of the savings projected to come from no longer covering those who don’t qualify under the new work rules. Those spending cuts help offset the costs of GOP priorities, such as extra border security and tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthy.
Conservative lawmakers have argued that Medicaid, the government health insurance program for people with low incomes or with disabilities, has grown too large and expensive, especially in the wake of its expansion to more low-income adults under the Affordable Care Act. They also say that requiring participants to work is common sense.
The work rules in Trump’s tax-and-spending law offer exemptions for several groups who might struggle to meet them, including people deemed “medically frail.” The law spells out certain “medically frail” conditions such as blindness, disability, and substance use disorder. But it does not list many others.
Senators send Medicaid work requirements to governor’s desk

Instead, the law exempts those with a “serious or complex medical condition,” a term whose interpretation could vary by state. 
State officials say they need more clarity to ensure that people who cannot work for health reasons retain rightful access to Medicaid. They also worry that, even with a clear definition, people will face the onerous task of having to regularly vouch for being medically frail, which is a challenge without reliable access to medical care.
“The stakes are incredibly high,” said Kinda Serafi, a partner at consulting firm Manatt Health.
The new work requirements will affect Medicaid recipients in 42 states and Washington, D.C. Eight states — Alabama, Florida, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming — did not expand their Medicaid programs to cover additional low-income adults, so they won’t have to implement the work rules.
The Medicaid work rules are expected to be the largest driver of health insurance coverage losses over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Forty-four percent of all adults covered by states’ expanded Medicaid programs have at least one chronic health condition, according to KFF.
A Challenge for States
State Medicaid agencies are scrambling to implement the rules with little direction from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has yet to issue specific guidance. Federal officials will clarify the “medically frail” definition next year, said Andrew Nixon, an agency spokesperson.
Ultimately, states will have to decide who is unhealthy enough to be exempt from work rules. And it won’t be easy for state workers and their computer systems to track.
Every year, state eligibility systems screen millions of applicants to check if they qualify for Medicaid and other government programs. Now, these same systems must screen applicants and existing enrollees to determine whether they meet the new work rules. 
Jessica Kahn, a partner at consulting firm McKinsey & Co., has urged states to start planning how to adapt eligibility systems to verify work status. States can do a “tremendous amount” of work without direction from the federal government, said Kahn, a former federal Medicaid systems official, who spoke during a recent Medicaid advisory panel hearing. “Time is a-wasting already.”
State Medicaid directors are pondering the challenge.
“Medical frailty gets so complex,” Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director, said during a recent panel discussion. Conditions that can keep people from working, such as mental health disorders, can be hard to prove, she said.
A state might try to use a person’s health records, for instance, to determine medical frailty. But a patient’s chart may not paint a clear picture of someone’s health, especially if they lack regular access to medical care.
It’s a tall order for eligibility systems that historically have not had to scrape medical records to screen applicants, said Serafi of Manatt Health.










That is an incredibly new thing that eligibility enrollment systems are just not fluent in at all.


– Don't forget to add author


Lobbying groups for the private health insurance companies that help run Medicaid in many states also have urged federal regulators to clearly define medical frailty so it can be applied uniformly.
In a Nov. 3 letter to federal officials, the Medicaid Health Plans of America and the Association for Community Affiliated Plans advocated for allowing enrollees to qualify for the exemption by saying on their applications that they have conditions that make them medically frail. Successfully implementing exemptions for the medically frail will be “crucial” given the “severe health risks of coverage loss for these populations,” the groups said.
Some state officials worry about unintended consequences of the work rules for people with chronic conditions.
Jennifer Strohecker, who recently resigned as Utah’s Medicaid director, reiterated the high stakes, especially for those with diabetes on Medicaid. They may be very healthy and functional with insulin, but if they fail to complete the work requirements, that may change, Strohecker said during a recent Medicaid advisory hearing. 
Whether someone is deemed medically frail already depends heavily on where they live.
For example, in Arkansas, people indicate on their Medicaid applications that they’re disabled, blind, or need help with daily living activities.
Approximately 6% of the roughly 221,000 people enrolled in Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program are deemed medically frail, according to Gavin Lesnick, a spokesperson for the Arkansas Department of Human Services.
In West Virginia, the state accepts a medical frailty designation when an applicant self-reports it.

The burden of proof is higher in North Dakota. Applicants there must answer a questionnaire about their health and submit additional documentation, which may include medical chart notes and treatment plans. More than half of applicants were denied last year, according to Health and Human Services Department spokesperson Mindy Michaels.
Indiana’s Family and Social Services Administration, which runs its Medicaid program, declined an interview and said it could not comment on individual cases, like Brader’s.
Brader worries the additional red tape will cause her to lose Medicaid again. She said she was temporarily kicked off the program in 2019 for failing to meet the state’s work rules when Indiana said her work-study job didn’t count as employment.
“Anytime I have tried to receive help from the state of Indiana, it has been a bureaucratic nightmare,” she said.
As states await federal guidance, Kristi Putnam, a senior fellow at the conservative Cicero Institute and former secretary of the Arkansas Department of Human Services, which oversees the state Medicaid program, said even if a state creates an extensive list of qualifying “medically frail” conditions, the line must be drawn somewhere.
“You can’t possibly create a policy for exemptions that will catch everything,” she said.

Greg Tehven, chair of the Grand Farm board, said the top priority is building up the facilities and infrastructure on the research campus west of Casselton.
“It increases our capacity for more testing of technology for farmers, more partners to engage, the ability to have more trials on site and deeper collaboration with both public and private sector,” Tehven said.

The funding is through the state Commerce Department’s Autonomous Agriculture Grant Program. The state Legislature in 2021 made $10 million in federal funds available for the program. Grand Farm was the sole recipient of that grant round. 
The money helped build the first building at Grand Farm, a 25,000-square-foot Innovation Shop. 
This year, there were 16 applications for $7.5 million made available by the Legislature.
In addition to Grand Farm, the Commerce Department awarded $500,000 to Kansas-based Greenfield Robotics. The company is developing robots to control weeds without using herbicides. 
It is one of the companies that have participated in Grand Farm autonomous technology demonstrations. 
Robotic weeding, using drones and incorporating data from soil sensors and images to feed into artificial intelligence are some of the components of autonomous farming. The state also has provided money for a program to use drones to scout for weeds. 
“We anticipate more application of artificial intelligence solutions that can keep our farms efficient, financially healthy, safe and allow our producers to have the best tool possible to do what’s best for their farm,” said Tehven, co-founder of Emerging Prairie, a Fargo-based technology company. 
Grand Farm celebrates first building to foster ag innovation

Miki Miheguli is the director of agronomy and research at the North Dakota Soybean Council who served on a committee that evaluated the grant applications.
“From field-scale research to the infrastructure that enables commercialization, these strategic investments drive cutting-edge technology development and accelerate its real-world adoption, ensuring North Dakota remains at the forefront of agricultural innovation,” Miheguli said in a news release. 
Tehven said Grand Farm now has about 80 ag industry partners such as AGCO and North Dakota State University. 
 He said the next phase of development will help that grow. 
“This allows us to attract companies’ investments and deeper research activity right here in our backyard,” Tehven said.

	The most extreme disruptions will likely be felt by Coloradans who purchase coverage on Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace established under the Affordable Care Act. Because of the nonrenewal of enhanced premium tax credits by the Republican-controlled Congress, average premiums for marketplace plans are set to double as of Jan. 1, according to state estimates released last month.
Roughly 285,000 Coloradans purchase their health coverage from one of six insurers that offer plans on the individual marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act to serve consumers who are self-employed or otherwise don’t receive insurance from their employers.
But the millions of Coloradans insured through an employer-sponsored plan could also be affected. Health benefit costs for employers are expected to rise by an average of 9% in 2026, according to a survey by consulting firm Mercer.
That’s the largest increase in 15 years, and it’s likely to cause many employers to change to higher-deductible plans, require employees to cover a greater share of premiums, or cease to provide insurance for some or all of their employees altogether. Nearly 60% of employers told Mercer that they plan to take cost-cutting measures on health benefits in 2026.

There are also storm clouds on the horizon for Health First Colorado, the state’s Medicaid program, which serves about 1.1 million lower-income Coloradans. The impacts of the nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts passed by congressional Republicans in 2025 will be phased in over the next several years, with the biggest disruptions likely to come in January 2027. But the state is already scrambling to deal with ballooning Medicaid costs and state revenue shortfalls resulting from the GOP tax cut and spending law enacted in July. Gov. Jared Polis’ proposed 2026 budget would reduce projected Medicaid spending by $330 million through measures like a cap on dental benefits.
Lower-income Coloradans and people in rural areas could bear the brunt of the immediate fallout in 2026. But state officials and health policy experts say that the consequences of lost coverage — overall, nearly 200,000 people in Colorado are projected to become uninsured as a result of Republican policy changes — will be felt by everyone.
“They’re still going to get sick, they’re still going to end up in the hospital — that’s going to drive uncompensated care,” Michael Conway, the Colorado insurance commissioner, said of people who lose their insurance during a town hall in October. “That uncompensated care in hospitals, that’s going to be transferred out into the entirety of the marketplace.”
“There isn’t a corner of our health care system that is going to be safe from the impact of the loss of these subsidies,” he added.

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Last week there was some hopeful communication from Washington, D.C., for our agricultural communities in southeast Idaho. 
In a video-taped message, reported by the Idaho Falls Post Register on Nov. 14, U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, spoke about farm labor needs to southeast Idaho dairymen and farmers who gathered in Idaho Falls to discuss agricultural labor shortages in Idaho. 
Idaho U.S. Sens. Risch, Crapo join request for more guest visas to support seasonal workforce 

“Simpson spoke about the current Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2025 bill in the U.S. House that aims to stabilize the agricultural workforce by providing a path to legal status for current farmworkers, reforming the H-2A guest worker program and mandating a national E-Verify system for agricultural employment,” the Post Register reported.
Currently, the H-2A program provides temporary work visas for individuals coming to the U.S. as seasonal or temporary (less than one year) workers in the agricultural industry. Extensions to these visa times are possible when emergency labor shortages occur. There are many problems with the current system; the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 3227) will address some of the most pressing issues.
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 3227) was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on May 7, 2025. The bill has not been voted on as of Nov. 15, 2025. 
This bill is a positive step forward for those involved in agriculture both because of its substance and the process it will create. Rep. Simpson said in his video-taped message that passing this bill is currently one of his most important goals. 
A little background: In 2022, the USDA commissioned a study to understand the problems within the H-2A system from the perspectives of employers and employees. The United Farmworkers were contracted to do this research, and they subsequently came out in support of H.R. 3227 when it was submitted to the House on May 7, 2025.
According to the USDA study, for employers — the cost of working within the H-2A system program is a significant barrier. At each stage of hiring from abroad, the employer pays fees and completes large amounts of bureaucratic paperwork; the system is slow and costly. Employers also stated that changes need to be made to the E-Verify system of identity verification to make the process more reliable and easier to navigate. 
Employers interviewed for the USDA study also noted the need for year-round visas. This kind of visa would be very useful for the dairy industry in states like Idaho, since cows need to be milked year-round, among other industry-specific circumstances. Currently there is not a visa for foreign born workers to be hired to work year-round. 
The H-2A system was created with the idea of a migrant workforce moving between different harvests as the need arose. This conceptualization of farm work is out of date; technology and mechanization have created significant changes in the industry over the decades since this program was put in place. Vegetable packing plants, meat-processing plants and associated transportation and service jobs all are necessary parts of “agriculture.” Work visas need to reflect this changing labor needs. 
For employees interviewed for the study, some problems with the current H-2A system include the need for families to be able to work and live in the U.S. together, as families — thus, the need for a family-based visa option. The agricultural workers interviewed for this study also cited the need for affordable and safe housing, fair wages and a path toward citizenship based on years of employment. Long-term employment is a goal of most individuals as is settling in a community, raising kids and being a contributing member of society. 
The substance of the Farm Workforce Modernization Act (H.R. 3227) addresses ways to start fixing many of the issues that were identified for employees and employers in the agricultural sector. 
The process of implementing H.R. 3227 would, importantly, = create the basis for dialogue between employers and employees at a time when our nation is seeing a rise in immigration surveillance and detention and increased strife between different sectors of our communities. 
Having the various stakeholders from the agricultural community, employers and employees and other community members sitting down and working together to implement changes such as those outlined in the Farm Workforce Modernization Act is a process that will require effort and acts of trust from everyone. This dialogue, with concrete results, could be a way forward out of the increasingly polarized and confrontational encounters that we are seeing in our communities in Idaho and across the nation. 
Working toward common goals is a way forward for our Idaho agricultural communities to create better, more productive work and living situations for all.

Mississippi regulators, though, aren’t monitoring air emissions from those 18 turbines because they fall into a “temporary-mobile” category.","SOUTHAVEN – Jason Haley, who’s lived in his Southaven home for the last two decades, in August started to hear a whirring, mechanical noise from outside that sounded like a leaf blower. 
The noise would go on for days at a time and through the night, he told Mississippi Today. He soon realized the sounds were coming from a cluster of natural gas turbines about a half mile away.
Over the summer, billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company set up shop in north Mississippi, erecting dozens of turbines on the site of a former power plant to fuel two data centers just up the road in Memphis. 
In 2024, the company, xAI, finished construction on the first center, Colossus, which it claims houses the “world’s biggest supercomputer.” Colossus holds over 200,000 computer chips powering the AI chatbot Grok. The company is now building the second iteration, Colossus II, near the Mississippi state line. To help power the operation, xAI planted 59 natural gas turbines in Southaven. 
Eighteen turbines are currently running, as the company awaits permit approval through the state for the remainder. Mississippi regulators, though, aren’t monitoring air emissions from those 18 turbines because they fall into a “temporary-mobile” category. 
The designation means they aren’t subject to air emissions oversight as long as they operate for less than a year, state regulators told Mississippi Today. The Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality said it adopted standards used by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
But some, including people living near the Southaven power generators, disagreed with MDEQ’s approach and argued a lack of enforcement and transparency will force them to breathe unsafe air. 
“This isn’t some far away industrial site, this is smack in the middle of a suburban area,” said lifelong Southaven resident Shannon Samsa. She is especially worried about the impact of particulates from the turbines on kids at the multiple schools within a 3-mile radius from the plant.
Debate over EPA air pollution rules
Natural gas turbines are considered cleaner than coal but still release air pollutants such as nitrous oxides and particulate matter. Exposure to those can lead to heart and lung complications, the EPA says.
Amanda Garcia, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, argued MDEQ’s basis for allowing the temporary turbines to run without permits is flawed and violates the federal Clean Air Act. The turbines fall under the EPA’s “New Source Performance Standards” and need to be treated as a “stationary” source, she argued.
“While (the EPA) hasn’t weighed in directly, they’ve made pretty clear their interpretation is these large combustion turbines are subject to New Source Performance Standards, which means they need to get a permit,” said Garcia, who also led litigation from the NAACP over temporary turbines xAI placed in Memphis. 
Last year, Garcia’s group made the same argument to officials in Shelby County, where Memphis is located, over xAI needing permits for the generators. In January, the company finally applied for permits for its Memphis turbines, and then moved others to Mississippi, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
The Memphis metropolitan area, which includes Southaven, already has smog-pollution levels that surpass federal standards, Garcia said. 
“One of our big concerns was that this huge unpermitted installation of gas turbines had become the largest source of smog forming pollution in Shelby County, and we have the same concern about the installation in Southaven,” she said. 
Last December, the EPA proposed amending emissions standards for different types of turbines. In a statement to Mississippi Today, the EPA did not address whether MDEQ had properly applied current federal standards. 
“EPA is working expeditiously to issue a final rule,” said the agency. 
The EPA statement also criticized Democratic members of Congress over the recently ended government shutdown, saying the “Democrat shutdown disrupted critical functions of our agency and others across the federal government.”
When asked for a response to Garcia’s argument over EPA’s standards, MDEQ replied in an e-mail to Mississippi Today, “It would not be appropriate for MDEQ to engage in a legal debate through this means.”
Residents yet to see noise mitigation
Haley, living near the turbines, said he hopes something can be done to limit the noise. The temporary turbines have another nine months before they reach their one-year limit. 
“I can’t live here like this for another nine months. It’s going to drive me crazy,” Haley said, adding he’s filed noise complaints, talked with the police department and emailed the mayor. 
Friends suggested he sell his house and move. He likes his house and worries about his neighbors who aren’t in a financial position to move. But if the noise continues, he believes he might not have a choice. 
In a Nov. 19 email to Mississippi Today, Southaven Mayor Darren Musselwhite said, “The noise is mostly temporary construction noise that will go away within days. xAI has assured the City that any and all necessary adjustments will be made within days to mitigate any noise and not negatively impact surrounding developments and neighborhoods in any way.”
A Mississippi Today reporter recorded sounds at 7 p.m. on Nov. 12 of a constant loud humming noise easily heard from homes in the Colonial Hills subdivision of Southaven half a mile from the xAI power plant. Reporters also reviewed recordings by Southaven residents of similar sounds heard on different dates.
When Samsa heard that xAI would be operating a power plant two miles from her home, she was willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. She’d heard about environmental concerns surrounding xAI’s data centers in Memphis, where residents have pushed for stricter air quality monitoring.
Samsa remembers thinking that after everything that happened in Memphis, public officials would take steps to protect Southaven residents. While Musselwhite has assured the generators will have a “very low” environmental risk, she’s found the lack of public information around the turbines’ impacts worrying. 
“If a project is truly healthy and safe, why not be transparent about it,” Samsa said. 
The 41 permanent turbines will have a maximum generation capacity of 1,200 megawatts, while the temporary generators will only be able to reach about 400 megawatts, MDEQ told Mississippi Today in an email. 
While notifying xAI that the temporary turbines fall into a special criteria precluding them from emissions limits, MDEQ in a July letter “implored” the company to “operate … in a manner that minimizes the emission” of nitrous oxides and particulate matter.
“In conversations we’ve had with (xAI), I think they have the right intentions,” MDEQ director Chris Wells later told Mississippi Today. 
Mississippi Today reached out to xAI with questions about emission controls and noise complaints and received what appeared to be an automated message that said, “Legacy Media Lies.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/20094651/AP25128659328597.jpg,,,2025-11-24 06:57:03.498080

A federal judge has declined to block ongoing book bans at one of Tennessee’s largest school districts before a full trial next year.
In April, after months of heated school board meetings and district schools pulling more than 140 books from library shelves, three high school students sued the Rutherford County Board of Education. The students, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, argued in initial filings the book bans violated their First Amendment rights and disadvantaged students by blocking them from accessing “crucial, acclaimed, and historical works.”
Judge Eli Richardson denied a preliminary injunction this week, declining to block the district from limiting access to books until the full trial plays out and indicating that the defendants have an uphill battle in the case.
“Here, the Board (or for that matter the State writ large) has not prohibited students from reading the books or acquiring them elsewhere; instead it has merely opted not to carry them on school library bookshelves,” Richardson wrote.
Attorneys for both parties declined to comment on the ruling on Thursday.
The Rutherford County case, which also includes the literary and free expression group PEN America as a plaintiff, is the first legal challenge to Tennessee’s expanded school book statute in 2024 that culled hundreds of books from school shelves.
Rutherford County book removals include “Beloved,” a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the horrors of American slavery that includes depictions of sexual violence, and “Catch-22,” a satirical World War II novel. Both books have been recommended in Advanced Placement literature classes curricula in previous years.
The Republican-backed legislature used a state obscenity law to prohibit any school material that “in whole or in part contains descriptions or depictions of sexual excitement, sexual conduct, excess violence, or sadomasochistic abuse” or is “patently offensive.”
But guidance for interpreting the law was limited when schools were required to implement it last fall. Critics wondered if books depicting classic art with nude figures or books about puberty education could be included in the ban and questioned who gets to define “excess” violence or offensive content. The ACLU of Tennessee warned the law would be wielded by some who wanted to ban books that address race, racism, LGBTQ+ rights, and marginalized groups.
Other removals in Rutherford County include “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” a popular young adult novel in which a supporting character is gay, and “Wicked,” the popular retelling of Wizard of Oz.
A 2024 survey of members of the Tennessee Association of School Librarians found that more than 1,100 titles were removed in just a few months, as schools grappled with how to interpret the newly expanded law. PEN America named Tennessee as among the top 3 states with the largest number of book bans in the last school year.
A review in The Tennessean earlier this year found book removals surged in the past year, with 1,155 unique titles either fully removed from school libraries or heavily age-restricted between December 2023 and January 2025.
A full trial in the Rutherford County case is not expected to begin until next fall.
