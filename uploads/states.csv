When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

(Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)During her tenure as the governor of South Dakota, Kristi Noem liked to remind legislators at budget time that the money they were dealing with was not their own. 
From a 2019 address to the Legislature: “I’m committed to maintaining the fiscal integrity for which our state is known. We won’t spend money we don’t have. We will not raise taxes.”
From 2022: “I recognize that taxpayer dollars are not our own — they belong to the people of South Dakota. We all must remember throughout our budget discussions that this money belongs to the hard-working people of South Dakota.”
From 2025: “During my time as governor, I have always kept my budget proposals focused on our people, not government programs. After all, this is the people’s money. They entrust it to us and expect us to spend it wisely and responsibly.”

Those are good reminders that legislators should take to heart. However, it seems that Noem was just reading from the teleprompter rather than paying attention to her own advice. Recently Noem’s actions with taxpayer dollars were the topic of discussion on a couple of fronts. 
A South Dakota Searchlight story noted that the Government Operations and Audit Committee in Pierre was trying to get answers about how Noem rang up $750,000 on her state credit card during her six years as governor. Noem admonished lawmakers to look out for the way taxpayer dollars were spent while she was racking up travel expenses on a book tour, a Canadian hunting excursion and various out-of-state political trips to tout the hopes of Republican candidates, including Donald Trump. 
Who’s to say if South Dakota will ever have another governor like Noem who became the darling of the Republican Party for her reaction to the pandemic. During her many travels, she was quick to praise South Dakota’s maskless response to the pandemic and just as quick to label as fake news anyone who dared point out that the state was leading the league in per capita COVID-19 deaths. 
Lawmakers on the committee learned that under the current laws, there isn’t much that state bookkeepers can do when called on to cover a governor’s credit card expenses. They can question a credit card charge, but if it isn’t then handled voluntarily by the elected official, the state has to pay. 
Basically, the current law treats elected officials like adults. As adults, those officials should know when the people should pay and when they should reach into their own wallets to cover any expense that doesn’t directly have anything to do with their elected positions. Given the example Noem set, lawmakers who took her advice about fiscal integrity seriously are now faced with proposing legislation that calls for creating some sort of credit card overseer or nanny. That’s a move that wouldn’t be needed if Noem’s credit card use was more statesmanlike instead of resembling a sailor on leave. 
Another Searchlight story published on the same day chronicled Noem’s appearance before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security. At the meeting, Noem had it pointed out that her new department has budget problems. 
“Your department is out of control,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. “You are running out of money.”
Given that Noem has been given responsibility for Trump’s signature issue — immigration control — it would certainly be a bad look for the president if the department charged with rounding up illegal immigrants ran out of funds before the end of the fiscal year. Fiscal restraint may be the order of the day as Noem works for a man who changes Cabinet secretaries the way other presidents changed their socks. 
For her part, Noem doesn’t seem like she’s pinching pennies, spending $100 million on TV commercials that praise Trump policies and warn immigrants not to come to the United States illegally. 
She has also unveiled a plan to offer $1,000 in “travel assistance” to illegal immigrants who self-deport. The cost of that could be as much as $1 billion if Trump reaches his goal of deporting 1 million people. Those hardly seem like the actions of someone who has been entrusted by taxpayers to spend their funds “wisely and responsibly.”
All of Noem’s budget guidance for South Dakota lawmakers should have come with another bit of helpful advice: Do as I say, not as I do.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.
The federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.
The agency said there was a 60 percent chance of an above-normal season, a 30 percent chance of a near-normal season and a 10 percent chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.

The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30.
“We’re ready here at NOAA,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, Louisiana, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. “Are you?”
NOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.
Forecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms—including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125 percent of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.
By comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130 percent of an average season’s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.
The Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51 percent chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26 percent chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33 percent chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56 percent chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.
The season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.
“Uncertainty is not great,” said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science. “It just adds another layer of stress. That isn’t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.”
As much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA’s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.
“If you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,” he said. “So we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.”
No changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael “Mac” McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.
“There are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,” McAlister said, referring to Kermit. “The wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets, because of the data they provide.”
No one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year’s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Normally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.
“I’m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn’t at that conference,” Fugate said.
NOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.
“We are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “We are really making this a top priority for the administration.”
Kim Doster, the agency’s communications director, added in a statement, “in the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
Meanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be “in the best interest of the American people.” His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained “steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.”
But during Trump’s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA’s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must “recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.” The order called on state and local governments and individuals to “play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.”
In April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.
Nonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.
“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” the statement reads. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.
“We’re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,” said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. “We’re nimble. We’re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don’t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.”
But state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state’s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.
He said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.
Even more cuts could be coming
Trump’s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.
An earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA’s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.
The Trump administration’s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,” according to the document. “Passback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.”
Project 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.
“We’re just providing as accurate information as we can,” said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. “Hopefully we can get back to that, but it’s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.”
In central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida’s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.
The agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.
“We at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,” Harris said. “We will need help. We just don’t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it’s through mutual aid agreements or it’s from other states or our own state. We’re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.”

Lancaster Hill and other Black Americans in the Massachusetts Bay colony, “who are detained in a state of Slavery in the Bowels of a free & Christian Country,” declared in a petition that they were born free just like the white citizens and “have never forfeited this Blessing by any compact or agreement whatever.” 
Seven years later, Elizabeth “Bett” Freeman heard that the new Massachusetts Constitution said every person had a right to freedom. The next day, she approached a lawyer and was quoted as asking, “I heard that paper read yesterday, that says, all men are created equal, and that every man has a right to freedom.” She said she wanted her freedom, too. The lawyer agreed and filed a lawsuit on behalf of her and another African American. 
In 1781, the case went to court, and a jury ruled in her favor, making her the first Black woman set free under the Massachusetts state constitution. 
“Any time while I was a slave,” she said, “if one minute’s freedom had been offered to me and I had been told I must die at the end of that minute, I would have taken it, just to stand one minute on God’s earth a free woman!”
At the same time, Quock Walker sued his former master, Nathaniel Jennison, for battery. After the local courts ruled in his and Freeman’s favor, they pressed the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court on whether the state’s Constitution applied to those enslaved. That challenge led to Supreme Court Chief Justice William Cushing’s conclusion that slavery was “inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution.” 
By 1790, the U.S. Census found no Black Americans enslaved in Massachusetts, making it the first state to abolish slavery",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/06120142/May25-FeaturedImage-Elizabeth-Freeman-1000x881-1.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:59:50.767216

(Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)It took six months, but the race for the North Carolina Supreme Court is finally over. The rules of the game held – just as they did following the 2020 election – and the winner is now in office.
That’s a win for democracy.
And we owe that win in large part to an exceptionally strong ruling from Trump-appointed judge Richard E. Myers II, chief judge of the Eastern District of North Carolina.    
While other branches might be absent (Congress), or ambivalent on whether or not it has to follow the Constitution (Executive), the federal judiciary continues to hold the line.
North Carolina is one of seven states that has partisan elections for its judges. In the November 2024 election for one of North Carolina’s Supreme Court seats, Democrat Allison Riggs defeated Republican Jefferson Griffin by 734 votes. Out of 5,540,090 votes. Griffin challenged the results in court, as is his right.
Included in Griffin’s challenges were attempts to retroactively challenge the state’s election laws, and then use the new understanding of the law to throw out 60,000 presumptively-valid votes. All based in election denial conspiracies.
Such an effort violates two important principles of how our elections are run: 1) You can’t change the rules of the game after the game, and 2) You can’t punish voters for following the rules as they were understood at the time.
These principles are what kept Al Gore from invalidating 25,000 likely-Republican votes in Florida in the 2000 presidential election, and they’re what allow for finality in election results.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals and the North Carolina Supreme Court shocked the election community by partially indulging Griffin’s after-the-fact challenges. They showed they were willing to set a dangerous precedent of legitimizing false claims of voter fraud, especially in close margin races. 
If the North Carolina Supreme Court’s decision had held, and if it had gained popularity in other state courts, then we would have been in a world of trouble for 2026. Elections would drag on for months.  
For example, if I, in Arizona, narrowly lost an election, but then challenged the legality of mail balloting, then that legal theory would have to be fully litigated before calling an end to the election. Despite the fact that I could have challenged the legality of mail voting before the election.  
Imagine if the election in dispute had been a seat in Congress. Or if the partisan balance of Congress had only been divided by one vote. Would we have been waiting until May to seat the Speaker of the House?
Maybe then it would’ve gotten more attention nationally. It flew largely under the radar for many Americans. And who can blame them? Democracy is under attack from so many angles, who can keep up?
The truth is, election denial was alive and well in North Carolina this election cycle. But ultimately, the federal courts stepped in and settled the race once and for all.
Judge Myers didn’t hesitate to rebuke the problematic nature of such an approach. He wrote: “A post-election change of practice that results in the discarding of votes is abominable under the Constitution of the United States.” 
Griffin ultimately called off the fight and conceded to Riggs, allowing her to, finally, be sworn in to a new term on the North Carolina Supreme Court.
As long as I wasn’t one of the candidates, nor a North Carolina citizen looking for finality, there’s a silver lining. The ruling provided a persuasive refresher on election law for judges.  It came from the chief judge of a district. It came from a Republican-appointed judge. It came from a Trump-appointed judge. 
Don’t get me wrong. The lawsuit threatened to undermine the legitimacy of our election system and silence the eligible voters. It’s going to take time for pro-democracy officials in North Carolina, and across our country, to rebuild trust in our election system.
We have the federal courts to thank for keeping our election system free, fair, and secure this cycle. I firmly believe that almost all federal judges consistently do the right thing according to fact and law, regardless of their politics. But for those who think the judiciary is just “politics in robes,” we couldn’t have asked for a better ambassador for election-law-sanity than we got in this federal court.
As I have said many times over the past few months, thank goodness for our federal judiciary, one which continues to be the envy of the world.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5131673-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:00:23.919638

The hound “training” season begins on June 1 in Vermont and lasts all summer long, offering wildlife little reprieve from harassment. The practice can be particularly traumatic at this time of year for mother animals and their offspring. Hounding occurs on both public and private lands, raising ethical and legal concerns among property owners and outdoor recreationists who fear run-ins with uncontrolled hounds. It causes extreme stress and suffering for both the hunted animals and the hounds, especially when violent encounters occur between the dogs and their quarry, sometimes resulting in severe injuries or death. Young wild animals who can’t outrun the hounds stand little chance of escape.  Hounding also disturbs the peace of public lands and occurs on private properties without consent. It often lacks meaningful regulation or enforcement, especially during the training period. Raccoon, bobcat and fox hounding, for example, are governed by few regulations, allowing hounders to run their dogs even in the middle of night.If you’re looking to take action, there are several potential steps:Contact legislators to advocate for restrictions or bans on hound hunting.

Fern was known for her kindness, joy and strong connection to nature. We are also deeply troubled by the outcome of the trial of Seth Brunell, which failed to deliver justice for Fern.

Our Quaker faith teaches that there is that of God in everyone. This belief calls us to affirm the dignity, worth and spiritual gifts of all people. Our community is enriched by the presence of transgender and gender diverse individuals. Transgender people deserve not only affirmation, but protection. To honor Fern is to reject the negligence and prejudice that enable transphobia to thrive in courtrooms, police departments, and legislatures. It is to recognize that the criminal legal system is not only broken, but structurally incapable of serving the communities most impacted by violence.Vermont has taken crucial steps towards creating a safe and inclusive environment for transgender people. However, we still must hold our public institutions accountable. When our system fails to uphold justice for Fern, it has failed all of us. We must allow ourselves to grieve, but it is equally important to transform that grief into courage, solidarity and love towards the transgender community. We recognize that honoring each person’s self-identified gender is a spiritual practice rooted in love and truth.

This story was originally reported by Alexis Wray, Eden Turner and Sabreen Dawud of The 19th. Meet Alexis, Eden and Sabreen and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Sunday is the fifth anniversary of George Floyd’s death, a time that many remember as a “racial reckoning” that heightened the world’s attention on police brutality and its deadly impact on Black people.
Activists, leaders and community members believed five years ago that the country would point to this moment as the one that brought lasting change toward racial equity. Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.
In a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.
Furthermore, in 2025, 67 percent of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65 percent felt similarly in 2020.
The 19th spoke with Black activists about the country’s progress toward equality since Floyd’s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.
 ‘You have to do things to actually show how you feel’

Alaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.
  Alaunna Thompson (left) and Gabriel Broadman (right) at a George Floyd protest they both organized in Englewood, New Jersey on May 31, 2020. (Alaunna Thompson)
Protestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd’s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.
“It was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.”
Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery’s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd’s.
Thompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.
“I saw people talking about [Floyd’s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, ‘Wow, this is really sad,’ and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,” she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, “that was a shock to me,” Thompson said. “That’s never really happened before.”
In Thompson’s eyes, while Floyd’s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd’s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.
“People are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,” she said. “They’re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.”
At just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford’s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a “suspicious person” prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.
Although Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd’s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.
“It’s about history. It’s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.”

 ‘I hope many people hold onto … the possibility that lies ahead’

Throughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she’s done for her community.
As a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.
Ferrell-Zabala felt that Floyd’s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.
“In the moment, you just want to make sure everyone’s OK,” she said. “You want to wrap your arms around them, but then there’s this point about ‘What do I need?’”
Five years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it’s a hard moment for the country — and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.
For instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren’t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.
“Right now, it feels particularly difficult because there’s this sense of, ‘No one cares, no one gives a damn,’” she said. “But I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it’s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.”
Ferrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother’s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.
“That’s one of the things I hold onto,” she said. “I hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.”
  Destine Riggins says she was the only photographer at the various West Jefferson, NC racial justice protests she attended and documented, such as this 2020 march. (Vicki Randolph)
 ‘We’re the only thing protecting each other’

Destine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.
Riggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like “the whole world is against us again.”
“I feel like we’re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,” Riggins said.
Floyd’s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.
Since the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.
“Each time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,” Riggins said.
Millions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.
“There is no protection for Black people except us, we’re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,” Riggins said. “I don’t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don’t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.”

 ‘Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people’

While Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.
“White people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying — largely by the hands of the police or people in power,” Wellington said.
After the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.
“There was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?” Wellington said. “Black people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.”
While Wellington feels that things aren’t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.
“If we can’t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,” Wellington said.
Wellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies’ custody in a similar way to Floyd.
Several community members are outraged by Mast’s death, and people who once “backed the blue” are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.
“The fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,” Wellington said. “Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.”

 ‘Our joy has to be non-negotiable’

In 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.
As the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.
Then Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.
“We were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,” she said. “We had to be on the frontlines at the same time.”
At that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd’s murder.
In 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump’s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.
Overall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency “would be detrimental.” Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.
“I think we’re in more danger now than we were before,” Simpson told The 19th. “We’re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.”
To create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because “disrespectability politics … have kept us divided.” The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.
“We need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,” she said. “That’s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/george-floyd-square-1024x593.jpeg,,,2025-05-25 07:01:24.182156

If the tidegates on No Name Slough — an estuary at the Skagit River delta — appear to be stained, crusted and a bit sagging with age, it could be because they are 60 years old.
If they fail, 450 acres of prime farmland could be inundated with salt water spilling in from Padilla Bay, and lost to farming.
The Skagit Delta tidegates have a simple purpose: to drain farmland when the tide goes out, then block incoming tides when they come lapping at the gate. The Skagit River delta produces about 90% of the agricultural value of all farms in Skagit County. Some of the highest value crops — spinach and cabbage seed, wheat and barley — grow on the soil protected by the diking districts.
The gates have made the Skagit River delta one of the state’s most productive farmland areas, acre for acre, for 140 years. Now, the future of farming on 60,000 acres of delta land protected by a network of dikes and 100 tidegates can no longer be assumed.
The issue is now being fought in federal court. A lawsuit brought by Skagit Dike, Drainage and Irrigation Improvement District 12 seeks to overturn a biological opinion by National Marine Fisheries Service, or NMFS, that the district says imposed onerous impact fees for merely repairing existing infrastructure.
The fate of the Skagit delta’s highly fertile farmland is inextricably intertwined with that of the Chinook salmon, classified as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.
The district lost its request for summary judgement  in the first round on April 28, when U.S. District Court Judge Brian A. Tsuchida ruled for NMFS on all key claims. The decision was based on review of documents filed by both sides.
Tsuchida’s decision mooted his earlier decision in 2024 that the district could proceed with repairs because NMFS had taken too long in its environmental review of the tidegate repair permit.
At issue, notes the ruling, is “NMFS’ conclusion that the No Name Slough tidegate project would further reduce the quality and perpetuate poor conditions of nearshore and estuary habitat for Puget Sound Chinook for an additional 50 years” — thus necessitating habitat mitigation and restoration. In bringing suit, District 12 contends the project is “a simple tidegate replacement which does not expand the footprint of existing structures, and provides benefits to fish.”
Commissioners of the district voted on May 12 to file an appeal with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A hearing before a three-judge appeals panel is not yet scheduled.
 ‘Disappointed’

Jenna Friebel, executive director of the consortium that represents all 12 diking districts, said her organization “disagrees with and is disappointed with the district court’s decision.”
A rule that NMFS adopted in November of 2020 imposes substantial mitigation fees for any nearshore infrastructure repairs, from tidegates to Port of Seattle piers.
The No Name Slough tidegates are the first in the Skagit delta system to face the consequences of the rule. Before the change, the Skagit Tidegate Fish Initiative, or TFI, in 2010 established a system whereby tidegate improvements could be made without having to go to NMFS for permission for every individual project.
The Diking District 12 tidegate replacement on No Name Slough has been pending for four years, since the district’s original application for a permit approval from NMFS.
The ruling expands the baseline for determining effects of a repair project from the immediate vicinity of the work to the entire Puget Sound range of Chinook salmon. The next step under ESA, unless conditions for Chinook recovery show improvement, would be to declare the species endangered, triggering more stringent rules to protect the fish.
The rule also has been extended to include repairs to public infrastructure such as piers, waterfront bulkheads, ports and any other project that NMFS decides must involve mitigation fees.
 Added cost for district

For District 12, that would add $2.5 million in mitigation fees on top of whatever it costs to replace the tidegate and repairs to a section of the dike around it. What NMFS wants to have mitigated is the subject of a lawsuit the district filed against the agency last December.
Tsuchida sided with the federal fisheries agency on virtually every issue, citing at one point the “deference” given to NMFS as the source of expertise and scientific knowledge on the ESA.
Despite disagreement with the ruling, “our member districts remain committed to working with state and federal resource agencies and local tribes to develop solutions to the complex at hand that are grounded in facts and science,” Friebel said.
Senior Civil Prosecutor Will Honea, who deals with natural resource issues, said that Skagit County government has no direct stake in the District 12 lawsuit against NMFS.
“However,” he said, “We are concerned that NMFS’s single-minded focus on punitive regulatory measures is preventing productive progress in the Skagit, damaging the Skagit fisheries resource, hampering our ability to prepare for sea level rise and climate change and creating unnecessary conflict in our community.”
NMFS officials have declined to comment on the ruling.
 Swinomish perspective

The TFI was intended to make the process of obtaining permits for work on tidegates easier for applicants. The Army Corps of Engineers was empowered to issue permits directly for tidegate repairs under terms of the TFI approved by NMFS. It created an oversight board consisting of dike district representatives, the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and Skagit County, state Fish and Wildlife and NMFS, with a staff member acting as coordinator.
The program included a system by which districts could acquire “credits” by doing work that made “operational improvements” to their tidegate systems. Districts could do the work even if they did not have any credits stored.
The Swinomish objected, complaining that the districts were using the operational improvements to do work that was more than the system should have allowed. The tribe gave 60 days notice of intent to sue NMFS. The tribe threatened to sue the Corps of Engineers for approving the District 12 work after its own finding that the project would have minimal effect on the threatened Chinook.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/tidegate.jpg,,,2025-05-25 07:01:24.182156

(Screenshot from event video stream)A panel of speakers at a Tuesday “Voices for Veterans” event recently agreed that America has a moral obligation to care for members of the military after they have completed their service.
The panelists’ remarks were in response to a question by moderator Michael McElroy, a political correspondent at Cardinal & Pine, the North Carolina online publication that hosted the event for the purpose of “supporting North Carolina’s veterans and military families.”
 Big VA cuts spark big worries

The comments came amid concerns about steep staffing cuts at Veterans Administration hospitals. VA staff and supporters contend proposed cuts will hinder the ability to adequately care for veterans. More than 80,000 positions — just over 17% of the roughly 470,000 people it employs — could be eliminated as part of a major restructuring of the federal government’s second largest department.
The Trump administration is thinking about numbers and not people when it proposes such deep cuts to the VA, said Ann Marie Patterson-Powell, a VA nurse.
“They’re not looking at the human side of it. Patterson-Powell said. “We promised those who signed up and left their families, their homes — everything behind — to serve the country. We said, ‘If you do this for me, we’re going to take care of you when you come back.’”
The nation must do for veterans what it said it would do with “no strings attached, with no arguments, with no pushback,” Patterson-Powell said.
(U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz defended the Trump administration’s planned staffing cuts, saying, “We’re going to maintain VA’s mission-essential jobs like doctors, nurses and claims processors, while phasing out non-mission essential roles like DEI officers.”)
Dr. Kyle Horton, founder of On Your Side Health, a nonprofit that addresses health care disparities and works to improve veterans’ care, said the nation has a sacred obligation to protect those who serve.
“Those who wrote a blank check in service to this country with their lives do not deserve to be penny-pinched by Washington bureaucrats,” Horton said.
Horton added: “They don’t deserve to be penny-pinched by Captain Bone Spurs in the White House [a reference to President Donald Trump, who obtained a medical excuse from serving in the Vietnam War due to bone spurs] right now and they don’t deserve to be penny pinched by DOGE [the so-called Department of Government Efficiency] and  [Elon] Musk who don’t even know what they’re doing. Period.”
Patterson-Powell said there is a push by the Trump administration to privatize the VA. That could be harmful to veterans who wouldn’t receive the specialized care they now get at the VA, she said.
  Scott Peoples (Screenshot from event video stream)
Scott Peoples, a retired Army captain, member of Veterans for Responsible Leadership (VFRL) and an advocate for free and fair elections, noted that America fights its wars with volunteers. The proposed budget VA budget cuts could make people think twice about making a commitment to serve, Peoples said.
“How we take care of them after service is kind of our Number One recruiting tool as well for future people who want to join the military,” Peoples said.
He said the Trump administration’s firing of VA staff members made him angry.
“Every single one of those people got into it for the right reasons; wants to serve their country by taking care of our veterans and the way they have so inhumanely shrugged off cutting people with no transparency, just people receiving emails, people having moved their families across country [to work at the VA], is just despicable,” Peoples said.   
  Grier Martin (Screenshot from event video stream)
Grier Martin, Secretary of the NC Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, said the cuts would have a devastating impact on rural communities.
“If these cuts go through, you’re going to see the VA’s presence in rural areas start to dry out,” Martin said. “These are areas that are already starting to see their civilian hospitals close also.”
The state’s decision to expand Medicaid has been helpful in helping some rural hospitals remain open, he said, but veterans will have difficulty finding care near home if the VA’s presence is diminished.
“If you live on the coast, you’re not going to drive to Durham and you’re probably not going to drive to Fayetteville to the VA hospital to get your care,” Grier said.
Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe) said the outpouring of concern and support for veterans gives him cause for hope amid threats of major cuts to the VA.
“That is how change happens,” Ager said. “It may not be immediate. It may not always be completely satisfying. But the fact that veterans are coming together, that the community is coming together to support veterans, I think will eventually lead to change.”   
 Threats to democracy

A second panel discussion moderated by Cardinal & Pine’s managing editor Billy Ball, focused on threats to democracy and the evolving role of veterans as defenders of democracy.
  Bobby Jones (Screenshot from event video stream)
Panelist Bobby Jones, president of VFRL and retired Navy commander, said he could see the cost of freedom in the faces of the veterans in the audience. Jones said the services the VA provides are essential to national security.
“I know this panel is about national security, but my thing is you cannot have one without the other,” Jones said. “The VA has to be sound in order for us to have a proper national security apparatus.”
Jones was critical of Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. He said neither man understands the concept of service to country.
“For the first time, I believe in American history, we have leadership that doesn’t get it, that thinks the Constitution is nothing more than a suggestion,” Jones said. “Hell, even the South for the Civil War had the good sense to defect and secede before going against the Constitution.”
America is in “unparalleled, unprecedented times” and veterans must step up to lead the country out the quagmire, Jones said.
Ball asked the panel to discuss the much-watched North Carolina Supreme Court race between Republican Jefferson Griffin and Allison Riggs, a Democrat. The outcome of the closely contested race wasn’t resolved until this month after nearly six months. Griffin conceded after a federal judge ordered the state to certify Riggs’ election victory.
Military and overseas votes were at the center of the election dispute. Griffin challenged the validity of some military and overseas absentee ballots in the 2024 contest.
“To protect military and veterans’ families’ votes, really has to come from the voters, really has to come from political pressure,” said Sean Wright, a former Army medic. “We have to make it, as voters, unacceptable to take away the right to vote.”
Rep. Terry Brown (D-Mecklenburg) said men and women who serve overseas have expectations that they will be treated with a certain amount of respect.
“This election really showed how little the powers that be cared about that,” Brown said. “I like to think about it in terms of people that talk a good game, but they don’t back it up.”
Brown said Americans can’t afford to take a day off defending democracy.
“We have to make sure that’s it’s not just doing election season, it’s not just when there are votes on the line, it’s not just when a bad thing happens,” Brown said. “It’s all the time that we’re making sure that y’all are laser-focused on protecting against threats to our democracy.”
Jay Carey, leader of Resist & Persist, a nonpartisan veterans advocacy organization, said the challenge to the state Supreme Court election was a test by the GOP to determine how much the judicial system and voters could stomach.
Carey, who garnered national attention after he was escorted out of U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards’ townhall meeting in Asheville in March, said there will be more challenges to valid election victories.
“They’re [the challenges] are going to get more and more ridiculous,” Carey said. “It’s going to tie up time and waste more money. Like I said, it was a test. They just wanted to see what they could do.”
The discussion turned to talk of Trump’s removing the military’s Judge Advocate Generals (JAG) and replacing them with what some panelists said are loyalists to the administration. JAGs advise commanders on legal matters and oversee the military judicial system.
Jones said the legal protections provided by JAGs are critical to defending the nation against internal threats he fears are coming from the Trump administration.
“I can’t stress the panic level enough on this,” Jones said. “All of the dominoes are falling. To those of us paying attention, it’s blatantly obvious. Any time there’s a voice of dissent, they shut it down.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-05-25 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,It’s time for lawmakers to do Mississippi taxpayers a solid in the special session,Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/25/its-time-for-lawmakers-to-do-mississippi-taxpayers-a-solid-in-the-special-session/,Column: It will cost Mississippi taxpayers more for a special session than it would have cost them had lawmakers finished their work on time earlier this year. Here's how they can make it up to us.,"In early April, the Mississippi Legislature opted to end the 2025 session and come back in special session, at greater expense to taxpayers, to pass a budget for the upcoming fiscal year that begins July 1.
It will cost Mississippi taxpayers more for a special session than it would have cost them had legislators just voted to remain in regular session to work on the budget. They could have remained in regular session without actually being in Jackson until an agreement between legislative leaders was reached on a budget. At that point, members could have come back to Jackson to vote on the budget, and the additional expenses would have been nominal.
In special session, legislators receive the same expense reimbursements they receive in regular session. In addition, however, the 175 members (including the lieutenant governor) will receive an additional $75 per day.
It is worth noting that legislators receive $1,500 per month when out of session. If they had voted to remain in regular session, they would not have received the $1,500 for April and the $1,500 for May.
Granted, in a representative democracy, making laws can be messy and disagreements occur that lead to added expenses. Those additional expenses can be the cost of living in this country. After all, Russia does not have to worry about additional expenses for lawmakers because of disagreements with Vladimir Putin.
And this is not intended as an argument that Mississippi legislators receive too much money. After all, they have not received a pay raise since 1997 except for increases in their daily per diem when in session for living expenses. The per diem is tied to the federal rate.
But this is simply to point out that legislators had a choice to make back in April: stay in regular session for less money or come back in for a more costly special session.
Since at this point there is no escaping the added expenses for the Legislature being in special session, there are a few extra steps lawmakers could take to give the taxpayers something more for their money.
First of all, when they come back, they should work as quickly and efficiently as possible. Presumably, legislative leaders have been working behind the scenes to reach a budget accord. So, when the governor calls the special session and legislators return to the Capitol, they should be ready and rearing to go.
Second, pass a responsible budget that takes care of the people of the state and not the special interest of any particular legislator or group of legislators.
And finally — and this is an important one — be transparent. The final passage of the state budget normally occurs in the waning hours of the regular session and in one big blur. Transparency is almost never a focus.
The budget is passed piecemeal in more than 100 individual bills. And while this has not always been the case, in recent years often there has not been a readily available document that provides information so that it can be ascertained whether agencies are receiving more or less funding and how the funding the agencies are receiving is being divvied up.
Many legislators often do not actually know what they are voting on when passing the budget in the fog of the end of the regular session.
Legislative leaders, during their out-of-session negotiations, should have had plenty of time to have staff develop such documents, which used to be provided as part of the normal budgeting process.
It could be argued that legislators like the whirlwind process and the lack of transparency because that is how things like funds for work on golf courses or work on obscure streets are sneaked into budget bills while other major needs are neglected.
But since the Legislature has been able to work behind the scenes on a budget for almost two months now, there is no excuse for the lack of transparency.
After all, taxpayers should be getting something for their money. So come on, legislators, it is time to do the taxpayers a solid.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/10091749/Legislative-Session-2025-10.jpg,,,2025-05-25 08:00:23.919638

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerMARLBORO — As a longtime volunteer and chair of the town’s new cemetery commission, Marcia Hamilton annually prepares for Memorial Day by helping place American flags at the graves of local soldiers. This year, that tradition hit especially close to home with the latest addition to the list: The 102-year-old World War II hero she knew as Dad.Richard Henry Hamilton was born to nearby Brattleboro farmers on Sept. 28, 1922. The family didn’t plug into electricity until after he graduated from high school in 1940, which is why all were huddled around a battery-powered radio when President Franklin D. Roosevelt called for war after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941.“Listening to that, we didn’t know where Pearl Harbor was,” Richard recalled in a 2015 National WWII Museum interview, Drafted in 1942, the young Vermonter joined the Army Air Corps. He was serving as a radio operator and gunner on a B-17 bomber named “Destiny’s Child” when it flew over Germany on July 20, 1944.Vermont television station WCAX profiled Richard Hamilton for its “Super Senior” series in 2018. Photo by Joe Carroll/WCAX“When dots were spotted way back, we assumed that was our escort,” Richard said.Instead, the speeding specks were 60 enemy fighters that shot a wing off his plane. Richard saw bullets and a resulting blaze kill four crewmen before he and four others parachuted down 18,000 feet. Separated from his fellow soldiers, he soon found himself in a wheat field.“The whole village seemed to turn out — with their clubs and pitchforks,” he recalled in a 2008 Library of Congress interview. “I don’t speak German, but I was introduced to it very suddenly.” Richard landed in the Stalag Luft IV prisoner-of-war camp. Jailed for 10 months, he was forced out on Feb. 6, 1945, for a multiweek death march.“Day after day we were just on the road,” he said. “There was no destination.”It instead led to dysentery, frostbite, blisters, body lice and jaundice. “My feet were black and blue and infected,” he said of his 76th day. “I came to a decision that I wasn’t going to go anymore.”Miraculously, that’s when two Allied soldiers liberated him on April 24, 1945.“When we saw the Statue of Liberty, I could just sense how those immigrants placed all their hopes and dreams in that,” he said of his return home.Richard Hamilton stands second from the left in the back row for this World War II photo of the “Destiny’s Child” B-17 bomber and crew. Photo from the 91st Bomb GroupBack in Vermont, Richard married his sweetheart Joyce White and moved to Marlboro, a southeastern Vermont town known for its former namesake college and longtime music festival. There, they acquired the Skyline restaurant, which the couple ran atop Hogback Mountain until retiring almost 50 years later in 1994.Ever busy, Richard also served on the town select and school boards and as a constable, tax collector and justice of the peace. He wound the clock in the Meeting House steeple until his hip was replaced at age 90. He commanded the Vermont chapter of American Ex-Prisoners of War, and after drawing faith by memorizing Psalm 91 during his capture (its line “He is my refuge and my fortress” appears on his gravestone), he helped Gideons International distribute Bibles to hotels, schools and prisons.Richard died at home on Feb. 19 at age 102, leaving four daughters, seven grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.“He was still active” attending men’s breakfasts, senior lunches and veterans’ dinners, his obituary said.Marlboro residents were still thinking about him two weeks later when they voted to create a local cemetery commission.A tree grows in Marlboro’s Center Cemetery. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerAccording to state law, municipal gravesites are the responsibility of a town selectboard or city council unless a community “votes to place its public burial grounds under the charge of cemetery commissioners.”Marlboro approved Vermont’s newest such commission in a 308-22 vote March 4, electing Marcia Hamilton and fellow volunteers Hollis Burbank-Hammarlund and Sally White to its three seats. They’re now working on spring cleanup, summer mowing, year-round green options and “a user-friendly flowchart to help the public navigate the burial process,” according to meeting minutes.“One thing we plan to do is create a policy to standardize the care each cemetery gets,” Marcia said of the group, which has a $16,200 annual budget. “We’re trying to show that a commission is a good idea by not having a spurt of expenditures. It’s not going to cost any more money than it ever has.”Marcia and her family received help at her father’s graveside service May 14 at King Cemetery. More than 200 friends, neighbors, veterans and first responders assisted with a 21-gun salute, the playing of taps and a U.S. Air Force flyover.Shortly after, Marcia followed in the footsteps of her late mother by gathering three generations of her family to place American flags at the burial plots of local soldiers. She started with her father and went as far back as Revolutionary War militiaman Elijah Bruce, who is believed to have fought at the Battle of Bennington in 1777 before dying from smallpox in 1835.Each stone, she knows, has its own story.Read the story on VTDigger here:  A Vermont WWII veteran survived a death march.

Maine law mandates annual reporting to the Maine Department of Education. However, according to Bear Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist, Maine DOE “has not been given statutory authority or mechanisms to enforce compliance.”
Rather, the department seems to operate under the assumption that a district’s lack of reporting means schools didn’t restrain or seclude any students that year.
“It is possible that if a school district does not have any incidents of restraint and seclusion in a school year, they will not report any data,” said Chloe Teboe, the department spokesperson, when asked about the dozens of districts that aren’t reporting every year, according to publicly available state data. “The Maine DOE can only act on the data that is shared by school districts, as required by statute.”
Atlee Reilly, managing attorney for the advocacy organization Disability Rights Maine, said it’s “beyond unlikely” that districts failing to report have not used restraint or seclusion.
Overall, reporting to the DOE has fallen off in recent years, Reilly told lawmakers on May 9 during discussion of a proposed bill that aims to relax the rules on restraint and seclusion. Many of the state’s largest districts and schools that historically reported frequent use of restraint and seclusion have stopped sharing their numbers in recent years, according to statewide data.
“I know that some schools that have historically reported high numbers of restraints haven’t reported,” Reilly said. “So does that mean that they, all of a sudden, are not restraining or secluding youth? I think probably not.”
At least one school not reporting high use to state
A closer look at the Bangor Regional Program, a school for students with disabilities, reveals how restraint and seclusion practices can go unreported for years.
Bangor Public Schools is responsible for reporting its own numbers, as well as the data for the Bangor Regional Program, which serves students from several area districts. The state database includes numbers from the regional program for one of the past 10 years, after a 2019 investigation found the school had been restraining and secluding students thousands of times each year from 2015 to 2018, more than almost any other school in the state.
During the 2019-20 school year, the regional program used 261 restraints and 325 seclusions on 33 individual students. Internal data provided by Bangor schools to Maine Morning Star in response to a records request shows that in the following years, the program continued using these practices. In 2021-22, the school reported 419 total uses of restraint and seclusion. In 2022-23, use dropped to 187, and in 2023-24, increased to 281.
None of these incidents were reported to the state, according to publicly available state data.
Though Bangor Public Schools reports its data every year, when asked why the regional program’s numbers were not shared with the state, spokesperson Ray Phinney said he didn’t know and couldn’t find out due to recent changes in district leadership.
“The superintendent who oversaw the submission of this is no longer with us,” he said.
The DOE did not respond directly to questions about this school’s lack of reporting, but the spokesperson said the department “reports any data received from school districts and does not make a practice of not publishing it.”
Ben Jones, director of legal and policy initiatives for Lives in the Balance, a Maine-based nonprofit that works with schools to reduce restraint and seclusion, said it’s important for the department to explain what happens when schools like the regional program collect data but don’t report it to the state.
“We still don’t have a true sense of the scope of using these dangerous practices, so this, to me, points the spotlight back at reporting and collecting,” he said. “So what more is DOE doing to ensure the completeness of the data, the completeness of this picture?”
Few districts regularly report data
This underreporting casts doubt on the apparent progress Maine has made in relying less on these practices in the wake of a 2021 law, which specified restraint and seclusion should only be used in emergency situations.
The law was intended to reduce the use of emergency behavioral interventions that are known to be traumatic — particularly for students with disabilities, who are disproportionately affected.
“It’s very difficult to tell if the numbers went down or up after the law change because of underreporting,” Jones said.
In the 2022-23 school year, Maine schools reported 44% fewer incidents of restraint and seclusion in schools than it did four years earlier. But only 140 of Maine’s 300-plus school administrative units submitted their data for that school year. In 2018-19, that number was 213.










I don't want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it's traumatic, it's not good. However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.


–  Superintendent Clay Gleason, Maine School Administrative District 6


Only 24 districts have submitted restraint and seclusion data every year for the last decade, a Maine Morning Star analysis found.
Together, they represent fewer than one-quarter of Maine’s roughly 170,000 K-12 students. Only two of the state’s 10 largest districts, Bangor and Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 6 in the Buxton area, are among them.
In the 2018-19 school year, MSAD 6 staff reported restraining students 150 times and placing them in rooms by themselves 256 times.
By 2022-23, MSAD 6’s use of those tactics, especially seclusions, had dropped considerably. District staff that year reported restraining students 100 times and placing them in seclusion rooms 132 times.
That district’s reliance on restraint and seclusion roughly matches the trend statewide over that period. Across Maine, use of restraint and seclusion peaked in the 2018-19 year at more than 22,000 reported uses, according to the available state data. After passage of the 2021 law restricting their use to instances when a student’s behavior poses an “imminent danger” of serious injury, overall incidents fell to just under 12,600 in the 2022-23 school year — a 44% drop.
“I don’t want anyone to think that people in schools are just wanting to put hands on kids. Because it’s traumatic, it’s not good,” said MSAD 6 Superintendent Clay Gleason. “However, there are times, when for the safety of an individual student or others around that individual, it becomes necessary to restrain or seclude.”

Numbers still high despite underreporting
Despite inconsistent reporting, it’s clear many Maine districts still rely on these practices thousands of times a year. In 2021, data reported directly by schools to the federal government showed that Maine ranked first and second in restraining and secluding students, respectively, per capita. According to an analysis of the most recent national numbers, the state fell to third and fourth per capita.
“These are still extremely high numbers,” said Jones with Lives in the Balance. “Each one of these is a kid being grabbed or put into a closet, and then there’s probably more of it going on based on what we know.”
The number of reported restraints and seclusions vary widely from district to district, noted Alan Cobo-Lewis, director of the Center for Community Inclusion and Disability Studies and associate professor of Psychology at the University of Maine.
Some districts have reported zero incidents for many years, and others like those in the Buxton-area, report large numbers. But “whether they’re model programs, or whether they’re just not reporting their restraints, I don’t think that you can know that without actually visiting schools,” Cobo-Lewis said.
“I have advocated for a while for the department to visit the schools that had high rates and also visit the schools that had zero,” he said.
While the federal government collects this data from districts, there is no federal oversight, and every state has different laws about restraint and seclusion. Some members of Congress have proposed a federal ban on school use of restraint and seclusion, with the most recent legislation introduced in 2023.
The proposal currently before Maine lawmakers would allow districts to move students against their will without reporting it as a restraint and would allow educators more flexibility in determining when they use these practices by decreasing the level of danger posed by a student’s behavior from “serious physical injury” to just “injury.”
Both Jones and Reilly of Disability Rights Maine worry that if the bill passes, schools will no longer have to report incidents where staff move students against their will into classrooms and quiet rooms. That would mean the statewide data on the number of restraints could drop.
“What we’re going to do is take a whole class of stuff — like the physical management of students that I think most people would look at and say, that child’s being restrained — and say it’s no longer restraint,” Reilly said.
He added, “It doesn’t mean that people are going to be putting their hands on kids less.”
From 2014 to 2023, school units reported 55 serious bodily injuries to students and 594 to staff members related to the use of a restraint or seclusion, according to publicly available data. In recent years, the number of students injured while being restrained and secluded has increased, with 22 of those 55 instances reported in the 2022-23 school year, all reported by Biddeford Schools. The southern coastal district did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Most years, the vast majority of districts reported zero injuries.
MSAD 6 in Buxton is one of the only districts that has reported staff and student injuries to the department every year, but Gleason said he did not recall any serious incidents, and did not know what criteria was used by staff who filled out forms.
“There are minor injuries that happen to both staff and students, sometimes with somebody getting a little rug burn or bumping into a desk or something,” he said, explaining the typical ways staff or students might get injured during a restraint or seclusion.
“But I don’t know if it’s a standard kind of thing across districts and how they report it, or if it’s like an internal measure,” he added.
According to state law, school units would not report injuries that do not meet the definition of serious physical injury, according to Shea, the department’s restraint and seclusion specialist. But in practice, “I have talked with many schools and there is a wide range of ways that [school administrative units] choose to report injuries with some tending to report even more minor injuries,” he said.
While the department collects injury data, there is no statewide policy about what districts should do in response to student or staff injuries.
Majority of reports from schools for students with disabilities
When public school districts determine they can’t adequately serve a student with disabilities, some of them are referred to special purpose private schools. Although these schools still receive public funding, Jones said the programs are often insulated from scrutiny.
Having sat through dozens of those placement meetings, Jones said the student’s parents and advocates are hoping that a move would increase support for the child, but that’s not always the case.
Pointing to the high number of reported incidents, Jones said these schools can often be “hotbeds for the inappropriate use of restraint and seclusion.”
Over the past decade, Maine’s special purpose private schools have accounted for roughly 57% of all uses of restraint and seclusion in the state each year, going up to almost 70% in 2019-20, when the state saw the most incidents in a decade.
Though the data from these schools haven’t been consistently included in the state’s annual data, students with disabilities in Maine and nationwide are much more likely to be subject to these practices.
Maine’s special purpose private schools served roughly 850 students in 2022-23 but accounted for 58% of all 7,975 restraints in the state, according to a Maine Morning Star analysis. That same year, they also accounted for about 47% of all seclusions in Maine: 2,154 of 4,618 incidents.
The Margaret Murphy Centers for Children, a special purpose private school with campuses in Auburn, Lewiston, Saco and Turner, has topped the state’s list for seclusion every year since 2014-15; it has also restrained students more than any other school every year since 2017-18, state data shows.
The centers used these practices more than 11,000 times on just 108 students in 2019-20, according to the state data from 2023.
There is no state law restricting an educator from using these practices repeatedly on a particular child. And unless a parent complains and requests a district try a new approach, there is no statewide process for addressing the frequency of incidents.

Margaret Murphy Senior Director Michelle Hathaway attributed those numbers to the severity of the student population’s needs. The school exclusively serves children and young adults (up to age 22) with significant behavioral and developmental challenges, many of whom are referred to the school specifically because of the “intensity or dangerousness of their behaviors,” she said.
They sometimes display aggression — including attempts to hit, choke, or rip out hair — that can pose serious safety risks to themselves or others.
Hathaway wrote in an email that restraints are only used as a “last resort” but argued the law leaves room for interpretation and that ambiguity means some schools may “over-document and over-report.”
For example, she said a staff member holding a 3-year-old’s hand to prevent them from running into a parking lot could technically, under current law, be considered a restraint.
But repeatedly using restraint and seclusion on a small number of students should be a red flag that something is not working, Jones said.
“Of course emergency situations will arise, but after the first few uses of restraint or seclusion, we are no longer talking about emergencies,” he said. “We are talking about predictable behavior that can be planned for, trained for.”

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
 Cash cow

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
Abortion providers challenge FDA’s remaining mifepristone restrictions in federal court

“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
 David vs. Goliath

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.
But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
‘It is a fight’: Patients, OB-GYNs and sexual health advocates determined to stop Medicaid cuts

A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
 State solutions

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

But during the 2023-24 school year at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, that’s what happened — at least 18 times, according to Emerson and school district incident reports reviewed by the Maine Morning Star. Staff members put the 7-year-old boy in holds, forced him into empty rooms and did not let him out until he calmed down or his parents picked him up.
“It broke him, and it broke me,” Emerson said.
The trauma became so severe that her son, now a third grader, no longer attends school in person, she said.
What happened to Emerson’s son is not an isolated case. Across Maine, schools use restraint and seclusion on students more than 10,000 times each year, according to Maine Department of Education data — with some districts resorting to the emergency tactics regularly while others have changed policies and taken other steps so that such interventions are only used as a last resort.

​In recent years, Maine as a whole has made an effort to reduce restraint and seclusion in schools, particularly for students with disabilities, with the U.S. Department of Education citing staff and student injuries and the resulting trauma for students as the reasons to curtail their use. The department has also condemned and discouraged these practices for years under multiple presidential administrations. Rare cases have resulted in serious injuries to students and even death.
A 2021 state law limits restraint and seclusion to emergencies. But as Maine educators report more challenging student behavior in the years since pandemic school closures, there have been calls to allow school staff to restrain and seclude children more often. A newly proposed bill would broaden the circumstances under which school staff could restrain or seclude students, igniting debate among educators, parents and lawmakers about how to manage student behavior without inflicting harm.
The Maine Education Association and the Maine School Management Association, representing teachers and administrators statewide, both support the proposal, citing increased reports of disruptive and violent student behavior — something educators nationwide have also reported in recent years.
The Gardiner-area school system, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 11, has led the push for that proposal. Victoria Duguay, principal of River View Community School in Gardiner, and MSAD 11 Superintendent Patricia Hopkins shared stories with lawmakers of students who hit and spit at adults, scream in hallways, throw chairs and destroy other students’ schoolwork.
Under the 2021 state law, school staff can only restrain students (immobilize them and move them against their will) or seclude them (isolate them in a room that they can’t leave) if their behavior “poses an imminent danger of serious physical injury” — requiring medical intervention beyond first aid, according to the Maine Department of Education regulations that govern restraint and seclusion.
“Staff are being hit, they’re being bit, but it doesn’t meet the threshold of serious imminent danger, because a 5-year-old isn’t going to [cause] an injury that requires medical care,” Hopkins said during an April 23 public hearing.
This extreme behavior, when it happens in a public place at school, traumatizes other students who witness it, Duguay said. The school sometimes has to close off access to common spaces — the gym or cafeteria — if a student acts out in a hallway through which students would need to pass.
Under the legislation MSAD 11 is supporting, staff would be able to move students against their will to a seclusion room or another quiet space without it counting as a restraint, which districts have to record, document, and report to the state.
But some educators who have pursued alternative training don’t agree that loosening restraint and seclusion requirements is the answer.
“The consequences of passing this bill will only inflict more trauma on students,” said Audrey Bartholomew, associate professor and coordinator of special education programs at the University of New England, who trains special education teachers. “Additionally, the behavior will keep happening, because restraint and seclusion is not an appropriate response to challenging behavior, and it will in no way help students remediate their behavior. These should not be referred to as strategies, treatments or solutions.”
Inside the three-hour restraint and seclusion of a 7-year-old
In October 2023, Emerson’s son started a behavior plan to help with concentration and self-regulation. The plan, which Emerson shared with the Maine Morning Star, highlighted the mother’s concerns about her son’s anger, dysregulation, anxiety and ADHD, and noted Emerson’s finding that occupational therapy had helped her son better regulate.
One week after the plan was put into place, the boy arrived at Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School already agitated, hit another student with a Pete the Cat stuffed animal and tried to leave the classroom, setting off a series of escalating interventions in which staff physically restrained him, relocated him against his will, and ultimately placed him in a small room where he stayed until his father arrived, according to incident reports shared with the Maine Morning Star.
The reports, which staff or administrators are required to write, offer an inside look at the behavior leading up to the restraint, how the situation escalated as staff restrained and secluded the boy, and how it continued for three hours, ending when Seth Emerson picked his son up from a seclusion room.
When the second grader initially tried to leave his classroom, two educators cornered the boy in a hallway nook, according to the report written by the school’s assistant principal. When he tried to push past them, they placed a mat between themselves and the child to block him from hitting them, and initiated the first of several physical holds. Each time he was released, he briefly calmed down but didn’t follow directions to sit still or stay in a designated spot, prompting a cycle: he would attempt to flee, staff would block him, the boy would resist, and staff would restrain him again, the report says.
About an hour in, while hiding in a locker, he asked to go home. A staff member moved him to a classroom, where he hid under a desk, retrieved rocks from his backpack, and threw them at staff, the report said. While the report described the projectiles as rocks, Emerson said her son had pebbles in his backpack.
Two hours in, staff called his parents. Even after he calmed down, they placed him in a seclusion room — referred to as a “quiet room” in the report — where they continued telling him to sit in a specific spot. When his father arrived, the boy walked out on his own, calm and cooperative.
Incidents like that continued for several more months for reasons that Emerson said did not warrant these measures: After he pulled books off shelves, punched a door, or refused to accompany staff to a quiet room, staff would put him in a physical hold or placed him in a room alone, according to a complaint Emerson filed with the district.
“I never condoned any of the behavior, whether he was throwing a book or whether he was yelling or running out of the classroom,” she said. “But he was not getting any education whatsoever last year. He was literally just going to school and being restrained and secluded.”
  Ellsworth Elementary-Middle School, pictured here, is far from the only school restraining and secluding children, practices that Maine law said should be used only in emergency situations.

Frequent seclusions push an educator to quit
It’s not only students and their families who feel the trauma from restraints and seclusion. The educators who are told to put their hands on children feel it, too, several current and former teachers and education technicians told the Maine Morning Star.
Ashley Rose took a job as an ed tech at SeDoMoCha Elementary School in Dover-Foxcroft in August while working toward a degree in special education. But after months of witnessing staff placing students in empty rooms as they screamed and cried to be let out, she changed course.
In March, Rose switched her major, deciding she no longer wanted to become a teacher. On April 28, she resigned, writing to Superintendent Stacy Shorey that she had repeatedly raised concerns with supervisors about the school’s frequent use of seclusion, the lack of staff training on student behavior, and the absence of alternatives — without seeing meaningful change.
SeDoMoCha Elementary School has “quiet rooms” located within special education classrooms — which Rose described as 10-by-6-foot rooms with no windows. Some have benches and one light, while others are entirely empty, she said. All the doors have windows in them so staff can monitor students.
In her 10 years of working in special education, she has never seen such frequent use of quiet rooms, Rose said.
In December, Rose found herself participating in her first seclusion. The student she was working with wasn’t physically aggressive, just loud, and Rose’s plan had been to escort her into the special education classroom — not the quiet room — to help her calm down.
The student went with her voluntarily but was crying, she said. When they got to the classroom, another staff member who had worked at the school longer said it was part of that student’s behavior plan to go to the quiet room.
“That wasn’t my plan,” Rose said. “That room scares me just looking at it as an adult.”
As the student became more agitated, Rose said her own anxiety rose. If the student didn’t calm down, the other employee told Rose she had to shut the door. Rose complied, and then her colleague told her to hold the door shut with her foot to keep the student inside, she said.
Inside the room, the student began having what appeared to be an anxiety attack and threatened to break the window. She calmed down after about 20 minutes, and Rose let her out. Rose said she was not directed to file an incident report, nor was she told if someone else in the district did, despite the requirement in state law that districts document every seclusion.
Over the holiday break that followed, Rose said she had trouble sleeping. “All I can think about is the student I put in that room,” she said. “School should be their safe place, and these students were not feeling safe.”
Shorey, the superintendent, said staff members are required to report every incident, but she did not know about the particular incident Rose described. Special Education Director Sue Terrill said it’s possible that a staff member other than Rose wrote a report, but the district was unable to locate any documentation of that event.
The district trains employees in safety care — crisis management and prevention practices — Terrill said. It is open to other trainings, too, she said, including one that Rose brought to Terrill’s attention in February offered by the Maine nonprofit Lives in the Balance, which other districts have used to dramatically reduce their reliance on restraint and seclusion.
Quiet rooms present a gray area
Rose said she saw staff members keep students in seclusion rooms even when they were calm, using those same rooms for a variety of reasons beyond seclusion, which is banned or strictly regulated in at least seven states, according to the MOST Policy Initiative, a Missouri nonprofit. Maine came close to banning the rooms in 2021, but the final version of the law was amended to allow their use in emergencies.
Rose said she saw staff place students in quiet rooms to calm down after acting out, and then not allow them to exit for 20 minutes after they calmed down. If the seclusion happened at the end of the school day, sometimes the student would be expected to return to the quiet room the next day, she said.
Terrill recalled Rose raising this as an issue but denied keeping students in the rooms after they calmed down and no longer met the legal threshold for confinement.
But the district does use these rooms as timeout spaces, either by student choice or by staff direction, Terrill confirmed. Often, Terrill said, staff members are positioned outside the rooms, as they would be in a seclusion incident, but the student is typically free to leave the room, which is not the case in a seclusion.
Sometimes, the door is open, or a student can choose to shut the door with a staff member standing outside, she said.
“It can be the same room used if the student was in seclusion,” she said. “But if they’re taking a break because of something that happened, and that’s being used as a break space, the student might continue to work in there until they’re ready to go back to the classroom.”
Like RSU 68 in Dover-Foxcroft, districts across Maine also use seclusion rooms as quiet spaces, according to Ben Jones, a former Disability Rights Maine attorney who now works for Lives in the Balance.
“I think it’s actually more the rare case that the school is like, ‘We’re going to build this room and we’re going to call it the seclusion room, and it’s going to be used just for seclusion,’” he said.
If a student has voluntarily shut themselves in the seclusion room with a staff member outside and is free to go at any time, it would not count as seclusion under Maine law, he said. But if staff members ask students to stay in there to complete their work, as Rose described, whether it would count as a seclusion that districts are required to report to the state is “open to interpretation,” Jones said.
“The overall thing is, the kid is not learning, not in the classroom, in something that could easily turn into seclusion,” he said. “It’s inappropriate at best and potentially illegal if it’s an unrecorded seclusion.”
When are students and staff in ‘imminent danger’?
Education technicians like Rose — aides who often work with students one-on-one or in small groups — are often the ones handling student outbursts or potential violence, said Greg Kavanaugh, who spent 13 years working as an ed tech and special education teacher in Biddeford, Portland, and Yarmouth.
Ed techs are among the lowest-paid professionals in education, and often the least trained — including on behavior management techniques.
“They’re having to make good decisions about when to restrain, when to seclude, and their judgment is going to be really hard because they’re so stressed, overwhelmed, underpaid,” Kavanaugh said. “That just leads to more mistakes, more lapses in judgment.”
In his experience, Kavanaugh said, restraint and seclusion were consistently treated as last-resort measures — used only in extreme situations.
Staff received training on managing student behavior, they debriefed after restraints and seclusions, and they held regular conversations with parents, he said, which disability rights advocates recommend as best practices.
But working in a functional life skills program with students with moderate to severe disabilities, Kavanaugh said, deciding whether to restrain or seclude a child was never easy despite clear protocols in place. Even when a student threw a laptop across the room or hit him, he had to determine whether the behavior posed an imminent danger of serious injury that would require medical intervention beyond first aid — the standard in Maine law — and only intervene physically if it did. He also had to keep calm if students hit him, he said, because that still did not meet the legal standard.
Every time he did restrain or seclude a child, it stayed with him long after. He said he often questioned whether it had been the right call, thought about how families would respond, and considered the lasting effects the practice might have on the student — and on himself.
“Anytime there was a hold, a restraint or a seclusion, you’re taking that home, and you’re thinking about that kid when you’re at home, trying to move on with your day,” he said. “I’m a pretty strong-willed person, but there are plenty of times I would quietly be in tears, or going home and having an extra glass of wine, because I’m just not processing it well in the aftermath.”
Other students in the classroom witnessing these incidents are also traumatized, Kavanaugh said.
“You see the terror on their classmates’ faces, and you feel bad for the kid in a certain way because this is going to hurt their relationships,” he said.
But talking to parents afterward would always make him feel better, Kavanaugh said, because parents of students with disabilities are often dealing with similar behavior challenges at home.

District response to a parental complaint
Emerson, the parent in Ellsworth, complained to the school board, Superintendent Amy Boles, and the Maine Department of Education in August 2024, alleging that staff members had not met the legal threshold for using restraint and seclusion so often on her son.
Boles wrote back in October, saying in cases where Emerson’s son was hitting, scratching, and kicking staff, “it is my conclusion that active behavior like this toward another person does create an ‘imminent danger’ that the other person could be sufficiently injured that he or she may need more than ‘routine first aid.’”
“The incident may not in fact have caused an injury requiring that level of care, but a reasonable and prudent person could reasonably conclude that this could occur,” Boles wrote in her letter, reviewed by Maine Morning Star.
But the investigation the district launched in response to Emerson’s complaint found that staff had improperly restrained and secluded her son in at least five of the 18 incidents to which his mother objected. Some incident reports were also vaguely written, Boles wrote, which was the case for the three-hour incident in October 2023 — making it difficult to determine whether restraints and seclusion were warranted.
Nonetheless, Boles concluded in her letter to Emerson that all staff need training on the proper use of restraint and seclusion, and she agreed the district should rely on the practice less often.
Boles declined to comment on the investigation or specific incidents, but said district staff have undergone an initial training with Lives in the Balance, and followup trainings are planned.
“Behavior is an issue across the board. I mean, it’s skyrocketing everywhere. It’s not just Ellsworth,” she said. “But we’re working really hard to try to be preventative before it gets to that extreme state, trying to teach staff day-to-day strategies to prevent the behavior before it escalates.”
Emerson said her son is still visibly shaken every time he passes by the school, or even when someone mentions the word “school” around him.
On April 23, she testified at a public hearing, telling Maine lawmakers restraint and seclusion in public schools must stop. The day before, her son had said he was still afraid to go to school in person.
“His world has become so small since these events, he rarely leaves our home,” she said. “Everyone continues about their day, and yet I’m left to pick up the pieces.”

(Troy Bennett/Maine Morning Star)About a decade ago, a Maine school district became concerned about how often staff members physically restrained students who were acting out and put them in seclusion rooms, especially the district’s 500 or so special education students.
Those tactics are only supposed to be used in emergencies under state law, but at the time, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 75 recorded 176 restraints and 152 seclusions on just 15 students, according to district-level data shared with Maine Morning Star. Staff were routinely scratched and bruised in the process, said Amy Hall, the district’s special education director.

“We started to get very concerned about the level of staff injuries, student injuries, and just the level of crisis we were dealing with in our schools,” Hall said.
So in 2018, the district decided to pursue an alternative. Today, because staff members now view student behavioral issues as a problem to prevent and solve, rather than an infraction to punish — and because of a significant investment in training to execute that shift in mindset — the 2,350-student district’s use of restraint and seclusion is down to the single digits: two restraints and seven seclusions in the 2022-23 school year.

The Maine Department of Education is touting that success story in the hope that more districts will sign onto MSAD 75’s approach and rely less on restraint and seclusion — when a staff member temporarily immobilizes a student and places them alone in a room until they calm down. Research has shown that the tactics “are not effective in altering a student’s behavior and that the experience of being restrained and secluded can be traumatizing and cause lasting effects for students,” according to the Maine DOE website. The state and some school districts have worked to reduce their use for years due to staff and student injuries.
The model MSAD 75 turned to was developed by a Maine-based nonprofit, Lives in the Balance, that works nationally and has been adopted by a handful of other districts — including the much larger Fairfax Public Schools in Virginia — to dramatically reduce their use of restraint and seclusion.
But despite that model’s success, it has not been widely adopted across Maine, according to Ben Jones, director of the organization’s legal and policy initiatives. Although Lives in the Balance has offered free technical assistance to districts since 2022 through a state Department of Education partnership, Jones said only two districts have followed up on the offer.
Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine who recently co-authored a report on student behavior, said the state is failing to provide adequate assistance to districts to make sure these tools can be implemented properly.
“Any one of these programs would decrease the behavioral crises, and then need for seclusion or restraint. But part of the issue there is that the state doesn’t really have the infrastructure to support implementation,” Wilkinson said.
In response to questions about state support, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for Maine DOE, said the department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them.
“What works in Falmouth isn’t going to work in Machias or Fort Kent, and that’s where folks at the district level need support to implement these approaches in a way that works for their population,” Wilkinson said.
Since 2021, Maine has limited the circumstances under which school staff can restrain and seclude students through a change in state law that aimed to nudge districts away from their frequent use. But recent complaints of worsening student behavior since the pandemic led to an effort to loosen those restrictions, which disability rights advocates fear could result in a spike.
The Topsham-area district, MSAD 75, is seeing that same increase in extreme behavior among younger students, Hall said, but relaxing the law on restraint and seclusion is not the answer.
“The mental health needs of our population of students have increased, while restraints and seclusions have dramatically decreased,” she said.
Instead, Hall advocates for educators to rethink how they view behavior. Most kids will do well in school if they can. Problems with behavior often signal a response to an underlying problem that educators need to uncover and address, she said.
“If a kid is not doing well, then we need to shift the way that we’re working with that student,” Hall said. “Once we get to a restraint or in a seclusion, you’re way too late.”
Changing how schools think about student behavior
The founder of Lives in the Balance, Ross Greene, a child clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical School faculty member, came up with the model based on a mindset shift that MSAD 75 adopted.
Greene’s approach helps schools address what he calls “concerning behaviors” without resorting to punitive measures, based on the idea that when children struggle with frustration, refuse to follow instructions, or can’t keep up academically or socially, their response is to act out.
“I get it, those behaviors are dangerous and scary and disruptive, but they’re communicating the exact same thing — they’re having difficulty meeting a particular expectation,” he said.
Rather than respond with punishment or continue to demand compliance, educators can work with the child to identify and address the underlying problems. By temporarily adjusting expectations and focusing on solving problems, educators can prevent behavioral issues from escalating and build students’ skills so they can meet expectations in the future, Greene said.
“The problem is that a lot of adults, not just in schools, see a kid who’s having difficulty meeting an expectation as being noncompliant, and what they do is they shoot for compliance,” he said.
Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model has been studied in students with significant behavioral challenges, including nonverbal students and students with oppositional defiant disorder, and those studies have found the model leads to notable improvements.
One district that’s advocating to loosen the state’s restraint and seclusion law, MSAD 11 in Gardiner, said it considered Greene’s model but worries that the approach is not enough to address increased reports of aggressive student behavior.
“Given that we’ve almost never experienced the type of dysregulation we’re seeing in very early learners, I am not confident that only going down the proactive pathway is a solution to the current context and climate that we are in,” said Angela Hardy, the district’s director of curriculum and instruction.
In the upcoming school year, Hardy said the district will try to implement some strategies that worked for MSAD 75 and that Greene advocates for, such as designing a learning environment that helps prevent incidents.
Classroom design as prevention
A special education teacher at the time, Samantha Lapointe started thinking that restraints and seclusions were no longer an option when MSAD 75 first made the change, even though the law permits their use in emergencies.
“It’s hard to imagine how you would do business without those tools, until you commit to thinking about not having them,” said Lapointe, who is now the district’s elementary special education coordinator. “That leads to a lot of thinking about what to do instead — and that leads you into new territory, right around what new skillsets need to be stronger, what prevention strategies need to be stronger.”
Classroom design is one element of prevention, Lapointe said. The idea is to minimize any danger in case a student acts out — and reduce the need for staff to physically intervene.
She started working with students on the floor, then brought in a sofa. When the school got new furniture, she requested two heavy, communal tables instead of individual desks that students could easily move or overturn. The tables also had to be low to the ground so students climbing atop them would not be in danger. And Lapointe hung all the posters high enough so elementary students couldn’t rip them off the walls. Staff also locked the closet that stored toys and activities.
“I’ve still had kids climb on tables, and I’ve had to ask myself, how dangerous is this really?” she said. “Is it an extreme, imminent risk of harm if they fall? You should be constantly weighing out what really constitutes danger to the extent that you would need to go hands-on.”
The other piece was training ed techs — aides who often work one-on-one with students — in the new approach.
“Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand,” Lapointe said. “The way you talk to kids matters a lot.”










Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand. The way you talk to kids matters a lot.

If a student tries to leave the classroom, for example, instead of stopping them, staff can start a conversation by asking them where they’re going, what they need to leave for and what their plan is after leaving, she said. Meanwhile, she also trained her staff to ask themselves: “What can I tolerate? Why can’t they leave the classroom? What’s the worst that’s going to happen?”
“The level of thinking and intentional decision-making needs to be very high, and that’s one thing also that I train my staff in: intentionality,” Lapointe said. “You must ask yourself, before you say anything, before you do anything: What is it you’re going to say or do and why? What outcome are you hoping to get?”
That’s the kind of training Maine teachers are asking for and largely not receiving, said Wilkinson with the University of Southern Maine.
“Teachers or ed techs will report, ‘We’ve been safety-care trained, we’ve had de-escalation training’ … all of these things that really only happen when a behavior gets to a certain point,” Wilkinson said. “That means that the behavior has to get to that point before they have the skills to deal with it. Teachers are not reporting that they’re confident with all of the things you would do before the behavior escalates.”
Even in the Topsham-area district, the training in Collaborative and Proactive Solutions isn’t complete. Lapointe said it’s now a priority to expand beyond special education to general education classroom teachers and higher grades.
A new approach
The Topsham-area district combines Greene’s model with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS — a research-based model used in schools across the country that’s built around positive reinforcement of good behavior and gradually increasing levels of intervention and consequences for kids who misbehave.
This is how the combination of the two models could look.
In the library, the expectation for all students is that they keep their voices low and read, Hall said. PBIS lays out a system to reinforce positive behavior, often through small rewards, and address infractions. But Greene’s approach would come into play if a student can’t keep quiet in the library, she said.
It may be that the child can’t focus, keep still, has sensory issues, or is too stimulated in that setting. Instead of punishing the child, teachers try to problem solve: They might offer them headphones, move their reading time to a quiet classroom, or even allow the child to leave the library, Hall said.
Moving away from demanding compliance from students helps educators understand and work with them to solve the issue underlying the behavior, instead of an outburst or aggression stemming from it, she said.
“Instead of just asking them to do the same thing over again and sustain in an environment that they can’t, you try to figure out what’s behind the behavior,” Hall said. “We still have rewards, and kids still have consequences, but the consequences just aren’t, ‘We’re going to put you in a seclusion room.’ Because that’s not a consequence, that’s a crisis response.”

When the Neighborhood Health workers first met this homeless man in Hartford, they weren’t sure he would be able to get around on his own again, or even if he’d survive. The flesh was rotting off his feet, and his tendons were exposed from frostbite.
But last week, squeezed into the back of the former ambulance they use to get around the city, they were watching a video of the man taking some of his first steps on new prosthetic legs. They craned their necks to see their colleague’s phone. 
They could see the patient smiling, hesitantly pushing a walker as he meandered down a hallway.
The man had been living on the streets of Hartford over the winter and couldn’t get into a shelter. As the homeless population has risen, shelter space has become more scarce and scenarios like his more common. 
The Neighborhood Health workers, employees of Hartford HealthCare, cheered when they saw him walking with the prosthetics. Then they climbed out of the ambulance, grabbing gloves on the way. They had more patients to help, more people with complex health care issues like his.

Launched in 2021, the team drives a refurbished ambulance to shelters or encampments, then provides health care on-site for people experiencing homelessness. They’re out nearly every day. 
In recent months, as more people, particularly seniors, have lost their housing, health workers are finding that the cases they handle are more complicated. People often have multiple diagnoses, and with older age groups, there are often health complications that make the illnesses or injuries harder to treat. Sometimes, conversations are veering to end-of-life care.
These conversations between health care professionals and patients are poignant as state lawmakers debate funding for the systems that offer shelter and other services for the unhoused population. The providers that would benefit from the state support — none affiliated with Hartford Healthcare — could help prevent many of the injuries the nurses see in the first place, health care workers said.
Homelessness in Connecticut increased by about 13% from 2023 to 2024. Recent data from the state’s response system shows that nearly 6,000 people are experiencing homelessness, and nearly 1,000 are living outside instead of in shelters. Providers have asked for $33.5 million for homelessness services to help with the increased population, but most budget proposals so far have suggested they’ll get only a fraction of that money.
“When you think about the fact that the average life expectancy of an unhoused individual is about 50 years, a 60-year-old is like dealing with a 90-year-old that’s housed, so these individuals are really sick and complex,” said Kelly Toth, system director of the Neighborhood Health Operations.

In the case of the older man with frostbite, workers did the best they could for him, bandaging and cleaning his wounds. But within days, his legs had to be amputated in the hospital. Soon after, another problem presented itself.
“They finished the acute stuff, but there was nowhere to send him, because no nursing home wanted to take him, because he’s homeless” and unable to pay, Toth said. “So they were going to discharge him to the street with no legs.”
It took 24 hours and more than a dozen health care workers, but Toth and her team helped find a place for him in a rehabilitation facility. He’s doing physical therapy while he learns to use his new legs.
The Neighborhood Health program started in 2021 with funding from Hartford HealthCare, grants from organizations such as the Connecticut Health and Educational Facilities Authority, Farmington Bank Community Foundation and TD Bank Charitable Foundation, as well as private donations.
The team works out of an ambulance that’s been retrofitted to allow for more seating and storage. The team offers a range of medical aid, from eye care to wound care and overdose prevention and treatment. Part of their goal is to keep health problems from getting worse — and even harder to treat — down the road.
Earlier this month, they gathered in a circle at the Hartford office to talk about the day ahead before clambering aboard the rig.
“We’re going to go to Pope Park first. There’s someone who got a gunshot wound in November and never followed up,” Toth said.

David Mingolelli, a physician’s assistant and street medicine lead, said they might see a patient there who has been getting treatment for an opioid use disorder. They have high hopes that he’ll get clean and plan to bring him another regiment of medication for the addiction.
Another nurse told the group that a service provider at Hands on Hartford, a nonprofit that offers housing and support services, told her they had a lot of folks who needed wound care, and everyone nodded as they packed up the ambulance to head out into the field for the day.
Throughout the day, the staff recalled the stories of different people they’ve treated: cuts on a man who was living in a dumpster and was accidentally picked up by a dump truck, a man on dialysis who needed help getting follow-up appointments, a woman who had leg surgery months ago and never got her stitches out.
Toth spent hours removing that woman’s stitches and staples while sitting on a milk crate in a public park. She fears the woman will get an infection.
“I told her, ‘Not only could you lose your leg, you could lose your life,’” Toth said.

End-of-life care
Two months ago, the team started working with inpatient referrals — meeting with people who come into the hospital for treatment but don’t have a place to go after. Sometimes, like in the case of the man who lost both legs, they try to find a short-term rehabilitation or nursing facility that can admit them. In other cases, they just make sure to follow up with them at their encampments or shelters.
In the coming months, they hope to expand to provide mobile medicine in the eastern part of the state.
Many of the people they treat don’t have watches or phones, Toth said. They don’t know what day it is or what time, and even if they did, transportation to get to follow-up appointments is a challenge.
They’re seeing more seniors, Toth added. The latest state data shows that more than 1,300 unhoused people were over 55, up from 800 last year.
It’s been a concern for the past couple of years as rents have risen and people on fixed incomes struggle to keep up. Toth said many of their patients also struggle to access shelters or warming centers in the winter because of mobility issues.
One warming center in Hartford is on the second floor of a building with no accessible entrance, she said. And sometimes, shelters only have top bunks available.
“It’s hard. Sometimes you feel like you’re trying to boil the ocean, but you just take it one visit and one patient at a time,” she said.
The growing number of seniors also means she’s having more conversations about end-of-life care. In one case, a patient with HIV was in and out of the hospital every couple of days. In another, an older man broke his femur and got an infection that could only be treated with IV antibiotics. The patients weren’t sure about entering the hospital full time, which is what their care required, Toth said.
“We need to figure out how we can support him out here the way he wants and have him still have control, do it his way, have dignity,” she said.
She said she’s asking questions she hasn’t had to in the past, such as: If we find you unconscious, do you want CPR? Do you want us to put a tube down your throat to breathe for you? Where do you want to be when you die?
“Within the last month, we’ve had multiple conversations popping up,” Toth said. “They don’t want to be in the hospital for six weeks for IV antibiotics, or they don’t want to undergo surgery. That’s OK, and I respect that, but it’s thinking about how we support them out here and make sure they’re comfortable.
“They can die with dignity and they can die where they feel safe, and if safe is a park bench that’s your home, that’s your spot. So it’s a crappy realization, but I think this is going to be something we are seeing more and more now that the population is getting older and sicker.”
Sarah Fox, chief executive of the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness, said her organization is focused on helping people get housed and increasing funding for the homeless response system. For years, providers have said they don’t have enough resources to meet the need.
“For people who are outside, you know, their mortality is increased exponentially,” Fox said. “People age so much faster because it is so stressful to be outside and to be unhoused.”

The budget request
As homelessness has increased over the past few years in Connecticut, more people are also living outside.
Homeless service providers, such as overnight shelters, this legislative session asked the state for $33.5 million.
The providers’ request includes $7.8 million for prevention, including legal and social services for people facing eviction, and flexible funding for things like rent aid, utility bills or other expenses that could help keep people housed.
It also seeks $19.5 million in crisis response, which includes annual funding for cold weather emergencies, and $6.2 million to increase the number of people getting housing vouchers through the state’s Rental Assistance program.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s budget proposal would have added rental assistance vouchers for senior citizens and people with disabilities, as well as a $5 million allocation for eviction prevention and additional funding for the homeless system’s response to cold weather. 
But that $5 million was set to come from the Connecticut Opioid Settlement Advisory Committee budget. The proposal has been controversial among lawmakers and advocates who say the state shouldn’t dip into that money for anything other than its intended purpose.
Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said during a press briefing last week that the details of the budget are still being worked out. But the legislature and governor are faced with difficult funding choices, as many programs say they need more money.
Lamont has favored a fiscally conservative approach to pay down debt. But that’s become more difficult to maintain as state officials grapple with federal budget cuts and which holes the state will fill.
The Appropriations Committee proposed spending less than Lamont did: $3.5 million for cold weather services.
Fox said that simply isn’t enough.
“We asked for $33.5 million to prevent homelessness, to respond to homelessness when it arises, and then to house individuals and ensure that they’re stable,” Fox said. “And it’s exactly still what we need. We need every dollar. And when we look at people with complex medical needs, or people who are literally losing their limbs because they aren’t able to get into a warming center, those are our neighbors, and that’s the lens that we look at this from.”
Earlier this year, lawmakers announced the launch of the Homelessness Caucus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers focused on improving services for the unhoused population. Caucus chair Rep. Kadeem Roberts, D-Norwalk, said he’s still talking to other lawmakers, trying to get them more money.
“We’ve just been trying to spread the word, putting a lot of pressure, not just on the governor’s office, but each one of these reps — you guys represent a population that is homeless in your communities,” Roberts said.

Housing Committee ranking member and Homelessness Caucus member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, called into question the state’s priorities. It’s been hard to get enough funding for homeless services, he said, and he thinks the state wastes money on other programs.
“These are the people that are the most vulnerable people in the entire state,” Scott said. “If we’re not here to help those folks, what are we doing here?” 
Fox added that putting people in shelters and preventing some of these medical needs will likely save the state money in the long-term by keeping them out of emergency rooms or urgent care.
That’s one of the goals of the Hartford HealthCare team as well. In addition to medical care, they carry supplies to take care of people’s basic needs. They keep Slim Jims and mini muffins in the ambulance, as well as a couple of stuffed animals in case they come across any children.
During the recent trip earlier this month, Talia Neves, a nurse with the Hartford Neighborhood Health team, examined one man’s tent and sleeping bag. They were wearing out, and she helped him make plans to get new supplies.
Two people with tents facing one another, and a clothesline stretched between two trees, needed new prescriptions for medication as well as treatment for a wound.

Discover how seamless transitions, flexible plans, and adaptive technology are setting the standard for the future of mobility.","It has been a defining and deeply devastating moment for the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season: two back-to-back monster storms battering the Southeast in a span of less than two weeks. First Helene, then Milton lashed Florida’s Gulf Coast with deadly flooding and destructive winds, as well as damage from unprecedented tornadoes generated by the second storm. The toll of two major hurricanes in such a short amount of time has left people in the Sunshine State reeling and communities in ruins, with barely any time to recover in between.
Few parts of the southeastern region were spared from this one-two punch of tropical weather. Only a week and a half before Milton, entire communities from Virginia to the Carolinas were left unrecognizable by the widespread wrath of Helene. Some were unreachable for days after being cut off by mudslides and washed-out roads and bridges. The catastrophic hurricane also knocked out power and cell service for millions of people, leaving residents in a virtual black hole as they frantically tried to reach their loved ones and even making it difficult to call 911.
Responding to historic disasters like these requires a massive relief effort comprised of agencies from all levels of government, along with nonprofits and mutual aid from utilities across the country. Among the thousands who didn’t hesitate to answer the call for help: dozens of Eversource crews from Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire who traveled to storm-ravaged Virginia to help turn the lights back on after Helene. 
In today’s world, staying connected is more than a convenience. It has become a fundamental part of how we work, travel, and engage with others. From remote professionals managing business on the go to families keeping in touch across cities, the expectation for seamless and reliable mobile access has never been greater.
The evolution of digital connectivity has shaped how we interact with technology. Mobile service is no longer just about making calls. It powers everything from virtual collaboration to entertainment and navigation. The shift toward flexible and adaptive mobile access reflects the changing demands of users who rely on their devices as essential tools for daily life.

The Demand for Seamless Transitions
One of the most significant transformations in mobile technology has been the push for smoother connectivity between home Wi-Fi and mobile data. Consumers expect their connection to move with them, whether stepping outside for a walk, commuting, or traveling across the country.
The rise of nationwide 5G networks has made this transition easier, allowing people to work remotely, stream content, and stay in touch without interruptions. As the workforce embraces hybrid models and businesses expand their digital reach, the ability to move effortlessly between networks has become crucial.
Connectivity should adapt to users, not the other way around. People expect mobile service that enhances mobility, instead of restricting them with outdated models or rigid contracts.
Flexibility in Mobile Plans to Fit Real-Life Usage
Traditional mobile contracts have often forced users into standardized tiers that may not align with their habits. Mobile needs vary widely. Some people use their phones only for essentials, while others rely on constant data access to stay productive.
Flexible mobile options are gaining traction. Pay-as-you-go models allow occasional users to pay only for what they need, while unlimited plans provide freedom for those who depend on continuous connectivity for work and travel. This shift represents a larger movement toward customizable digital experiences, where technology adjusts to individual lifestyles rather than locking users into predefined choices.
Why Seamless Integration Matters
For many, home internet and mobile service are no longer separate. They work together to create a unified digital experience. Whether joining a virtual meeting from a laptop, switching to a mobile hotspot, or streaming content across devices, users expect a simple transition between networks without disruption.
Mobile service providers now recognize that strong coverage is not enough. Consumers want ease of use, cost-effective bundling options, and integration that makes managing their digital experience simpler. As Wi-Fi-to-cell transitions become more reliable, people can move between environments without interruptions. This has become especially important for remote work, travel, and day-to-day communication.
Security and Reliability in a Mobile-First World
As digital interactions grow, mobile security has become increasingly important. Whether working remotely, conducting transactions, or managing sensitive information, protecting data on the go is a priority.
Consumers expect mobile providers to invest in privacy safeguards, encrypted connections, and network reliability. The rise of predictive troubleshooting and real-time customer support reinforces confidence in secure connectivity. Mobile service has become more than a tool for communication. It is now a critical part of both personal and professional life.
The Future of Mobile Flexibility
The way people communicate, work, and engage with digital technology continues to evolve. Hybrid workplaces are expanding, streaming services are growing, and connectivity plays a larger role in daily routines. Expectations for adaptive, user-focused mobile experiences will only increase.
This transformation is not about making mobile access more complicated. The goal is to make it effortless, reliable, and aligned with real-world lifestyles. People no longer want to adjust their habits around mobile plans. Instead, they expect providers to offer solutions that work for them, giving them mobility without limits.
A New Standard for Connectivity
In a digital world that never stops moving, flexibility in mobile service is no longer a luxury. It has become a necessity. As expectations shift and innovations bring new possibilities, seamless, integrated, and adaptive connectivity is setting the standard for how people stay connected, whether at home, at work, or on the move.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Featured-Image_Cox-Mobile-771x578.jpg,,,2025-05-25 05:02:07.316359

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)Jails are hard places made necessary by people like Ernest Hoefgen.
Few are likely to remember Hoefgen now, but back in September 1943 the 31-year-old escaped from the city jail at Cottonwood Falls. He’d been picked up for assault, according to newspaper accounts, and was using an alias. In reality, Hoefgen was an escapee from the Texas state prison at Huntsville, where he had been serving a life sentence for murder.
Stick with me, because this is not a story about a murder that took place eight decades ago, but about due process in America in 2025. I’ve been thinking a lot lately about the Constitutional guarantee of due process, which means everyone should have access to fair and adequate legal proceedings when the government threatens to deprive us of life, liberty or property. This is regardless of what Kristi Noem, director of Homeland Security, may say it and habeas corpus are.
Our thinking about courts and jails and their role in American society has been shaped by Hoefgen and other criminals like him. The reason “In Cold Blood” stays with us, apart from Truman Capote’s writing, is that it’s a story of a farm family in western Kansas who were murdered in a sensational way. It leaves us asking, why?
Movies, books and television also tend to blur our thinking about who is a criminal and who is not. If you’re in jail — or a detention center, as they’re likely called now — you must be a criminal, right? Well, no. There are plenty of people being processed in our jails right now who have committed no crime but who have violated relatively minor civil codes, comparable to getting a ticket from the city for the height of your grass. But unlike policing lawn care, there’s a gold rush related to immigration enforcement. There’s a billion-dollar detention industry hungry to fill beds with Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, and civil liberties are being eroded in the process.
ICE doesn’t like to talk about how much it pays facilities, or to have any of its contractors talk about how much they make per day for each detainee. Apparently, the first rule of ICE club is don’t talk about ICE club.
But let’s talk first about how jails are supposed to function.
In 1938, Hoefgen killed carpenter George Richet with a hatchet from Richet’s own toolbox. Hoefgen and a teenage girlfriend, Sylvia Phipps, were hitchhiking near Wichita Falls when the carpenter gave them a lift, according to the Associated Press. Hoefgen later told investigators he didn’t know why he killed Richet, who still had $8 in cash when his body was found by railway workers. The case remained unsolved for two years.
Both Hoefgen and Phipps were later picked up on forgery charges at Scottsbluff, Nebraska, found guilty, and sentenced to prison. In 1940, Phipps told the matron at the women’s reformatory she wanted to talk to investigators because she had witnessed the killing of Richet in Texas. When questioned, Hoefgen confessed.
We know all this about Hoefgen because of due process. The evidence against him was carefully detailed in court filings, he had advice from lawyers, and his court proceedings were open to the public and the press.
Hoefgen was sent to Huntsville to serve his life sentence, but he escaped — twice. After the second escape, he ran back to his home state of Kansas, where he married a local girl named Pauline and got into trouble at Cottonwood Falls. After escaping from the city jail, he stole another car and picked up a hitchhiker, 18-year-old Kansas State University student Bruce Smoll. When Smoll became suspicious, according to a United Press story, Hoefgen shot him to death. Rabbit hunters found the body a month later in a cornfield near Peabody, about 40 miles southwest of Cottonwood Falls.
Based on a hunch from Smoll’s father that Hoefgen may have been involved in his son’s death, and tips from Pauline’s parents, investigators found Hoefgen living in Denver and returned him to Marion County, where he was charged with Smoll’s murder.
Hoefgen’s story is full of odd details that, if you put them in a movie, would shatter the audience’s suspension of disbelief. When he and Phipps were in the county jail at Gering, Nebraska, awaiting trial on the forgery charges, they allegedly hatched a ridiculous jailbreak plot by hiding notes to one another in bananas and tomatoes. My interest in Hoefgen is because his last murderous jail escape began in Cottonwood Falls.
The Chase County Detention Center at Cottonwood Falls has received attention lately as being the last and largest ICE-contracted jail facility in Kansas. The 148-bed facility was built to turn a profit for this central Kansas county of 2,500, and it has been mostly full since the mass deportations began under the Trump administration. Back in 2021 and again earlier this month, I wrote about my discomfort with a picturesque Kansas county profiting from the misery of ICE detentions. Four years ago, the rate paid per day of inmate detention was $62.
Curious about how much Chase County is now receiving to house detainees, I filed a Kansas Open Records Act request for the facility contract. I was told to take a hike.
“Due to being a federal contracted agency,” Sheriff Jacob Welsh wrote in an email, “there are contract restrictions which I am not allowed to disclose any information about the contract.”
Requests, he said, were to be sent directly to ICE.
Welsh did not respond to a request to cite the KORA exemption he felt applied in the situation or to provide the language in the federal contract that forbade him from discussing the contract.
I did contact ICE for the contract but received an automated out-of-office reply from spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe. The email said she would respond when she returned “Monday, May 21.” As of Friday, I had not received a response from O’Keefe or any other ICE representative.
Max Kautsch, a First Amendment lawyer at Lawrence, told me that Welsh’s responses showed a lack of concern for open records and state law.
“The sheriff’s response violates the Kansas Open Records Act,” Kautsch said, “because he does not ‘cite the specific provision of law’ authorizing denial of the request,” which he must do under Kansas law.
There are legitimate exemptions to KORA that allow the use of federal law to deny requests, such as how public universities can deny some requests for student information under Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.
“If the sheriff insists on denying the request based on guidance he’s received from the federal government, he must come clear to the public and cite that authority, as KORA requires,” Kautsch said. “He also would need to explain why he is unable to produce even a redacted version of the requested records.”
Welsh’s response raises concerns about open government.
“These circumstances suggest, at a minimum, that the sheriff is indifferent to open records laws, attention to detail, or both,” Kautsch said. “That conclusion is bolstered by the fact that the inmate information portal on the sheriff’s website says access to records held by the Chase County Jail is purportedly governed by the ‘Kentucky Open Records Act.’ Their office is in Cottonwood Falls, Kansas. If the sheriff’s office can’t be bothered to properly identity its own state law on its own website, perhaps it is to be expected that it wouldn’t know how to respond to a KORA request, either.”
Why Kentucky?
I don’t know. Perhaps the template for the inmate portal was borrowed from the Muhlenberg County Detention Center.
To get a better understanding of what ICE detainees at Chase County and elsewhere go through, I contacted Kansas City, Missouri, immigration attorney Michael Sharma-Crawford.
For years, Sharma-Crawford told me, Chase County was the only immigration detention facility for most of Kansas and Missouri. There are now more counties being contracted, he said, especially in Missouri. In Kansas, for-profit CoreCivic is attempting to repurpose a shuttered prison in Leavenworth for ICE detention, but it has faced legal challenges and has not yet opened.
The issue with the current wave of detainments, Sharma-Crawford said, is the speed at which deportations are being carried out and the difficulty in tracking cases through the system. Migrants are typically given a handful of documents upon their arrest containing the specifics against them. Without access to those papers, it’s difficult for an immigration attorney to evaluate a case, he said, or to track a migrant’s case online. In many instances, he said, jails meant to house criminal detainees are unprepared to deal with civil immigration cases.
He commended Chase County on being willing to fax immigration documents to attorneys, while allowing the detainees to keep the originals, and to facilitate attorney-client phone calls.
“I’d take 12 Chase Counties compared to other facilities,” Sharma-Crawford said.
Access to legal counsel is an important Sixth Amendment right, he said, and this is especially important when deportation may now occur three weeks or less from the time of arrest.
“If you’re from Mexico, you have to move quickly,” he advised. “If you don’t know what your status is, you should talk to an immigration attorney.”
He also suggested having important documents, like birth certificates, at the ready, and being prepared to seek a second legal opinion when necessary.
Sharma-Crawford said the immigration system was broken and that things were building to a chaotic crescendo. The administration’s goal, he said, is to artificially clog the system and then claim it is impractical to give every detainee a hearing. But as late Justice Antonin Scalia said, due process applies to everyone.
It’s something average Americans should take to heart, no matter where they were born. It’s something that is being lost among the current rhetoric about crime and immigration. The vast majority of ICE detainees, he said, are held on civil charges.
“I don’t defend people against criminal charges,” Sharma-Crawford said.
If we don’t protect the due process rights of migrants now, he said, we might be denying due process for everyday civil infractions tomorrow, such as allowing your grass to grow too high.
“At some point, this leads to abbreviated trials” and other erosions of due process, he said.
The prospect of CoreCivic opening a thousand-bed facility at Leavenworth terrifies him. The previous prison operated by CoreCivic in Leavenworth was described as a “hell hole” of abuse and mismanagement. The city of Leavenworth sued to stop the facility from being reopened as an ICE detention facility, but on Thursday a federal judge dismissed the case.
While Chase County did not provide answers to my questions about how lucrative its ICE contract was, a 2024 report by the American Immigration Council provides some clues. It estimated the average daily rate for detention to be $237 per person, with single adults spending an average of 55 days in detention. The rate for Chase County, of course, might differ. But with nobody willing to talk, who knows?
Communities such as Cottonwood Falls and Leavenworth must weigh the price of monetizing ICE detainment in the age of Trump against the fundamental American values of fairness and compassion. Leavenworth wouldn’t directly share in the per-day rate as Chase County does, but there is the lure of jobs and economic development. It is a devil’s bargain, a Faustian pact, the civic equivalent of 30 pieces of silver.
Back in 1943, Hoefgen pleaded guilty in Marion County District Court to the murder of K-State student Smoll. He was sentenced to death.
Hoefgen was hanged shortly after 1 a.m. Friday, March 10, 1944, on a newly constructed gallows in a warehouse at the Kansas State Penitentiary at Lansing. His last meal had been fried chicken. He declined requests to speak to reporters and showed little emotion as he was led up the 13 fated steps, an eyewitness from the Associated Press reported. Hoefgen was the first person to be executed by Kansas since 1870.
The death penalty is currently legal in Kansas, but it hasn’t been used since 1965. The most notorious murderers executed at the Lansing gallows were “In Cold Blood” killers Dick Hickok and Perry Smith.
While it’s easy to see the story of Hoefgen as that of a criminal who got what he deserved, it’s also a saga of Constitutional due process. He was repeatedly brought before the courts in the downward spiral of his life, afforded lawyers, treated humanely and even given fruit while in custody. Whether you agree with capital punishment or not, there was no abbreviation of justice.
County jails were typically places where criminal defendants were sent to await their trials or where those convicted of misdemeanor crimes served sentences of a year or less. They were not places for defendants in civil cases. Criminal cases can result in punishment that includes jail time, while civil cases typically involve settling disputes.
The migrants now being rushed through the deportation pipeline deserve the full protection of due process. If we deny them legal representation and access to courts by accelerating their cases through a broken system, we are betraying core American values. We risk turning justice into an unthinking machine run by idealogues and fueled by the monetization of detainment.
It is either due process for all, or due process for none.

You know what TOD is, right?  Transit Oriented Development… building homes and offices near mass transit facilities.  Well, I’m going to suggest you think about TOR… Transit Oriented Recreation.


Did you know you can travel to many state parks and beaches by train and a connecting bus shuttle?  Details on this year’s program are still to come, but the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Department of Energy and Environmental Protection have partnered since 2021 to offer ParkConneCT from Memorial Day through Labor Day.
In years past, beach and park shuttles meeting in-coming trains have been free on weekends and holidays, taking you to places like Sleeping Giant State Park in Hamden or Hammonasset Beach State Park in Madison.
While many state parks close their gates on weekends when their parking lots are full of cars, the shuttle buses can still deliver you to Mother Nature without the hassles.
The state’s modest marketing efforts to attract tourists seem to be working as the number of visitors was up 2% last year.  Officials say tourism brings Connecticut $18.5 billion each year… more than what’s seen in Maine, which bills itself as “Vacationland.”
And it’s clearly our beaches that are a main draw.  Who needs to endure I-95 when you can take the train to visit…
…. Sherwood Island State Park in Westport:  Just take Metro-North to Westport Station and grab the Sherwood Island Shuttle from the station to the park to enjoy swimming, picnicking and great views of LI Sound.

… Silver Sands State Park in Milford:  Metro-North gets you to Milford Station where a walk or bike ride to the beach presents newly refurbished boardwalks, pristine beaches and bird-watching spots.
… or Bluff Point State Park in Groton:  Take Shore Line East or Amtrak to New London Station, then grab the SEAT (Southeast Area Transit) Route 11 bus to the beach where you can enjoy walks along the coast, biking and fishing.
Beyond TOR, how about TOE…. Transit Oriented Entertainment?
You wouldn’t think of driving to New York City to see a Knicks or Rangers game. You’d take the train, right? Well, you can take Metro-North directly to Yankee Stadium, too.
…Or to Bridgeport to see Ringo Starr or Jerry Seinfeld at the Hartford HealthCare Amphitheater… also walking distance from Amtrak and the Port Jefferson Ferry.
Going to see a play at The Shubert in New Haven or Andrea Bocelli at the XL Center in Hartford? Ditch the car and try mass transit.
And if you’re a rail fan, visit the Essex Steam Train & Riverboat by training to Old Saybrook and hopping into a cab for the quick ride back into history.
If you’re city-bound, check out Metro-North’s “MTA Away” packages… train and event tickets, often at a discount… for venues both in New York City and the ‘burbs. You can go star gazing or catch an outdoor concert in Forest Hills without a car.

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)TRENTON, N.J. – The U.S. government has sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson and Hoboken – and their elected officials – for city policies prosecutors say interfere with the Trump administration’s immigration detention and deportation goals.
Prosecutors want a judge to declare the policies an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which holds that federal law prevails over state law. They also want an injunction to block the cities from protecting their residents and visitors from immigration enforcement.
“The United States is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration, and the Federal Government is set to put a stop to it,” the lawsuit states. “While states and local governments are free to stand aside as the United States performs this important work, they cannot stand in the way. And where inaction crosses into obstruction, local governments break federal law. That is what is happening across New Jersey right now. It is past time it ends.”
The complaint, filed Thursday, names as defendants Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla and the cities’ council presidents (all four mayors are Democrats). Baraka and Fulop are among six Democrats running to become New Jersey’s next governor, and Baraka just two days ago beat another federal case against him over a contested immigration jail that recently opened in Newark.
Baraka blasted the latest prosecution as “absurd.”
“We are not standing in the way of public safety. We are upholding the Constitution, providing oversight, and following the laws and guidelines of the State of New Jersey,” he said in a statement. “Nothing in our policies prevents law enforcement from doing their jobs. What we refuse to do is turn our city into an arm of federal immigration enforcement, which the courts have already ruled is not our role.”
Fulop said he would not be “bullied” and vowed to fight the feds.
“Jersey City gets sued for being a sanctuary city — I guess MAGA ran out of conspiracy theories for the week,” he said. “Here is the truth: Jersey City’s policies protect families, reflect our values and have led to record low crime rates.”
And Sayegh dismissed the complaint as “a frivolous lawsuit and a flagrant affront to the rule of law.”
“We will not be intimidated, and we will fight this egregious attempt to score political points at Paterson’s expense,” Sayegh said.
Bhalla also said his city “will not back down.”
“The Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants, lawful residents, and countless citizens is truly disgraceful and often, unconstitutional. Families have been senselessly torn apart, and legal residents who have not been proven to have committed any crimes have been deported to jails overseas without due process. These actions of the federal government are truly barbaric, and Hoboken will not aid this lawlessness,” he said.
In the 24-page complaint, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors led by Yaakov M. Roth, acting assistant attorney general, accused the cities of denying federal immigration agents access to undocumented people in local jails, forbidding local police from delivering them to federal immigration agents, and barring “otherwise willing local officers from providing mission-critical information to federal immigration authorities.”
Prosecutors cite executive orders and police directives that the cities issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 during President Trump’s first term, but that remain in effect. Such policies prohibit “even the most basic cooperation with federal officials” and undermine immigration enforcement work, prosecutors argue.
“These efforts to shield illegal aliens within the Garden State are unlawful,” the complaint states.
The complaint also accuses city officials of discrimination, because they bar local police and municipal officials from cooperating only with federal immigration agents, not any other entity. Singling out one agency for unfavorable treatment constitutes discrimination, the lawsuit says.
“Such discriminatory targeting of the Federal Government is unlawful,” the complaint says.
The complaint comes three weeks after federal authorities began detaining undocumented people at Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed jail in Newark that has drawn protesters daily.
Jail officials initially had barred city officials from inspecting the facility, which led to Baraka’s arrest earlier this month when he visited the site seeking entry. Prosecutors on Monday dropped charges against Baraka but then charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting officers by acting as a human shield to protect Baraka from arrest. She denies the charges, and Congressional Democrats from around the country have denounced that arrest.
Immigration advocates decried the lawsuit filed Friday as the feds’ attempt strong-arm local governments into carrying out federal immigration enforcement.
Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the cities’ policies don’t violate federal law but instead “reflect a clear separation between local and federal responsibilities.” She urged the cities to resist caving to federal “bullying.”
“Over the last few months, the Trump Administration’s DOJ has made it clear that they want to make an example out of New Jersey — first by raiding our cities, then by expanding ICE jails in defiance of local law, and most recently by arresting elected officials and charging sitting members of Congress with felonies,” Torres said in a statement. “It is clear that the DOJ remains hellbent on making a national example out of New Jersey. In return, NJAIJ calls upon the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken to be a national example of resistance, dissent, and champions for justice.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A group of 19 community organizations have joined forces to push for oversight of police surveillance in Milwaukee. Together the groups signed an open letter addressed to the city’s common council, asking it to adopt a Community Control Over Police Surveillance (CCOPS) ordinance.
The measure would require existing surveillance technologies used by the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) to receive a public hearing and be subject to approval by the Milwaukee Common Council.  The ordinance would also require the department to produce an annual report of surveillance gear. 
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
“The proliferation of surveillance technology by the Milwaukee Police Department has occurred with virtually no transparency, no opportunities for community input and — without a real opportunity to reject surveillance techs or advocate for critical guardrails — presents significant threats to civil rights and civil liberties that hurts us all but disproportionately impact communities of color, queer communities, people seeking reproductive healthcare, immigrant communities, people fleeing violence, and low-income communities,” the coalition states in its letter. 
“While we trust our local elected officials in Milwaukee, in light of the current political climate and the uncertainty surrounding future administrations at both the federal and state levels (both in Wisconsin and in other states), it is critical that our community has a say in if and how invasive surveillance technologies are used, how they are deployed against residents, if and how their data is stored and shared with third parties, and whether spending our limited tax dollars on surveillance technologies is the best way to promote public safety,” the letter adds.
CCOPS ordinances have already passed in 26 cities nationwide, and calls to rein in the flow and development of police surveillance technologies have grown in recent years in Milwaukee. Last year, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin began advocating for CCOPS ordinances in the Badger State, prompted by a lack of discussion on the issue and the impending Republican National Convention during the summer of 2024. 
As with the 2020 Democratic National Convention four years earlier, the RNC brought with it an influx of new equipment that allowed MPD to augment its surveillance network. Before the DNC the police department upgraded its mobile phone surveillance gear, expanded a camera network capable of using automatic license plate reader technology, and purchased vans equipped with cameras and drones. The RNC likewise opened the door for a new open source intelligence software, growing MPD’s social media surveillance capabilities. 
 
CCOPS Coalition Letter to Common Council
 
During the summer of 2020, many people who joined protests following the death of George Floyd witnessed these technologies, and reported suspicions that they were being monitored. As time passed, investigations revealed that local police departments monitored social media closely and drew information from confidential databases, with one agency funneling much of what it’d learned into a “target list” of nearly 200 people. The list had been shared with dozens of local, state, and federal agencies from Milwaukee to Kenosha. 
Since then more attention has been focused on intelligence units such as the MPD’s fusion center, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s “MATRIX Group”, and on technologies including drones, wiretap devices, gunshot detection sensors like Shotspotter, and spyware. More recently, Milwaukee residents have begun to express concerns about MPD’s plans to acquire facial recognition technology.

The accumulation of these issues spurred the group of 19 community organizations to sign the letter calling for CCOPS. The coalition includes Planned Parenthood, Black Leaders Organizing Communities (BLOC), the ACLU of Wisconsin, Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, Ex-Incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO), Voces de la Frontera Action, ComForce, Citizen Action of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee County League of Women Voters and others.  
The letter states that “policies are increasingly enacted, and local governments and their surveillance mechanisms will likely be used to target individuals seeking or providing these services. This scenario is particularly alarming given that Black, Brown, Muslim, queer, low-income, and immigrant communities are already disproportionately affected by law enforcement practices.” 
The letter suggests the stage is being set to repeat law enforcement spying scandals from the 1960s and ‘70s.
“Without robust oversight, we risk a resurgence of COINTELPRO-like tactics, where surveillance was used to suppress political dissent and target minority groups, including Dr. Martin Luther King Jr,” the letter states. “At a minimum, people who live, work, visit, or attend school in Milwaukee deserve to know if and how they’re being surveilled and who has access to that surveillance data.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2403-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-24 11:04:53.093139

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.

“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
  Cash cow 

Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.

Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
  David vs. Goliath 

After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.




States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network



But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much (help) coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“(States) are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
 

When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
  State solutions 

Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)In November of 1976, after graduating from high school I went to the polls, and along with more than 75,000 Alaskans, voted YES on Proposition 2; this vote created Alaska’s Permanent Fund (PF). It continues to amaze me that more than 30,000 Alaskans voted against this measure.
We were blessed to have wise leaders who had the foresight back in 1976 to ask Alaskans if we should save a portion of our non-renewable resource; making it a renewable resource in the corpus of the PF.
The vote on Proposition 2 has created enormous wealth for Alaska and is the envy of other states. Today, Alaska’s PF and Earnings Reserve Account (ERA) has over $80 billion and is being managed and invested by experienced financial professionals. 
In addition to the deposits discussed above, the Legislature with the support of the Governor has deposited billions more into the fund’s corpus and appropriated hundreds of millions more in inflation proofing deposits to maintain the value of the PF.
The PF consists of two separate, but related accounts; the corpus or principle of the PF and the ERA, which receives earnings and realized gains from the PF investments. The corpus of the fund is constitutionally protected. The ERA is not; it can be appropriated — spent — with a simple majority vote of the legislature.
Senate Joint Resolution 14 currently resides in the Senate Finance Committee and proposes to ask Alaskans to combine Alaska’s PF and the ERA into one account. Simply put, this resolution proposes two changes: 1) the balance of the ERA shall be deposited in the corpus and become part of the PF principle and 2) the Legislature MAY appropriate from the PF an amount that is NOT more than 5%. 
Part 2 is particularly important. Currently the Legislature is withdrawing 5% to meet the public’s needs and balance the state budget. There is growing concern with falling oil prices, dwindling savings accounts, and few, if any, revenue options, that the Legislature will move to withdraw more than 5% to meet current needs. Placing the 5% withdrawal limit in the constitution will protect the remaining realized earnings in the corpus/principal of the PF and provide a known revenue stream for sound fiscal policy planning.
I believe that if the Legislature passes SJR14 as soon as possible, it would allow Alaskans to debate this important issue.
The Board of Trustees of the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. has recommended combining the ERA with the corpus of the PF. As a former legislator and a former Senate Finance committee co-chair, I have come to trust the knowledge of the staff at the APFC and value the experience and recommendations of the members of the Board of Trustees.
The Senate Finance Committee sponsor statement for SJR 14 says it best: “Consolidating the two accounts follows globally recognized best practices for endowments and trusts. A single-fund model ensures all earnings are retained and reinvested within the fund, eliminating the need for inflation-proofing, and the endowment model structure guarantees an annual, sustainable POMV transfer. Additionally, constitutionalizing the draw protects the Permanent Fund, preventing the legislature from making ad hoc draws on the Fund.”
As a more “mature” woman, retired, with decades of work experience and community service I support combining the corpus of the PF and the ERA. 
Given the opportunity, I will vote YES on a constitutional amendment, to secure the PF for future generations of Alaskans and provide a sustainable and predictable revenue stream for our state.

Elevators were scorched. Conveyor belts collapsed. Metal doors melted. As smoke filled the sky, employees scrambled to escape. One dialed 911.
“The plant’s on fire,” he hurriedly breathed.
“Is everybody out of there?” The dispatcher asked.
“Working on it.”
Local fire crews extinguished the blaze at the Archer Daniels Midland plant about three hours later. Equipment failure likely created a spark. But the product upon which ADM built an empire was most responsible for the destruction: grain.
Processing grain generates a highly explosive byproduct, dust. Industry guidelines recommend, and experts encourage, that companies install machines to capture airborne dust and routinely clean dusty areas. A few days after the explosion, ADM assured the community it was qualified to handle the emergency. “Safety is always our top priority,” a spokesperson told the Fremont Tribune. “ADM has extensive processes and procedures in place.”
A federal safety inspector found a different story.
About two weeks after the explosion, the inspector arrived and immediately spotted the problem: Dust-coated walls and pipes. As the inspector collected samples, the plant manager grew irate.
“I know I have a dust problem,” the plant manager confided.
Near the top of the Fortune 500, with annual profits exceeding several billion dollars each year, ADM has long dominated American grain processing. It underpins the agriculture and food industries, producing feed for livestock and artificial sweeteners for Coca-Cola. It has touted its safety record, and it recently highlighted that it was named “one of America’s most responsible companies.”
However, despite its vast resources and awareness of the risks, ADM has failed to prevent a series of recent grain explosions, according to interviews with experts and a review of federal, state, and local records obtained by Investigate Midwest.
Disregarding industry best practices and government warnings, the company has allowed dust to accumulate to unsafe levels, has failed to maintain equipment designed to prevent explosions properly, and has not developed procedures for safely removing dust.
In total, one person has died and 15 employees and first-responders have suffered life-changing injuries.
The death occurred in Iowa in 2019. After a fire had started in a grain silo, ADM allowed fire crews to blast the product with water. Research going back decades showed the best way to handle a silo fire was to close all openings so it could burn out. Pressurized water only generates grain dust, creating fuel for the fire. ADM employees had no idea. As firefighters hosed the fire from the silo’s roof, it blew.
Two government investigations concluded ADM’s mismanagement was at least partly responsible for the death. ADM has denied this.
The same year, a section of ADM’s North American headquarters in Decatur, Illinois, exploded.
Again, mismanagement contributed, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration found. ADM had not studied how destructive dust could be. Contractors had flagged incorrectly installed parts and parts needing replacement on the facility’s dust collectors, but no maintenance was performed.
Two more explosions rocked the facility in 2023. OSHA found the same problems: poor maintenance. Eleven workers suffered third-degree burns across their faces and bodies. ADM is contesting the government fines.
Between 2018 and 2024, ADM has had eight grain explosions, or about 13% of all such incidents in the agriculture industry, according to Purdue University research. Only two other companies have had more than one during that time period. Investigate Midwest also identified a handful of other grain fires at ADM facilities.
John Newquist, a former OSHA administrator who now trains companies on dust explosion prevention, said there’s little doubt ADM had policies in place addressing the problem.
“The real, million-dollar question is, Why didn’t they follow their own program? This is one of the 500 largest companies in the United States,” he said.
“They have everything to do it right. They have the money. They have the resources. There is no excuse for a big, billion-dollar company to have any dust explosions.”
Over the past six months, Investigate Midwest has repeatedly sought comment from ADM, first contacting spokeswoman Jackie Anderson in early November. She declined an interview request but asked for specific questions. Despite two rounds of detailed, written inquiries and repeated follow-ups since then, she has not responded.
In corporate documents, ADM has said safety is a top concern. Most years, about 80% of its locations, including about 200 North American processing facilities, have recorded no worker safety incidents, the company reported. After the 2023 explosions, ADM admitted in corporate records its “safety performance did not meet our expectations,” though it did not mention the incidents specifically.
“Our people are our lifeblood,” ADM has said. “We are refocusing our efforts in both occupational and process safety in support of our vision of Safe or We Don’t Do it. We remain committed to fostering a safe working environment for all of our employees and contractors.
ADM added it was “enhancing efforts” related to maintenance activities, risk management and employee health.
Preventing dust buildup can be challenging, said Kingsly Ambrose, a Purdue University professor and authority on grain dust explosions. Facilities process large volumes of grain, which is jostled around as it’s transported up and around the building. This flings grain dust into the air. “When it gets suspended in air, that’s the major challenge,” Ambrose said. In that scenario, even a small fire can lead to a massive conflagration.
“If anyone sees dust,” he said, “better to clean it up immediately.”
ADM has, at times, been slow to address maintenance issues. A stark example is the aftermath of the Christmas Eve explosion in Nebraska, which has not been previously reported. Newquist said the discussions detailed in the OSHA investigation are “rare” — company managers and executives are generally more tight-lipped.
After getting upset, the plant’s manager, Eric Stanley, took the safety inspector to his office. Stanley, who told the inspector he was “under intense pressure” from his bosses, unburdened himself. He had not stopped working in the week since the fire, he said, and he knew the facility was behind on dust maintenance.
Eventually, Stanley told the inspector he was “happy” OSHA was now investigating. When asked why, the inspector later wrote, “Stanley stated that (ADM) is finally doing things that needed to be done. (He) indicated that he has brought things to their attention in the past and no action was being taken.”
After OSHA’s visit, the plant was shut down for about a week. Soon after, ADM fired the facility’s maintenance contractor, A-Lert Construction Services, a Kansas-based company that installs and maintains dust collection systems. When the inspector interviewed an A-Lert manager, he seemed salty at the dismissal. ADM did not fix anything “until it was broken,” the manager said.
A-Lert did not respond to requests for comment. ADM did not comment on A-Lert’s responsibilities.
A-Lert’s performance later became a central issue at a meeting — it’s unclear where, based on reports — between OSHA and ADM. The inspector, Stanley and an ADM corporate lawyer were present.
Also attending was a longtime safety executive, David Frazelle. His tenure at ADM began in 1979. Over the years, he traveled the country to hand out safety awards, and he defended ADM against OSHA oversight. In one case, OSHA fined the company $7,000 for exposing workers to an unsafe manlift. Before an administrative law judge, Frazelle successfully argued the manlift was exempt from OSHA protections. At the time of the meeting, he was the executive in charge of safety for all of ADM’s milling operations, the places most at risk for dust explosions.
Frazelle said A-Lert employees lacked strong mechanical skills and were unqualified to work at the Fremont facility. Then, he acknowledged Stanley had told the truth: The plant manager had been raising the alarm for a while.
“I’m going to say something that our attorney isn’t going to like,” Frazzelle said, according to the inspector’s notes. “Eric has been trying to get rid of the maintenance company for quite some time.”
Frazzelle retired in February. Asked for comment, he replied to an Investigate Midwest email with a screenshot of ADM’s media relations webpage.
A century of dust explosions
Dust explosions have plagued the industry for at least a century, almost as long as ADM has existed. In 1919, a Cedar Rapids, Iowa, starch factory blew, killing 43. Five years later, 42 died at a corn processor in Pekin, Illinois. In 1927, ADM formed its grain division.
Deadly incidents continued throughout the 20th century. In the late 1980s, a rash of explosions prompted OSHA to act. A new rule forced companies to practice preventative maintenance, write housekeeping policies and create escape plans. The agency also defined how much dust was considered safe, an 1/8 of an inch. “If you can write dust on the floor, that’s too much dust,” said Newquist, the former OSHA administrator.
Since the rule, the number of dust explosions, and the number of deaths, has decreased dramatically, according to OSHA. Still, dangers exist. In 2008, at the Imperial Sugar Company in Savannah, Georgia, managers had allowed “massive accumulations” of sugar dust to build up. The explosion killed 14 and injured dozens. OSHA fined the company more than $6 million.
Experts said, overall, facilities that generate dust have made strides in preventing incidents. In the past decade, the agriculture industry has averaged about eight explosions per year, according to Purdue University figures. It’s a good sign the average isn’t changing, Ambrose said. At times, though, he’s surprised at the lack of knowledge of some of the industry insiders he trains. “They never knew that dust could explode,” he said.
ADM has its own history of incidents. In 1998, five men were injured at its Decatur facility. They were investigating a smoldering fire inside a piece of equipment, and, when they opened it, the full blast hit them. Explosions also occurred in 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2011. Few injuries were reported, but one man died.
In 2013, ADM aimed to improve its overall safety management, which included a “focus on serious and potentially serious events,” according to corporate documents. In June 2016, it announced it had just had its safest year in company history. Adding to the good news, a press release proclaimed ADM had reduced all workplace incidents by two-thirds in the past decade.
In the press release, ADM’s president and CEO, Juan Luciano, said workplace safety had become a “cornerstone of our culture, but our work won’t be complete until we have eliminated 100 percent of the incidents and injuries companywide. We have an ongoing journey to zero.” It was important to take time, he continued, “to reflect on what we’ve done well and also what we can do better in the future.”
While ADM was trumpeting its safety culture, its negligence, OSHA found, was laying the groundwork for a devastating dust explosion.
Months after Luciano’s statement, a maintenance contractor inspected a chemical suppression system at the Decatur facility. The system was critical to preventing explosions. It was linked to an indoor bucket elevator, which shot grain upward and flung dust into the air. If the suppression system sensed an ignition, it would suffocate the fire, preventing destruction. The National Fire Protection Association, which sets industry standards, requires the system to be inspected every three months.
But no one else would inspect the system for years, with life-altering consequences.

ADM allowed first-responders to douse a smoldering silo. It was a fatal choice.
Two hours before sunrise on Saturday, Jan. 5, 2019, at ADM’s Clinton, Iowa, facility, a group of contractors arrived at a row of six concrete silos along the Mississippi River. Each silo was about 100 feet tall, 24 feet wide and more than a foot thick. Typically, about a thousand workers bustled around the facility, but on weekends, there was a skeleton crew, including contractors.
What they found that morning would prove deadly.
Inside one of the silos, wet, processed corn had crusted into a hardened bridge. The contractors had been blasting the blockage with water for months, trying to break it apart. The night before, they’d opened the silo’s hatches, allowing air to flow through. As they began again that morning, they noticed the corn material tumbling out — it was black, burnt.
The product had self-ignited. When stored, organic material can produce its own heat. Any exposure to oxygen can start a fire.
Silo fires have been a known risk for decades, and a growing body of research prior to 2019 showed what factors caused them and how to prevent smoldering burns from turning into destructive explosions. In 1988, Pennsylvania researchers published a study with a succinct conclusion: “Do nothing to increase the level of oxygen or air inside the silo,” the authors wrote. “Opening the top hatch cover to dump water or foam inside can create an explosive mixture.”
Simply, the best way to handle a silo fire is to close any openings and let it burn itself out. No one at the ADM facility that day knew that.
ADM did not answer questions about what its corporate safety team understand about silo fires or whether any plant personnel were trained on how to handle them safely. Small fires had occurred in the silos before, but ADM did not answer questions about what lessons were learned.
Alerted to the fire, ADM plant managers quickly gathered to determine how to proceed. They asked the contractors to douse the fire, but the contractors refused, citing lack of training. Around the same time, managers announced the emergency over the radio and called the Clinton Fire Department.
At 5:52 a.m., fire trucks arrived, and first-responders huddled with plant management about 500 feet north of the smoking silo.
ADM has hotly contested what happened next.
Two independent investigations, by a state office and a federal agency, concluded firefighters were given inaccurate information that determined their response. They were not told the silo contained potentially explosive corn material. Instead, they understood it housed a less flammable product. An explosion was also unlikely, they were told, because contractors had been soaking the material for months.
ADM has denied the findings. In a later court case, company lawyers deposed a firefighter who said ADM staff told him the silo could blow because of “corn dust.” The company claims the firefighter did not tell his supervisors.
ADM has not disputed what happened after, as detailed by the two government investigations.
As smoke filtered from the silo, the fire department and plant management continued to debate the best approach. Firefighters noticed a hatch about 13 feet off the ground, large enough for a person to squeeze through. Could they pump water through it? An ADM manager cautioned against it, arguing the burning product could spill onto those who opened the hatch.
Then, it was decided water would be pumped from the roof of the silo, through a top hatch. The fire department’s ladders could not reach the roof. Two men would have to summit the silo, shouldering 50 feet of hose, and connect the nozzles. Eric Hosette, 33, and Adam Cain, 23, prepared themselves.
An ADM employee guided the firefighters along a catwalk that led to the silo’s roof. With no respirator, the smoke overcame him. He was forced to turn back several feet from their destination. He pointed to the roof and rushed away. Hosette and Cain walked through a gray haze of smoke and dust to reach the opening. They began pumping.
On the ground, a new ADM manager arrived. He told the assembled crew the burning bridge was likely below the hatch, the one firefighters had originally wanted to open. Firefighters could likely extinguish the fire in relative safety. As the manager spoke, around 8:45 a.m., gray smoke turned white.
Then, a roar.
Hosette was hurled toward the ground and landed near the river. His colleagues rushed to revive him as a helicopter was called. At the hospital, he died from his injuries.
Attention then turned to Cain. ADM employees and firefighters searched the area but were unable to find him.
After about 30 minutes of searching, a contractor told firefighters the hatch had a viewport. No one had volunteered this information before. When firefighters peered through, they saw Cain sitting semiconscious on the bridge, among chunks of the roof.
Cain was hospitalized for three weeks. He declined an interview request, saying he wanted to move on. Hosette’s widow could not be reached.
The Iowa Occupational Safety and Health Administration completed its investigation in early 2019. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s worker safety arm, released its report in January. (The pandemic delayed its release, a spokesperson said.)
Iowa OSHA found ADM had failed to prepare its plant personnel to handle the emergency. Managers who assumed responsibility during the incident were “not properly trained.”

They did not effectively organize the company’s response, including assigning staffers to roles they were not qualified for, such as guiding firefighters to the silo’s roof. Because of poor training, “vital information” — such as the silo’s destructive contents or the presence of a viewport — was not communicated to first-responders.
ADM commissioned its own third-party investigation from Exponent, which specializes in workplace safety reviews. The report, obtained by Investigate Midwest, did not examine the company’s role in the explosion. Instead, it examined the explosion’s root cause: Water pumped through the silo’s top hatch. (Its author, Sean Dee, who spoke at two ADM-sponsored events before his investigation, did not respond to requests for comment.)
The report concluded the buildup of combustible gas in the silo was the explosion’s likely cause, but the presence of dust “could not be ruled out.” In this scenario, the water stirred up the grain dust. Side hatches left open overnight likely fanned the flames, but the water generated ample fuel.
In April 2019, Iowa safety inspectors explained their findings to plant management and lawyers. During the meeting, ADM “expressed concern regarding the penalty size,” inspectors noted. The company was fined about $56,000, less than many plant workers’ yearly wages.
As Iowa’s investigation concluded, ADM faced questions about its actions at another facility, about 200 miles south.
At ADM’s flagship plant, dangerous dust problems were ignored
Two days after the April meeting in Iowa, federal safety inspectors visited ADM in Decatur. The campus, on the Sangamon River’s banks, is almost two square miles and provides the city’s only skyline. A few thousand employees and contractors work there. The inspectors were investigating a series of failures that had led to a fireball blowing a hole in a grain elevator.
Missed opportunities to prevent the destruction stretched back to the previous summer. During an inspection, a technician noted that parts on a dust collector needed replacing. On another dust collector, parts were incorrectly installed.
Six months later, a technician inspected the same collectors, and discovered the same problems. Yet another dust collector was also likely malfunctioning, but, the technician told the feds, he was “allowed very little time to investigate” the problem.
Also, ADM had not analyzed the risk dust posed to its facility, which is considered an industry best practice. The company didn’t even have guidelines written down for how to analyze such a risk, inspectors found. Without a policy, ADM was missing a “critical step” in determining how to prevent dust explosions.
ADM’s response to the explosion was haphazard as well, safety inspectors discovered during their April visit. After the blast, the company installed two chemical suppression systems, which could snuff out flames. However, it was unclear if the systems were “operational and effective.” Nothing documented their proper installation.
Despite the litany of issues, accountability proved elusive. In a July 2019 letter, federal officials informed ADM that “no OSHA standards generally apply to the majority of the concerns.”
In cases where specific violations aren’t on the books but an unsafe environment exists, OSHA can wield what’s called the “general duty clause.” Essentially, it ensures employers provide an overall safe workplace. The standard is rarely invoked.
In this case, OSHA officials decided it was “not considered appropriate at this time” to use the general duty clause. There would be no citations, no fines.
“In the interest of workplace safety and health,” an official told ADM at the time, “I recommend that you voluntarily take the necessary steps to eliminate or materially reduce any employee exposure” to dust explosions.
ADM did not answer Investigate Midwest’s questions about what new safety measures it implemented following OSHA’s admonishment.
In 2022, ADM’s corporate leadership unveiled a new slogan for its facilities: “Safe or We Don’t Do it.” The company announced, “We have improved our investigation work processes with a goal to prevent repeat incidents.”
The new focus was almost immediately put to the test.
Back-to-back explosions rock the Decatur plant
Around 2:50 p.m. on April 20, 2023, Antonio McElrath clocked into work on the western half of the Decatur campus. His job was in an area where grain flew through conveyor belts and bucket elevators, stirring up dust. By the time he entered, dust littered the interior.
For ADM workers, nothing about the situation seemed amiss, according to a lawsuit McElrath later filed. The outgoing shift did not indicate anything was unusual. But unknown to McElrath, the dust had already reached dangerous levels.
Later in the workday, employees discovered a bucket elevator was smoking. It was outfitted with a chemical suppression system, which theoretically could suffocate any nascent fire. But the system had not been inspected since late 2016. If it had been, inspectors would have found it was inoperable.
As smoke filled the area, McElrath was directed where to stand by his immediate supervisor, according to his lawsuit. The bucket elevator was opened. An influx of oxygen hit the smoldering grain. He heard a deafening pop.
He suffered third-degree burns across his face, torso and legs. Doctors placed him in a coma for three weeks. “He has lifelong injuries,” his lawyer said. Two other men were hospitalized with severe burns. One suffered permanent damage to his arms, hands and fingers. Another’s entire body was torched. (The men could not be reached for comment through their workers compensation attorneys.)
While their coworkers recovered, plant employees had a short reprieve. Around 7 p.m. on Sept. 10, 2023, a building processing soybeans was torn open. The explosion was one of the worst in the agriculture industry in recent years.
Eight employees were injured. Helicopters rushed at least four to trauma centers. One man was transported 150 miles east to Indianapolis for specialized burn treatment, according to the Decatur Herald & Review. Another man’s lungs were burned. A single mother of two suffered burns on her back. (None of the workers could be reached for comment.)
A month later, OSHA fined ADM $325,000 for the April explosion. The company’s failure to inspect the chemical suppression system for several years was a major reason for the hefty fine. Also, OSHA mandated the company develop a “written housekeeping plan” — which it first suggested the company do after its 2019 explosion — to ensure dust does not reach dangerous levels.
ADM is contesting the fine, which is currently at about $200,000. While the fine amount is debated, OSHA’s investigation into the April 2023 explosion remains open. The agency fined ADM about $50,000 for the September 2023 explosion, and that investigation also remains open, as ADM contests the fine. (Detailed accounts about how the explosions started are not available until the investigations are administratively closed.)
David Horn, a Decatur city council member, said, if “systemic issues” plague ADM’s operations, the company must address them. But assessing the quality of ADM’s safety oversight will be challenging if the company is not sharing information publicly, Horn said.
The only communication between the company and the city about the explosions appears to be a single email exchange. Gregory Webb, an ADM lobbyist, forwarded the company’s public statement about the September explosion to Decatur Mayor Julie Moore-Wolf. She replied, in full, “Thank you!”
When asked about her communication with ADM, Moore-Wolf said, “My initial concerns were about the injured workers, and their progress toward recovery. I do not recall specific dates or details of communications regarding the accident.”
Without a full accounting of the changes ADM is pursuing, it can be difficult to trust the company’s actions, Horn said. “I think it would create greater confidence among our city residents to hear from ADM: This is what happened, these are the steps that we have taken since then and this is why these types of incidents won’t happen again.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Admfinal-2-1024x768.png,,,2025-05-24 10:01:58.272944

The Tulsequah Glacier meanders down a broad valley in northwest British Columbia, 7 miles from the Alaska border. At the foot of the glacier sits a silty, gray lake, a reservoir of glacial runoff. The lake is vast, deeper than Seattle’s Space Needle is tall. But it didn’t exist a few decades ago, before 2 miles of ice had melted.
On an overcast day, a helicopter carrying three salmon scientists zoomed up the valley. As it neared the lake, the pilot banked to the right and flew over the south side of the basin, whirring over a narrow outlet where it drains into the Tulsequah River. He landed on a beach of small boulders and the researchers clambered out one by one.
“We don’t think there are fish here yet,” said one of them, Jon Moore, an aquatic ecologist at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver. “But there will be soon.”
The lake, so new to the landscape that it doesn’t have an official name, is still too cold and murky for salmon. But that’s likely to change soon: As the Tulsequah Glacier above it retreats, the lake is getting warmer and clearer, becoming a more attractive environment for migrating fish. “It’s going to be popping off,” Moore said.
It’s among hundreds of ice-fed lakes, rivers, and streams in Alaska and western Canada that could turn into prime fish habitat as the planet gets hotter. These new salmon grounds could help counteract other threats to the fish from climate change, such as warming seas and drought. And they could bolster a commercial fishing industry that generates millions of dollars for the state each year.
The disappearance of glaciers is also creating opportunities for the multibillion-dollar mining industry. Like migrating salmon, mineral exploration companies are moving quickly into areas exposed by melting ice, hoping to strike the next big lode.
With gold prices booming and demand soaring for copper, a metal necessary for making solar panels and electric cars, mining corporations have backed a number of major projects in the region. The Canadian government is paying for roads and power lines to improve access to them.
This mineral rush promises jobs and revenue for some towns and First Nations in northern Canada. But it’s troubling to many Alaska fishermen, environmental advocates, and Indigenous leaders living downstream, near several salmon-rich rivers that start in Canada and head west across the international border. The Tulsequah River is a major tributary of the Taku River, which runs about 50 miles from British Columbia’s Coast Mountains to the Pacific Ocean just south of Juneau, Alaska. The Taku supports iconic runs of sockeye and coho salmon that power commercial fishing businesses in both countries. In 2023, Moore and other researchers warned in the journal Science that, barring key policy reforms, future mines could impair future salmon habitat in glacier-fed watersheds like the Tulsequah and Taku.
Alaska Native leaders have called on British Columbia’s provincial government to clamp down on mining in the region, and some First Nations are working to restrict mineral exploration and development in their traditional territories. But Canadian officials largely support the proposed mines, and the Trump administration has stayed quiet on the issue of mining near the border, though Canada’s mineral riches have reportedly attracted President Donald Trump’s interest.
On the Tulsequah River, the stakes are clear. A few miles downstream from the new lake, a ribbon of rust-colored water flows into the waterway: acid runoff from a former gold mine. Contaminants from the Tulsequah Chief mine have been flowing into the river ever since the operation shut down in the 1950s. Alaska’s elected officials, salmon advocates, and Indigenous nations have urged British Columbia’s government and mining companies to clean it up for decades without success.
The pollution is confined to just a short stretch of river — and fish, including some salmon, still swim in the waters below it. Still, environmental groups often cite the uncontained acid drainage as an example of what can go wrong with mining.

A small Vancouver-based company, Canagold, wants to reopen and expand a different gold mine on the other side of the river from the shuttered Tulsequah Chief. The opening of a new mine could coincide with the expansion of salmon grounds in the upper Tulsequah watershed. Moore and his colleagues hope that their projections of emerging fish habitat in the lake that drains into the Tulsequah River will be incorporated into environmental assessments for new mining proposals like Canagold’s.
In some watersheds, nearly all of the projected habitat lies within a few miles of mining claims. Even though no fish swim in those lakes and streams now, that could change in just 20 or 30 years, the lifespan of a typical mine, said Chris Sergeant, a freshwater ecologist at the University of Washington who works with Moore on the Tulsequah and nearby rivers. Sergeant wants regulators to consider this prospect before they approve a mine. Accounting for this future habitat is especially important, he added, “because there just aren’t that many places where salmon are doing well.”

News articles describing the effects of climate change on salmon usually tell an alarming story: Fast-warming oceans and rivers are threatening an iconic fish that thrives in cold water, while record droughts are drying up their streams.
Some of these grim effects were on display last September about 250 miles south of the Tulsequah Glacier at Meziadin Lake, a long basin ringed by hemlocks and firs, near the small mining town of Stewart, British Columbia. It’s one of the province’s most abundant spawning areas for sockeye salmon.In a typical year, hundreds of thousands of sockeye fill Meziadin Lake and the surrounding creeks. Two creeks that feed the lake, Hanna and Tintina, have a reputation for being especially prolific. Each September they swell bank to bank with sockeye, splashing, spawning, and dying en masse. These runs can be so plentiful that wolf packs and grizzly bears sometimes catch fish within feet of each other.
 
As salmon disappear, a battle over Alaska Native fishing rights heats up

	But last year, during what should have been the peak of Tintina’s sockeye run, only a handful of salmon made it upstream. After a summer of high temperatures and drought, the creek was flowing at its lowest level in recent history, said Kevin Koch, a fish and wildlife biologist who works for the Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs, a First Nation whose traditional territory encompasses the area. Below a highway bridge, the slow, sad creek looked more like a pond. A thick mat of algae blanketed its bottom.
Two years ago, “you would have seen hundreds of fish,” Koch said, looking down from the bridge on a crisp day last fall. He saw none.
Hanna Creek, a couple miles away, also trickled at a historic low, according to Koch — though some ruby-red fish still wriggled in its mucky water.
What’s happening at Hanna and Tintina is only part of the picture, though. As the planet warms, a third creek that flows into Meziadin Lake has also transformed in a stunning way, but one that’s actually helping salmon.
For a long time, Strohn Creek gushed out of a huge glacier, and hardly any sockeye swam in its turbid water. While glacial runoff helps make some streams more habitable for salmon by keeping them cool, it also can have the opposite effect: Streams that flow directly from glaciers are often near freezing, too cold even for the cold-loving fish. And they’re full of silt, which blocks the sunlight that forms the basis of the food chain. Salmon eat insects and tiny aquatic animals called zooplankton; the insects and zooplankton eat algae; and the algae feeds off the sun.

	As the glacier above Strohn shriveled up and retreated from a mountain pass in the second half of the 20th century, its runoff started to drain down the other side of the Coast Mountains, away from Strohn Creek. Without a torrent of ice melt, the creek lost its silt and warmed up enough that, after a few decades, salmon now spawn there in the thousands. “There was this huge shift happening before our eyes,” said Naxginkw Tara Marsden, who directs the Gitanyow Nation’s sustainability program.
Approaching Strohn Creek to observe the peak of last year’s sockeye run, Koch brushed aside alder branches and yelled to alert lurking brown bears.
“This spot is one of the most pain-in-the-ass spots for grizzlies, where I’m taking you,” Koch said. “So sorry about that.”
The stream came into view. Half-eaten fish carcasses were strewn along its banks, and dozens of bright-red salmon splashed in its shallow blue waters. Their tails slapped the surface as they fought against the current.

	In some years, more sockeye return to Strohn than to Hanna or Tintina Creek. Scientists think it could be a bellwether: There are countless creeks like Strohn across Alaska and western Canada — glacial streams that could transform into salmon havens as the ice above them melts. Fish are turning up in these new spots surprisingly quickly. Hundreds of miles from Strohn Creek, scientists found pink salmon in a stream in Alaska’s Glacier Bay National Park less than a decade after it emerged in the wake of a receding glacier.
According to a paper in Nature that Moore co-authored in 2021, nearly 4,000 miles of new salmon streams could appear in Alaska and northwestern Canada by the end of the century. The gains could be “enormous,” Moore said.
And that estimate — one of the only published projections of emerging salmon habitat near glaciers — doesn’t account for new lakes, like the unnamed one below the Tulsequah Glacier, or streams or rivers that already support a handful of salmon but could boast a lot more. By one rough, unpublished estimate from Moore and his colleagues, the extent of lake habitat accessible to salmon in the 4.5-million-acre Taku River watershed could double over the next 100 years.
This all sounds promising for a species under siege, but salmon researchers warn that the region’s mining boom could stand in the way.
In the Nass River watershed, which encompasses Strohn Creek and Meziadin Lake, some 99 percent of emerging salmon habitat is within roughly 3 miles of mineral claims, according to Moore and Sergeant’s study.

Around the same time that Gitanyow leaders first witnessed the salmon bonanza in Strohn Creek, about eight years ago, they also discovered that companies looking for valuable minerals had staked mining claims in the mountains upstream, including beneath some of the small glaciers and snowfields that drain into the creek.
It was a glimpse of the mineral rush that now spans hundreds of miles of British Columbia’s Coast Mountains, from Meziadin Lake in the south to the Tulsequah Glacier in the north. Nicknamed the Golden Triangle for its metal-rich rocks, the region first lured prospectors 150 years ago. They led horses across glaciers, and tunneled thousands of feet into the ice using steam-powered equipment and sleds.

	Today, they travel by truck and haul drills by helicopter. Driven by record-high gold prices and demand for copper, northwest British Columbia drew some $250 million in investments in mineral exploration last year, accounting for more than 60 percent of the industry’s total expenditures across the province, according to British Columbia’s Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals. A government report in 2022 estimated that more than $900 billion worth of metals could be sitting beneath the Golden Triangle. That figure stands at well over $1 trillion with today’s record-high gold prices.
The mining industry’s mark on northwest British Columbia is hard to miss. Ore trucks thunder along the region’s main highway, hauling loads from a large copper mine, built a decade ago and now set to expand. A hefty 200-mile transmission line skirts the same road: a $500 million project developed in 2014 largely to power new mines with hydroelectricity. Large signs bearing the names of mining companies — Teck, Newmont, Skeena Resources — stand beside gated gravel roads that spur off the two-lane highway.
Deeper in the Coast Mountains, the gold and copper rush happens mostly out of sight, across roadless, heavily glaciated terrain. Roughly one-fifth of all the mining claims in northwest B.C. are covered by glaciers, according to a report released last year by the Environmental Investigation Agency, a global watchdog group. As those glaciers melt, they’re exposing outcrops of gold and copper that are luring mineral companies, whose geologists then drill into bedrock freshly exposed to the sun after thousands of years under ice. Mining companies are even staking claims beneath glaciers, poised to move in as soon as the ice melts.
“The glacier might melt at some point, and you want to be the first person” to see the rocks beneath it, said Matthew Reece, a U.S. Forest Service geologist based in Juneau who oversees mining in Alaska’s national forests.
Vancouver-based Scottie Resources Corp., one of the companies with claims in the mountains near Strohn Creek, has a few prospects that could attract more investors as nearby ice thaws. Hoping to find more gold, the company is drilling into the rock near a long-shuttered underground mine in a mountain partially covered by a glacier. Old tunnels, built decades ago, allowed miners to dig up just a sliver of the deposit. Scottie Resources is discovering more gold as the ice above it melts, according to Thomas Mumford, the company’s vice president of exploration.
“We are literally the first humans to look at those rocks,” Mumford told Grist.
Not far from Scottie’s claims, another small Canadian firm, Goliath Resources, recently discovered gold and copper in a small island of rock surrounded by a massive ice field. “I get the question, ‘Why hadn’t someone drilled it before?’” Roger Rosmus, Goliath’s chief executive, said in an interview posted on YouTube last year. “It was actually buried under the glacier and permanent snowpack, which are no longer there. We got lucky.”

	Reviewing filings from Canadian securities regulators, corporate presentations, and marketing materials for investors, Grist identified more than 20 companies that tout the promise of melting glaciers in Alaska and British Columbia. That number, likely an undercount, could grow as demand increases for metals like copper, and as more ice disappears. Last year, a private company named B-ALL Syndicate, partly funded by Goliath, launched a “large-scale exploration and prospecting program” aimed specifically at melting snow and ice across the region.
Most of these companies, including Goliath and Scottie, are small and based in Canada, where they can take advantage of generous tax policies. They tend to be funded by investors who like taking risks, or are eager for tax write-offs. Just a tiny fraction of prospects ever become producing mines.
Government support can help boost their chances, though — and the industry in northwest British Columbia has received a good deal of it over the past decade. Just last year, Canada’s federal government and British Columbia’s provincial government committed $140 million to upgrade the region’s only major road, Highway 37, explicitly to support production of “critical minerals.” Those are elements, like copper, that Canadian officials have deemed essential for national security and renewable energy.Some Alaskans, including the state’s Republican U.S. senators have worried that funding for Canadian mines could also come from the U.S. government, potentially boosting mining upstream from Alaska and endangering the state’s fishing industry. The Biden administration directed tens of millions of dollars to mineralprojects in Canada, also in the name of national security and clean energy as it considered Canada akin to a domestic source.

The Trump administration has yet to say if that funding will continue. Trump himself has signaled strong support for mining on the American side of the border: On his first day in office in January, he signed an executive order to develop Alaska’s minerals and other resources “to the fullest extent possible.
But Trump has also tried to unravel the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which established tax credits and other financial incentives that have spurred mining in both the U.S. and, indirectly, Canada. And some analysts have warned that certain tariffs Trump has threatened to put on Canadian goods could hamper Canada’s mining industry and the U.S. mineral supply chain.
Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, has called for a halt in sending U.S. taxpayer dollars to Canadian mines, citing past pollution, like the old, acid-leaking gold mine along the Tulsequah River. “I join many in Southeast Alaska who do not believe that our pristine waters are adequately protected,” she wrote to Biden in 2023.
Murkowski’s plea came even though she has supported mining elsewhere in the state. Earlier this year, she praised Trump’s Alaska-focused order.
Many Alaska Native leaders have also been lobbying against mining in Canada upstream from their communities. Worried about threats to salmon and other traditional food sources, the biggest Indigenous nation in Southeast Alaska — the Central Council of the Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska — wants the B.C. government to put a hold on mine permitting in transboundary watersheds until Canada and the U.S. agree to a framework for resolving mining disputes in the region. The council has also asked for a permanent ban on storing waste behind large dams above salmon-bearing rivers that cross into Alaska.
Are critical minerals “more critical than our lives?” Richard Peterson, president of the Tlingit and Haida government, asked an audience of tribal citizens, environmental advocates, and government officials at a conference in Juneau last year. “More critical than the fish?”

	Government regulators and industry representatives contend that mining can be done safely, without harming salmon. All mining in British Columbia “is subject to a robust environmental review process, whereby any potential impact to wild salmon habitat must be avoided and mitigated,”according to a spokesperson for the province’s Ministry of Mining and Critical Minerals. Regulators in the province ensure that any activity in mountain watersheds “adheres to the highest standards of environmental protection,” he wrote in an email.
The mining industry is also a vital source of jobs and revenue for two First Nations in the region: the Nisga’a and Tahltan. Over the past two decades, those nations have made deals with mining corporations for production royalties or cash payments, as well as commitments to hire their citizens. Tahltan leaders have also signed a series of agreements with the provincial government that gives the Tahltan a voice in regulatory decisions on a few mining projects in the nation’s traditional territory.

While small Canadian companies have been scouring rocks near receding glaciers, publicly traded mining giants have also been investing in prospects across Alaska and B.C. One of North America’s biggest, Newmont Corp., bought a company with two operating mines in northwest B.C. in 2023, and it’s now seeking to develop a third, in partnership with another mining giant, Vancouver-based Teck Resources.
That development, Galore Creek, would be a massive open-pit copper and gold mine 25 miles from the Alaska border, in an area ringed by receding glaciers. In 2023, Teck and Newmont’s geologists discovered minerals in rocks there that had been covered by ice a few years before. Last year, Canada’s department of natural resources handed the companies $15 million to build a key access road to a proposed processing site.

	Galore Creek’s backers are marketing the mine as a climate solution: It’s sitting on an estimated 12 billion pounds of copper, enough to make it one of North America’s biggest sources of the mineral. Since copper is great at conducting electricity, it’s especially useful for building energy equipment like solar panels and transmission lines. S&P Global projected in 2022 that demand for the metal would double by 2035.
But Teck, Newmont, and other mining corporations that could benefit from copper subsidies aren’t just after copper. Most of them are also looking for gold, which is used mainly for jewelry and in financial markets and considered less important for developing renewable energy than copper and other minerals like lithium and cobalt. The Biden administration didn’t consider gold “critical” but Trump promoted it along with dozens of other minerals in an executive order he signed earlier this year to spur mining nationwide. In addition to the copper that Galore Creek’s owners like to advertise, their mine could yield some 9 million ounces of gold, worth roughly $29 billion at current prices.
Critics argue that huge corporations shouldn’t be getting clean energy subsidies to dig gold out of the ground. The mining industry’s marketing of critical minerals, while miners largely hunt for gold, is “one of the biggest greenwashing efforts on Earth,” said Mary Catharine Martin, a spokesperson for SalmonState, an Alaska-based mining watchdog group.
One company that’s focused primarily on gold is Canagold, with its proposal to resurrect a mine along the Tulsequah River, some 40 miles from Juneau and about 8 miles downstream from the future sockeye lake that Moore and Sergeant are studying. Canagold bought the site in the 1990s and still hasn’t started producing. Soaring gold prices, driven by Trump’s tariffs and global economic uncertainty, however, have injected new life into the project, known as New Polaris. Canagold has proposed shipping construction materials by barge up the Taku River from Alaska and building an airstrip where the company would load ore concentrate onto planes to fly out of the mountains.

	The success of New Polaris hinges in part on a unique agreement between Canagold and the Taku River Tlingit First Nation, whose traditional territory encompasses the site and the Tulsequah River. Their agreement, announced in 2023, gives the nation a say — by a vote of its citizens — in whether the mine gets built.

	The Taku River Tlingit nation is also a key partner on Moore and Sergeant’s salmon research: The nation’s fisheries coordinator, Mark Connor, co-authored the 2023 policy analysis in Science that first noted the prevalence of mining claims near future salmon habitat. (Marsden, with the Gitanyow nation, was also a co-author on that paper.)
To keep emerging fish habitat intact, Taku River Tlingit established their own protected area, prohibiting mining across 60 percent of the Taku River watershed. In the other 40 percent, the First Nation allows some development with its approval. New Polaris sits in that zone, and the nation’s leaders are confident that Taku River Tlingit citizens will have a say in whether a mine ultimately gets built.
“We already have verbal agreements with the company that they will not proceed with a mine should our citizens, or the majority of our citizens, not agree with that,” said Rodger Thorlakson, Taku River Tlingit First Nation’s lands and resources manager.
Canagold, however, doesn’t have similar agreements with Indigenous governments downstream in Alaska. Clarence Laiti, president of the Douglas Indian Association in Juneau, said he’s “very, very concerned” about mining in the Taku River watershed. For decades, Laiti caught salmon for a living at the mouth of the Taku, some 30 miles below New Polaris. “It’s everybody’s river,” he said.



On the beach along the upper stretch of the Tulsequah River, 8 miles upriver from New Polaris, the three salmon scientists — Sergeant, Moore, and Brittany Milner, one of Moore’s doctoral students — unraveled a 30-foot seine fishing net. To learn more about the habitat, they catch, record, and release fish in dozens of spots along the river. They had never seen salmon this far up the river, this close to the new lake. They still sample the spot, though, because they think fish could appear any year as the water warms.
Milner grabbed one end of the long net and stood on shore. Moore took the other end and waded into the water, slowly walking in a circle to corral any fish that might have been lurking. Once again, they caught nothing.
About a week later, the researchers flew back to check a dozen small, cylindrical minnow traps that they had set in the lake itself. To their astonishment, they found a Dolly Varden, a common species of char, the first fish they’d ever seen in the new lake.

	“It was kind of surreal,” said Milner, who had set the trap in a shallow area near the mouth of a stream that was slightly warmer than the rest of the lake. Dolly Varden, which can tolerate very cold water, often move into glacial lakes and streams before other species.
“I’m assuming the fish was just in the lake swimming around and was able to find this pocket of a little bit warmer water,” Milner said. “I was really stoked.”
The rest of the traps came up empty: still no salmon. But to Milner and the other scientists, that one Dolly Varden sure looked like a sign of more to come.

Within a few months, police arrested more than 400 Freedom Riders.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Ben Carver, a boat captain for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, assumed the worst.
When Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsed — killing six construction workers and sending thousands of tons of concrete and steel hurtling into the Patapsco River — Carver feared that the foundation’s nearby oyster reef would be smothered beneath the sediment and debris.
“I thought all of our little buddies out there would be dead,” said Carver, the foundation’s Baltimore Harbor Environmental Education Program captain.

He had last visited the reef, located beside historic Fort Carroll, the night before the tragedy, when he dredged up some oysters from the river bottom for a regular check-up. It would be about six months before he could return to inspect the reef, upon which 6 million oysters have been planted since 2008.
What he found surprised him. Healthy oyster after healthy oyster.
“These are resilient little things,” Carver said.
This month, the Bay Foundation began oyster planting at the fort for the first time since the bridge fell. In two boat trips to the site, schoolchildren and other volunteers have tossed an estimated 128,187 oysters overboard, to start their new lives in the Patapsco. The goal is to plant half a million oysters there this summer.
Last year, with maritime traffic limited in the Patapsco River channel during the typical planting season. oysters grown in and around the Baltimore Harbor that would have gone to Fort Carroll were planted in the Magothy River instead.
It was a hard decision, said Kellie Fiala, Maryland oyster restoration coordinator for the Bay Foundation. Staffers toyed with keeping the oysters in their dockside cages, and waiting to plant them at the fort, a manmade island fortress that never saw battle, but has become a sanctuary for cormorants, gulls and other seabirds. But keeping the oysters out of the reef during peak feeding season could have caused some to perish, Fiala said.
“People were very understanding, but we’re very excited to get oysters back in Baltimore, in the Patapsco River, where people are growing them,” she said.
Aboard the Snow Goose, the Bay Foundation’s educational vessel, volunteers start by counting the number of oysters, which appear as small dots on the rough grey shells, on a selection of shells. From there, they estimate the total number of mollusks that will be planted.
Once they reach Fort Carroll the process is simple: Volunteers grab a bright blue basket filled with oysters, and dump them over the side of the boat and into the murky depths.

But getting each oyster ready for release day is a bit more complicated.
It begins at the Bay Foundation’s Oyster Restoration Center in Shady Side, where oyster larvae are placed in tanks with recycled oyster shells, their preferred substrate. The setup mimics a natural process, which has become more difficult for baby oysters as the Chesapeake Bay’s oyster reefs dwindle.
“Imagine being fertilized, being born, and then having two weeks to find your forever home,” Fiala said. “That’s what they have to do.”
Once the baby oysters adhere to a shell, they’re known as spat. Afterwards, the spat-on-shell bound for Fort Carroll are moved to submerged cages around the Baltimore Harbor, where they are minded by volunteer “oyster gardeners” for their first year of life.
The cages help shelter the vulnerable young oysters, and keep them from sinking into the mud, serving the function of oyster reefs, which once rose above the surface of the Chesapeake in some places, snarling passing ships.
Domino Sugars in downtown Baltimore is a longtime “gardener,” and contributed tens of thousands of oysters to a planting this week, the second since the Key Bridge fell. Others came from the Seagirt Marine Terminal in Dundalk and Vane Brothers in South Baltimore, which are newer participants.
Frits de Goede, operations manager for Ports America Chesapeake, which operates Seagirt, said the group wants to up its game next year, in hopes of inching closer to Domino’s oyster number. Ports America grew 5,580 oysters this year, compared to Domino’s 21,060.
“We’re trying to work up to that,” de Goede said.
Gardeners periodically pull up the cages attached to their docks, and clean off any algae or debris, to ensure that the oysters get plenty of water flow.

Oysters are filter feeders, which means that they pull nutrients from the water column in order to survive and grow.
Therein lies their value to the Chesapeake Bay, which is beset by excess nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, runoff from farm field fertilizer and sewage treatment plant discharges, among other sources. The excess nutrients spur the growth of algae, which essentially suck oxygen from the water as they die, creating hazardous anoxic conditions — “dead zones” — for crabs and fish.
But adding more oysters in the Chesapeake means more nutrients will be filtered out, strengthening ecosystems and further growing the natural oyster population.
Decimated by disease, harvesting and habitat loss, the bay’s oyster population has plummeted since the 1800s. While it once took Chesapeake oysters an estimated three days to a week to filter all the water in the bay, it now takes more than a year, Fiala said.
“We also couple that with the fact that there’s more people in the bay watershed than ever before having an impact. So, we need more oysters in the water than we have ever had,” Fiala said.
The strategy could be working. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources released a summary this week of its latest stock assessment for oysters in Maryland portions of the bay, which found that the population increased from 2.4 billion adult oysters in 2005 to 7.6 billion in 2024.
Back then, Maryland’s oyster population was just starting to recover from devastating bouts of disease, such as MSX and Dermo.
Mike Wilberg, a professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science who led the assessment, pointed to three reasons for the increasing trend in a news release from the department.

“The first one is that we have had some good spatsets,” he said. “The second one is that natural mortality rates, or particularly disease, hasn’t been as bad as it was in the 1980s and 1990s. And then the last one is that the department has maintained restrictions on harvesting that have allowed the oysters that are in some of these areas to continue to survive and reproduce.”
The stock assessment doesn’t include oyster sanctuaries like the ones at Fort Carroll, focusing instead on oyster bars that are open to harvesting. But large-scale restoration sites, planted by DNR and partner organizations, make up substantial portions of several harvest regions — and they’re likely strengthening the oyster harvest in their areas, Wilberg said in the news release.
“The three major restoration sanctuaries that are pretty much finished have all been really strong successes,” Wilberg said.
But the Bay Foundation believes there’s more to be done.
In a 2024 report entitled “Hope on the Half Shell,” the foundation pushed for Maryland and Virginia to establish sanctuaries in an additional 20 tributaries, ensure that 11 existing tributaries are maintained, and bolster the aquaculture industry, which grows oysters for consumption, by leasing more areas to proprietors.
There are two small sanctuaries on either side of Fort Carroll, Fiala said: a 2-acre plot and a 1-acre plot. In part to protect those two areas, the Bay Foundation is keeping a close eye on the effort to demolish the remainder of the Key Bridge and build its successor, said Gussie Maguire, Maryland staff scientist at the foundation.
“There are certain practices that can be put in place — and that we’re advocating for — to minimize the impacts of disturbing the sediment with the explosives and all that,” Maguire said. “Silt curtains on land, turbidity curtains in the water.”
In a September 2024 letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment, which is in charge of permitting for the new bridge site, the Bay Foundation highlighted the importance of the reefs.

While testing found the reefs in “relatively good” shape after the collapse and the subsequent salvage effort, “more extensive disturbances” could “impact these nearby reefs in the absence of proper precautions,” wrote Allison Colden, the Bay Foundation’s Maryland executive director.
“Nearly every weekday during the spring and fall school season, students sample the reefs at Fort Carroll to learn about the importance of oysters for water quality, habitat, and biodiversity,” Colden wrote. “The protection of these areas from disturbance and damage associated with bridge reconstruction will be critical.”
The Bay Foundation is also pushing for the rebuilt bridge to include new features such as upgraded filtration for stormwater, reducing the amount of rainwater that washes off the bridge’s roadway and directly into the Patapsco, carrying pollutants with it.
That could include the addition of a piping system with filters included, but it could also include the installation of rain gardens, known as bioswales, on either end of the new bridge, like at the Aurora Bridge in Washington State, the Bay Foundation said. Or the new bridge could host floating wetlands that could filter pollutants, like the ones installed at Baltimore’s National Aquarium nearby.
The new bridge will be wider than its predecessor, potentially increasing the discharge of pollutants “including trash, oil and grease residues, salt and brine during winter weather, and tire dust and other sediments,” and increasing the necessity of adequate stormwater treatment, Colden said.
In the meantime, the return of oyster plantings mere feet from the Key Bridge wreckage is a welcome symbol of the city’s toughness, Fiala said.
“Baltimore has a lot more behind it — a lot more resilience — than I think people give it credit for,” Fiala said.

Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) was the keynote speaker Friday at Bowie State University's spring commencement ceremony. (Photo courtesy of Bowie State University)Kermit the Frog got most of the attention — and delivered most of the bad puns — for a University of Maryland, College Park, commencement address Thursday, but there were plenty of others who suited up in a cap and gown for the chance to inspire, comfort and, most of all, congratulate Maryland graduates in the Class of 2025.
Their speeches ranged from under 13 to 24 minutes, tolerable for anxious graduates and fidgety relatives, and while many touched on the current troubles in the world, most urged graduates to embrace the challenge.
For most of her short six months on Capitol Hill, Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.) has done battle with the agenda of President Donald Trump (R) and administration, which have been working diligently to dismantle the federal government. But in her commencement address Friday at Bowie State University, the former Prince George’s County executive’s 15-minute speech leaned heavily into one word: hope.
“It seems like all the good things are happening for the absolute worst people. It looks as if the cruelest and most selfish characters are getting the service ahead,” she said at the campus’ Bulldog Stadium. “My response to that is just live a little longer.
“The callous and self-centered personalities may seem popular, but trust me, the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” Alsobrooks said.
Part of her speech mentioned the late Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison for opposing the South Africa’s apartheid system. After Mandela’s release from prison in February 1990, he was inaugurated as the country’s first Black president in May 1994.
Before Alsobrooks left campus, she spoke to a few reporters and was asked whether one of the “characters” in her speech happened to be Trump, especially for any graduates who may want to become public servants in the federal government. She answered by looking beyond Trump.
“The great thing for these young people is they have … their whole life ahead of them,” she said. “There will come a moment when this current administration will leave office and the rest of us are still going to be here to carry on, to rebuild whatever’s been broken and to continue to ensure that they have the economic opportunities and that their families have the true opportunity to experience the American dream.”
At University of Maryland, Eastern Shore — another of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, along with Bowie State — Gov. Wes Moore (D) urged graduates to imagine themselves looking back on the journeys they are just now starting.

Moore told the UMES graduates they would be asked repeatedly, on commencement day and after, what they plan to do with their new college degrees. But he asked them to think farther ahead and start planning for the question they will be asked at the other end of the road they are starting down: What did you do?
“The ones who obsess over answering ‘what will you do?’ are often the ones who lose sight of answering ‘what did you do?'” Moore said. “The ones who stay focused on answering ‘what did you do’ are the ones who will never waver in their convictions, and will always continue the work.”
In between citing the achievements of his administration and giving shout-outs to high-achieving graduates, Moore assured the graduates that it was OK if they didn’t have a ready answer to the many “what are you going to do” questions they are sure to get in the coming days. The important thing is to stay focused on making the difference once they find their goals.
“Because when you look back many years from now, you aren’t going to say to yourself: ‘I wish I were more certain about what I wanted to do right out of school,'” Moore said. “You’re going to say: ‘I’m proud of what I accomplished.'”
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-8th) delivered the commencement address May 10 at St. Mary’s College of Maryland.
Raskin, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, who spoke for about 24 minutes, told the graduates they will face challenges in today’s political atmosphere.
“Your class is graduating in a moment of profound crisis for humanity, and searing existential choice for each and every citizen,” he said. “The river could be taken all of us to a place of danger, or to a place of renewal. I wish this was commencement speech hyperbole, but it’s not.”
Raskin said hope can be obtained, but everyone must participate to improve society.
“If we’re engaged in a sustained titanic and perhaps final struggle on this small planet between the forces of democratic freedom and the forces of fascist authoritarianism, this is a battle unlike we have ever seen before, and it requires all hands on deck,” he said.
“Remember always the beauty and promise of America, which is made exceptional not because it is magically immune to the forces of racism or antisemitism or fascism, but because the people have always insisted that we will move forward to form a more perfect union,” Raskin said.
The day before her husband spoke at UMES, Maryland first lady Dawn Flythe Moore on Wednesday gave a less than 13-minute address at the University of Baltimore commencement ceremony.
Moore, who worked as a substitute teacher in Baltimore after she graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park, summarized three lessons to solve “big” problems.
“Division is the greatest barrier to progress. Two, collaboration is our path to success,” she said. “And three, the only way to elevate the work is to strengthen community. That work is more important now than ever before. Community is our lifeblood. It is the only hope we have as a state to secure our future.”
Other commencement speakers who attempted to inspire at Maryland colleges and universities this month included: Vice President J.D. Vance addressing the 2025 Class of midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy; entrepreneur Sal Khan at Johns Hopkins University; TIAA CEO Thasunda Brown Duckett at Morgan State University; Global Refuge CEO Krish O’Mara Vignarajah at Goucher College; urban Afrofuturist Lawrence T.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, who had asked Trump for an expedited disaster declaration, thanked the president and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a post on social media. 
“Remember, this process takes time and we will add more counties to our request as damage assessments are completed,” Beshear said.
Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster, the FEMA release said.
Jeremy Slinker has been named the federal coordinating officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. Slinker formerly was director of Kentucky Emergency Management.

(Photo by Janecze Wright/U.S. Army)This month, students across Maryland headed to school to celebrate National Walk, Bike and Roll to School Day. Many did so despite facing perilous routes, a stunning lack of basic infrastructure like crosswalks, and poorly designed streets resulting from decades of failed public policy that prioritized cars over pedestrians.
Far too often, tragedy is no accident. It’s inevitable.
In November 2023, that reality hit Prince George’s County when two elementary school students were struck and killed walking to school. Sadly, their deaths were no anomaly, with U.S. pedestrian deaths hitting a 40-year high – more than 7,500 – in 2022. That’s 20 pedestrian deaths every single day, and meaningful action is long overdue.
Prince George’s County is leading the way. After tragedy, parent leaders from 11 schools representing 8,200 students came together with a clear message: Every child has the right to get to and from school safely. In addition to the immediate hiring of additional crossing guards, they also called for long-term reforms and a renewed policy focus on pedestrian safety.
That effort and earned media campaign helped launch the Prince George’s County School Pedestrian Safety Workgroup, a collaboration of parents, municipal leaders, and school and county officials who spent six months crafting a detailed report of 18 Safe Routes recommendations released last December.
Some formalized existing policies, such as ensuring pedestrian safety infrastructure at the time of new school construction and proactive meetings between agencies to improve coordination and efficiency. The group encouraged partnerships between school, municipal and county officials. And recommended establishment of Safe Passage Coordinators, officially hired by Prince George’s County Public Schools this spring.

Many recommendations formed a roadmap for local education agencies and municipalities nationwide. Creating a unified walk audit template to help standardize data collection will help school administrators establish internal goals and timelines for implementing these walk audits, while collaborating with local officials to initiate an overall evaluation of accessibility around schools. Once concerns are identified, schools and municipalities are encouraged to establish long-term strategic plans to equitably improve pedestrian infrastructure.
This data and planning can help create a pedestrian safety risk measure for each school, ensuring resource allocations are prioritized by need instead of politics. And Board of Education members are encouraged to take on greater roles engaging and educating their own school communities on pedestrian safety.
One recommendation focused on bilingual outreach and pedestrian safety education to ensure “every child has the right to get to and from school safely” truly means every child. Another empowers students to become Vision Zero advocates by launching an annual Youth Transportation Safety Summit. This event, organized by the Washington Area Bicyclist Association, successfully hosted more than 100 attendees earlier this month. And the group recommended working with artists to create walkability safety signs and high-visibility artwork for crosswalks.
Schools are encouraged to participate in events like National Walk, Bike and Roll to School Days and Ruby Bridges Walk to School Day (Nov. 14) to increase parent and community engagement. County and school district officials are recommended to establish both as official events, and there’s an ongoing legislative effort to recognize Ruby Bridges Walk to School Day statewide.
Parents can organize “walking school buses” and walking groups to help reduce the number of families driving to school. Less cars around schools means less opportunities for tragedy.
One recommendation encourages increased traffic calming infrastructure around schools and temporary street closures at drop-off and pick-up. And it’s crucial to encourage principals to be proactive and empower them to create their own innovative solutions to improve school pedestrian safety.
Finally, some recommendations focused on legislative and government solutions. The group strongly encouraged using unspent funds to subcontract with municipal police departments for difficult-to-fill crossing guard positions.
One of the most important recommendations involved lowering speed limits around schools. Municipalities must have greater autonomy to keep their own residents safe, without regulatory hurdles. The National Transportation Safety Board found a pedestrian struck at 20 mph has a 90+% survival rate; at 30 mph, chances of survival are around 55%. Lowering speed limits, while protecting and enhancing the radius of school zones, will save lives.
Creating safe walkable routes to schools is a rare opportunity for bipartisan consensus at every level of government. Investing in safer streets around schools also helps create safer routes to small businesses, parks, libraries and other community hubs. But we can’t expect students and families to walk to school – or anywhere in our communities – if we don’t provide them with the safe routes to do so.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/8591599.jpg,,,2025-05-24 08:02:38.033591

Bob Ferguson using a red pen to partially veto a bill on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Before Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the next state budget on Tuesday, he vetoed a few dozen spending provisions scattered throughout its 1,366 pages.
The plan he approved lays out $78 billion in spending over two years. The roughly 55 items he removed add up to around $22.3 million in savings. 
He zeroed out funding of contracts to nonprofits serving foster youth, college students, immigrants, and seniors. He canceled spending for studies and work groups. Ferguson’s veto message, containing an itemized list, spans 15 pages.
Here are some of the targets of Ferguson’s veto pen.
Issaquah Teen Center
The Garage is a cafe where high school students can drop in after school and receive tutoring, counseling, or case management services. 
It will lose $300,000, or roughly one-fifth of its budget. If the dollars cannot be made up through private donations, the center will look at reducing its services for teens. The reduction would have a “massive impact” in the community, said KayLee Jaech, the group’s executive director. 
The governor wrote in his veto message that supporting programs and services for youth is important, but cited budget constraints. 
Mentor Washington
Mentor Washington has been recruiting, training and providing support for mentoring programs for at-risk youth in Washington using $1.55 million in contracts with the Department of Children, Youth and Families. About half is getting spent now on a pilot effort focused on foster youth.
Lawmakers shaved $1 million of that sum in the budget they sent Ferguson. While he noted the significant reduction for the “valuable” program, he axed the remaining $550,000. 
“We need to find a way to regroup and reconfigure what service looks like moving forward,”  said Jolynn Kenney, executive director of Mentor Washington.
Redmond Latino Cultural Center
Centro Cultural Mexicano in Redmond provides services for low-income, immigrant, and Spanish-speaking residents in King and Snohomish counties. 
They will lose a $200,000 state grant, which helped connect clients with health care, financial coaching, small business assistance, internships, and home buying services — all at no cost.
Free services like this help support communities, Ferguson said. But he said that due to the budget challenges, this program was something the state couldn’t afford.
Refugee Women’s Alliance 
Refugee Women’s Alliance provides services to refugees and immigrants, including an ice skating lesson program for preschoolers from diverse and low-income families.
They will lose the $200,000 the Legislature allocated for the skating program. They have previously received money from the state and have also partnered with the Seattle Kraken and One Roof Foundation. 
Political conservatives were sharply critical of this grant-funded program on social media. The governor said that while youth enrichment opportunities like this are beneficial, this one needed to be cut because of the budget deficit. 
Hospitality Center of Excellence
A year ago, the state Board for Community and Technical Colleges received $257,000 “solely for the creation of a Hospitality Center of Excellence” at Columbia Basin College in Pasco. 
It launched in January with its leadership drawing up a game plan to strengthen ties between culinary programs on campuses with hospitality businesses and organizations. A key goal was to develop best practices and strategies for workforce education and training in the industry.
Not now. It will close up shop in July. Though the Legislature did budget $408,000 for two years of operation, Ferguson deemed the “worthwhile endeavor” not affordable and crossed it out.
Offshore wind projects
The state Department of Ecology won’t get $816,000 of Climate Commitment Act proceeds to assess Washington’s siting and permitting authority around potential wind energy projects in federal waters off the state’s coast. The agency was also going to look into the ecological impacts of such undertakings as part of a broad analysis.
“Given the current federal administration’s position on offshore wind, this work is less
time sensitive,” Ferguson wrote in his veto message, adding he is “committed to continued dialogue with coastal Tribes regarding the future of offshore wind projects.”
Meanwhile, Ecology did receive $338,000 to develop “planning, engagement, and evaluation tools for effective ocean management and offshore wind energy development.” And Ferguson left $500,000 in the budget to contract with “a nonregulatory coalition” in Seattle that wants Washington to be able to receive power from future floating wind projects off the West Coast.
Senior housing options
How many places in Washington market themselves as “senior independent living” communities for individuals aged 55 years and older? 
Lawmakers put $80,000 in the budget for the state Department of Commerce to come up with an answer. And, by July 1, 2026, the department was to make recommendations on creating a registry of senior living locations as a consumer protection move for residents and prospective residents. Not going to happen.
“Supporting our seniors is important to me but I am vetoing this item because of the state’s significant fiscal challenges and funding cuts from the federal government,” Ferguson wrote to lawmakers in his veto message.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_2829-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-24 07:01:44.096996

But her perspective on the growing divide between conservatives and liberals remains relevant four months into the second administration of President Donald Trump. Rochelle sees the lack of political and social connection and collaboration at the national, state and local levels as hindering the country’s progress.


Grace Rochelle will read her award-winning VFW Voice of Democracy essay as the featured speaker at the 51st annual Memorial Day Commemoration on Monday, May 16, at 1 p.m. at the Rhode Island Veterans Cemetery in Exeter.
Listen to the audio version of essay here.

“I thought about the issues in America, and I don’t really feel like we’re in a place where we can be proud, I guess you could say, of where we’re at because a lot of issues need to be resolved,” Rochelle said.
History teacher Coleen Turner made the essay a mandatory assignment for her students and gave them the option of recording the essay and submitting it to the 2024-2025 Veterans of Foreign War Voice of Democracy National Scholarship Competition through VFW Post 406 in Newport. Rochelle, a competitive tennis player with three State and All-Division honors to her name, including 1st team All-State this year, was fair game.
“I thought I already did the essay, I might as well do the recording,” Rochelle, 17, a Rogers senior, recalled.
“It took a few tries, or more like 20, 25 tries,” she said. “It was either too short or too long depending on how I was pacing myself. But I just thought you know why not? We’ll see what happens.”
What happened was the VFW Department of Rhode Island named Rochelle the state winner. She won a total of $2,000 in scholarships and received a trip to the 2025 VFW Washington Conference held March 2-6, 2025, in Washington, D.C.

“It was the best trip I’ve ever been on. It was cool to be around a bunch of different kids,” Rochelle said, adding she made several new friends.
“I got (to be) pretty good friends with Oklahoma and Guam and Louisiana and New Jersey. Those were the four girls I really clicked with.”
Rochelle will read her award-winning essay as the featured speaker at the 51st annual Memorial Day commemoration on Monday at 1 p.m. at the Rhode Island Veterans Cemetery in Exeter to honor service members who sacrificed their lives for our nation.
Gov. Dan McKee, the state’s four congressional delegates and state office holders and lawmakers are scheduled to attend. The 88th Army Band of the Rhode Island National Guard will perform and Gold Star Family members will participate in the ceremony.
Rochelle is the daughter of Brian and Carrie Rochelle, both Army veterans who served tours in Iraq. Her parents work at Naval Undersea Warfare Center where her mother is a contracting officer and her father is a contracts manager.
She plans to attend the University of Notre Dame to study political science and economics, with hopes of going to law school and making a career in international politics and government. Her dream job is to become a diplomat for the U.S. State Department or the United Nations.










I thought about the issues in America, and I don’t really feel like we're in a place where we can be proud, I guess you could say, of where we’re at because a lot of issues need to be resolved.


– Grace Rochelle, 17, of Newport


In discussing this year’s VFW Voice of Democracy question with her comparative government students, Turner had them the ideas of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness emerging from the Declaration of Independence and the contradictions over the meaning of equality as applied to different demographic groups.
“It was a good question. It fit in well with my curriculum,” Turner said of the class which looks at six different countries in relation to life in the United States.
Rochelle’s award-winning essay takes a contrarian view. She argues that the U.S. has been weakened by divisiveness and that’s not what the founding fathers envisioned at all.
“You go back to George Washington’s farewell address and he warned about political factions and that’s where we are as a society. We have political factions,” Rochelle said.
“I don’t necessarily feel like they are a horrible thing, but what political parties do however, is make people close-minded from what I’ve seen a lot of times. People aren’t willing to hear the other side and even consider the other side, and I think that‘s where the real issue comes.”
The solution, she said, is to somehow bring people back to the moderate side of both parties. 
“I do think the majority of Americans are somewhat moderate. They’re the less outspoken ones and I think we need to be uplifting the voices of those who are moderates and giving them the bigger platform than people who are far left and far right.”
Turner said Rochelle presented a “unique voice and a different perspective.”
“It came out really well,” Turner said of Rochelle’s essay. “She’s made us all proud. She’s going to do great things.”



Is America today our forefathers’ vision? 
By Grace Rochelle
When answering whether America today is our forefathers’ vision, there may be a variety of responses. On one hand, Americans are still some of the most passionate people when it comes to upholding liberties, democracy, and nationalism. But on the other hand, we have never been more fractionalized, and the divide between conservatives and liberals seems to continue to grow. I will attempt to navigate these complexities and demonstrate that overall, America today is not our forefathers’ vision.
The struggle to answer this question is mainly the stark differences between the late 18th century and the 21st century. Our forefathers could not possibly imagine the advancements we have today, especially when it comes to technology, transportation, and media. For example, Thomas Jefferson, a major proponent for privacy and freedom, may find mass surveillance and data gathering disturbing and unconstitutional. Furthermore, the further in time we progress, the more different our country will look compared to when it was founded. So how can we compare values from the late 1700s to today’s? I believe that as time progresses, central values may also have to progress and/or change to better fit the people of the time. 
Next, we look into what the forefathers wanted for our country. The most important and main issue was independence. In Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary, independence meant, “A state of being not dependent; complete exemption from control, or the power of others; as the independence of the Supreme Being.” I argue that today, we are greatly economically dependent on other countries through the trade of goods and services which goes against our Founding Fathers’ vision. Dependency, such as our large debt to China and reliance on their goods, leads us to be vulnerable to instability if a country were to collapse or eliminate trade with us. Since World War I, the U.S. has taken a sort of overseer role in the world. As a global power, we always appear to aid countries in need, whether it be supplies or money. While this certainly is a morally good thing, it also can undermine what gets done internally.   
In addition to the question of our true independence as a state, many of the forefathers were very weary and against the forming of political factions, but today we have not been more divided as a country since the Civil War because of factions. The current split between the conservatives and liberals has seriously hindered the progress of the legislature in this country, divided not just the government but also citizens, and weakens the country’s internal strength. The Founding Fathers knew the importance of unity, as they brought the 13 colonies together not just for the Revolutionary War against the British, but also to form a new country. They promoted and inspired nationalism in the colonies and preached that unity was vital to protecting America from external influences. With the constant stalemate we see in Congress, we have seriously fallen behind in making a budget for our country and addressing social and other important political issues. I believe the current disunity in this country is the complete opposite of what the forefathers hoped to continue for America. The internal conflict disrupts the nation’s progress and displays our weaknesses to our largest enemies such as China, Russia, and Iran. 
Although America today has seemed to have fallen on a different path from what our forefathers were envisioning, we have always and will continue to have fighting spirits. When it comes to civil liberties and social issues, Americans are some of the most vocal out of any groups in the world. While this is one of the main causes for discontinuity, it does show the freedom and pride that people have to improve this country. In the beginning days of our country, the Forefathers wanted the people’s voices to be heard, setting up a system to ensure that was made possible. Today we see that same system allowing citizens to protest issues such as abortion and gun laws, without prosecution. That system in the 18th century instilled a sense of identity and nationalism into the new American people and continues to do that in Americans today. 
Overall, America today is not our forefathers’ vision, whether it be the issue of independence or political factions. And while we have fulfilled some of their manifestations, altogether the drastic difference in society now has prevented their vision from completely continuing. While I wouldn’t expect America to be fully on the path of our forefather’s vision, I do believe they would feel we seriously need to fix our current system, economically, socially, and politically.

Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances, and deal with none of its consequences.
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control until the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution.
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.
  Sen. Ed Setzler. (Photo by Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance. The law cannot act more wisely or with more love than would those who know the situation best.

Story summary

U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright issued an emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution on in February urging Consumers Energy to delay the closure of the J.H. Campbell plant, however, it stopped short of filing a lawsuit in April.
Consumers Energy previously said the plan for closure was vetted and approved from multiple stakeholders and regulatory agencies; it is unknown how much coal remains at the site to continue operations.


PORT SHELDON TWP. — The long-planned closing of the coal-fired J.H. Campbell plant in Port Sheldon Township will be delayed at least 90 days after Trump Administration officials issued an emergency order directing Consumers Energy to remain “available for operation” going into peak summer demand.
U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, May 23 — just eight days before the plant was scheduled to shut down, a plan that has been in place since 2021.
The U.S. Department of Energy said the move is intended “to minimize the risk of blackouts and address critical grid security issues in the Midwestern region of the United States ahead of the high electricity demand expected this summer.”
Wright directed the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, in coordination with Consumers Energy to ensure that the 1,560 megawatt plant to “[remain] available for operation, minimizing any potential capacity shortfall that could lead to unnecessary power outages.”
“Today’s emergency order ensures that Michiganders and the greater Midwest region do not lose critical power generation capability as summer begins and electricity demand regularly reach high levels,” Wright said in a prepared news release.
The Energy Department said the emergency order, which is issued by the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response, is authorized by Section 202(c) of the Federal Power Act and is in accordance with President Trump’s Executive Order: Declaring a National Energy Emergency to ensure that power generation availability in the region does not “dip below 2024 capacity levels.”
“This administration will not sit back and allow dangerous energy subtraction policies threaten the resiliency of our grid and raise electricity prices on American families. With President Trump’s leadership, the Energy Department is hard at work securing the American people access to affordable, reliable, and secure energy that powers their lives regardless of whether the wind is blowing, or the sun is shining.”
On May 14, Consumers officials said the planned May 31 closure of the Campbell plant remained on track. After Wright issued the emergency order on Friday, however, the company said it would comply.
“Consumers Energy plans to comply with the 90-day pause from the Department of Energy. We are reviewing the executive action and the overall impact on our company,” Katie Carey, director of media relations for Consumers, said in a Friday statement to ONN.
 A long-debated topic

The emergency order came after a yearlong effort from a local grassroots organization petitioned Ottawa County officials to intervene in some way to prevent the closure of the Campbell plant.

Organizers of the “Save the Campbell” effort coalesced at the beginning of 2024 — mainly members of far-right fundamentalist groups such as Ottawa Impact, The Gideon 300 and the Ottawa County GOP — said a government-owned electric co-op was possible if voters approved a “home rule charter” at the ballot box.
The issue was never put up for a vote, so a change in government structure is not forthcoming; however, local officials asked Consumers for reassurance earlier this year that local energy supplies will be uninterrupted as the Campbell plant headed for closure at the end of May.
In February, the Ottawa County Board of Commissioners approved a resolution urging delay in the plant’s closure, however, officials stopped short April 22 of opting to bring litigation to prevent the closure altogether.

Commissioners pointed to two separate reports — from MISO as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or NERC — that gave them concerns over the energy grid’s reliability once the Campbell is taken offline.
MISO published the results of its annual survey in June 2024, which indicated at the time that there was “a growing capacity deficit beginning in the 2025-26 planning year.”
“Next summer, MISO could see resource sufficiency ranging from a 2.7 GW capacity shortfall to a 1.1 GW surplus, underscoring the need to accelerate resource additions, monitor large load additions, and delay resource retirements to reliably manage the anticipated growth in electricity demand,” according to the survey.
NERC is a nonprofit international regulatory authority that more broadly looks at reliability standards as well as seasonal and long‐term outlooks for the entire U.S. grid. The group published a long-term reliability assessment in December 2024 that labeled MISO’s section of the grid as “high risk,” meaning the grid subsection that includes the state of Michigan “falls below established resource adequacy criteria in the next five years.”
“High-risk areas are likely to experience a shortfall in electricity supplies at the peak of an average summer or winter season. Extreme weather, producing wide-area heat waves or deep-freeze events, poses an even greater threat to reliability,” the report said.

Commissioner Jacob Bonnema questioned why Consumers opted to sunset the plant five years ahead than previously planned.
Dena Isabell, stakeholder engagement manager at Consumers, told commissioners in February that Consumers adopted in 2021 that helped the company identify about $600 million in savings for its customers over 20 years with the retirement of the plant.
“That includes renewables that get brought onto the grid, which are cheaper than what we have,” she said, “so that is a savings to our customers, which is part of the clean and affordable and reliable energy — so it’s an economic decision.”
One component of the cost savings was coal.
Rich Houtteman, community affairs manager for Consumers, explained to commissioners in February that the cost of shipping coal is a huge financial consideration for the energy company.
“It’s about $50 a ton to ship excess coal off-site,” he said. “We had 30,000 tons. That’s a lot for our customers. So we’re trying to burn up all the coal as we kind of bring in 130 train car loads a day.”
Consumers did not respond to an inquiry Friday evening on how much coal remained on the site.
 A political talking point

OI Commissioner Allison Miedema — who strongly backed the county suing Consumers to prevent the Campbell closure — asked the utility company’s officials in February what new assets were being brought onto the grid.
Isabell pointed to renewables as well as natural gas assets.
“We do have a lot of renewables that are coming online, so that is very important to us,” she said. “We do have natural gas. We like natural gas. It is part of our future that we have — it is agile, it’s able to come online quickly, we can dispatch that in a matter of hours, versus a matter of days in the cold — so we see natural gas as part of our future.”
Isabell also noted wind and solar and battery storage, “which is going to be a major, major component and required by law, so we are going to be adding a ton of battery storage as well.”
After Isabell noted that the state’s new clean energy laws required energy companies to have clean and sustainable energy sources by 2040, OI Commissioner Sylvia Rhodea asked if the new Trump Administration’s policies could lead to a relaxation in Consumers’ plans.
“Is it possible we might see a change in that legislation that would lift those requirements? I’m just wondering if it could be slowed down if we’re not looking at deadlines until 2040,” Rhodea said.
Isabell said Consumers was committed to its clean energy plan in 2021 — before the legislation in Michigan was approved in 2023 — and that bringing massive assets like the Campbell on and off the grid is no simple or quick task.
“We do our best to try to be as agile as possible, but assets like this aren’t something that you can just bring on and take off very quickly,” she said. “So we do our best in these integrated resources plans to try to plan for what we think could be possible in the future. But we can’t plan for everything that could happen with any type of policy. So our plan to retire (Campbell) was on the last integrated resource plan, which does actually meet the new state policy, which works for us going forward.
“But large assets like that aren’t something that you can just quickly change with new policies in two years.”
The integrated resource plans are required by the Michigan Public Service Commission, a regulatory agency that oversees public utilities in Michigan.
“The Michigan Public Service Commission requires us to create a 20-year plan that says, ‘How are you going to serve your customer, clean, reliable and affordable energy for the next 20 years?’ And this requires us to come up with scenarios,” Isabell said.
Those scenarios are then presented to stakeholders in a series of workshops over two years with community stakeholders who then provide feedback to help.
“We’re retooling, and we’re getting ready to do our next integrated resource plan, new technologies, new laws, new things like that require us to be agile. We constantly need to update those plans and make sure that we’re giving our customers the best technology and the best cost we possibly can,” Isabell said.
 How we got here

The Campbell Plant is Consumers’ last — and largest — coal-fired plant in the state.
The plant, operating since 1962, was originally scheduled to close partially in 2030 and wholly in 2040. But the utility announced in 2021 it was moving the plan up by 15 years for an operations end date of May 31, 2025.
The utility was seeking to end coal use altogether by 2025 as part of its goal to achieve carbon neutrality.
Since the announcement, Consumers has been actively preparing the plant for “full retirement,” a spokesperson said last year.
“The complex will officially go into retirement with an aim to go cold and dark after 2025,” said former Consumers spokesperson Kristen Van Kley. “In 2026 and on, the complex will be demolished with a plan to restore the site over time.”
The plant, when operating at full capacity, can generate 1,450 megawatts of electricity. Michigan consumed about 113,740 gigawatt hours of electricity in 2019, according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Department of Energy.
At the time, Van Kley said new technologies would ensure Consumers would be able to continue supporting the statewide grid.
“Energy efficiency, demand response and emerging technologies such as grid modernization and battery storage will help us lower peak customer demand for electricity and deliver exactly what Michigan needs,” she said. “Our plan is designed to respond to emerging needs, adapt to changing conditions and embrace emerging innovative technologies as we work to achieve net zero carbon emissions.”
Key to that strategy are natural gas-fired plants in Consumers’ portfolio, Van Kley said, which include locations in Zeeland, Jackson and a 1,200-megawatt facility that began operating in Van Buren County’s Covert Township in June 2023.
Those operations “will supply reliable, on-demand electricity to meet Michigan’s energy needs when renewables and other sources are not available,” Van Kley said.
Meanwhile, efforts continue to restart operations at Palisades Nuclear Power Plant in Covert Township. The facility, owned by New Jersey-based Holtec International, went offline for decommissioning in May 2022.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-24-065259.png,,,2025-05-24 07:01:44.096996

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Income levels v. affordable housing markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”

Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 More schools, hospitals providing housing help for teachers, nurses

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast home-building states, like Idaho, have higher birth rates, federal data show

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Courtesy of the Nebraska Mesonet system)LINCOLN — Two National Weather Service offices that cover some rural parts of Nebraska will no longer monitor local weather around-the-clock. 
The Weather Service offices in neighboring states that forecast parts of western and southwest Nebraska cut back from 24/7 coverage after staffing reductions were made under the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. One office in Wyoming covers eight counties in the Nebraska Panhandle, and the other, in Kansas, forecasts for three counties in the southwestern corner of Nebraska. 
Those two offices in neighboring states are among only four nationally so short of staff that they lack enough meteorologists to staff an overnight shift. Other nearby forecasting offices — dealing with their own staffing problems — will have to handle the load during those shifts. They will be tasked with monitoring conditions and temporarily issuing forecasts and warnings each night for the two regions in addition to their normal coverage duties. 

Earlier this month, five former National Weather Service directors wrote an open letter to the public expressing fears that the cuts would endanger lives. An agreement last month between the Weather Service and its employees’ union warned of “degraded” services as more people leave.
“These shortages threaten public safety,” said Nebraska State Climatologist Deb Bathke, who works out of the State Climate Office based at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. 
Bathke said staff may be unable to provide accurate and timely severe weather warnings, monitor for storm reports and monitor radar during severe weather because the offices are running thin. 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spokesperson Kim Doster told the Nebraska Examiner that the Weather Service has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts from shifting personnel. The same NOAA spokesperson told the New York Times that “several local NWS offices are temporarily operating below around-the-clock staffing.”
“These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce,” Doster told the Examiner. 
The Trump Administration fired roughly 600 workers at NOAA and NWS in March as it tried to reshape the federal bureaucracy. NWS was understaffed long before Trump’s second term, but the recent cuts required “urgent action,” according to NOAA. 
NOAA is offering paid moving expenses to get employees to move voluntarily to fill positions across the country, including the Kansas office that covers Nebraska. Like other rural areas across the U.S, rural Nebraska has fewer news outlets providing crucial, time-dependent information, such as weather alerts, to the public. Many of those areas rely on rural radio stations. 
Nebraska Rural Radio Association, also known as Rural Radio Network, is a group of stations owned by farmers and ranchers that provides news and weather reports for rural areas of the state. NRRA’s Bill Boyer, who manages the Scottsbluff market, said the change “raises concern” due to the possibility of a missing severe weather alert. 
Boyer said that western Nebraska had its own NWS office in the 1990s, but it was shut down, and the remaining operations were moved to the Cheyenne office in Wyoming. 
“More troubling is that we received no communication from the National Weather Service,” Boyer said. 
Kevin Spencer, manager of the biggest city in the Panhandle, Scottsbluff, told the Examiner that the city is monitoring the changes to the Cheyenne NWS office and working with the Scotts Bluff County Emergency Management Office to do so.
“We support NWS staff and have complete confidence in their ability to manage their time effectively, ensuring we receive accurate information in the event of inclement weather,” Spencer said. “We have been assured that staff will be available in case of severe weather.”
The two parts of Nebraska affected by the recent staffing cuts in forecasting are in U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith’s congressional district and include his Gering-area home. 
Smith said timely and reliable weather warnings can make all the difference in a region of the state where severe weather can arise suddenly. 
“I am working to get additional information from the NWS to ensure Nebraskans have access to the information they need when it counts,” Smith said. 
Russ Pankonin, who lives in the state’s southwestern corner, in Imperial, said this is the first time the region has felt a direct effect of DOGE. Pankonin said the area shouldn’t feel an impact if the other offices tasked with the overnight shift can handle it. He ran the rural Imperial Republican newspaper and several nearby papers for years.
This isn’t the first DOGE cut to the Weather Service affecting Nebraska this year. 
In April, an NWS office in the Omaha area and other Great Plains offices announced pausing the deployment of weather balloons. That decision was reversed after some of the state’s federal delegation pushed back on those DOGE cuts. At the time, U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb., said he hoped to introduce legislation that would reclassify National Weather Service employees as public safety personnel because it would exempt them from future hiring freezes and buyouts.  Flood has since said the station is launching two weather balloons a day. 
However, the Omaha area NWS office has said it is still facing staffing issues.

Senate Bill 7 would allow for the creation of four overdose prevention centers in Connecticut. These are safe, supervised spaces where people can use their pre-obtained substances in the presence of trained staff who intervene in the event of an overdose. 
This bill (Raised as Senate Bill 1285) recently advanced to the floor after a vote in the Public Health Committee, where it passed almost along party lines. 9 Republicans opposed it, while 22 Democrats and 1 Republican voted in favor. Though divided in their votes, all members expressed deep concern for the lives impacted by addiction and overdose. This crisis touches nearly everyone, as many Americans know someone who has died from an overdose, leaving a wake of grief behind. 
At the heart of the debate lies a critical question: “Do overdose prevention centers help people get into treatment?” 
To address this, we must define what we mean by ‘treatment.’ 
Treatment as Abstinence? 
For many, “treatment” means complete abstinence from drug use. This belief is foundational to 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA), which frame addiction as a disease best treated through lifelong abstinence, peer support, and spiritual principles. While some people do find long-term recovery through abstinence-based programs, research shows that such strict abstinence is not a viable path for everyone. Addiction is a chronic relapsing condition, and data suggest that about 70% of people with an opioid use disorder will relapse at some point. This is not a moral failure, it is the nature of the condition. 
Why does this matter? Because relapse, especially after a period of abstinence, drastically increases their risk of overdose. Individuals lose their drug tolerance, and the modern drug supply is increasingly contaminated with fentanyl and xylazine, making even small relapses deadly. If our goal is to reduce overdose deaths, we must acknowledge that abstinence alone does not work for most people and should not be the only option. 
Treatment as Detox and Rehab? 
Others equate treatment with detoxification (i.e., withdrawal management) and inpatient rehabilitation programs – often called detox and rehab. While these programs can be helpful, they are not sufficient on their own. Research shows that people with addiction have a chronic condition in which the median time from first to last use is 27 years. This underscores a critical point: Substance use is rarely an immediate, one-time problem that can be resolved through a short-term intervention like one visit to detox or rehab. For people with long drug use histories, expecting instant or permanent change is not only unrealistic but also harmful. When individuals repeatedly enter programs that do not work for them, they are often discharged back into environments that increase their overdose risk—particularly if they have lost tolerance. Without ongoing support, detoxes alone have low success rates—many people relapse soon after leaving, often returning to use at levels that increase overdose risk. Further, withdrawal and detoxification are incredibly difficult, leading to symptoms such as fever, vomiting, seizures, and hallucinations. Sadly, Rehab programs that do not integrate medication for opioid use disorder often have poor outcomes—one Connecticut-based study found that individuals who continued using opioids had similar or even lower overdose death rates than those who attended detox and rehab without medication support.
So, what does work? 
Treatment as Medication for Opioid Use Disorder? 
The gold standard of addiction treatment is MOUD, such as methadone and buprenorphine. These medications (1) reduce drug cravings, (2) stabilize withdrawal symptoms, and (3) lower one’s risk of relapse and overdose. Overdose prevention centers can serve as a critical bridge to evidence-based treatment, providing a low-barrier entry point where individuals can engage with professionals and learn about medications for opioid use disorder, mental health support, and social services. 
But what if “treatment” could be even broader than that? 
Treatment as Any Positive Change?
Overdose prevention centers operate on the harm reduction principle that any positive change is a step in the right direction. On any given day, a person visiting an overdose prevention center may not enter treatment as defined above (i.e., abstinence, rehab, detox, medication for opioid use disorder), but they do stay alive another day, connected to and supported by staff and peers who will help them with treatment if and when they make that step. 
Each visit represents a moment of stability, a chance to engage in community, ask questions about safer use and overdose prevention, and make decisions at their own pace. While on a given day, someone visiting an overdose prevention center may not enter treatment as traditionally defined, they become part of a community that instinctively loves and cares for them. They might return the next day, alive and knowing they are safe. This could be the day they start a conversation with a peer worker, receive a pamphlet about support groups, or make an appointment with a doctor for a health issue. Over time, they might learn about access to mental health specialists and social workers. Eventually, they might inquire about medication-assisted treatment like methadone.
Overdose prevention centers offer a safe space where individuals are empowered by the community and the choice to pursue what is right for them at that moment. They build trust within a system that supports their needs rather than punishes them. 
This process is not hypothetical — it is a documented reality.

Do Overdose Prevention Centers Get People into Treatment? 
Decades of evidence say yes. Overdose prevention centers already exist in countries such as Canada, Australia, Spain, Germany, and Denmark. Research demonstrates overdose prevention centers increase engagement in treatment services (including medications for opioid use disorder, rehabilitation, detoxification, etc.) among people who use drugs, increase engagement with mental health care and healthcare systems in general (e.g., primary care), reduce overdose deaths, lower public drug use, and much more. New York City’s overdose prevention centers are already proving successful, offering wraparound services that acknowledge the complex realities of addiction — including trauma, mental health issues, and social barriers. 
Senate Bill 7: Crucial for Treatment of Substance Use in Connecticut 
Senate Bill 7 would create four pilot overdose prevention centers within existing service hubs, ensuring that visitors receive access to treatment options tailored to their individual needs—whether that means abstinence, medication for opioid use disorder, harm reduction, or social support. 
Rather than pushing an immediate “success-or-failure” model of treatment, overdose prevention centers acknowledge that recovery is a long-term process with many stages. While some individuals may take years to transition into traditional treatment, their first step may simply be staying alive long enough to make that choice. 
A common misconception is that overdose prevention centers “compete” with abstinence-based models like NA/AA. However, they complement these systems by meeting people where they are rather than demanding immediate abstinence. Some people will ultimately choose abstinence-based recovery. Some will choose MOUD and harm reduction. Some will take years to transition into formal treatment, but all deserve to live long enough to make that choice. 
Instead of arguing “which model is better?” we should ask: How can we expand recovery options so more people can survive and thrive? The evidence is clear: Overdose prevention centers are one of those options. 
Do OPCs help people get into treatment?
Yes—when we recognize that treatment means more than just abstinence. 
Yes—when we acknowledge that recovery is a process, not an on/off switch. 
Yes—when we focus on saving lives first, people have the chance to seek treatment when they are ready.

(Allison Joyce/AFP/Getty Images)Violent tornado outbreaks, like the storms that tore through parts of St. Louis and London, Kentucky, on May 16, have made 2025 seem like an especially active, deadly and destructive year for tornadoes.
The U.S. has had more reported tornadoes than normal — over 960 as of May 22, according to the National Weather Service’s preliminary count.
That’s well above the national average of around 660 tornadoes reported by that point over the past 15 years, and it’s similar to 2024 — the second-most active year over that same period.

I’m an atmospheric scientist who studies natural hazards. What stands out about 2025 so far isn’t just the number of tornadoes, but how Tornado Alley has encompassed just about everything east of the Rockies, and how tornado season is becoming all year.
 
Why has 2025 been so active?
The high tornado count in 2025 has a lot to do with the weather in March, which broke records with 299 reported tornadoes — far exceeding the average of 80 for that month over the past three decades.
March’s numbers were driven by two large tornado outbreaks: about 115 tornadoes swept across more than a dozen states March 14-16, stretching from Arkansas to Pennsylvania; and 145 tornadoes hit March 31 to April 1, primarily in a swath from Arkansas to Iowa and eastward. The 2025 numbers are preliminary pending final analyses.
While meteorologists don’t know for sure why March was so active, there were a couple of ingredients that favor tornadoes:

First, in March the climate was in a weak La Niña pattern, which is associated with a wavier and stormier jet stream and, often, with more U.S. tornadoes.
Second, the waters of the Gulf were much warmer than normal, which feeds moister air inland to fuel severe thunderstorms.

By April and May, however, those ingredients had faded. The weak La Niña ended and the Gulf waters were closer to normal.
April and May also produced tornado outbreaks, but the preliminary count over most of this period, since the March 31-April 1 outbreak, has actually been close to the average, though things could still change.
What has stood out in April and May is persistence: The jet stream has remained wavy, bringing with it the normal ebb and flow of stormy low-pressure weather systems mixed with sunny high-pressure systems. In May alone, tornadoes were reported in Colorado, Minnesota, Delaware, Florida and just about every state in between.
Years with fewer tornadoes often have calm periods of a couple of weeks or longer when a sunny high-pressure system is parked over the central U.S. However, the U.S. didn’t really get one of those calm periods in spring 2025.
 
Tornado Alley shifts eastward
The locations of these storms have also been notable: The 2025 tornadoes through May have been widespread but clustered near the lower and central Mississippi Valley, stretching from Illinois to Mississippi.
That’s well to the east of traditional Tornado Alley, typically seen as stretching from Texas through Nebraska, and farther east than normal. April through May is still peak season for the Mississippi Valley, though it is usually on the eastern edge of activity rather than at the epicenter. The normal seasonal cycle of tornadoes moves inland from near the Gulf Coast in winter to the upper Midwest and Great Plains by summer.
  Where local forecast centers reported tornadoes in 2025, through May 22. Data is preliminary, pending final analysis. (NOAA Storm Prediction Center)
Over the past few decades, the U.S. has seen a broad shift in tornadoes in three ways: to the east, earlier in the year and clustered into larger outbreaks.
Winter tornadoes have become more frequent over the eastern U.S., from the southeast, dubbed Dixie Alley for its tornado activity in recent years, to the Midwest, particularly Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.
Meanwhile, there has been a steady and stark decline in tornadoes in the “traditional” tornado season and region: spring and summer in general, especially across the Great Plains.
It may come as a surprise that the U.S. has actually seen a decrease in overall U.S. tornado activity over the past several decades, especially for intense tornadoes categorized as EF2 and above. There have been fewer days with a tornado. However, those tornado days have been producing more tornadoes. These trends may have stabilized over the past decade.
 
Deadlier tornadoes
This eastward shift is likely making tornadoes deadlier.
Tornadoes in the Southeastern U.S. are more likely to strike overnight, when people are asleep and cannot quickly protect themselves, which makes these events dramatically more dangerous. The tornado that hit London, Kentucky, struck after 11 p.m. Many of the victims were over age 65.
The shift toward more winter tornadoes has also left people more vulnerable. Since they may not expect tornadoes at that time of year, they are likely to be less prepared. Tornado detection and forecasting is rapidly improving and has saved thousands of lives over the past 50-plus years, but forecasts can save lives only if people are able to receive them.

This shift in tornadoes to the east and earlier in the year is very similar to how scientists expect severe thunderstorms to change as the world warms. However, researchers don’t know whether the overall downward trend in tornadoes is driven by warming or will continue into the future. Field campaigns studying how tornadoes form may help us better answer this question
 
Remember that it only takes one
For safety, it’s time to stop focusing on spring as tornado season and the Great Plains as Tornado Alley.
Tornado Alley is really all of the U.S. east of the Rockies and west of the Appalachians for most of the year. The farther south you live, the longer your tornado season lasts.
Forecasters say it every year for hurricanes, and we badly need to start saying it for tornadoes too: It only takes one to make it a bad season for you or your community. Just ask the residents of London, Kentucky; St. Louis; Plevna and Grinnell, Kansas; and McNairy County, Tennessee.
Listen to your local meteorologists so you will know when your region is facing a tornado risk. And if you hear sirens or are under a tornado warning, immediately go to your safe space. A tornado may already be on the ground, and you may have only seconds to protect yourself.

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”




Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now.


– Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education



Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.

“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)

“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

Rockville is one of three hospitals in Connecticut owned by Los Angeles-based Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for bankruptcy in January. 
The settlement signed on Friday between Prospect and the state of Connecticut concludes an ongoing state investigation into unauthorized service cuts at Rockville launched in October of last year. Prospect agreed that Connecticut will have a $300,000 claim included in the bankruptcy case as a result of the termination of services, subject to approval by the court. 
The terms require Prospect to maintain emergency services at Rockville for three years and keep existing inpatient behavioral health services “at or within 30 miles of their current location on the RGH campus.” However, it doesn’t require the operator to reopen services that were cut without state permission. 
The agreement also grants Prospect permission from the state’s Office of Health Strategy, or OHS, to terminate Rockville’s status as a full-service acute care hospital and convert it into a satellite campus of Manchester Memorial Hospital, located 20 minutes away. Prospect must now also obtain permission for the consolidation from the Department of Public Health, which oversees hospital licensing, Wendy Fuchs, a spokesperson for OHS confirmed. 
A spokesperson for the Department of Public Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday. 
In a Friday press release, OHS Commissioner Deidre Gifford said the agreement “protects critical resources” for patients and families in the area.
“The agreement also holds the Prospect applicants accountable to the community, requiring public notice of past terminations and development of a strategic plan for the consolidated hospital.  The plan must be developed with community input and presented to the community in a public forum,” Gifford’s statement read.  
The agreement requires Prospect to announce the consolidation of Rockville with Manchester Memorial publicly, create an interim strategic plan for services at Rockville and hold a community forum within 60 days. 
Spokespeople with Prospect Medical Holdings and Eastern Connecticut Health Network, which owns Rockville General and Manchester Memorial, did not respond to a request for comment.
In March, Suzanne Koenig, a bankruptcy-court appointed patient care ombuds reported that, during a visit to Rockville General, she found that surgical services, as well as the intensive care and medical-surgical units at the hospital had remained closed since March 2020. The company did not receive state permission to permanently close any of those services in advance of doing so.
State law defines a termination of services as “the cessation of any services for a period greater than one hundred eighty days.” Termination of services by a hospital without state approval can result in civil penalties of up to $1,000 per day.
The unauthorized cuts were the subject of an October 2023 investigation by the Connecticut Mirror. 
When Prospect filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, state officials offered assurances that its three Connecticut hospitals would remain open and operating. 
​​“Some people think bankruptcy means the lights go out and the party’s over. That’s not true at all. These hospitals are very successful,” Lamont said during a press conference in the days following the bankruptcy announcement.
Although Rockville General will technically remain operational, it will no longer be a stand-alone, full-service acute care hospital. 
A spokesperson for Lamont did not return a request for comment. 
Rep. Tammy Nuccio, R-Tolland, whose district contains Rockville General Hospital, said Friday that the state had failed her residents.
“Profit over people. That’s what I think we’ve come to expect here unfortunately from OHS and the state when it comes to health care for residents that are not in large cities,” Nuccio said. 
The agreement with the state will be binding for any future buyers of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals. 
Yale New Haven Health first reached a tentative agreement to purchase the three facilities from Prospect for $435 million in 2022. But the deal has been mired in complications since then, including lawsuits and, most recently, Prospect’s bankruptcy. In February, Yale said it would be “impossible” to close the deal.
An auction process for the Prospect-owned hospitals will take place through bankruptcy court. 
In the state’s Friday announcement, OHS said the process is “ongoing.” In court documents, the sale hearing was tentatively scheduled for June 5, but no notice of hearing has been officially posted and spokespeople for Prospect and their lawyers have not responded to multiple requests regarding the auction timeline.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 21:00:36.276697

The rule change went into effect May 17 and was announced Monday.
The move does not apply to federally protected Columbian white-tailed deer. Instead, it allows salvage of elk and black-tailed deer in the three counties with a Fish & Wildlife-issued roadkill salvage permit.
“We carefully reviewed available data and determined the risk of mistakenly salvaging Columbian white-tailed deer is low,” Kyle Garrison, the department’s ungulate section manager, said in the announcement.
It’s still illegal to salvage, handle or possess Columbian white-tailed deer in Washington. Fish & Wildlife asks salvagers to report when the remains of that species are found.
While eating roadkill can be dangerous, salvagers west of the Cascades have not had to worry about chronic wasting disease in dead animals.
“We have not had any cases of chronic wasting disease in southwest Washington,” said Britton Ransford, Fish & Wildlife’s spokesman for the region.
The department stressed that salvaging deer and elk is allowed only for animals killed in motor vehicle crashes. It also said anyone who takes possession of a carcass is required to obtain a free roadkill salvage permit within 24 hours.

(Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)A Gallatin County Commissioner described a scalding letter from the attorney general about a local legal opinion as “political theater” and said Friday the county has had the longest-standing agreement with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement of any county in Montana.
Wednesday, Attorney General Austin Knudsen sent a letter to the Gallatin County Commissioners criticizing a legal opinion — which Knudsen put inside quotations as “legal opinion” — by Gallatin County Attorney Audrey Cromwell.
The April 24 opinion from Cromwell argued against entering into an agreement with ICE to detain undocumented immigrants from across the state at the Gallatin County Detention Center.
Cromwell said doing so would raise constitutional and legal questions and potentially cost taxpayers millions of dollars.
The Trump administration has been aggressive in pursuing, and in some cases deporting, immigrants nationwide, including in Montana, as the president pledged to do in his campaign.
In March, MTN News reported that ICE detained 17 immigrants it described as undocumented in Bigfork.
In some cases, judges have found authorities under Trump acted without due process and deported people illegally, including legal immigrants and even U.S. citizens. A New York Times analysis said illegal deportations are difficult to undo.
But immigration is a political hot button, and in his criticism of the Gallatin prosecutor, Knudsen said the American people sent Donald Trump back to the White House “to secure our border,” and Montanans want state officials to support his agenda, “not undermine it.”
“At its core, the Cromwell Opinion is an endorsement of the disastrous open border policies of the Biden administration,” Knudsen said in his letter.
In a 2024 report, the Pew Research Center said unauthorized immigrants hit a 12.2 million peak in 2007 and, after a downward trend, crept up again in recent years to 11.1 million in 2022, and likely higher since then.
“My office fought back against these destructive policies for four long years, and I refuse to stand by as feckless left-wing prosecutors attempt to subvert the will of the people and put dangerous criminals back on the streets,” Knudsen wrote.
In response, Cromwell said in a statement that Gallatin County already participates in a program, known as the federal 287(g) program, that ensures “undocumented individuals charged with a crime in Gallatin County are immediately flagged and held for ICE.”
The 287(g) program authorizes local law enforcement officials to perform specific immigration duties under the agency’s oversight.
“Given constitutional concerns regarding due process, significant legal liability, and added strain on overburdened County resources, I stand by my legal opinion, which advises the Commission against entering into an additional agreement with ICE to detain non-local undocumented immigrants in the Gallatin County Detention Center,” Cromwell said.
Her legal opinion said earlier this year, a court found Suffolk County in New York responsible for $60 million in a class action lawsuit that found unconstitutional detention practices of undocumented immigrants. The county is appealing the decision, according to a local news report.
Gallatin County Commissioners said they already cooperate with ICE on immigration and will “continue to work closely with the Gallatin County Attorney, who was elected by our community.”
“And we will continue supporting the Sheriff and his dedicated team of public safety heroes,” Commissioners said in a statement.
In an interview Friday, Gallatin County Commissioner Zach Brown said under the existing agreement, Gallatin County already temporarily holds detainees for ICE to pick up when an immigration flag comes up during booking.
“That’s a legal framework that is in place and has been in place for a long time,” Brown said.
Cromwell’s opinion said 1.4% of the county jail population has been flagged for ICE holds over the last year.
Brown also said he wanted to cut through some of the rhetoric around immigration. For one, Brown said the president and the attorney general are conflating civil and criminal law — and doing so “intentionally.”
In other words, he said, local government and county law enforcement handle criminal offenses, but federal civil procedures govern people whose immigration status is questioned.
County facilities and services aren’t designed, funded or empowered to execute federal civil procedures, he said. Rhetoric, including from President Trump, implies that every illegal person is a criminal, he said, but that’s not necessarily true.
“If someone has an immigration issue, that does not make them inherently a criminal under American federal law,” Brown said.
However, he also said Gallatin County has made “record investments” in public safety, including in salaries, new positions, and equipment, and resources for the drug task force, courts, “and on and on.”
“That trajectory and commitment to law enforcement is really strong with this commission and within this community,” Brown said.
In February, MTN News reported ICE agents arrested six alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua in Gallatin County. At the time, Sheriff Dan Springer told MTN News law enforcement had been working to combat the gang and had been successful given no violent incidents had been reported.
Springer could not be reached by voicemail Friday for an update.
Cromwell’s opinion said those people were held solely on ICE detainers and not on criminal charges, and the situation demonstrates the risk that counties may inadvertently hold people without due process.
Brown also pointed to statistics that show Gallatin County has the second lowest crime rate among urban counties in Montana, only behind Flathead County.
Citing the Montana Board of Crime Control, he said Gallatin had 540 incidents per 10,000 in 2023, the most recent data available, compared to 1,100 per 10,000 in Cascade County, reporting the highest number per capita.

Brown also said that at its root, immigration is squarely a federal issue, and an argument about a county contract, “a minor, minor issue,” is a distraction from the fact that Congress hasn’t taken action on immigration reform since 1986.
“It’s infuriating that these issues are getting talked about at the local government level. Just that, in and of itself, is political theater,” Brown said.
He said local government is at the behest of the federal government when it comes to immigration, it’s experienced whiplash upon changes in administration, and it will continue without action.
“Congress is allowing the executive branch to make policy on immigration law, and that’s not the executive’s job under the constitution and our form of government,” Brown said.
He called on Montana’s congressional delegation to legislate, and he said the dispute over the additional agreement between ICE and Gallatin County is just a symptom of the disease.
“The cancer in the system is Congress’ inaction. So Congress needs to get off their butt and do their job,” Brown said.
U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy are from Bozeman in Gallatin County and could not be immediately reached for comment on Friday. However, in remarks three weeks ago and posted on his Facebook page, Daines said presidential leadership matters.
He said law enforcement officers in Bozeman told him they weren’t getting any response from ICE under the Biden administration, and that changed right after Trump was sworn into office.
“Within 30 days, those ICE agents swarmed and got those TDA (Tren de Aragua) guys apprehended and deported from our country. That directly affects my hometown of Bozeman,” Daines said.
In his letter, Knudsen, said the “horrors aren’t hypothetical.” In his letter, he said under the Biden administration, the state Crime Lab reported 262 fentanyl-linked deaths in Montana, and he said 100% of illicit fentanyl seized in Montana is trafficked across the border.
“In one Gallatin County operation conducted in March, three illegal immigrants were arrested on drug-related charges and methamphetamine, cocaine, cash and four vehicles were seized,” Knudsen said.
He also said earlier this year, the Eastern Montana High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area seized 9,400 carfentanil pills in Billings, just a couple of hours away from Gallatin County. He said carfentanil is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, “making it even more dangerous and deadly.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2234-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

A state-funded scientific research institute. Exempting service workers’ tips from state income tax.
Those are among the hundreds of proposals California lawmakers swiftly rejected Friday under the banner of cost savings, as they cited the state’s $12 billion budget deficit — a worsening figure due to the threat of unprecedented federal funding cuts and California’s ballooning spending on health care for low-income residents. 
“We are in (a) very difficult budget environment this year, so consequently many good bills are going to fall by the wayside today,” said Assembly Appropriations Committee Chair Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, before beginning that chamber’s hearing. 
“We are not in a year where we can be expanding programs, developing new offices, new agencies, new departments, and expanding our footprints.”
The Friday procedure is known as the “suspense file” — the state Legislature’s most secretive and fast-paced biannual hearing, where the chairs of the Assembly and Senate Appropriations committees quickly shoot down pricey proposals with little explanation, often acting more aggressively during years of budget woes. 
The suspense files are where the appropriations committees send bills that would cost the state at least $50,000 in the Senate and $150,000 in the Assembly. The process was originally a way for lawmakers to consider policy proposals that cost the state money together by balancing them against each other. 
But the well-accepted open secret in Sacramento is that it’s also an opportunity for lawmakers to quietly kill controversial bills, appease powerful special interests or just winnow down the number of bills they’ll have to debate on the floor. Lawmakers decide ahead of time, in secret, whether to pass the bills to the full Senate or Assembly, or to withhold them. The public hearings are a rapid-fire announcement of the decisions.
On Friday, the Senate Appropriations Committee axed 29% of the 432 bills on its list, although it kept a handful of those alive to work on next year. That’s more aggressive trimming than the committee did last May. 
“The state is facing a significant budget deficit and with that in mind, the committee had to make difficult choices on a number of bills to reduce costs,” said Senate Appropriations Chairperson Anna Caballero, a Merced Democrat, before the hearing. She opened the hearing with a defense of the arcane proceedings, explaining that the results would be posted online, but rushed out to catch a flight after the meeting without discussing her approach with reporters. 
The Assembly Appropriations Committee killed 35% of the 666 measures on its suspense file, similar to last year. Lawmakers had been warned to keep the cost of their proposals down, Wicks said. 
“We stressed heavily to members as they were putting together their legislative package this year to be very mindful of cost,” she told reporters.
The state’s fiscal future is anything but certain: As federal threats loom, Gov. Gavin Newsom earlier this month rolled out a $322 billion spending plan that included significant cuts to Medi-Cal, the state’s health care system for low-income Californians, and a 3% cut to public universities. 
Health care expansions on the chopping block
On Friday, some Assembly measures that would have expanded health care services for Californians met their fate. That includes Wicks’ own proposal seeking federal approval to qualify some housing services as Medi-Cal benefits, a $40 million endeavor that Newsom previously vetoed. The committee also killed a proposal to allow more Medi-Cal enrollees to receive home-based care and another that would have allowed higher-earning immigrants in the country illegally to purchase insurance plans on Covered California, the state-run health care marketplace.

In the Senate, lawmakers shelved a proposal by Sen. Catherine Blakespear to impose campaign contribution limits on candidates for judicial office and school board races, which the influential California Teachers Association opposed. They axed Sen. Henry Stern’s proposal to expand the state’s contentious new mental health program CARE Courts to include defendants with bipolar disorder I, and Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil’s bill to address mountain lion interactions that has pitted rural communities against animal rights and wildlife conservation advocates. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee also killed two Republican tough-on-crime proposals, showing the limits of Democrats’ recent shift slightly rightward on crime. Until Friday, it had been surprisingly smooth sailing this year for Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones’ bill to block sex offenders from being released from prison through the state’s elderly parole program, and Sen. Kelly Seyarto’s bill to increase penalties for selling or giving fentanyl to minors.
The law enforcement-backed bills were opposed by criminal justice reform advocates, who still hold sway with the majority party and often argue it would be too costly for the state to imprison more people. 
In a statement, Jones, a San Diego Republican, called the suspense file process “anti-democratic” and accused Democrats of “silencing the voices of victims and the public.”
Some measures are now postponed until next year. That includes two Assembly measures seeking tighter regulations on ticket sales for sports and musical events, amid fierce opposition from ticketing platforms such as Stubhub and from local chambers of commerce. The measures would restrict when those platforms can resell tickets, strengthen the disclosure of ticket information and require venues to accept proof of purchase as tickets. 
Assm. Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat who authored one of the measures, said Wicks never articulated her concerns with his proposal, even though Wicks told reporters Friday her staff had been in touch with Bryan’s office. “There was never an attempt to discuss the bill,” which led him to believe her concerns had been alleviated, Bryan said in a statement. 
Lawmakers also pushed off some issues to be debated further during budget negotiations between the Legislature and Newsom. That process will accelerate in the coming weeks before a mid-June deadline to pass a balanced budget. 
Newsom’s film tax credit pushed to budget talk
They stripped out language in both Assembly and Senate bills to more than double the state’s film tax credit to $750 million. Newsom has pushed hard for the tax credit expansion to help the ailing Los Angeles industry and keep production in state, and he’s included the money in his budget proposals which lawmakers will debate separately. 
Assemblymember Rick Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat who authored the Assembly version of the measure, said the committee move was merely a technical one to separate budget allocations from policy changes. 
“The increase in the size of the program will happen in the budget,” Zbur said. “I’m not that nervous about it.”
But to others, the move indicated that some lawmakers remain skeptical of spending so much on the program. Sen. Ben Allen, an El Segundo Democrat who sponsored the Senate bill to boost the tax credits, said he was “certainly disappointed.”
“It’s something we are going to push back against as budget negotiations begin to heat up,” he said in a statement.
An ambitious and highly technical proposal by Sen. Scott Wiener reining in the landmark California Environmental Quality Act to make it harder for opponents of development to sue to block housing projects also will be debated in the budget process.
In the Senate Appropriations Committee, lawmakers passed the bill but Caballero said they would continue negotiating it to help the state meet its housing needs “without compromising environmental protections.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/052325_Suspense-Day_FG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s signature budget legislation would punish 14 states that offer health coverage to people in the U.S. without authorization.
The states, most of them Democratic-led, provide insurance to some low-income immigrants — often children — regardless of their legal status. Advocates argue the policy is both humane and ultimately cost-saving.
But the federal legislation, which Republicans have titled the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” would slash federal Medicaid reimbursements to those states by billions of dollars a year in total unless they roll back the benefits.
The bill narrowly passed the House on Thursday and next moves to the Senate. While enacting much of Trump’s domestic agenda, including big tax cuts largely benefiting wealthier Americans, the legislation also makes substantial spending cuts to Medicaid that congressional budget scorekeepers say will leave millions of low-income people without health insurance.
The cuts, if approved by the Senate, would pose a tricky political and economic hurdle for the states and Washington, D.C., which use their own funds to provide health insurance to some people in the U.S. without authorization.
Those states would see their federal reimbursement for people covered under the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion cut by 10 percentage points. The cuts would cost California, the state with the most to lose, as much as $3 billion a year, according to an analysis by KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
Together, the 15 affected places cover about 1.9 million immigrants without legal status, according to KFF. The penalty might also apply to other states that cover lawfully residing immigrants, KFF says.
Two of the states — Utah and Illinois — have “trigger” laws that call for their Medicaid expansions to terminate if the feds reduce their funding match. That means unless those states either repeal their trigger laws or stop covering people without legal immigration status, many more low-income Americans could be left uninsured.
The remaining states and Washington, D.C., would have to come up with millions or billions more dollars every year, starting in the 2027 fiscal year, to make up for reductions in their federal Medicaid reimbursements, if they keep covering people in the U.S. without authorization.
Behind California, New York stands to lose the most federal funding — about $1.6 billion annually, according to KFF.
California state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat who chairs the Senate budget committee, said Trump’s legislation has sown chaos as state legislators work to pass their own budget by June 15.
“We need to stand our ground,” he said. “California has made a decision that we want universal health care and that we are going to ensure that everyone has access to health care, and that we’re not going to have millions of undocumented people getting their primary care in emergency rooms.”
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement that Trump’s bill would devastate health care in his state.
“Millions will lose coverage, hospitals will close, and safety nets could collapse under the weight,” Newsom said.
In his May 14 budget proposal, Newsom called on lawmakers to cut some benefits for immigrants without legal status, citing ballooning costs in the state’s Medicaid program. If Congress cuts Medicaid expansion funding, the state would be in no position to backfill, the governor said.
Newsom questioned whether Congress has the authority to penalize states for how they spend their own money and said his state would consider challenging the move in court.
Utah state Rep. Jim Dunnigan, a Republican who helped spearhead a bill to cover children in his state regardless of their immigration status, said Utah needs to maintain its Medicaid expansion that began in 2020.
“We cannot afford, monetary-wise or policy-wise, to see our federal expansion funding cut,” he said. Dunnigan wouldn’t say whether he thinks the state should end its immigrant coverage if the Republican penalty provision becomes law.
Utah’s program covers about 2,000 children, the maximum allowed under its law. Adult immigrants without legal status are not eligible. Utah’s Medicaid expansion covers about 75,000 adults, who must be citizens or lawfully present immigrants.
Matt Slonaker, executive director of the Utah Health Policy Project, a consumer advocacy organization, said the federal House bill leaves the state in a difficult position.
“There are no great alternatives, politically,” he said. “It’s a prisoner’s dilemma — a move in either direction does not make much sense.”
Slonaker said one likely scenario is that state lawmakers eliminate their trigger law then find a way to make up the loss of federal expansion funding.
Utah has funded its share of the cost of Medicaid expansion with sales and hospital taxes.
“This is a very hard political decision that Congress would put the state of Utah in,” Slonaker said.
In Illinois, the GOP penalty would have even larger consequences. That’s because it could lead to 770,000 adults’ losing the health coverage they gained under the state’s Medicaid expansion.
Stephanie Altman, director of health care justice at the Shriver Center on Poverty Law, a Chicago-based advocacy group, said it’s possible her Democratic-led state would end its trigger law before allowing its Medicaid expansion to terminate. She said the state might also sidestep the penalty by asking counties to fund coverage for immigrants. “It would be a hard situation, obviously,” she said.
Altman said the House bill appeared written to penalize Democratic-controlled states because they more commonly provide immigrants coverage without regard for their legal status.
She said the provision shows Republicans’ “hostility against immigrants” and that “they do not want them coming here and receiving public coverage.”
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said this month that state programs that provide public coverage to people regardless of immigration status serve as “an open doormat,” inviting more people to cross the border without authorization. He said efforts to end such programs have support in public polling.
A Reuters-Ipsos poll conducted May 16-18 found that 47% of Americans approve of Trump’s immigration policies and 45% disapprove. The poll found that Trump’s overall approval rating has sunk 5 percentage points since he returned to office in January, to 42%, with 52% of Americans disapproving of his performance.
The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, enabled states to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes of up to 138% of the federal poverty level, or $21,597 for an individual this year. Forty states and Washington, D.C., expanded, helping reduce the national uninsured rate to a historic low.
The federal government now pays 90% of the costs for people added to Medicaid under the Obamacare expansion.
In states that cover health care for immigrants in the U.S. without authorization, the Republican bill would reduce the federal government’s contribution from 90% to 80% of the cost of coverage for anyone added to Medicaid under the ACA expansion.
By law, federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to cover people who are in the country without authorization, except for pregnancy and emergency services.
The other states that use their own money to cover people regardless of immigration status are Colorado, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, according to KFF.
Ryan Long, director of congressional relations at Paragon Health Institute, an influential conservative policy group, said that even if they use their own money for immigrant coverage, states still depend on federal funds to “support systems that facilitate enrollment of illegal aliens.”
Long said the concern that states with trigger laws could see their Medicaid expansion end is a “red herring” because states have the option to remove their triggers, as Michigan did in 2023.
The penalty for covering people in the country without authorization is one of several ways the House bill cuts federal Medicaid spending.
The legislation would shift more Medicaid costs to states by requiring them to verify whether adults covered by the program are working. States would also have to recertify Medicaid expansion enrollees’ eligibility every six months, rather than once a year or less, as most states currently do.
The bill would also freeze states’ practice of taxing hospitals, nursing homes, managed-care plans, and other health care companies to fund their share of Medicaid costs.
The Congressional Budget Office said in a May 11 preliminary estimate that, under the House-passed bill, about 8.6 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034. That number will rise to nearly 14 million, the CBO estimates, after the Trump administration finishes new ACA regulations and if the Republican-led Congress, as expected, declines to extend enhanced premium subsidies for commercial insurance plans sold through Obamacare marketplaces.
The enhanced subsidies, a priority of former President Joe Biden, eliminated monthly premiums altogether for some people buying Obamacare plans. They are set to expire at the end of the year.

Mental health day
Lawmakers commemorated the third annual Mental Health and Wellness Day on Tuesday and used the occasion to highlight some of the bills they are working on this session. Rep. Kai Belton, D-Middletown, who led a press conference, said she wanted to create a “space for healing and support and for connection” when she started the mental health and wellness fair.
Among the bills on the table, H.B. 7158 would require health care providers treating minor patients to send a safety plan to that child’s school with the consent of their parent or guardian, and develop a discharge plan in a timely manner from inpatient facilities.
Rep. Tammy Exum, D-West Hartford, said the pandemic brought the children’s behavioral health crisis to the forefront. “Children should not have to leave the state of Connecticut to get the care that they needed.”— Laura Tillman, Human Services Reporter
Multifamily housing bans
The state House of Representatives on Tuesday passed a bill that would ban towns from temporary pauses on multifamily housing constructions, a measure that aims to ensure municipalities don’t use zoning to ban apartment construction outright.
Trumbull has a moratorium in place that has stretched on for six years. Ridgefield has been trying to get one. Towns sometimes say they’re using these plans to pause applications while they plan where they want to put apartments or affordable housing.
“We believe that this leads to a shortage of housing in areas that really really need housing that’s more affordable, need better places for people to live,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport, on the pauses.
Republicans opposed the measure, saying it would weaken local control. “I also worry about single-family housing,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe. “By not addressing it in this bill, we are saying that a town could ban single-family housing.”
The bill next heads to the Senate for a vote.— Ginny Monk, Housing & Children’s Issues Reporter
Net equality
The Senate passed a bill on Wednesday by a 29 to 7 majority that seeks to create more affordable internet access for low-income Connecticut residents. Senate Bill 514, as amended on Wednesday, would encourage broadband providers to offer a $40 per month plan for broadband internet, which would include all taxes and fees. Residents who are enrolled in SNAP would qualify.
Under the amended bill broadband internet providers that offer an affordable option would be given preference in state contracts, creating a “more stick than carrot approach,” Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, said. “It’s not saying you need to do this to get a state contract, you could still win one without opting into this program, however it does give you preference in winning a state contract,” he said.
During the Senate discussion on Wednesday, Sen. Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven asked if the bill would spur an increase on internet rates for users who don’t qualify. Maroney said he didn’t believe so because most companies already provide a low cost service. The bill now heads to the House.

Serving green crabs
One of Connecticut’s most invasive species could soon find its path to the dinner plate eased under legislation approved by lawmakers on Thursday. The Senate gave unanimous approval to House Bill 6222, which would allow restaurants to serve invasive green crabs and other “bait” species without obtaining a license from the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.
The tiny crabs, which arrived from Europe and can wreak havoc on native habitats, are currently on the menu at The Shipwright’s Daughter, a James-Beard-award-winning restaurant in Mystic.
David Standridge, the executive chef and partner at the restaurant, told lawmakers in written testimony earlier this year that he has to import the crabs from Rhode Island due to the regulations in Connecticut. “Luckily we can eat our way out of this problem as green crabs have a very high culinary value,” he said.
In addition to easing the rules for restaurants to serve up green crabs, the bill also authorizes the Department of Agriculture to study lowering the minimum harvest size of oysters below the current standard of three inches. While some proponents pointed to consumers’ preference for smaller oysters, members of Connecticut’s oyster industry have argued in support of the current minimums, which they said help maintain the health of the species in Long Island Sound.

Scholarships for aspiring teachers
A bill that would broaden scholarship eligibility for aspiring educators passed unanimously out of the Senate Thursday. Senate Bill 1513 would reframe what was known as the Aspiring Educators Diversity Scholarship Program.
The scholarship currently offers up to $10,000 annually to graduates from priority school districts — the top 10 lowest performing districts in the state — who are now seeking to become educators. The new proposal would open the scholarship to anyone becoming a teacher who comes from “a population subgroup that is underrepresented in the teaching profession in Connecticut and has been identified as a teacher shortage area under state law,” according to an Office of Legislative Research bill analysis.
The bill is expected to incentivize more people to enter the teaching profession as it hits critical staffing levels, lawmakers said earlier this legislative session.

Recovery Day
Lawmakers shared personal stories on Thursday of how they and their families have been touched by addiction and recovery. Surrounded by groups that support people in recovery across Connecticut, Rep. Robin Comey, D-Branford, Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, Rep. Toni Walker, D-New Haven, Rep. Bill Heffernan, D-West Haven, Rep, Cristin McCarthy Vahey, D-Fairfield, and Rep. Devin Carney, R-Old Saybrook, Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton and others.
Heffernan said that as a state representative, he goes to a million meetings, but, “The most important meetings I go to begin with me standing up and saying, ‘My name’s Bill, and I’m an alcoholic.'”
Carney, who said he had not planned to speak, shared that his father had died of addiction. “Throughout my whole childhood he was an addict,” Carney said. “People in recovery can do anything. They can be executives, they can be teachers, they can be doctors, and they can be elected officials in this building. And I’m one of them.”
Statewide efforts to support people in recovery with job, housing, counseling and other supports are showing promising signs of success. Overdose deaths fell across the U.S. in 2024, which is reflected in Connecticut’s statistics.— Laura Tillman, Human Services Reporter
Pay hikes for CT troopers
The state Senate unanimously approved an agreement Thursday granting 885 unionized state police troopers a 2.5% general wage hike and a step increase next fiscal year. The House of Representatives approved the raises earlier in the week by a 134-12 margin.
Legislators from both parties have lamented a state police force that’s now about 25% smaller than the 1,200-plus troopers who served Connecticut prior to 2010. Nearly all unionized state workers have received a 2.5% general wage hike and a step, which typically adds another 2 percentage points to the raise, each fiscal year since 2021-22.
Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration, which negotiated the wage deal with the troopers, also is bargaining new contracts with all other major state employee unions. And it would be difficult for state officials not to award matching raises to other unions. That’s because they would have to convince labor arbiters that Connecticut could not afford effective 4.5% annual increases for other state employees even though the legislature approved such raises for troopers.— Keith M. Phaneuf, State Budget Reporter
Street takeovers
The House paused discussion on a bill meant to increase penalties for people involved in street takeovers after several Republicans argued over provisions for seizing and destroying ATVs.
The bill allows towns and cities to adopt ordinances against street takeovers and to fine drivers and revoke or suspend the licenses of those who participate. Under the bill, a municipality would be allowed to destroy ATVs and dirt-bikes that were seized by the police after violating municipal ordinances if the owner does not claim the vehicles within 30 days.
The largest point of contention was how to identify the owners of ATVs after they were seized by the police. Rep. Craig Fishbein, R-Wallingford, noted that the municipalities who supported this bill wanted a way to dispose of the vehicles, which they were currently required to hold onto or auction. But Fishbein said many of the vehicles used at street takeovers are stolen, which makes it hard for the police to identify the owners, and possibly requiring the municipality to hold onto the vehicle indefinitely.
Rep. Jack Fazzino, D-Meriden, said he felt the ordinances would be difficult to enforce in smaller towns. The amendment failed on party lines.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
Traffic stops
Republicans unsuccessfully attempted to reinstate police officers’ ability to conduct consent searches in motor vehicles during a Senate debate Thursday. Senate Minority Leader Steve Harding, R-Brookfield, offered an amendment to a bill changing some of the laws around secondary traffic stops.
The bill would remove several equipment violations from a list of legal infractions for which Connecticut motorists can be pulled over, including a broken headlight; having license plates displayed in a rear window, but “plainly legible”; or having a windshield ornament or sticker, as long as it doesn’t “significantly block or conceal” the driver’s ability to see. It also allows a police officer to pull over drivers who they see consuming a cannabis product and smell its “burnt odor.”
Harding’s amendment would have allowed police officers to search a vehicle if the officer has “reasonable and articulable suspicion that weapons, contraband or other evidence of a crime is contained within the vehicle.” Harding argued that police officers saw consent searches, which were prohibited under the 2020 Police Accountability Act, as the most effective way of finding illegal drugs and weapons. 
Senate President Pro Tem Martin Looney, D-New Haven, disagreed, saying the idea of anticipating crimes and preventing them in advance was “chilling in our democracy.” The amendment failed 12-24 on party lines. The bill passed unanimously.— Emilia Otte, Justice Reporter
LGBTQ rights at nursing homes
A bill intended to promote LGBTQ rights among nursing home patients exposed intra-party differences in the General Assembly among House and Senate Republicans. The bill, which was amended in the House to draw bipartisan support, won final passage Thursday in the Senate on a 26-10 vote, with every Democrat in favor and every Republican save one in opposition.
It was a different story in the House, where the bill passed on a 124-19 vote, with every Democrat and 27 Republicans in favor, including House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. The House Republicans became more comfortable with the bill after an amendment struck a provision that states that a transgender patient could not be refused a room or be forcibly transferred if another patient objected to a trans roommate.
Recommended by the state’s long-term care ombudsman, the bill affirms and requires public notice in nursing homes that state and federal law prohibits discrimination on any number of counts, among them sexual orientation, HIV status and “gender identity and expression.”
The bill requires facilities, at least every two years, to provide direct-care workers with cultural competency training focused on residents who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or gender-nonconforming, or are living with HIV. The training materials must be developed by the commissioner of public health by January.

Energy bill gets one step closer
The Appropriations Committee gave its approval Friday to Democrats’ signature bill addressing Connecticut’s energy affordability crisis, even as lawmakers were continuing to hammer out the details of the measure.
Earlier in the week, negotiators revealed their latest draft of the legislation, Senate Bill 4, which they said could lower electricity prices by around 5% by borrowing money to pay for portions of the public benefits charge. The latest draft was quickly advanced by the Appropriations Committee on a party-line vote Friday. Republicans objected to the fact that the bill and its costs had not yet been worked into the state’s budget.
Members of that committee, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office and stakeholders were continuing to hold meetings on Friday to discuss further revisions to the bill. An initial vote in the Senate is expected some time next week.

Federal public health changes
The Senate passed an omnibus bill that proponents say is meant to guard the state against potential changes to public health policy by the federal government.
The megabill contains provisions to guarantee in state law the current federal standard for the level of fluoride in drinking water and access to emergency reproductive services, including miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy treatment. It also creates a “safe harbor” account, to be managed by the state Treasurer and funded exclusively through private donations, to cover out-of-pocket costs for people who come to Connecticut from other states seeking reproductive or gender-affirming care. Additionally, it would create accounts for the Department of Public Health to use in the case of federal public health funding shortfalls, but does not include a funding source for those accounts. Some Republicans criticized the bill as jumping ahead and legislating in advance of situations that may never happen.
Outside of the measures that directly respond to potential federal changes, the legislation also seeks to establish overdose prevention centers that include safe injection sites and creates a program to promote pancreatic cancer screenings. The legislation now moves to the House for final passage.

“It's universal in the committee that we support the town's position on their ability to maintain — or not maintain — these trails,” said Rep. Matt Walker, the House Transportation chair.

Matt Walker, R-Swanton, chair of the House Transportation Committee, listens as the committee takes testimony at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Feb. 12. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerA proposal that’s ping-ponged between two different transportation-related bills in recent weeks could impact a judge’s ruling in a yearslong, costly court battle over public access to a trail in Tunbridge. But only if the bill that includes that measure, the miscellaneous motor vehicle bill, crosses the finish line before the end of the session.The DMV bill, S.123, as voted out of the House Transportation Committee, seeks to clarify that municipalities have the authority to maintain so-called “legal trails,” though are not required to do so. “Legal trails” are former public roads that remain open for recreational uses. There are more than 500 miles of these trails, largely in small segments, across the state.Depending on who you ask, state law already grants municipalities that authority. But differing views on that have been at the center of a more than four year dispute between the Town of Tunbridge and a local landowner who’s sought to limit cyclists’ use of a legal trail that runs across his property. Town officials have said it’s up to them what uses are allowed on the trail.A judge has yet to resolve the case. But the language recently added to this year’s DMV bill could lead the court to decide the Legislature has, effectively, resolved the question on its own — though that’s far from a guarantee, according to an attorney who advises the House and Senate transportation committees. As now up for consideration by the full House, S.123 states “it is the intent of the General Assembly to clarify municipalities’ authority to exclusively or cooperatively maintain legal trails.” “There is the potential that the current case gets dismissed,” said Damien Leonard, an attorney with the Office of Legislative Counsel, during a committee hearing earlier this month.The language in S.123 has, much like a hike, taken a circuitous route with several starts and stops. Similar language started the session in a separate bill, S.4, that did not make it off the wall in Senate Transportation before the “crossover” deadline for approval in mid-March.The following month, Senate Transportation added language on local trail jurisdiction into this year’s transportation funding bill, H.488, after that bill had already cleared the House. But legislative leaders later nixed the measure from the bill during a conference committee.At that point, the motor vehicle bill — which had already passed the Senate — was in House Transportation. The committee held onto the bill to take testimony about the legal trails issue, ultimately deciding to add in similar language to what was, for a time, in the T-bill. House leadership expects to take up the DMV bill next Tuesday, according to Conor Kennedy, chief of staff to Speaker Jill Krowinski, D-Burlington. It’s possible the bill would need to go to a conference committee after that.“It’s universal in the committee that we support the town’s position on their ability to maintain — or not maintain — these trails,” said Swanton Republican Rep. Matt Walker, the House Transportation chair, in an interview this week.A number of outdoor recreation advocacy groups, as well as the Vermont League of Cities and Towns, have also backed clarifying the law.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveThe Vermont Senate voted on Friday evening to approve its version of this year’s landmark education reform bill, H.454.

If passed, the law would take effect in 2027. “It’s time to end the era where children’s wellbeing is collateral damage in the pursuit of profit,” Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, said ahead of Friday’s vote. The bill still requires final House approval, a vote that is expected next week. The legislation then heads back to the Senate, which needs to sign off on amendments to the bill, before heading to Gov.

The bans would need to go into effect in time for the 2026-2027 school year. The legislation also allows students to enroll in career technical education (CTE) facilities outside of their districts, as well as a requirement that school districts develop response plans in cases of student cardiac arrest.The bill still requires final Senate approval, which will likely come next week, before heading back to the House for a final sign off. — Habib SabetVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Vermont lawmakers consider a proposal that could impact long-running Tunbridge trail dispute.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/house-transportation-4-20250212-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

That makes the path to a final product uncertain as the Legislature inches closer to adjourning.The debate in the Democrat-controlled House centered on what guardrails lawmakers ought to place on the Community and Housing Infrastructure Program, a new initiative aimed at allowing municipalities and developers to use the increased tax revenue from new housing projects to pay back debt for infrastructure like water lines, sewers and sidewalks.After advancing the bill out of committee last week, House lawmakers faced blowback from Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s administration, senators and housing advocates, who said House members had made access to the program too restrictive, particularly for smaller towns. In response to that criticism, key committee leaders put forward an amendment to ease some of those rules, like taking away geographic criteria for where projects could go and adding a pathway to exceed an annual cap on tax increment a state board can approve each year, at the discretion of the governor.But many House members felt those concessions did not go far enough. Members of the tripartisan rural caucus brought forward an additional amendment on the House floor on Friday which would, among other measures, strike a controversial “but for” test included in the legislation.READ MORE
The test, a common feature for tax increment financing programs elsewhere in the country, essentially requires that a development can only be approved for the program if it wouldn’t happen “but for” the public financing boost.Proponents of the test said it would play a critical role in protecting the state’s overstretched Education Fund.“If the development would have occurred anyway, or would have occurred somewhere else, then the retention of the statewide education property tax to pay for it is effectively foregone revenue from the Education Fund, which could actually end up increasing property taxes for all Vermonters,” said Rep. Charlie Kimbell, D-Woodstock, on the House floor.But opponents argued that the test amounts to an added barrier to housing development amid Vermont’s acute shortage of homes. The state needs upwards of 24,000 additional year-round homes by 2029 to achieve a healthy housing market, according to a report released last year. “The ‘but-for’ test is bureaucratic red tape,” said Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford. “The need for housing is self-evident.” The amendment to scrap the test failed, even after gaining the support of some rural Democrats, in addition to Republicans – 53 members voted for it, and 86 voted against. Some members who voted for the shot-down amendment ultimately voted in favor of the overall bill, expressing a desire to see it tweaked yet again in a committee of conference between the House and Senate.But it’s still unclear which housing bill will make it to that near-final step. As senators watched the House delay a vote over S.127 on Thursday, its members took the dramatic step of suspending all rules to get their version of a housing package, H.479, to the finish line – a move that required cross-party support. That bill contains a version of CHIP with fewer rules attached.Staff for legislative leadership indicated late Friday that they did not yet know which bill would be the ultimate vehicle. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Divided lawmakers keep housing bill hobbling toward finish line .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Charles-Kimball-2025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved Gov. Kim Reynolds’ waiver to exclude foods like candy and soft drinks from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program in Iowa. 
Anti-hunger advocates were against the waiver and argue it would not help low-income Iowans gain better access to nutritious foods. 
Reynolds, who appeared on “Iowa Press” Friday, said the demonstration waiver is a “really good first step” to return SNAP to its original intent of providing nutritious food to low-income families. 
“We are an unhealthy population,” Reynolds said. “We think this really lines up with the intent of what SNAP was designed for in the beginning, and they can use those dollars to purchase healthy foods and help supplement their family income.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The waiver, which Reynolds submitted in March, excludes any food item eligible for sales tax, as determined by the Iowa Department of Revenue. This includes soft drinks, candy, and sweetened snacks, including granola bars and fruit leathers. 
The waiver would take effect Jan. 1, 2026, and last for two years. The federal Food and Nutrition Service will work with the state to implement the new definition of eligible food items and then evaluate the demonstration project and its impact on SNAP participants. 
Nicole McAlexander, vice chair of Iowa Hunger Coalition and executive director of Southeast Linn Community Center, said the waiver will increase stigma and “perpetuate misconceptions” around SNAP participants.
“Instead of investing in evidence-based solutions to improve healthy eating, the state of Iowa is choosing to experiment on low-income Iowans’ grocery carts,” McAlexander said.
Members of the coalition advocated for increased funding to the Double Up Food Bucks program, which allows SNAP recipients to double their spending on produce, but proposed bills did not advance in Iowa’s legislative session.
Luke Elzinga, board chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, said the waiver will “do nothing” to lower the cost of nutritious food for Iowans. Elzinga also questioned how the action fit with Reynolds’ approved waiver for Iowa’s summer feeding program, Healthy Kids Iowa.
“If Gov. Reynolds’ opposition to participating in Summer EBT was the lack of nutritional focus,” Elzinga said. “Why didn’t she elect to submit a similar restriction waiver for Summer EBT and participate in the program?”
Iowa Hunger Coalition said Reynolds’ summer program will assist just 65,000 kids, as opposed to the federal program which would have supported nearly 245,000 Iowa school-aged students in low-income families. 
Reynolds, when asked about the figure on “Iowa Press,” said her program allots $40 per eligible student, but families will be able to get more food with their dollars since the program distributes through food banks, versus individual electronic benefit transfer cards. 
“And, again, it restricts it to nutritious food,” Reynolds said. “We’re driving healthy outcomes, healthy behaviors in the state so that we can help families provide the kids nutritious food during the summer.” 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins signed similar SNAP-related waivers in Nebraska and Indiana this week. She congratulated the states for stepping up and taking action following her requests to “innovate” at the state level. 
“President Trump has given our nation a once in a generation opportunity to change the health trajectory for our entire country,” Rollins said. “I look forward to signing even more waivers in the days ahead as we continue to restore the health of America.” 
The waivers follow guidance from the Trump administration to reduce disease trends, including prediabetes trends in children, which were highlighted in the recent Make America Healthy Again report.

(File/Getty Images)South Carolina’s state-owned utility company and the electric cooperatives it serves are feuding over the power bill for a long-time Google data center in the Lowcountry.
At stake in the business dispute is between $16 million and $24 million annually, according to lawyers for the two utility groups.
The cooperatives say that’s a savings that could be divided out among all of their roughly 2 million customers statewide to reduce their power bills. Santee Cooper argues it’s a cost that could increase the power bill of their 200,000 direct customers, located in Berkeley, Georgetown and Horry counties.
The question is over which group of customers pays, who saves and how the state-owned utility’s financials are impacted.
“This $16 million or $44 million over a couple of years is a big issue because it matters to the people at the end of the line,” said Central Electric Power Cooperative CEO Rob Hochstetler, whose organization negotiates rates and supplies power on behalf of cooperatives statewide.
The disagreement, discussed at a joint meeting held Friday in West Columbia, came about as cooperatives had sought to use a provision in the long-term contract it holds with Santee Cooper that gives the cooperatives the option to buy power for a lower rate for large industrial users — in this case a Google data center in Berkeley County that has been in operation since 2007.
Google announces $3.3B investment in SC data centers, 200 new jobs

But Santee Cooper says the size of that data center — which uses upwards of 380 megawatts of power — is too large and the rate reduction will cost the power company too much money, creating a “grossly unfair and unjust burden” to Santee Cooper and its customers. By comparison, all of Santee Cooper’s current industrial customers use about 379 megawatts in total, attorney Carmen Thomas said.
Instead, Santee Cooper wants the cooperatives to renegotiate new terms rather than using those included in the existing contract.
“What that really amounts to is saying, ‘You guys need to take something less than your contract entitles you to,’ ” said Alex Hall, the attorney for the cooperatives. “Not liking the implications of a counterparty exercising his contractual rights is not a valid reason for refusal. That’s not how contracts work.”
While the data center may use a lot of power, it had already paid the cost of the power lines it required. Plus, the $16 million to $24 million in question only amounts to about 1% of Santee Cooper’s $1.9 billion in total operating revenue.
Besides, Santee Cooper and cooperatives already reached an agreement on the matter back in January. Santee Cooper had already signed, Hall said.
The cooperatives held off on signing as the two groups continued to negotiate other matters related to charges racked up during a court-mandated Santee Cooper rate freeze that recently expired. But had they not waited, Berl Davis Jr. of Palmetto Electric Cooperative said, the issue would not have been up for argument now.
Thomas said Santee Cooper considered those previous documents to be draft agreements, not final.
She also argued the cooperatives’ right to a reduced rate “is not unilateral,” saying the provisions for this particular type of rate allow Santee Cooper to negotiate when it comes to “large and unusual loads.”
“That right does not exist in a vacuum,” she said.
Hochstetler and Santee Cooper President Jimmy Stanton closed the meeting with mutual vows to resolve the contract dispute in the coming months.
SC’s state-owned utility enacts higher rates for data centers, large users

While the Berkeley County data center has been around for nearly two decades, such centers have dominated the conversation around energy needs in South Carolina as the state has grappled with how to meet the power demand of a growing population and manufacturing based, in addition to the new centers being built by tech giants such as Google, Meta and Blox.
Santee Cooper’s governing board, last month, even enacted a new rate meant to ensure energy-intensive data centers, built to serve the country’s ever-growing technology needs, are covering the cost of generating the massive amount of power they require.
The “experimental” rate will be in place for the next four years, testing it out before considering whether to make the policy permanent.
But that rate for new customers doesn’t apply to the 18-year-old Google data center.
Under Santee Cooper’s new rate, large users will be charged at a rate similar to Santee Cooper’s existing industrial users. The difference is those customers must sign a 15-year contract, one they can’t get out of without paying a set minimum. The utility also will charge more for power used at times of day when demand for energy is at its highest.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/electric-meter-1024x752.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Members of Iowa’s U.S. House delegation, who voted this week in favor of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” have been defending and promoting their decision amid criticism over cuts to health care and food assistance for low-income Americans.
Trump’s bill promises multitrillion-dollar tax cuts while simultaneously rolling back programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The Congressional Budget Office also estimates this bill could add an additional $3.8 trillion to the national debt. 
Democrats and advocates held a news conference Thursday urging Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst to vote against the bill.
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks has received criticism for her vote. Derek Eadon, former Iowa Democratic Party Chair, said in a press release it threatens clean energy jobs in Iowa’s 1st District by repealing the clean energy credits of 2022, despite past commitment to protect these tax credits. Miller-Meeks is currently a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee which helped to identify budget cuts in the programs it oversees, including Medicare and Medicaid.

Miller-Meeks posted in a statement: “This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable—not for those who can work and choose not to.” Miller-Meeks said. “Today’s vote is a win for Iowa and for every American who believes in work, responsibility, and a government that serves its people, not the other way around.”
Rep. Ashley Hinson also voted for the bill, saying on X: “Iowans overwhelmingly voted for President Trump’s America First agenda — ending illegal immigration and preventing dangerous criminals and drugs from entering our communities, cutting wasteful spending, and unleashing American energy.”
Reps. Zach Nunn and Randy Feenstra, members of the Agriculture committee, played a role in identifying $230 billion in cuts, which included major cuts to the food program SNAP. 
“The bill also safeguards key benefit programs for vulnerable Iowans while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,” Nunn said in a statement. “It bolsters border security, restores accountability, and invests in American energy dominance—where Iowa is already leading the charge.”
Feenstra stated: “Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, our families will see big tax cuts, Iowa workers will have higher wages, our farmers will see relief from the death tax, and our small businesses and local manufacturers will grow and thrive.”
Grassley, Klobuchar introduce bipartisan resolution for return of Ukrainian children
Grassley and Democrat Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota introduced a bipartisan resolution calling for the return of all abducted Ukrainian children before Russia-Ukraine peace agreements are finalized. Ernst was also a co-sponsor of this bill.
“[Putin] has kidnapped thousands of children to brainwash and Russify them in an attempt to destroy their cultural identity and heritage,” Grassley said, “The United States ought to demand these children are returned before inking a deal to end the war in Ukraine.”
Trump said he believed his phone call Monday with Russian President Vladimir Putin went “very well.” Following the call, he dropped his demands for an immediate ceasefire. The Kremlin has yet to provide a timeframe for ceasefire negotiations. 
This resolution, while non-binding, condemns Russia’s “abduction and forcible transfer of Ukrainian children,” a prominent war crime allegation against Russia. Its introduction follows a letter sent in April by 40 prominent religious leaders to Trump and Secretary of state Marco Rubio calling for Russia to return an estimated 20,000 children forcibly transferred to Russian territory.
Grassley and Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, also introduced the bipartisan Protecting Older Workers from Age Discrimination Act, which seeks to “level the playing field for Older Workers,” according to a news release. This bill would recognize the legitimacy of “mixed-motive” claims and reaffirm the workers’ ability to use any type of admissible evidence to prove their claims. 
Miller-Meeks’ veteran suicide prevention bill passes through House
The No Wrong Door for Veterans Act, introduced by Miller-Meeks, passed through the House this week. This bill seeks to strengthen the Staff Sergeant Parker Gordon Fox Suicide Prevention grant program by requiring local Veterans Affairs coordination and clearer eligibility standards, expanding access to emergency care, and holding grantees accountable. 
“The No Wrong Door for Veterans Act ensures that our heroes are never turned away or left without help. It streamlines access, strengthens coordination, and reaffirms our promise to those who served. I’m proud to lead this bipartisan effort—and to say to every veteran: we see you, we hear you, and we will fight for you,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement.
Additionally, this bill included the Supporting Prosthetics and Recreational Therapy act. The SPORT act ensures that artificial limbs must be furnished to eligible veterans as medical services, which include prostheses and terminal devices for sports and recreational activities.
Hinson named co-chair of biofuels caucus
Hinson was announced Thursday as a co-chair for the Congressional Biofuels Caucus, alongside five other representatives. Hinson said she plans to use the position as a means of expanding access to Iowa biofuels, increasing blending targets and securing permission to allow the sale of E15 year-round.
Currently, E15, a fuel blend consisting of 15% ethanol and 85% gasoline, for the most part is not sold during summer months because it has a higher fuel volatility than allowed under the Clean Air Act. 
Hinson said in a news release she wishes to increase domestic energy production stating “biofuels are key to Iowa’s economy and key to American energy dominance.”
Nunn, Himes introduce FORCE act to “modernize” Defense Production Act
Nunn and Democrat Jim Himes of Connecticut’s 4th District introduced the Federal Overhaul of Reserve Command Executive Modernization Act. The Defense Production Act, enacted in 1950, grants the president power to expand and expedite the supply of materials and services from the domestic industrial base. 
The FORCE act seeks to reintroduce the National Defense Executive Reserve, which would bring private-sector industry leaders and trained civilian experts into a corps for guidance during national emergencies. This bill would also allow federal agencies to partner with private industry more efficiently. The National Defense Executive Reserve was first established in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower through an executive order. 
“In today’s threat environment, America can’t afford a playbook from the 1950’s,” Nunn said. “Let’s leverage America’s best and brightest in the private and public sectors.”

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Following a series of cuts pushed by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk, the U.S. Forest Service announced Friday that it is cutting back hours at several Sawtooth National Forest field offices.
As part of the announcement, U.S. Forest Service officials said they are temporarily closing the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, or SNRA, offices in Ketchum and Stanley – effective immediately – until June 16.
“The SNRA is one of the crown jewels of the national forest system and one of the crown jewels of Idaho,” Josh Johnson, central Idaho director for the Idaho Conservation League, said in a phone interview Friday. “To not have Forest Service staff available to support visitors, help them find out where they need to go, answer questions and respond to other issues is a problem and unfortunate.”

“You can’t expect to eliminate as much forest service staff as you have and still provide essential services people are used to seeing in places like the SNRA,” Johnson added.
Forest Service officials made the announcement in a press release Friday afternoon, just hours before the beginning of the Memorial Day weekend that signals the unofficial beginning of the summer camping and recreation season in Idaho.
“The announcement comes as forest leadership works to provide the best service possible with the staffing and resources we have,” U.S. Forest Service officials said in Friday’s news release.
  How DOGE is affecting the outdoors in Idaho 

Since he took office in January, Trump and his ally Musk have pushed for deep budget cuts and firing thousands of federal workers through the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
U.S. Forest Service workers have been among those fired, and in February, former U.S. Forest Service Chief Randy Moore resigned amid the cuts, WyoFile reported.

Scaling back Sawtooth National Forest Service office hours could have widespread effects in Idaho – a state where more than 60% of the land is public land and recreation use and activities is at historic high levels.
“The bottom line is that the current administration’s efforts to save money and increase efficiencies has led to serious inefficiencies on the ground,” John Robison, public lands and wildlife director for the Idaho Conservation League, said Friday. “The administration’s understaffing the SNRA to the point they will only be open three days a week is a significant disservice for all of us who love the SNRA.”
In a Friday’s press release, Forest Service officials said visitors who need help when the offices are closed will have to call and leave a message. 
“Stakeholders requiring assistance from these offices outside of the listed hours should call and leave phone messages at the office from which they require services,” Forest Service officials said in Friday’s press release. “Forest staff in these offices will follow-up on all calls and messages at their earliest convenience.” 
Acting Sawtooth National Forest Supervisor Shawn Robnett said the staff members the agency does have are trying to find the best way to do their jobs.
“Adjusting our office hours as we enter our busiest season allows our rangers some flexibility with their available staff to continue to carry out all aspects of our mission – caring for the land while serving people,” Robnett said in a written statement. “Ensuring our employees are still out in the field accomplishing their work also affords our employees the opportunity to meet stakeholders where they are – out on the forest.” 
Efforts to reach a Sawtooth National Forest public affairs officer for follow up information were unsuccessful Friday.
The following field office hours are in place effective immediately. 

Fairfield Ranger District: Open 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mondays and Fridays.
Minidoka Ranger District: Open 8 a.m. to noon and 1 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. Mondays, Tuesday, and Thursdays.
Sawtooth National Recreation Area offices in Ketchum and Stanley: Temporarily closed until June 16. Both offices are scheduled to reopen three days a week from June 16 to Labor Day.

Once the office hours for reopening the Stanley and Ketchum field offices are available, they will be posted online, officials said.

(Photo via Getty Images)Every New Mexican deserves access to healthcare, dignity, and the peace of mind that comes from knowing their family will be cared for. But right now, that basic promise is under attack.

As a mom, an attorney, and a healthcare advocate, I work alongside families across New Mexico, in rural towns, Tribal communities, and urban neighborhoods, who rely on Medicaid as a lifeline. For far too many, it’s the only path to a doctor’s visit, a mental health appointment, or life-saving treatment.

Now, Congress is considering a budget that would gut Medicaid and slash funding for the programs our communities rely on every single day. The so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” – recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives – would create deep, drastic, devastating cuts to Medicaid, harming seniors, people with disabilities, and children. It even proposes new burdensome “work requirements,” an old, failed policy that would create needless bureaucracy and strip people of care, not because they don’t work, but because they can’t keep up with confusing paperwork.

Let’s be clear about what this means in New Mexico:

Nearly 850,000 people, including almost 70% of our children, rely on Medicaid.

It covers cancer screenings, prenatal visits, prescriptions, and behavioral health — care that keeps families whole.

In rural and Tribal communities, it’s the backbone of our healthcare system, funding clinics, keeping hospitals open, and making sure providers can serve everyone who walks through the door.

If this budget passes, all of that is at risk. We’ve already seen more than 100,000 New Mexicans pushed off Medicaid in the past year. Many are still eligible, but are lost in the red tape of the “unwinding.” These new proposals would make things even worse.

It would mean newborns missing out on critical early checkups, parents being forced to choose between groceries and insulin, and people suffering and dying from preventable conditions.

And for what? To give more tax breaks to the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.

Let’s talk about these “work requirements.” Most people who can work, already do, especially in low-wage, seasonal, or caregiving roles. And those who aren’t working often face real barriers: disability, caregiving, lack of transportation, unstable housing. Studies show that about half of people subjected to these requirements lose coverage, not because they’re unwilling to work, but due to the paperwork burdens and red tape.

This isn’t about encouraging work. It’s about terminating people’s healthcare.

Together, we must reject this reckless and harmful legislation that would strip healthcare from millions of Americans, and our stories are the most powerful defense. We must speak up loudly and boldly to send a strong message: No one can afford to lose their healthcare coverage.

Have you or your family benefited from Medicaid? Now is the time to tell your story to protect it. Telling your story can stop harmful cuts before they become law, show what’s really at stake, and protect care for millions of families like yours.

Let’s protect Medicaid and protect each other. Let’s not just defend what we have, but demand more: a healthcare system that truly works for all of us.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

Vander […]","A nurse readies an MMR vaccine at Sanford Children's Hospital in Sioux Falls. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Grant Vander Vorst is at the epicenter of vaccine hesitancy in South Dakota: Just 56% of incoming kindergartners in Faulk County, where he lives, were up to date on their measles, mumps and rubella vaccination during the 2023-24 school year, which was the lowest rate of any county in the state with available data.
Vander Vorst is the superintendent of Faulkton Area Schools. He said some parents are skeptical about the safety of administering multiple childhood vaccinations in a short window of time, “and justifiably so.” 
“I question it myself, and a lot of others do as well,” he said.
Vander Vorst said his views are influenced by U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine skeptic whose statements about vaccines have been called false and misleading by medical professionals.
“I haven’t looked into the research, but he obviously has,” Vander Vorst said.
Faulk County is not alone. Across South Dakota, vaccine hesitancy that took hold during the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded beyond skepticism of new vaccines to doubts about long-established ones, said Erin Tobin, a nurse practitioner and Republican former state senator from Winner.
Tobin said a growing number of parents are trusting web posts and social media influencers over local health care professionals. 
“It used to be that I could start a discussion with a patient with the words ‘the CDC recommends,’” Tobin said, referencing the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “and now I’m cautious to use that because people don’t trust the CDC.”

During the 2018-19 school year, before the COVID-19 pandemic, 96% of kindergarteners in South Dakota received all their required vaccinations. That number fell to 91% during the 2023-24 school year, the most recent year of available statewide data. 
Public health advocates are sounding the alarm about declining vaccination rates as the United States experiences its most severe measles outbreak since 2000, with over 1,000 confirmed cases across 31 states, including 12 confirmed cases in North Dakota. South Dakota has not had a confirmed case of measles so far this year, but last July, it reported its first measles case in nine years.
According to the CDC, a measles vaccination rate of 95% is needed to achieve herd immunity and prevent outbreaks, given the highly contagious nature of the virus. 
Ten years ago, only six South Dakota counties had MMR rates below 95%, with the lowest being 80%. Now, more than 40 counties in the state are below 95%, with 12 below 80% and five below 70%. The rates could be even lower than the numbers indicate, because kindergarten-age students being homeschooled or attending other forms of alternative instruction are not required to report their vaccination status. There were 431 alternative-instruction kindergarten students statewide last fall.
The MMR vaccine is a key indicator for public health, said Dr. Amy Winter, an epidemiologist at the University of Georgia College of Public Health. When MMR vaccination rates fall, it signals broader vulnerabilities.
“Where there is measles, there could be other outbreaks, other infectious diseases, depending on the dearth of vaccination that may be happening,” Winter said.
Mark Sternhagen, a retiree who formerly taught at South Dakota State University, knows those risks well. He was born soon after the polio vaccine came out in 1955. He contracted polio before his parents were able to get him vaccinated, and has used a wheelchair ever since.
“There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that if I got the vaccine, I would not have gotten polio,” he said. “I look at these declining rates and it just makes me sick.” 
Sternhagen said his mother carried guilt, but he doesn’t blame her. He said vaccinations in South Dakota were less accessible, and parents were less informed, but modern parents who do have access to vaccines and valid information don’t have those excuses.
“You’re putting your children and others’ children at risk, and there is no question about that,” he said.
Requirements and religion
The first laws requiring immunization appeared in the 1800s, coinciding with the development and spread of a smallpox vaccine. In 1922, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a local government’s vaccination mandate as a prerequisite to attending public school, leading states to implement similar requirements. 
States began allowing religious exemptions in the mid-20th century following advocacy from religious minorities, like the Christian Scientists. Adherents generally rely on prayer over medical care, and often decline to vaccinate children, according to the Harvard Divinity School.  
South Dakota’s immunization law requires children entering school or early childhood programs to be immunized against poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, rubeola, rubella, mumps, tetanus, meningitis and varicella.
There are two exemptions in South Dakota’s law. One is a medical exemption for children with certification from a licensed physician that immunization would threaten their life or health. Those exemptions have remained steady over the past decade at 0.2% of kindergartners or less.
There’s also a religious exemption, requiring a written statement from a parent or guardian that the child is an adherent of a religious doctrine whose teachings are opposed to immunization.
Religious exemptions are growing in South Dakota, where 5.4% of kindergarteners had them last school year, compared to 1.5% a decade ago. In raw numbers, that’s a change from 181 kindergarteners to 636.
Tobin, the nurse practitioner and former legislator, said the claiming of a religious exemption is probably not religiously motivated in many cases.
“I do think they’re using that as this all-encompassing exemption, and so it’s probably something they just don’t believe in, but not necessarily something that is against the religion,” she said.


One factor contributing to South Dakota’s declining vaccination trend is falling rates among Hutterite people, members of a communal branch of the Anabaptist faith who have dozens of agricultural-based colonies in the state.
During the 2019-20 school year, six of the approximately 50 Hutterite colony elementary schools in the state reported vaccination rates of 0%. Thirty-two of them did so during the 2023-24 school year. 
There are questions about the validity of the data. A state Department of Health dashboard shows some Hutterite colony schools with 0% of their kindergarten students vaccinated, but also shows some of those same schools with less than 100% of the students claiming a religious or medical exemption. South Dakota Searchlight asked the Department of Health and the Department of Education to explain the discrepancy but did not receive a full explanation from either department.
Searchlight followed-up by asking the departments what the state is doing to address the discrepancies.
“If any students are identified as neither vaccinated nor exempted (medical or religious), the accreditation team identifies that as a ‘finding, which requires the school district to resolve the deficit,” Department of Education spokeswoman Nancy Van Der Weide said in written statement. “If the school takes action to correct the situation within the allotted timeframe, the district receives accreditation. If they fail to do so, the school may be placed on probation or ultimately suspended.”






As of Friday, Van Der Weide had not identified which schools, if any, are currently on probation or facing suspension over vaccination exemption issues.






Upland Colony Elementary near Letcher, within the Sanborn Central School District, is one such school where the data does not add up. Laura Licht is an administrative assistant with the district. She said students at the colony have filed exemptions, and the data may not be getting pulled properly by the state.
Vander Vorst said his school district of 36 kindergarteners includes three Hutterite colony schools in its borders, and he said that likely contributes to the county’s low vaccination rate. The numbers show that Faulkton Area School’s kindergarten vaccination rate for required immunizations was 77% last year, while the rates for the three colony schools in the district ranged from zero to 50%.
Josh Oltmanns, CEO and elementary principal of Hanson School District, echoed that. The vaccination rate among kindergarteners at Hanson Elementary last year was 94%. The rates at the district’s colony schools were as low as 50%.
“I’d bet, if you look, a lot of these lower school districts have colonies,” Oltmanns said. “And that’s within those peoples’ rights.” 
It’s unclear why Hutterite people would be less supportive of vaccinations now than previously.
South Dakota Searchlight made multiple calls to Hutterite colonies and to educators who serve Hutterite students, but most were unwilling to speak about the potential reasons for vaccine hesitancy. An academic who studies the Hutterite faith said he doesn’t know why vaccination rates at colonies would be falling.
At one colony, a member who declined to provide her name said hesitancy is driven by the number of vaccines now being given to children.
“They’ve added so many more,” she said. “It’s a risk we don’t want to take.” 
Answering concerns
Medical professionals say those fears are unfounded.
The CDC says vaccines contain weakened or killed versions of germs that cause a disease. These elements of vaccines, and other molecules and micro-organisms that stimulate the immune system, are called “antigens.”
Dr. Allie Alvine, founder of South Dakota Families for Vaccines, said children encounter more antigen exposure during “one play session in a sandbox” than during an entire vaccine schedule.
“And the ones we expose a child to via vaccination are proven to be good for them,” Alvine said. “What we expose them to is targeted and saves lives.” 
Dr. Ashley Sands, a specialist in pediatric infectious diseases with Sanford Health, said parents are more frequently asking questions about the efficacy of vaccinations. She finds herself debunking some of Kennedy’s claims, like rumored links between vaccines and autism. 
The claim that the MMR vaccine causes autism originated from a 1998 study by Andrew Wakefield, which was discredited due to serious methodological flaws, undisclosed conflicts of interest, and ethical violations. Multiple large-scale studies since then have found no credible evidence supporting the claim. Wakefield lost his medical license, and his paper was retracted.
“The medical community can read the research it conducts,” Sands said. “Is it not far more likely Kennedy, who has never done medical research nor formally studied medicine, is misinterpreting or misrepresenting the data?” 
Sands emphasized that vaccination recommendations are built on decades of peer-reviewed and replicated research.
“A good doctor is keeping up with the medical journals pertinent to their field and adjusting patient recommendations as our shared science evolves,” Sands said. “Meanwhile, Kennedy is using his position to push conspiracies.”
Sands also hears parents romanticize “natural immunity” over vaccination. She warns that natural infection with diseases like measles can be deadly. Plus, infants and immunocompromised people rely on those around them to be immune, blocking the disease’s spread. If enough people are vaccinated, the disease can’t reach those most at risk.
“A child with cancer should have the freedom to go to school without being exposed to illnesses that are easily preventable,” Sands said.
Vaccinations and Pierre politics
Alvine said vaccine misinformation has taken hold in South Dakota politics. She cited recent failed legislation targeting vaccines, including bills promoting “conscience exemptions” to vaccination mandates and separating blood donations based on COVID-19 vaccination status — all based on misinformation, Alvine said.
“They prey on parents’ fears,” Alvine said. “Once you instill fear, it’s hard to fix that.”
Republican House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach of Spearfish voted for the conscience exemptions bill. He said “the ‘trust the science’ phase of COVID” is why people are more vaccine hesitant.

“I think wisdom is needed to make the distinction between true public health emergencies and those situations, more often, where personal bodily autonomy has to remain inviolate,” Odenbach said.
Alvine said she’s trying to educate people to accept vaccines, not force them against their will.
“Anytime we can save a child’s life, to grow up and live, it’s worth it,” she said. “It’s not, ‘Most kids will get through it and be fine.’ They will be miserable. A portion will get lifelong, deadly diseases stemming from measles, and some will even die.”
Nearly every child in the U.S. caught measles before the vaccine became available in 1963. In 2000, health officials declared measles eliminated in the U.S. thanks to nearly universal vaccination.
The South Dakota Department of Health declined an interview for this story but provided a statement noting the downward trend in childhood vaccinations is concerning. The department highlighted ongoing marketing efforts, refreshed ad campaigns, and 1,700 more total immunizations – combined among children and adults – administered in 2024 than 2023.
“We can have a positive impact on all health outcomes, including childhood vaccination rates, by addressing access to care, social drivers of health care outcomes, and public awareness campaigns,” the department said.

Photo via InstagramBURLINGTON — Legal troubles for a former California biomedical researcher and entrepreneur didn’t end when he was convicted by a jury last month of ordering the death of a former business partner.During a hearing on Friday, federal Judge Geoffrey Crawford lifted a stay in a civil wrongful death lawsuit also brought against Serhat Gumrukcu for his role in the 2018 death of Gregory Davis of Danville.That civil case had been paused pending the outcome of the criminal proceeding against Gumrukcu.In April, a jury in the criminal case convicted Gumrukcu of murder for hire and conspiracy to commit fraud. Prosecutors claimed that a failed business deal between Gumrukcu and Davis motivated Gumrukcu to hire someone to the Vermont man. According to prosecutors, Gumrukcu ordered and financed Davis’ fatal hit because he was concerned the Vermont man was going to go to authorities and accuse him of fraud. That would, prosecutors argued during the trial, put in jeopardy an even larger business deal Gumrukcu had been involved in at that time with Enochian Biosciences, in which he stood to gain millions. READ MORE
Melissa Davis, Gregory Davis’ widow, brought the civil suit against Gumrukcu in June 2022 shortly after he was arrested.Paul Perkins, an attorney for Melissa Davis and the estate of her late husband, told Crawford during a hearing Friday that he intended to file a motion seeking summary judgment on the wrongful death claim because Gumrukcu had already been found responsible in criminal court for Davis’ death.A jury would then determine whether Gumrukcu would pay damages, Perkins said.Shortly after the civil lawsuit was filed, Crawford granted Melissa Davis an order seizing roughly 12.5 million shares of stock Gumrukcu had in Enochian Biosciences — a California biotechnology company in which he had an ownership stake. At the time that order was granted, each share was valued around $2, meaning there was around $25 million worth of shares. However, during Friday’s hearing, Perkins told the judge that the share prices have since plunged to a total value of around $4 million, or a little more than 30 cents per share.Crawford questioned whether there would even be someone interested in purchasing those shares.“That’s a substantial concern,” Perkins said, adding he didn’t think there would be much of a market for them.During the hearing, Perkins said he may also seek Gumrukcu’s other assets, including shares in various business entities as well as a multimillion dollar California home he had been living in at the time of his arrest with his husband.Crawford asked Perkins to draft a settlement offer for Gumrukcu to potentially head off further litigation.  Meanwhile, Lisa Shelkrot, an attorney who had been representing Gumrukcu in the civil case, filed a motion to withdraw herself from it.

(provided by USC)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s traditional K-12 public schools will receive a bigger share of new money in the coming school year under a compromise approved this week.
An adjustment in calculations ultimately shifted nearly $10 million of a $112 million sum from charter schools to traditional public schools, according to data provided by the state Department of Education. That’s part of roughly $4.5 billion total the budget sends to K-12 public schools.
Also included in the $14.7 billion spending plan advanced Wednesday is more than $500 million to fund projects at the state’s public colleges, plus a continued guarantee that tuition rates will remain frozen for in-state students.
Parts of the budget were locked in when legislators started negotiations. That includes a $1,500 increase in teachers’ minimum pay, which will bring the floor for first-year teachers to $48,500. With an unexpected $1 billion increase in revenue coming as legislators started publicly negotiating, much of the disagreement between the chambers’ proposed budgets then came down to directives on how to spend the money.
Legislators are scheduled to return for a final vote approving the budget Wednesday.
Virtual charter school funding
Both chambers’ plans put an additional $112 million into “state aid to classrooms,” which is primarily meant for teacher raises. So, that statewide total was set ahead of negotiations. Where the plans differed was in the funding formula for virtual charter schools. The House plan lowered the normal weighting for students in online classrooms.
Traditional public schools, brick-and-mortar charter schools and virtual charter schools are all funded differently, with calculations involving student populations.
Unlike traditional public schools, charter schools organized under a statewide school district don’t receive local property taxes. So, state funding formulas provide them a higher proportion of state aid per student to help make up for that. Virtual charter schools receive a lesser share that other charter schools.
That is nothing new. But a combination of a growth in charter schools, population decreasing in some traditional schools, and a smaller hike in state aid being put through the complicated calculations meant traditional schools were slated to get less than they expected.
Last year, the Legislature provided an additional $200 million in “state aid to classrooms” to boost minimum salaries by $2,500. Charter schools received 24% of that money.
If the formulas had stayed the same, charter schools would’ve received more than 45% of the additional $112 million in the coming school year, according to numbers provided by the House Ways and Means Committee. Yet, the schools governed autonomously — while growing in population — are still expected to enroll just 7.5% of South Carolina’s K-12 public school students.
Advocates for the state’s 72 traditional school districts worried the lopsided distribution could only get worse in the future.
“If it keeps going the way it’s going, it’s going to be very difficult to address this thing unless we do it now,” said Debbie Elmore, a lobbyist for the state School Boards Association.
SC legislators advance $14.7B spending plan that includes pay raise for themselves

The issue became contentious enough that legislators stepped into a back room to continue deliberating after reaching a consensus on the rest of the budget Wednesday. Ultimately, the chambers compromised on a funding weight that split the difference between their spending plans.
Split among 72 school districts, all of which receive a different amount of the funding under the calculations that also involve their tax base — what’s called the “index of taxpaying ability” — that $10 million won’t make a huge difference. But it will make a difference, Elmore said.
Charter schools said they needed the extra money to support a growing number of students enrolled in their programs.
“While this recent funding decision is disappointing, South Carolina’s Legislature has historically upheld the principle that families deserve the right to choose the educational option that best serves their children,” the Charter Institute at Erskine, the authorizer for 26 charter schools statewide, said in a statement. “That principle — and the rapidly growing demand for school choice — must continue to drive the educational funding decisions made in our state.”
House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister said it was a shame that instead of getting together to figure out the best way to distribute new money for students, groups on either side of the issue attacked each other using faulty numbers.
“I’m frustrated by the whole prospect that while we’re trying to take care of students there are groups out there that are misleading the people who care about their kids and funding in their schools,” the Greenville Republican said.
The change in funding weights is meant to be a one-year fix, Bannister said.
Also included in the budget is a directive for the state’s Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office to take a closer look at the funding formula and find a way to distribute state money that helps traditional and charter schools proportionally.
“Education funding conversations are complex and must support thoughtful decision-making with accurate information,” state Superintendent Ellen Weaver said in a statement. “I’m grateful for the General Assembly’s strong focus on K-12 education in this budget and appreciate them providing a pathway for the deliberative, fact-driven study of funding allocations that our students deserve.”
“We must never lose sight of our shared commitment: ensuring the opportunity of an exceptional education for every South Carolina child, wherever they learn,” Weaver continued.
Higher education
Also at question when legislators sat down to hash out differences in the chambers’ plans was whether to continue a requirement that all public colleges freeze tuition for in-state students for a seventh year.
College presidents said freezing tuition long-term wasn’t sustainable, so the House proposed allowing universities to raise costs for incoming freshmen, so long as their tuition remained the same for each class through graduation.
Gov. Henry McMaster’s office said the governor was opposed to any increase. Facing the potential of a veto, representatives agreed with the Senate’s plan to keep tuition rates as they are but allow colleges to raise other fees, including the price of athletics.
SC colleges have frozen tuition for several years. University presidents say that’s not sustainable.

Included in the budget deal was $65 million to offset costs for colleges to maintain tuition for South Carolina residents. That’s a fraction of the $130 million schools said they would need to fully cover the costs.
The state’s colleges are also set to collectively receive more than $500 million to renovate existing buildings, build new facilities and establish new programs.
The University of South Carolina had the biggest single project, with $150 million to build a specialized hospital for neurological diseases in Columbia. The hospital, which is expected to cost $350 million overall, will have 80 beds for critical care and 32 beds for rehabilitation, according to an agency budget request.
This was “truly a banner year” for funding at USC, university spokesman Jeff Stensland said.
Clemson University is slated to receive $40 million to build a NextGen Computing Complex, a facility to expand the university’s electrical and computing engineering programs. The Medical University of South Carolina is set to get $25 million for a new seven-story building in Charleston to house its College of Medicine.
“We thank Senate and House leadership and the entire General Assembly for their continued investment in Clemson and higher education in South Carolina,” Clemson spokesman Joe Galbraith said in a statement. “Their support helps our continued commitment to access and affordability to a world-class education for every South Carolina citizen.”
Other projects slated to receive more than $10 million include:

$16 million to Greenville Technical College to build a Center for Industrial Cyber Security and AI,
$16 million to Midlands Technical College for an advanced trades center,
$15 million to South Carolina State University to renovate a historic building to house its College of Agriculture, Family and Consumer Sciences,
$15 million to Central Carolina Technical College for a technical high school workforce center,

Three Jefferson County residents are suing the county attorney over an alleged warrantless search of their property.
The plaintiffs — Gail Osborn, Tim McConnell Seaba and Gordon Seaba – are suing Jefferson County Attorney Chauncey Moulding, Jefferson County, and Iowa Department of Health and Human Services employee Kelsey Koenig in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and punitive damages for alleged trespassing, invasion of privacy and civil rights violations related to unreasonable searches.
According to the lawsuit, the three plaintiffs live on the same parcel of land in Jefferson County, with Gordon Seaba living in the main house on the property while Timothy McConnell Seaba and Osborn live in a separate home at the back of the property.
They allege that on Nov. 15, 2024, DHHS received an anonymous complaint alleging that Osborn had given birth to a girl two months prior and was using methamphetamine while caring for the child.
“The information relayed by the anonymous complainant was entirely false,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Osborn was never pregnant in 2024, had not given birth to a child, and was not using methamphetamine while caring for a child.
Koenig, a DHHS child protective services worker, spoke with Osborn at her house regarding the complaint and allegedly observed that Osborn exhibited no physical indications of having been recently pregnant. Osborn allegedly allowed Koenig to inspect her home, which showed no evidence of a baby residing there. Osborn then accompanied Koenig to the main home, where Gordon Seaba allegedly agreed to an inspection that produced no evidence of a baby or any illegal substances.
Later that morning, Koenig allegedly spoke to a Washington County Sheriff’s Office investigator who indicated he knew Osborn and had not observed any signs of her being pregnant the previous summer. A friend of Osborn’s allegedly gave similar information to Koenig.
The lawsuit claims that later that day, Moulding and Koenig arrived at the plaintiffs’ property, accompanied by Assistant Jefferson County Attorney Elizabeth Estey, two Jefferson County deputies and two Washington County deputies. The officials had no warrant to search any part of the property and Timothy McConnell Seaba informed them that no one was allowed on his property without a warrant, the lawsuit alleges.
“Moulding ignored Timothy McConnell Seaba and continued up the driveway to the main house,” the lawsuit claims. “Moulding opened the door to the main house and entered Gordon Seaba’s home without asking for or receiving consent.”
The lawsuit claims Moulding and Koenig then proceeded to search Gordon Seaba’s home, after which the law enforcement officers also entered the property to search outbuildings and campers on the site. Moulding then searched Osborn’s home over her objections, the lawsuit claims.
“No evidence that a baby had ever existed was found on the property,” the lawsuit claims, adding that Koenig subsequently deemed the anonymous complaint to be “unfounded” due to the lack of evidence the reported child existed.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit. Moulding said Friday he had yet to see a copy of the plaintiff’s lawsuit.
“This was obviously a government operation that was pursuant to a valid purpose,” Moulding said. “But beyond that, without having reviewed the actual complaint, I think I should withhold comment.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gavel-scales-law-books-courtroom-_-getty-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 19:05:51.691872

Jenny Willford after a ride-sharing safety bill passed the Colorado Senate during the last day of the 2025 legislative session on May 7, 2025 at the Colorado Capitol. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill on Friday afternoon that would have required more safety features in ride-hailing services, writing that the legislation would risk the future of companies like Uber and Lyft in the state.
The bill would “would jeopardize these services in Colorado to an untenable degree, and could very well lead to companies that Coloradans rely on exiting the market, raising prices, or reducing the number of drivers. This in turn would create economic hardship for the thousands of people who rely on the platforms for income and to go to medical appointments, as well as potentially add more drunk drivers to the road,” he wrote in his veto letter.
House Bill 25-1291 aimed to increase safety for passengers, including optional audio and visual recording during rides and a ban on drivers offering their passengers food and drink. It would have also added some new background check requirements and allowed a person to sue, instead of going to arbitration, a company or driver in the case of death, sexual assault, personal injury or kidnapping.
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Jenny Willford, a Northglenn Democrat who said she was sexually assaulted by a Lyft driver last year. Prosecutors charged the man who allegedly attacked her earlier this month. Willford is also suing Lyft over the incident. She did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the veto.
Lawmakers narrowed the scope of the bill throughout the legislative process, most significantly in the final days of the session, to respond to concerns from ride-hailing companies. It passed the House on a 56-9 vote and the Senate on a 22-13 vote.
Still, Uber said they would leave the state if the bill became law, and Uber and Lyft both encouraged a veto after the legislative session wrapped up.
Polis wrote that he was concerned the audio and visual recording provisions were in conflict with state privacy laws, and that banning arbitration clauses in rider agreements on the platforms in question could be preempted by federal law.
“I fear victims attempting to bring a claim in court in reliance of this bill will have their claims dismissed based on federal law and the arbitration clauses in the user terms and agreements, causing substantial delay in victims achieving relief,” he wrote. 
At the same time, Polis directed the state’s Department of Regulatory Agencies to work with bill sponsors to come up with policy ideas that could be implemented through executive orders or legislation next year. Specifically, he wants the department and the Public Utilities Commission to strengthen rules against driver impersonation and enhance existing audits on the companies’ background check processes.
He also requested recommendations about how to update and potentially expand the regulatory structure for ride-hailing companies “with a specific focus on passenger safety and enhanced transparency.”
“HB 25-1291 should not represent the end of this conversation on ride share safety,” he wrote.

Tate Reeves announced on Friday that he intends to call a special legislative session next week for lawmakers to pass a state budget.
The move comes after House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, both Republicans, said separately that they had reached a handshake deal on a $7 billion state budget, which was supposed to have been passed earlier this year in regular session.
Reeves, a Republican, said he informed Hosemann and White on Friday that he intends to call a special session for the middle of next week.
“The proposed budget does not materially increase state spending, is fiscally conservative, and will help us to continue Mississippi’s historic economic momentum,” Reeves said in a statement posted on social media. “I’m proud of the work we’ve done to reach this agreement. I’d like to thank Mississippi’s legislative appropriators for working diligently throughout the budget negotiation process. I’m excited to get the special session completed and look forward to quickly passing the budget.”
Multiple legislators told Mississippi Today that House Speaker Jason White’s office notified them that the special session would begin on Wednesday morning, though the governor has not yet publicly said when it will begin. 
Mississippi lawmakers must return for a special session because they adjourned their 2025 regular session earlier this year without passing a budget. Lawmakers were mired in political infighting over tax reform and capital projects, including many lawmakers’ pet projects in their districts.
The Senate wanted to spend only on projects for state agencies, universities and colleges. The House believed there was enough money to fund projects in counties and municipalities around the state, in addition to the state projects.
The political reality is that legislative leadership tightly controls the bulk of the local projects in what’s often referred to as the “Christmas Tree bill.” Leadership can use these projects to reward people who buy into their agenda and punish members who buck the leadership.
Such special projects for back home are often a key focus of rank-and-file lawmakers who don’t have prominent leadership roles at the Capitol.
Legislators must return to the Capitol to pass a budget in special session before the new budget year begins July 1. Failure to pass a new state budget by the end of June could result in some agencies shutting down until they are funded.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/29194330/State-of-the-State-10.jpg,,,2025-05-23 18:06:17.493994

The new cases also brought possible exposures in Santa Fe County, where cases have not yet been reported.
The new cases include an infant too young for vaccination and three adults who had each had at least one dose of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, according to a news release.
Six counties now have cases:
• 65 in Lea County
• six in Sandoval County
• three in Eddy County
• two in Doña Ana County
• one each in Curry and Chaves counties
NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Miranda Durham and DOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie held a news conference Thursday in Albuquerque to issue new recommendations for children in counties with measles cases to receive a first injection earlier than standard protocol and have three, rather than two, shots overall.
Durham also noted during the news conference that travel presents “a risk for measles spread and that the current outbreak is New Mexico’s largest in many years.
Both Durham and DeBlassie continue to reference vaccines as the only fully preventative method against measles. “We want to make sure everybody stays safe,” DeBlassie said.

Durham recommended Thursday that infants as young as six months could be eligible for a third measles vaccination dose if residing in or traveling to high measles spread areas.
Adults born after 1957 are recommended to have at least one dose of the vaccine, but two doses offers 97% protection from the measles infection and prevents spread. Measles symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people.
NMDOH is offering free measles vaccines at offices around the state, which are listed on the department’s measles webpage.
New Mexico residents can check their records online at the state Vax View website or call the NMDOH hotline at 1-833-796-8773. The hotline is staffed by nurses, who can offer measles vaccine or further testing information in English and Spanish.

(Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)Though the full ramifications of the “big, beautiful” tax and spending bill that narrowly passed the U.S. House this week are still murky — especially since the bill is likely to change as it makes its way through the Senate — the bill as currently written could jeopardize health insurance for tens of thousands of Utahns. 
Plus, states including Utah would need to grapple with an estimated $625 billion in cumulative Medicaid cuts over 10 years from work requirements, stricter eligibility rules and a pause on provider taxes — changes that would likely lead millions of Americans losing Medicaid coverage. 
On Friday, officials from the Utah Department of Health and Human Services told Utah News Dispatch they did not have state-specific estimates available detailing the potential impacts of the still-evolving federal budget reconciliation package on Utah’s Medicaid program because it’s still a “moving target.”
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

However, according to the health policy outlet KFF, the bill could result in an estimated $381 million loss in federal Medicaid dollars for Utah. The outlet used Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates to unpack the potential state-by-state impacts of a $625 billion federal cut to Medicaid in an analysis posted last week. 
“Cuts of $625 billion will force states to make tough choices: maintain current spending on Medicaid by raising taxes or reducing spending on other programs; or cut Medicaid spending by covering fewer people, offering fewer benefits, or paying providers less,” KFF reported. 
The vast majority of the cut would come from three sources: work requirements mandating that adults who are eligible for Medicaid expansion must meet work and reporting requirements (estimated to save $300.8 billion as people become ineligible), repealing the Biden administration’s rule simplifying eligibility and renewal process (estimated to save $162.7 billion) and setting a moratorium on new or increased provider taxes (estimated to save $86.8 billion), accordion to KFF. 
It depends on what states decide to do to respond to the cuts, but in another analysis posted Tuesday based on CBO estimates, KFF estimated the changes to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplaces could increase the number of people without health insurance across the nation by 8.6 million. 
Additionally, when combined with the effect of the expected expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, the CBO expects 13.7 million more people will be uninsured in 2034, according to KFF. 
“Anticipating how states will respond to changes in Medicaid policy is a major source of uncertainty in CBO’s cost estimates. Instead of making state-by-state predictions about policy responses, CBO estimates the percentage of the affected population that lives in states with different types of policy responses,” KFF noted, adding that states may choose to implement work requirements that are easier or harder to comply with, which would impact enrollment. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
So KFF’s analysis included a range of enrollment impacts varying by plus or minus 25% from a midpoint estimate. 
Based on the budget reconciliation bill’s changes to Medicaid, Utah is projected to see its uninsured population increase by a mid-range estimate of roughly 65,000 — somewhere between 49,000 on the low end and up to 81,000 on the high end, according to the analysis. 
When combined with the expected expiration of the Affordable Care Act’s enhanced premium tax credits, KFF estimated that Utah’s uninsured population could increase by even more — roughly 150,000, or a 4% increase. That estimate could vary between 110,000 on the low end or up to 190,000 on the high end, according to KFF. 
Other states would see bigger impacts than Utah, where about 350,000 total Utahns enroll in Medicaid. About half of the 13.7 million more people who would be uninsured under both policy changes live in Florida (1.8 million), Texas, (1.6 million), California (1.5 million), New York (800,000), and Georgia (610,000). 
‘Devastating’: Health advocates blast bill’s House passage 
Utah health advocates who have been watching the budget reconciliation bill’s progress expressed deep disappointment in its passage out of the House. 
“I’ve yet to meet any Utahn who said that when they voted in November, they were looking for which candidate was most focused on kicking as many people off Medicaid,” said Stephanie Burdick, an advocate with the newly-formed Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition. 
“Yet here we are,” Burdick said. “The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that could force almost 80,000 Utahns off their health insurance.”
  Stephanie Burdick, a health advocate, speaks during a news conference held at Pioneer Park in Salt Lake City on May 6, 2025 advocating against federal cuts to Medicaid. (Katie McKellar/Utah News Dispatch)
The proposed federal cuts also come as Utah state officials — anticipating the Republican-controlled White House and Congress’ appetite to implement work requirements on Medicaid — are considering a waiver to impose work requirements on Utah’s adult Medicaid adult expansion population. 
About 75,000 Utahns have enrolled in Utah’s Medicaid expansion program, an estimated 7,500 (10%), would not qualify for an exemption and be subject to the work requirements. That means that if they don’t start working or submit documents showing they’re applying for at least 48 jobs during a three-month period, they could lose their medical coverage. 
Between Utah’s proposed work requirements and the proposed federal Medicaid cuts, Burdick said state officials and federal politicians in D.C. are “both deadset on one thing: increasing the number of uninsured Utahns and squeezing more time and more money out of working families.” 
“How is this aligned with Utah values?” Burdick said, urging Congress to “go back to the drawing board and find ways to increase access and affordability to health care for all Americans and this is the opposite.”
Advocates sound alarm as Utah looks to impose work requirements on Medicaid expansion

Nate Crippes with the Disability Law Center, also a member of the Protect Medicaid Utah Coalition, issued a statement saying health advocates “remain concerned about the devastating impact of the billions of dollars in Medicaid cuts on Utahns with disabilities.”
“Numerous provisions in this bill would be harmful to the disability community, including a work requirement that penalizes Medicaid beneficiaries for losing a job, and will strip health coverage from millions nation-wide, including many Utahns,” Crippes said.
He added that given the focus on people enrolled in Medicaid expansion, “we are particularly concerned with the impact on those with mental illness and substance use disorder, who make up nearly 60% of the expansion population.”  
“We see no beauty in a bill that denies healthcare to millions, shifts costs to the states and the middle class, and weakens our entire healthcare system,” he said. “So we urge our senators to support the disability community, protect Medicaid, and stop this bill from passing.”
President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress have lauded the bill as needed to curb government spending, cut taxes and provide resources to execute Trump’s agenda around immigration, energy production and increased military investment. 
Democrats criticized the bill as a tax cut that would largely benefit the billionaire class and lead the U.S. to raise its debt limit by $4 trillion. 
How will Utah respond to Medicaid cuts if they pass?
Utah’s Medicaid Director Jennifer Strohecker briefed Utah lawmakers this week on the status of Utah’s Medicaid program, proposed changes including the state’s version of work requirements, and possible impacts from the budget reconciliation bill if it receives final passage. 
“Utah has the lowest Medicaid enrollment of every state, but for the 350,000 Utahns that do receive their health benefits through this program, it is a lifeline for preventive care, institutional care when it’s needed, physical health, behavioral health,” she told the state Health and Human Services Interim Committee on Wednesday. 
An estimated 1 in 10 Utahns are enrolled in Medicaid, she said. One in 6 babies are born with Medicaid as their health coverage.  
In total, Utah’s Medicaid program costs about $5.3 billion per year. More than 64% of it is funded with federal dollars, equaling $3.4 billion. About $1.7 in state dollars pay for the rest. 
‘Counterproductive and cruel’: Advocates form coalition to protect Medicaid from federal cuts

Lawmakers including Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo, and Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, asked Strohecker about Utah’s proposed work requirement waiver and questioned whether it will lead to Utahns losing coverage due to administrative burdens. 
“This was not meant to be an administrative hurdle or a barrier. This was not meant to take people off of the Medicaid program,” she said of Utah’s proposal. 
While Strohecker noted the federal proposal has a “pretty big dollar figure tied to work requirements as it’s proposed, Utah’s design did not have that intent.” 
“So it is our commitment to look at what are those administrative hurdles, what are those barriers, as it’s designed today, and thoughtfully work through those with you all and with our partners at DWS,” she said, noting that Utah’s proposal is still being drafted using feedback from public comment. 
Though the original public comment period for Utah’s proposed work requirements waiver was initially scheduled to end Thursday, state officials told Utah News Dispatch they decided to extend it through June 2, with one more public hearing scheduled for Tuesday. 
“We have received a lot of helpful feedback and will consider those recommendations before submitting the request to (the federal government) within a month or two of closing the public comment period,” a Utah Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said in an email.
However, Strohecker noted that Utah’s waiver and the federal mandates included in the budget reconciliation package are two different proposals. The proposed federal mandated work requirements would require Americans to “complete work requirements before you ever get Medicaid.” 
The federal proposal has the potential to risk loss of health coverage for tens of thousands more Utahns than the state’s work requirement waiver, as currently drafted. 
Additionally, if Congress approves the bill as currently drafted, it included a provision that would penalize states that expanded coverage for immigrants by reducing the federal Medicaid matching rate for the Medicaid expansion program from 90% to 80% for states that either provide health coverage or financial assistance to purchase health coverage to certain groups of immigrants. 
‘I have a hard enough time’: Utahns urge state not to impose work requirements on Medicaid

Last year, Utah started offering health insurance to noncitizen children through its State Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. As of last week, 1,317 children were enrolled in that program, which has the capacity to cover up to 2,000 kids, according to the state’s website.
Strohecker said that if the federal government penalizes Utah for its CHIP program and reduces its state match from 90% to 80%, that would trigger a law to “terminate” Utah’s adult Medicaid expansion program. She said lawmakers may need to consider what to do about that. 
That may include repealing the state’s CHIP program for 2,000 kids in order to save Utah’s Medicaid expansion program, which covers 75,000 adults. 
Rep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy, acknowledged the federal bill is “constantly evolving,” so state leaders will need to watch what happens, but he said “assuming this bill passes, if this provision is left in there,” lawmakers may need to repeal CHIP.
“I think it’s a really simple policy call, myself, that we need to sunset the (CHIP) program that would trigger the 10% penalty as well as our trigger law, because that would be a domino effect,” Eliason said. “This is not making a policy comment on the underlying legislation, it’s just that our hands would be tied, and it would be, I think, the greatest good for the greatest number.” 
Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, also acknowledged that the federal budget package is a “moving target, so who knows what it’s going to look like in the next week.” But she asked whether the Utah Legislature would need to convene in a special session to deal with fallout if the bill receives final passage before lawmakers’ next general session in January. 
Strohecker said that’s a possibility. 
“We’ve been keeping a very close eye on this legislation,” she said.

House Speaker Daniel Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton issued brief statements late Friday afternoon telling their members that they do not need to plan on returning to Tallahassee next week.
“I hope to have a better idea of our scheduling moving forward in the next few days and will share another update after the Memorial Day Holiday,” Albritton wrote.
“We continue working closely with the Senate toward a final budget agreement,” added Perez in his own statement to his members. “We will ensure you have the necessary notice to make travel and scheduling arrangements when the time comes.”
The 60-day regular legislative session was scheduled to end three weeks ago, on May 2. However, the two chambers have not been able to come together on a budget, the only job that they are constitutionally required to accomplish. The dispute mainly centers on the issue of tax cuts.
The session was originally extended to June 2, but the House returned to Tallahassee for one day last week to extend until June 30 – something that the Senate has yet to do. The fiscal year ends on June 30. If lawmakers don’t pass a budget by that time it would mean a government shutdown.
The budget passed by the House in April was $113 billion, about $4.4 billion less than the Senate’s spending plan.

Photo by James M. Patterson/Valley NewsThis story by Liz Sauchelli was first published by the Valley News on May 21.SOUTH ROYALTON — For the third time in seven months, Bethel and Royalton voters rejected a $3.8 million bond to renovate the White River Unified School District’s middle and high schools.The result was 540 to 446, according to results provided by Karmen Bascom, the Royalton town clerk who also serves as clerk for the White River Unified School District. Turnout on Tuesday was higher than it was for the same ballot measure in March, with about 27% of the district’s 3,658 voters participating.Tuesday’s rejection follows failed results for the bond at Town Meeting in March and in November.“It really is painful that this is the way it ended up,” said Nancy Pejouhy, chair of the White River Unified School District school board. “To have the vote be such a large margin was surprising, considering we were so close on the other two votes.”This week’s vote came after residents petitioned for a vote for reconsideration, so the measure had to be the same as the proposal put forward in March.The margin the renovation proposal has lost by has increased with each vote.In November, the bond failed by just 10 votes — 753-743.On Town Meeting Day, it failed by 20 votes, 435-415.The largest part of the $6.2 million project called for building a performing arts center at the high school, at a cost of about $3.17 million.Other elements included expanding the White River Valley High School’s wood shop and welding areas in South Royalton, as well as installing secure entrances at the middle school in Bethel and at the high school.In addition to the bond, the project would have been funded by capital reserve funds and donations, including $500,000 from the Jack and Dorothy Byrne Foundation.READ MORE
The school district had until the end of 2025 to use that donation, White River Valley Supervisory Union Superintendent Jamie Kinnarney said.“Certainly at this point, I think our constituents have indicated that they’re not in a position to approve a bond that’s going to result in any kind of tax increase,” he said Wednesday.Still, he noted that he expected that tuition from outside the district would have more than offset the cost of the bond.The average value of a home in the White River Unified District is just shy of $200,000, and the bond would have raised property taxes less than $50 per year, according to information provided by the school district. That amounts to roughly $1 per week, Pejouhy said, questioning why that would have felt unaffordable to residents.“You can’t even buy a pack of gum for a dollar anymore,” she said.The board decided in April to move forward with a state-mandated stormwater mitigation project near White River Valley High School’s gym. The cost of about $300,000 is expected to come from the district’s capital reserve fund. While the project was included in the bond proposal, the school board decided to do the work whether or not the bond passed.Plans are being drawn up for the work that needs to be done. The project will take place either in fall 2025 or spring 2026, Kinnarney said. The future of any other school building improvements are unclear.“We have not as a board discussed what we’re going to do beyond that,” Pejouhy said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bethel and Royalton voters again reject $3.8 million school bond.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bethel-Royalton-School-Board-Bond-Vote.jpg,,,2025-05-23 18:06:17.493994

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers passed two bills this week that aim to support mothers in the state.

One bill requires employers to give paid time off to employees who pump breastmilk at work. The second allows midwives to help with home births, which is the latest attempt by Illinois lawmakers to restore access to maternal health care in the state’s maternity care deserts.

House Bill 2688, sponsored by Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, would allow certified nurse midwives to enter a written agreement with a physician to provide or assist with home births. In designated maternity care deserts, they can enter into such an agreement even if the local physicians don’t provide home births.

The bill only applies to certified nurse midwives, who must be a licensed advanced practice registered nurse, or APRN, and have at least a graduate degree in midwifery. It does not give the same privileges to certified midwives, who are required to have a graduate degree in midwifery.

In recent years, the number of home births across the nation has been steadily rising. The CDC reported that 51,642 home births took place across the country in 2021. That number was a 12% increase from the number of home births in 2020, which the CDC said was the largest increase since at least 1990.

The rise in home births in Illinois is often attributed to the rise in the state’s maternity care deserts, which are counties without a single hospital, birth center, or licensed health care professional who offers obstetric care.

According to a report from March of Dimes, a nonprofit focused on improving maternal health care across the U.S., about 34% of Illinois counties are labeled maternity care deserts. The nationwide average is about 32% of all U.S. counties.

The CDC reported that nearly 35% of women living rural areas that are of reproductive age did not live within 30 minutes of a birthing hospital in 2023.

March of Dimes reported that women living in counties with the highest travel times to a birthing hospital had to travel anywhere between 47 and 59 miles. They also found that women living in maternity care deserts had to travel a little more than 5 times as far as women living in areas of the state with adequate access to maternity care.

“This bill addresses the maternity care deserts that exist in our state to give certified nurse midwives the ability to collaborate with other nurse midwives and APRNs to provide such care,” Moeller said during a House committee hearing on the bill in March.

Illinois’ recent history around the legality of midwives also played a role in the recent increase of maternity care deserts in the state. Although midwives have been used and recognized as health care professionals for centuries, when hospitals began to be recognized as the safest health care settings in the late 1900s, many states stopped licensing midwives and even outlawed the practice altogether.

In Illinois, state officials stopped licensing midwives in the mid-1960s and outlawed the practice in 1992 – making the act a felony with punishments of fines up to $10,000 or three years in prison – according to NPR Illinois.

A law passed in 2021 reversed that decision, making midwifery in the state legal and again allowing for midwives to be legally licensed.

HB 2688 also allows nurse midwives, if they are APRNs, to provide birth services in a licensed birth center without a written agreement if the director of the birth center allows them to. Under the bill, physicians will not be liable for the acts or omissions of nurse midwives solely because of the agreement, unless the physician “has reason to believe” the midwife was unprepared to perform the services or committed willful and wanton conduct.

The bill passed the Senate on Thursday with a vote of 57-1, with only Sen. Jil Tracy, R-Quincy, voting no. It now awaits approval from the governor to become law.

Paid time off to pump breast milk
Senate Bill 212 mandates employers to compensate mothers who take breaks at work to pump breast milk for up to a year after their child is born. The bill prohibits employers from requiring employees to use paid leave time for pumping.

“I believe many employers are already doing the right thing, and, you know, we just need to compel a few of them to make sure they are also supporting mothers and babies,” Rep. Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, said on the House floor Wednesday.

During a news conference in February, bill sponsor Sen. Laura Fine, D-Glenview, said she would have benefitted from the bill when she had children.

“I know for me, we did not have the generosity of these rules and regulations to allow me to take that break to take care of my child,” Fine said. “So, it would be hiding in a bathroom, getting away when you possibly could and actually having to stop breastfeeding early when it couldn’t work out.”

The bill passed the House Wednesday on a bipartisan vote of 82-27. It now only needs approval from the governor to become law.

As high schoolers across the state don caps and gowns for graduation, state education officials are noting the state’s highest graduation rate in at least the last 15 years. 
While still below the national average, last year the highest percentage of New Mexico high-schoolers graduated on time since 2008, when the state began its current methods of graduation rate calculations, according to new data from the Public Education Department. 
State data shows a little over three quarters of all students have graduated high school in New Mexico each year since the COVID-19 pandemic, but in 2024, 78.05% of them made it across the finish line, a slight increase over recent years and the highest rate in more than a decade.
PED calculated that of 26,108 9th graders who started the 2020 school year in New Mexico, 20,378 graduated from a New Mexico school four years later. The calculations account for students who move into or out of the state during that period, according to PED.
Despite the progress, New Mexico’s rate is about 10 percentage points less than the national average, which is 87%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
“This increase reflects the hard work of our educators, students and families, and it underscores our shared commitment to student success,” PED secretary Marianna Padilla said in a statement. “At the same time, we recognize that too many students are still not making it to the finish line—and we must continue working together to ensure every student has the support they need to graduate.”

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)Confirmed cases of measles in North Dakota increased to 21 this week after the Department of Health and Human Services reported two new cases in Grand Forks County, now the third county to be affected.
Both exposures in Grand Forks County are linked to international travel, according to the department. 
Williams County in western North Dakota has 13 cases and Cass County in eastern North Dakota has six confirmed cases, including one person who was hospitalized. All of the North Dakota cases involve people who were unvaccinated, the department said. 
Molly Howell, immunization director for HHS, said Friday she is “cautiously optimistic” about the slow spread of the disease in the state that was first confirmed May 2. But she reiterated that it takes two full incubation periods, or 42 days, without any new cases to declare an outbreak over.
“We’re definitely a long ways from that,” Howell said. 
The department is continuing to recommend early and accelerated measles, mumps and rubella vaccinations for people living in or traveling to Williams County due to confirmed community transmission. 
There is no evidence of community transmission in Cass or Grand Forks counties, the department said.
The department alerted the public to an exposure at the Williston Basin International Airport on May 14. On that day, an individual confirmed to have measles flew on a United Airlines flight from Denver to Williston. Anyone who entered the airport between 10:22 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. that day should consider themselves exposed to the virus, according to the department’s website.
The state health department recommends any unvaccinated people, those without at least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, exposed at the airport should quarantine themselves for 21 days to see if symptoms develop to prevent exposure to the community.
Howell said state health officials were able to get the flight manifest from the affected plane and all North Dakotans on the flight were notified about their exposure to the illness.
Anyone showing symptoms should contact a health care provider before walking into a medical clinic to receive instructions on how to present themselves for testing, Howell said.
Measles symptoms can develop up to 21 days after exposure. The symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a body-wide rash.
The measles virus is spread through the air and people remain contagious for several days before and after the first symptoms appear, the department said previously.
Other North Dakota exposure sites include:

Tractor Supply Williston on May 12.
Band Day Parade Williston in Harmon Park, Main Street and 11th Street on May 10.
Essentia Health Walk-in Care Clinic on 52nd Avenue in Fargo on May 9.
Essentia Health – The Lights West Fargo Clinic on May 7.
Missouri Ridge Elementary School from April 29 to May 2.

Howell said over the next few days the quarantine period for Williston schools will expire.
“Hopefully, we won’t have any children positive from the school setting,” she said. “From what I’m hearing from local public health, people have been coming in to be vaccinated … which is great to hear.”
As of May 22, the CDC reported 1,046 measles cases have been confirmed nationwide across 30 states. About 67% of those cases involved people under age 19 and 97% of the confirmed cases involved people who were unvaccinated or had an “unknown” vaccination status.
“We don’t want there to be any more cases, so we just really want to encourage people to revisit vaccination with a trusted health care provider,” Howell said.An updated list of measles exposure sites can be found on the HHS website.

(Maya Smith for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An interview with a news outlet cost a former University of Kansas resident assistant his job and his home. Now, he’s suing the university for violating his free speech rights.
The lawsuit filed in federal court Thursday says KU restricted Anthony Alvarez’ speech and fired him without cause in retaliation.
Alvarez, who is trans, talked to a media outlet on Feb. 26 during a campus protest over the university’s decision to end Grace Pearson Scholarship Hall’s gender-inclusive living arrangements. Alvarez, a 21-year-old student, expressed his frustration with the elimination of inclusive spaces where students feel safe. While he identified himself as a proctor, akin to a resident assistant, he did not claim to speak in his official capacity as a resident assistant for KU.
The university placed Alvarez on probation for failing to refer media inquiries to senior KU staff. Before the window to appeal the probation closed, Alvarez was subsequently fired from his position, and he was forced to rescind an offer to continue as a proctor the next academic year.
“I think it’s a bad sign that for infractions as little as this, you could get fired and kicked out and very quickly find yourself in a position where you have to find a place to live,” Alvarez told Kanas Reflector in April.
The lawsuit argues Alvarez “engaged in protected speech by speaking to a member of the media in their capacity as a private citizen on a matter of public concern — specifically by criticizing Defendant KU’s policies and practices related to housing policies for LGBTQ+ community members as applied to recent state and federal legislative directives.”
Precedent for resident assistants, who are students and employees of a university, fired for speech is largely undeveloped. However, First Amendment challenges, added restrictions and demands for universities and rollbacks of LGBTQ+ rights are becoming commonplace under President Donald Trump’s second administration.
A vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, Alvarez testified in January against a bill in the Kansas Legislature that bans gender-affirming care for minors and restricts the use of state funds for promoting gender transitioning. The bill made it through the House and Senate, was vetoed by Gov. Laura Kelly and ultimately became law after the Republican-controlled Legislature overrode the veto.
Representing Alvarez is Barry Grissom, former U.S. Attorney for Kansas, who argued in the complaint that as a result of KU’s actions, Alvarez experienced a “loss of living quarters, income, reputational damage, emotional distress, and the deprivation of constitutionally protected rights.”
Grissom filed suit not only to address the university’s retaliation toward Alvarez but also to garner a judgment from the court on whether the policy that led to Alvarez’ probation and termination is constitutional, Grissom said in a Thursday news release.
“Terminating a public employee after they speak to the media and criticize that employer’s policies is certainly in line with some of the challenges we have seen of late to the First Amendment, one of the bedrock principles of the American legal system,” Grissom said in a statement to Kansas Reflector.
He continued: “Speech that the government does not agree with is exactly the kind which the First Amendment was intended to protect — yet each day, there are seemingly more people affected by policies like the one which cost Mr. Alvarez his job.”
The lawsuit names KU; Sarah Waters, executive director of KU housing and resident life; and Emily Chellgren, assistant director of resident life, as defendants. Multiple attempts beginning Friday morning to reach KU for comment for this story were unsuccessful. By Friday afternoon, most staff members had set up out-of-office messages for Memorial Day weekend. KU also did not respond to requests to comment in past coverage of this story.

Eaton is charged in the shooting of three college students of Palestinian descent in Burlington in November of 2023. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerJason Eaton, the man accused of shooting three Palestinian students in Burlington in 2023, claimed without evidence during a court hearing on Friday that he had been acting under the instruction of the Central Intelligence Agency and Mossad, Israel’s intelligence agency.He said during the hearing that the three victims were associated with Hamas, and suggested he would pursue a public authority defense in his case because of his claimed ties to the CIA.Eaton’s comments came during a court hearing to review motions he filed to gain access to the victims’ cellphone data, which Burlington police collected from them with their consent in the hours after their shooting. His motion also sought access to a Homeland Security document compiled after the incident.Reviewing the victims’ cellphone data, he said, could help bolster his defense. He later asked Superior Court Judge John Pacht for permission to hire the head of defense at Palantir Technologies to review the data and brief the court on their findings.Chittenden County State’s Attorney Sarah George suggested during the court hearing that Eaton’s comments in court provide some evidence for a hate crime enhancement.“I do not believe this has any credibility at all,” George said of Eaton’s comments. “In fact, I think it is providing greater context than we’ve had for a possible hate crime enhancement.”Eaton was deemed competent to stand trial in the fall. But on Friday, his defense attorney, Peggy Jansch, of the Chittenden County Public Defender’s Office, asked the court to order an updated competency hearing, citing his comments in court.READ MORE
Eaton’s comments offer some insight into his defense strategy, and shed some light into his state of mind when he allegedly shot Hisham Awartani, Kinnan Abdalhamid and Tahseen Aliahmad on Nov. 25, 2023.The three students, all 20 years old at the time, were in town visiting one of their families for Thanksgiving. They were walking on North Prospect Street, speaking a mix of Arabic and English and wearing kaffiyehs, a traditional scarf that is a symbol of Palestinian identity, when Eaton approached them from a nearby porch and allegedly shot all three.He has pleaded not guilty to three counts of attempted second-degree murder charges, and has been held without bail at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans since his arrest soon after the shooting.His comments Friday prompted backlash from the victims’ attorney, William Clark, who said his clients were moving forward with a protective order to prevent access to their data.“I’m not letting my victims be harassed under a completely frivolous theory of defense that does not even have an ethical ground to be able to be raised in court, regardless of its legal infirmity,” Clark said. “It’s pure harassment if they go forward with a deposition that’s asking about some of the allegations you’ve heard today.”George has said previously that a hate crime enhancement against Eaton was unlikely, and that she did not have enough evidence to support such a charge.She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether she would pursue a hate crime enhancement.Eaton’s court case has lagged over the last year. He has repeatedly clashed with his attorneys over their defense strategy and has asked the court twice to fire them.He claimed in a handwritten motion filed in April that his counsel insisted on an insanity defense “to which I do not consent.”He claimed that they “refuse to investigate and prepare a defense based on the facts which I have disclosed for them” and claimed they would “prepare no other defense on ethical grounds.”“They have failed at their paramount obligation to be loyal to their client — going so far as to undermine my credibility on the record by stating that they are exploring an insanity defense,” he wrote.Jansch has supported Eaton’s motions for access to the victims’ cell phone data and other records throughout the case’s development.“I have an obligation to see if there’s any factual support for Mr. Eaton’s defense,” she said on Friday.But she appeared hesitant to push for his public authority defense. “If you want to raise it with the court, that’s up to you,” she said to Eaton in an aside on Friday. “I’m not going to.”Pacht entertained Eaton’s theories during the hearing Friday, but questioned whether it was “an expression of a disorder that hasn’t been reviewed yet which Mr. Eaton suffers from.”Regardless, Pacht noted the proposed line of defense had little to no factual basis to bring forward.“I know of no law that would suggest that if a state police officer said, ‘This guy is a bad guy, he’s done lots of things, he’s really hurting the community, and it doesn’t seem like anybody’s doing anything about it, I’m authorizing you to do it yourself’ — that would clearly be a violation of law, as far as I can see,” Pacht said.Pacht denied Eaton’s bid for new defense attorneys. He did not rule on his motions for cellphone data or federal government records — saying he would issue a written decision — but noted later that he was “not hearing why the cellphone data” would be material to the case.The court extended the timeline for discovery in the case. Pacht said Friday that the case would not be ready for trial until at least the fall.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Defense attorneys ask for new competency hearing for man accused of shooting Palestinian students after troubling court hearing commentary.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jason-eaton-4-20240308-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743

Timothy Beckmann was arrested in late September and found incompetent to stand trial due to mental health diagnoses. He was ordered into Department of Mental Health custody in January, joining the list of hundreds of people waiting in jail for a state mental health bed to open up.
Just before 5 p.m. on Monday, 64-year-old Beckmann was found unresponsive in his cell in the Jackson County Detention Center cell, according to the Jackson County Sheriff’s Office. 
He was brought to a local hospital, where he was declared dead.
Beckmann hadn’t been convicted of any crimes — his case was on pause while he waited months for mental health treatment. 
The cause of death is not yet known. The sheriff’s office, which oversees the jail, told The Independent it is investigating the death and the medical examiner’s office has not yet released a cause of death. The medical examiner’s office told The Independent no reports could be released under public records law while the case is still under investigation.
But in the seven months he spent in pretrial detention, Beckmann’s mental and physical health deteriorated, the public defenders overseeing his case told The Independent on Friday. They say his death is a tragic consequence of the state’s ballooning waitlist for mental health treatment, which leaves people languishing in jail for over a year on average. It’s also an indictment, the public defenders say, of the state’s inadequate support for those with mental illness.
“What happened to Timothy Beckmann is horrific,” said Annie Legomsky, who runs the state public defense system’s holistic defense services program, “and what makes it all the more tragic is that it was entirely preventable.”
She said jails are not equipped to help people with mental illness.
“The inability of our jails to provide appropriate psychiatric care for these individuals is something we’ve been trying to sound the alarm for for a while,” Legomsky said, “and unfortunately, it’s not a surprise that now someone has tragically ended up dying because they weren’t able to get the care they deserved.”
The Missouri Department of Mental Health declined to answer a list of questions, citing patient privacy protections. 
Jackson County Sheriff Darryl Forté also declined to answer specific questions, citing patient privacy, but wrote by email that the “death of an individual in our custody is a matter we take with the utmost seriousness and care. We are committed to thoroughly examining all circumstances surrounding such incidents, and this particular case remains under investigation.”
 A ‘life or death matter’

Missourians who are arrested and declared incompetent to stand trial wait in jail an average of 14 months before receiving treatment, according to data shared with The Independent earlier this month. Treatment generally includes therapy and medication and is referred to as competency restoration. 
There were 418 people on the waitlist earlier this month.
Those being held in jail are sometimes incarcerated for longer than they would be if they’d received the maximum sentence for the crime they were charged with. There have been successful lawsuits in other states arguing the practice violates due process and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Anthony Vibbard, the deputy district defender in Jackson County who oversaw Beckmann’s case, said Beckmann had been in and out of different mental health facilities over the last few decades.
He was arrested and charged with second degree burglary and first degree property damage, according to court records, after breaking a glass door of a home and entering.
Vibbard said Beckmann had been recently released from a mental health facility when he was arrested, and was left “wandering the streets of Kansas City” — where he wasn’t from and had no family. He said Beckmann entered the home because he was tired and hungry and was looking for something to eat.
Vibbard said once Beckmann was in jail, “his condition started deteriorating to the point where he started self harming.”
Vibbard and Legomsky said after he was detained, Beckmann started pulling out his toenails, scratching himself and “losing touch with reality.” At one point, they said, he stopped eating or taking his blood pressure and heart medication. 
The process of getting court orders for mental health examinations and referrals to the Department of Mental Health can take months. In Beckmann’s case, he was finally ordered into the department’s custody Jan. 21, nearly four months after he was arrested.
His attorney “sounded the alarms” in court, Vibbard said, trying to talk to judges, convince the department to expedite his treatment and making records of her concerns. Beckmann came to court “visibly frail,” Vibbard said, with “scabs and wounds on his body.” 
The legal team received reports he was being restrained due to his behavior, which the sheriff’s office declined to comment on. The jail has been sued in the past for its use of restraint chairs.
“[His attorney] made records over and over saying like that, this is bad. Something bad could happen. He needs to be in a hospital and not a jail,” Vibbard said.“…And eventually we got the word that Mr. Beckmann died number 109 on the waiting list for admissions.” 
The department declined to confirm that Beckmann was number 109 on the waitlist at the time he died.
Legomsky said despite legislative and court concerns, more needs to be done to remedy the competency restoration issue, “so that people like Mr. Beckmann don’t die locked up in a cell, strapped down.”
“If people don’t know what’s happening,” she said, “and they don’t realize that it’s a life or death matter, I’m worried that the status quo will continue.”

Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, tries to reason with an unruly crowd during a town hall event at the University of Utah on March 20, 2025. (Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)Utah U.S. Rep. Celeste Maloy’s proposal to sell off nearly 11,500 acres of public land in southwestern Utah was shot down this week after receiving bipartisan pushback in Congress.
The proposal, which identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George, was included by Maloy as part of Congress’ budget package.

But on Wednesday evening, Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross, rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip Maloy’s proposal from the budget bill during a House Rules Committee meeting.
“I worked hard with my colleagues in the House and locally elected officials to make sure that the one big, beautiful bill represented the unique needs of Utahns,” Maloy said in a statement Thursday. “My lands amendment would have delivered critical relief to fast-growing communities in my district.”
However, Maloy acknowledged it was removed from the reconciliation package, which she voted for.
“I still supported the bill, because it delivers a strong economy that will benefit Utah and the country as a whole,” she said. “I will continue to fight for Utahns to responsibly manage federal lands that currently landlock our communities and hinder economic growth.”
 Congresswoman says proposal would have helped expand water, transportation, housing infrastructure

Maloy, in an earlier statement, said the land would help the southwest corner of the state expand water, transportation and housing infrastructure, as the region deals with rapid population growth. St. George was eying an airport expansion; the Washington County Water Conservancy District had plans to build a new reservoir; Washington County was looking to widen some existing roads.
In a statement, St. George city leaders thanked Maloy for working on the amendment, and they plan to have more talks with lawmakers on the issue.
“We were disappointed that some groups falsely presented this amendment as if it were a land grab,” city leaders said. “In actuality, the amendment was intended to protect existing critical infrastructure or future critical infrastructure that would be built on already disturbed public lands. Only approximately nine acres would have been used for attainable housing, at a spot adjacent to a future cemetery and an existing residential subdivision.”
The Washington County Water Conservancy District issued a similar statement, telling Utah News Dispatch it respects Congress’ decision to remove Maloy’s amendment.
“We appreciate Congresswoman Maloy’s efforts to facilitate the availability of federal lands for exchange in a manner that would benefit the water district,” the statement reads. “The water district remains committed to securing the necessary federal lands in Washington County for critical water infrastructure projects through established, traditional processes.”
Maloy’s amendment identified a total of 70 parcels to be sold in Utah. The proposal had a far greater impact on Nevada, with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei earmarking nearly 450,000 acres for disposal in his state.
 Environmental groups, public land advocates said bill lacked parameters on what land could be used for

The proposal received broad criticism from environmental groups and public land advocates, who said the bill lacked language mandating what the land would be used for. They argued there was nothing stopping the governments from purchasing the land, then using it for something other than the originally stated purpose. And some of the land abutted rivers and popular recreation areas, including Zion National Park, prompting concerns over access and environmental harm.
The proposal also had its critics in Congress, on both sides of the isle, including Zinke, who called it his “San Juan Hill,” referring to a famous Spanish-American War battle.
“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a news release on Wednesday.
Environmental groups celebrated the decision, issuing a flurry of statements and reactions.
Travis Hammill, the Washington, D.C., director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said Maloy is the “latest in a long list of politicians with the bad idea to try and sell off public lands.”
“The through line of those failed efforts is this: love of public lands transcends geography and political party. Americans don’t want to see these lands sold off and time and time again have risen up to make their voices heard,” Hammill said.
Kyle Roerink executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said Zinke’s move to tank the disposal “sends a strong message to lawmakers of all stripes: We can never break the public trust and the Colorado River for billionaire tax breaks.”
Others noted the bipartisan opposition to the amendment, including Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who called the attempt “appalling” and “Gilded Age-level stuff.”
“Republicans’ public lands fire sale was so greedy even their own caucus wouldn’t support it,” Donnelly said in an emailed statement. “I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”
According to the amendment’s text, about 70 parcels were identified to be sold off to four entities, at market value. Consider:
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid


Washington County would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels covering about 6,492 acres.
The Washington County Water Conservancy District would have been allowed to purchase 22 parcels amounting to about 4,375 acres.
St. George would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels amounting to about 520 acres.
Beaver County would have been allowed to purchase three parcels amounting to roughly 62 acres.

The amendment was a small part of what President Donald Trump has called the “big, beautiful bill” that has been in the works for months. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax law, cuts steps out of the energy permitting process, increases defense and border security spending, and makes substantial changes to Medicaid.
The bill cleared the House early Thursday and is headed to the Senate.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Memorial Day weekend is typically considered the opening weekend for summer water recreation, but for some Iowans the thought of diving headfirst into a lake sounds more concerning than refreshing. 
Driftless Water Defenders, an environmental group based in northeastern Iowa, is launching an initiative to bring awareness to the “deteriorating quality” of Iowa’s water and its impact on summer recreation. 
The first beach monitoring report of the season, issued by the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, shows the department does not recommend swimming from beaches at four of the 41 monitored state lakes.

Nine Eagles, Black Hawk, Beeds Lake and Backbone beaches under advisory
DNR tests waters at the beaches weekly during the summer season, from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day weekend, for E. coli bacteria and microcystins. 
When levels of either exceed safety levels, DNR issues a beach warning which is not a closure, but an advisory to visitors that the water “may carry a higher risk” of causing things like diarrhea, nausea or other acute symptoms.
According to a press release from DNR, advisories are especially important for Iowans with weakened immune systems, young children or those who plan to swim and might ingest water. 
Advisories are issued when E. coli levels are higher than 235 colony forming units, or CFU, per 100 milliliters. At this threshold, the estimated illness rate is 36 minor illnesses per 1,000 swimmers. High concentrations of E. coli can also signal that other bacteria or pathogens are present in the water. 
The DNR beach monitoring also logs county and city beach test results. As of Friday, beaches at F.W. Kent Park, Hickory Grove Park and Lake Iowa Park had E. coli values above the standard. 
Microcystins, which DNR also monitors at beaches, are toxins produced by types of blue-green algae that can cause acute health effects, like rashes, nausea, diarrhea, or fever. These algal blooms appear as green “paint-like” scum on bodies of water and should be avoided, especially if they have an oily appearance. 
According to DNR, Iowa saw seven microcystin-related beach advisories in 2024. The blooms occur in nutrient-rich waters, which are exacerbated by industrial and agricultural runoff. 
Iowa Environmental Council monitors the lake data throughout the summer as well and reported  23 state park beaches had swim advisories in 2024. IEC also noted Green Valley Lake, Honey Creek Resort Beach, and Lake Anita as the only monitored state lake beaches that have never had an E. coli related advisory. 
DWD initiates clean-water dialogue at state lakes
The 48 Lakes Initiative, headed by Driftless Water Defenders, will kick off Saturday at 10 lakes across the state with in-person meet ups and the distribution of water quality statistics at each lake. Attendees are encouraged to share their experiences of recreating in Iowa lakes and how it has changed over time. 
Chris Jones, the organization’s president, said industrial agriculture practices are polluting the waters and “depriving” Iowans of recreational opportunities. 
“The Iowa citizens’ dialogue we are starting today will help citizens to increase the accountability of polluters and governmental agencies responsible for enforcing the state’s environmental laws and regulations,” Jones said in a statement. 
Those interested in attending a Saturday meet up can find more information online.
The organization hopes the citizen-initiated dialogue will persist through the summer on social media and it encouraged folks to share their stories with the tags : #NoSwimEra and #48Lakes.
Food and Water Watch, Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement and Progress Iowa are also supporting the initiative. Mazie Stilwell, the executive director for Progress Iowa, said the state’s rivers, beaches and lakes should be enjoyed “free of worry.” 
“But for Iowans, you either enter at your own risk or heed the warnings for fear of getting sick,” Stilwell said in a statement. “Iowans are making it clear they’re done with politicians and wealthy executives who let these waters deteriorate … These are our waters, it’s time we turn the tide and clean them up.”
Additional safety precautions for the holiday weekend 
Lake temperatures are still fairly chilly for swimming, as the latest fishing report issued by DNR shows most waters measured in the mid 60s, but the department encouraged Iowans to wear lifejackets and stay safe if they do decide to take a plunge. 
Additionally DNR reminded those camping at state parks to avoid transporting firewood, as it can spread insects like the emerald ash borer or oak wilt.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)This week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Delegates advanced a mega bundle of bills designed to shave billions from the federal budget, which Democrats and advocates have said will take resources from the nation’s most vulnerable citizens and hinder social safety nets. Virginia’s congressional delegation was split along partisan lines on the measure, which cleared the House by one vote and is now up for consideration in the U.S. Senate.
The 1,116-page package contains 11 total bills and is championed by President Donald Trump, and supported by Virginia’s Republican federal lawmakers including U.S. Reps. Rob Wittman, Jen Kiggans, John McGuire, Ben Cline and Morgan Griffith. The legislation aims to extend  2017 tax cuts from Trump’s first term at a cost of $3.8 trillion, trim $880 billion from the federal deficit and boost defense and border security spending by cutting several federal social aid programs or incentive packages.
The measure calls for a $625 billion cut to Medicaid over the next decade, which the state’s Democratic federal legislators — including U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan, Bobby Scott, Suhas Subramanyam, Euguene Vindman, Don Beyer and deceased Congressman Gerry Connolly, who died days before the vote — have cautioned and voted against. 
Medicaid is a federal program that helps states provide health insurance coverage to low-income people or people with disabilities. The newly-passed measure would impose work requirements on those who receive it and reduce Medicaid funding to states that choose to use the program for undocumented immigrants. Virginia has specific guidelines for which legal immigrants can qualify for Medicaid and state legislators have considered creating work requirements for Medicaid enrollees in the commonwealth in the past. 	

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


While it’s unclear exactly what toll the federal measure’s cuts would take in the state if it passes, the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee estimates 161,614 Virginians could lose Medicaid coverage. Meanwhile, some citizens, like Central Virginia residents Aida Pacheco and Andrew Daughtry, are voicing opposition to the work requirements. 
Pacheco’s daughter is currently unable to work while undergoing breast cancer treatment that Medicaid helps her cover, she said. Daughtry, a construction worker unable to work temporarily after an injury, has used Medicaid because he did not have employer-provided health insurance and now is out of work temporarily due to an injury that needs surgery and physical therapy. 
Pacheco and Daughtry joined U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond, on a recent press call, where McClellan said the proposed overhauls to Medicaid could cost taxpayers more money in the long run. Uninsured people are inclined to only seek emergency medical care, rather than preventative care. Because emergency rooms are federally required to treat all patients, care for uninsured patients who cannot pay could become a shared financial burden on taxpayers. 
“When you kick people off of their health insurance, that raises the cost for everybody else,” McClellan said. 
 Virginia’s congressional Republicans weigh in

In contrast, Virginia’s Republican representatives have celebrated the proposed changes, framing them as a big step towards fiscal responsibility and a better use of the country’s resources. 
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-Salem, told The Mercury before the bill cleared the House that his GOP colleagues “proved the other party wrong” by not making “massive, significant cuts to Medicaid.”
McClellan, Virginia Democrats warn of dire impact to state if proposed Medicaid cuts materialize

And though the projected $625 billion in cuts indeed qualify as “massive,” the federal funding tool that allocates Medicaid money to states called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) has not changed. Should the bill pass the Senate and be signed by Trump, many beneficiaries would remain covered, though changes like the work requirements could affect some Medicaid recipients. It’s a detail of the bill that  many Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Westmoreland, have pointed out. 
Wittman also framed the bill’s work requirements as “community engagement requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents” in a Thursday statement and emphasized that pregnant women, seniors, and people with disabilities would still be covered. 
“I’ve fought to protect and preserve Medicaid for Virginia’s most vulnerable, and this bill does just that,” he said. He added that the bill “strengthens the integrity of the program, saves taxpayers billions, and ensures care is available for those who truly rely on it.”
In April, he’d also co-signed a letter to Republican U.S. House leadership cautioning the legislative body not to cut too much from the program. 
Likewise, U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virignia Beach, characterized the bill as a way to strengthen, not destroy,  Medicaid. 
Kiggans said in a statement on X that she voted in favor of the measure because it “puts people first by protecting Medicaid for vulnerable families, delivering tax relief and child care credits to working Virginians, investing in our servicemembers and shipbuilders, and cutting wasteful federal spending.”
As Kiggans represents Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District, anchored in Virginia Beach, she and her predecessors from both parties have been considered vulnerable incumbents in elections. The district has oscillated between partisan control over the years, placing its representatives under heightened scrutiny for votes they take. 
Though the 1st Congressional District has been historically Republican-leaning, its absorption in redistricting of blue or politically purple Richmond suburbs has made it an opportunity for Democrats to try to flip. This spring, some constituents hosted a town hall and invited Wittman to hear their concerns about the federal cuts, but he didn’t show up.
Wittman constituents host town hall in his absence to address immigration, federal funding concerns

Though congressional elections aren’t until next year, the impact of their votes concerning Medicaid remain to be seen. 
In the meantime, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows that about 10.3 million people nationwide would lose access to Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with 7.6 million people becoming uninsured during that 10-year budget window. 
 As possible Senate rewrite looms, more Virginians could lose insurance if FMAP is altered

The “Big Beautiful Bill,” as Trump has called it, is not yet law. It still must pass the Senate chamber before he can sign it. 
Some GOP senators are calling for a rewrite of it to address a range of concerns to include the bill’s projected impact on federal debt, the phaseout of clean energy incentives and notably, the reforms to Medicaid. A key sticking point from Senate conservatives is concern that the bill doesn’t do enough to cut future deficits.
With some Medicaid recipients already standing to lose access as the bill has so-far advanced, further changes to the in-progress bill — like addressing the FMAP — could put about 630,000 more people in health insurance limbo. 
This is because when lawmakers were compromising to expand Medicaid in 2018, they settled on trigger language that would upend the expansion if the FMAP were adjusted.
Virginia’s private hospitals have financially supported the state’s Medicaid expansion since 2018, and are closely monitoring federal developments. 
Julian Walker, a spokesperson for the Virginia Hospitals and Healthcare Association, said that the organization is glad Virignia’s congressional delegation across both aisles has been listening to its feedback and is appreciative that the FMAP was not altered in the current draft of the bill. 
Walker said earlier this year that hospitals have been “proud” to help sustain Virginia’s Medicaid expansion, but acknowledged uncertainty about what lies ahead.
State lawmakers are monitoring the situation too. 
Del. Mark Sickles, D-Fairfax, suspects the legislature would need to go into a special session if the Medicaid expansion were undone but he also believes that congressional actions could wrap up in time for the 2026 Virginia General Assembly session. 
“It could turn out we know everything we need to know by the time our regular session starts,” he said. 
Or, he added, if Congress takes too long and has to pass continuing resolutions, they could still be sorting through final details of their proposal as Virginia’s legislature begins meeting early next year. 
As chair of the House of Delegates’ Health and Human Services committee and vice-chair of its Appropriations committee, Sickles is watching Congress closely.
“We need to see what they actually do,” he said. 
He echoed McClellan’s warnings about the potential financial burden to Virginia taxpayers if people unenrolled from Medicaid are forced to seek more care from emergency rooms. 
“In the end, the savings that (Republicans are) claiming are going to come from fewer enrollees in Medicaid, the cost of their health care does not go away,” Sickles said. “There is no free lunch if you’re not enrolled in Medicaid.”

Most of the action has moved out of committees and to the House and Senate floor. After Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) whizzed through a stack of bills on Thursday, Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) complimented her speed, sayingshe got faster each bill, clocking in at under 35 seconds from the opening to closing of the last. “Bravo,” he said.
Some other votes of note:
Members of both chambers overwhelmingly supported what was dubbed the “famous chicken bill,” (LD 1655) which bars a county or municipality from adopting a regulation that prohibits a person from keeping chickens on their residential property. “Time to put the chickens to roost,” said Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor).
Both chambers backed legislation (LD 698) that provides ongoing funds to emergency homeless shelters in Maine.
The majority of the House and Senate backed a bill (LD 599) to raise the salary threshold for overtime pay. During debate in the Senate, where it passed 18-14, Labor Committee Chair Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) said the threshold is in need of updating and that it would help prevent employers from misclassifying employees to deny them overtime.
House and Senate lawmakers narrowly backed legislation (LD 538) that would amend Maine’s prescription drug labeling law by allowing someone who prescribes abortion drugs, including mifepristone, misoprostol and generic alternatives, to remove their name. Rep. Sally Cluchey (D-Bowdoinham) said the proposal comes directly from providers who have been subject to harassing phone calls and targeted bomb threats and are concerned about their safety and the safety of their families. Rep. Reagan Paul (R-Winterport), who voted against the bill, said it shouldn’t be thought of as a referendum on abortion but rather an issue of medical transparency and the public’s right to know who is prescribing powerful drugs.
After passage in the House last week, the Senate voted 18-14 to back a bill (LD 1080) to prohibit public utilities from requiring deposits based solely on a residential customer’s income. 
Both chambers unanimously backed legislation (LD 1360) requiring the Secretary of State to provide the option for a driver’s license or a nondriver identification card that does not meet the standards of the federal REAL ID Act of 2005. (Read more about the issue here).
They also supported a bill (LD 530) that would eliminate the provision that presumes bar applicants who had been convicted of a crime punishable by at least one year in prison don’t have the good moral character required to be a lawyer. Bill sponsor Rep. David Boyer (R-Poland) said he proposed it  after conversations with someone who was formerly incarcerated and had to spend a lot of money to become a lawyer. Boyer argued, given the state’s indigent defense crisis, that Maine should take steps to allow more people to become lawyers. He also noted the bill doesn’t go as far as the recommendations of the American Bar Association on the matter.
The chambers voted to back LD 1123, which provides ongoing funds to establish two positions to facilitate MaineCare reimbursements for local school districts. During the House floor debate, Rep. Michael Brennan (D-Portland), who co-chairs the Education Committee, said the state has left millions in Medicaid funding in Washington, D.C. that could have come to Maine schools and students. The new positions are meant to help the state better access those reimbursements.
Lawmakers unanimously adopted a bill (LD 1604) that seeks to address forever chemicals from landfill leachate entering groundwater and surface waters.  (Read more on that here).
Emergency legislation (LD 1022) to increase funding for the civil legal services fund, which supports the provision of free legal services to low-income defendants, passed the Senate by a vote of 30-2 and the House 96-46. 
Both chambers voted in favor of a bill (LD 784) to require health insurance coverage for specialized risk screening for first responders. Senate Minority Leader Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), who voted against the measure, said he wasn’t opposed to firefighters receiving health insurance, but said his party believes the Labor Committee should be dealing with this issue with a workers comp lens. Sen. Donna Bailey (D-York) said the insurance committee has dealt with the issue twice and said with this bill they are “trying to give coverage upfront.”
Both chambers also supported legislation (LD 666) that would provide $2.5 million each year to the Department of Corrections for certified domestic violence intervention programs.
Both chambers voted unanimously to back a resolve (LD 1148) directing the Secretary of State to study providing access to absentee ballots for municipal elections to uniformed service voters or overseas voters as it does for statewide elections.
They also overwhelmingly backed a provision (LD 1576) that would extend the one year lobbying prohibition for former executive branch employees to also include former employees of the legislative branch. 
Following the action of the House, senators voted 19-13 to reject two bills (LD 189 and LD 743) that would eliminate the requirement for health care facilities to obtain a certificate of need for the provision of mental health and substance use disorder services. (You can read about a similar proposal last session.)
Following the House last week, the Senate voted 18-14 to reject a bill (LD 451), which would require operators of wind or solar developments to test for PFAS and, if so, determine if contamination was “reasonably caused” by the development. While proponents argued that solar panels are “leaking PFAS into the ground,” Sen. Mark Lawrence (D-York) pointed out that Maine has already passed bans on products with intentionally added PFAS, which includes solar farms. “The purpose behind it is not PFAS,” he said of the bill, but rather it’s to slow down the growth of renewable energy.
A resolution (LD 492) proposing an amendment to the state constitution to provide for “parental rights” was rejected by the Senate 19-17 following a House vote against the measure last week. (More on this here). 
Sen. David Haggan (R-Penobscot) argued the amendment would restore parental control over what happens to their children. “We’ve got to give parents the proper respect and rights to guide their children to adulthood the way they see fit,” he said. However, Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) pointed out that, “Maine already has constitutional rights for parents that are greater than most states” and said the amendment would undermine court rulings related to parents rights.
The House and Senate rejected a bill (LD 935) that would direct the Department of Environmental Protection to report on air and soil chemical and metal levels on solar farm sites. Proponents said they are concerned about solar energy installments having unintended consequences with the leaching of certain chemicals. However, Rep. Victoria Doudera (D-Camden) said the department doesn’t have the capacity or funds to test each of the more than 700 solar sites in Maine.
Both the House and Senate voted to reject a bill (LD 266) that would require voter signatures to be updated every five years. 
A bill that would repeal the laws allowing same-day voter registration (LD 349) was rejected 125-18 in the House and under the hammer in the Senate. During the House discussion, some Republicans noted that their voters use same-day registration more than any other party.
The Senate voted 19-13 against a resolve (LD 635) directing the state attorney general to drop its climate change lawsuit against Big Oil companies. Before the House voted 81-65 against the measure, Rep. Michael Lemelin (R-Chelsea) declared climate change a “hoax,” saying it is 100% physically impossible to prove that any fossil fuel use has had anything to do with climate change. (The vast majority of scientists, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, say burning fossil fuels is the largest driver of climate change). Other critics argued the attorney general should be putting resources into battling the drug epidemic instead, to which Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) responded that he has and it produced monetary settlements.
Both chambers voted to reject a provision (LD 206) that would eliminate the automatic cost-of-living adjustment to the minimum hourly wage.
Following the committee recommendation, the chambers voted to reject a proposal (LD 220) to establish a scholarship for students enrolled in certain private schools or homeschooled that would shift state and district funding allocated for each student to the accounts.
Following the House vote last week, senators voted 17-14 to reject legislation (LD 174) that would reinstate nonmedical exemptions for school-required vaccines, six years after that provision was repealed. 
After the Senate failed to garner enough votes to enact (LD 771), the chambers are now split over a provision to amend the Maine Criminal Code to define “amphetamine” and “methamphetamine” to mean any compound, mixture or preparation containing any quantity of those substances. Supporters said the change addresses a gap in drug laws but Sen. Chip Curry (D-Waldo) argued the bill would lower the standard for what it means to be a trafficker because it’s common for people to cut drugs with other substances.
Similarly, a bill (LD 16) that would establish separate prosecutorial districts in Downeast Maine is also in nonconcurrence after the House rejected the measure. Having initially voted against the measure, the majority of the Senate voted against enactment and then accepted an amended version of the bill, which would create a new prosecutorial district for Washington County. 
The chambers are also divided over legislation (LD 639) that would remove the requirement that the Maine Criminal Justice Academy’s law enforcement training program must be a residential program. After the Senate backed an amended version of the proposal, the House voted several times and ultimately insisted on its position against the bill.
And a proposal (LD 53) to establish the November General Election Day as a school holiday for school buildings used as voting places is in limbo after it passed the House but was rejected by the Senate.

House action
The House voted under the hammer to back LD 747, which if passed would provide rental assistance for students experiencing homelessness. (More on this here).
The House first took up the minority report rejecting legislation (LD 738) that would remove barriers to becoming a lawyer by allowing an individual who has studied law for four years in a law office study program under the supervision of a qualified judge or attorney to qualify for the bar exam without attending law school. The House rejected that move, voting 54-92 before backing the bill under the hammer. It was tabled in the Senate.
After initially taking up and rejecting an amended version of a bill (LD 301) that would allow the Public Utilities Commission to establish performance-based metrics and rate-adjustment mechanisms for a public utility, the House voted against the legislation that proponents said would help hold the state’s utilities accountable. (Read about a similar proposal last session).
The House also voted 97-18 against legislation (LD 1160) to prohibit ownership of 6% or more or control of a public utility by an entity providing aid to a foreign terrorist organization. Sponsor Rep. Nathan Carlow (R-Buxton) said it  “sends a clear message to America’s enemies” that “those systems are not for sale and they never will be.” However, Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport) said while well-intentioned, enforcement of the bill is “not feasible” as  what constitutes a terrorist organization is determined by federal law.
The House voted 109-33 to reject LD 160, which would eliminate REAL ID requirements in Maine. (Read more about the issue here).

The Healey administration announced it will not enforce minimum electric vehicle sales requirements for model years 2026 and 2027.
The post DEP delays electric vehicle sales requirements for two years appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE HEALEY administration said Friday it will not enforce minimum electric vehicle sales requirements for model years 2026 and 2027, administratively taking a step that lawmakers have repeated sought to force legislatively.Under the Advanced Clean Cars II regulation that Massachusetts adopted following California’s lead in 2023, vehicle manufacturers are supposed to produce and make available for sale a gradually-increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles starting at 35 percent in model year 2026, rising to 43 percent in model year 2027 and eventually hitting 100 percent in model year 2035 and beyond.The Department of Environmental Protection said Friday that it “will exercise enforcement discretion” for model years 2026 and 2027 and declared that “manufacturers shall not withhold internal combustion vehicles from car and truck dealerships seeking those vehicles.” MassDEP has similarly deferred enforcement of related minimum electric truck sales requirements.“EVs should be the most affordable and clean option for cars,” Gov. Maura Healey said. “We’re giving carmakers more runway to invest in their manufacturing and supply chains, which will help ensure customers have additional affordable electric vehicles options at dealerships in the future. Massachusetts will continue to invest in charging infrastructure to support the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.”Delaying implementation of the ACC II regulations has been a topic of amendments filed to the spending bills that have been moving between the House and Senate recently. This week, Millbury Sen. Michael Moore withdrew his budget amendment to delay implementation for two years but highlighted what he said would be devastating economic consequences of keeping the rules in place when both demand for electric vehicles and charging infrastructure lag previous expectations.“By enforcing this rule, manufacturers will have to artificially manipulate vehicle inventory to force more zero-emission vehicles into the state while reducing the number of gas-powered vehicles available,” Moore said. “Looking at last year, 280,000 new vehicles were sold in Massachusetts. To artificially meet the 35 percent threshold, there would have to be a reduction of 198,000 gas-powered vehicles, representing a $9 billion reduction in economic activity in Massachusetts.”Senate Minority Leader Bruce Tarr called for a two-year delay to the ACC II regulation Thursday afternoon in a speech on a Senate budget amendment that was ultimately sunk.“Number one, the electric grid is not ready to handle it. And number two, the demand for these vehicles has not proven to be as robust as we had hoped, and consumer uptake is not nearly where it would need to be to comply with those regulations,” he said.Environmental advocates slammed the MassDEP decision Friday. Environmental League of Massachusetts Legislative Director David Melly said the organization is “disappointed to see Massachusetts walk back its commitment to Advanced Clean Cars II, causing delays that will harm our communities and the environment.”“We know that timely progress on electrification of vehicles reduces both transportation emissions and healthcare costs. Our state leaders must step up to fill the gap this policy leaves behind, including firm commitments to expanding charging infrastructure statewide and addressing vehicle pollution in overburdened areas,” he said.Healey’s office said it will “soon announce dedicated additional grant funding for the purchase or lease of electric vehicles for publicly owned fleets, electric school buses, waste collection vehicles, and other vocational vehicles.” It also previewed an announcement related to “enhanced future grant funding opportunities for existing programs that support medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging, charging at multi-unit dwellings and educational campuses, charging at workplaces and for commercial fleets, and publicly accessible charging stations through the MassEVIP program.”The post DEP delays electric vehicle sales requirements for two years appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Electric-Chargers.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743

(Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)A patient whose ovaries were removed without her knowledge during colon surgery can sue the doctor who she says recommended the procedure, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled Friday.
In the opinion, five of the Court’s seven justices agreed that lower courts were correct when they refused to dismiss the patient’s lawsuit. With the ruling, the case is sent back to Rock County Circuit Court.
The patient, Melissa Hubbard, was being treated for endometriosis in 2018 by an obstetrician/gynecologist, Dr. Carol Neuman. During the time, Hubbard also was referred for surgery to remove a section of her colon.
The surgery was performed by Dr. Michael McGauley. During the procedure, Hubbard’s ovaries were removed, but she wasn’t told beforehand that would be part of the operation.
Hubbard initially sued McGauley, but that lawsuit was dismissed. She subsequently sued Neuman, charging that — without telling her — the OB/GYN had suggested to McGauley that he remove Hubbard’s ovaries during the colon surgery.
The lawsuit charges that when Neuman made the recommendation to McGauley, she violated Hubbard’s right to informed consent under Wisconsin law.
Neuman’s lawyers filed a motion in Rock County circuit court to dismiss the lawsuit on saying that, in the context of the surgery, Neuman was not Hubbard’s “treating physician” under the informed consent law. 

Neuman’s lawyer argued that because the state law’s informed consent requirement applies to the “treating physician,” Hubbard had no case against Neuman since she did not perform the surgery and she never gave a formal order to the surgeon to remove Hubbard’s ovaries.
The circuit court judge denied the dismissal motion, and the state 4th District Court of Appeals agreed.
With Friday’s opinion, the Wisconsin Supreme Court also denied the motion to dismiss the case.
“We disagree with Dr. Neuman,” Chief Justice Anne Walsh Bradley wrote on behalf of the majority. “The essence of the inquiry is whether Hubbard’s complaint sufficiently alleges that Dr. Neuman was a ‘physician who treat[ed]’ Hubbard, even though she did not actually remove Hubbard’s ovaries herself. We conclude that it does.” 
Bradley was joined in the majority by Justices Rebecca Dallet, Brian Hagedorn, Jill Karofsky and Janet Protasiewicz.
According to the opinion, the complaint depicts “Neuman’s intimate involvement with the removal of Hubbard’s ovaries” — first, diagnosing Hubbard with a severe case of endometriosis and then advising her to consider removing her left fallopian tube and ovary.
“Second, after Hubbard agreed to undergo colon surgery, Dr. Neuman allegedly helped plan the surgery with Dr. McGauley,” Walsh Bradley wrote. “The physicians’ pre-surgery discussions and plans included Dr. Neuman’s plan to attend and participate in Hubbard’s surgery and to remove Hubbard’s ovaries herself. Hubbard also alleges that Dr. Neuman recommended to Dr. McGauley that he remove Hubbard’s ovaries.”
Those allegations in the lawsuit are enough to consider Neuman a treating physician in the case, Walsh Bradley wrote.
Justice Annette Ziegler, joined by Justice Rebecca Bradley, disagreed. 
“To be a treating physician under [the informed consent statute], the physician needs to either provide the treatment at issue himself or formally order the treatment at issue,” Ziegler wrote, citing the text and history of the law along with “the decisions of courts across the country that have addressed who qualifies as a treating physician.”
While Hubbard never told Neuman she wanted her ovaries removed and never consented to their removal in the surgery, Ziegler wrote, “the complaint never expressly alleges, nor reasonably implies, that Dr. Neuman performed or participated in the surgery or attended the surgery.”

Wagers are not currently allowed on the website in Rhode Island, though state regulators are now considering letting vendors such as FanDuel operate in the state. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)A new report commissioned by the Rhode Island Lottery recommends the state should add four to six new online sports betting vendors to boost its competitiveness with its neighbors, but only if it makes itself more attractive to popular companies like DraftKings and FanDuel.
The report published by Spectrum Gaming Group on May 1 notes that there is no prohibition against increasing the number of authorized service providers beyond the one app currently managed by the gambling company that exclusively supplies the state’s lottery equipment and technology.
But when Rhode Island Lottery renewed its contract with International Game Technology (IGT) PLC to run the state’s digital sportsbook, it was with a clause that the company would have the exclusive rights to handle all digital wagers through November 2026.
State lawmakers have sought to end IGT’s monopoly of Rhode Island’s digital sportsbook, but such proposals were never going to head to the House floor this year.
“There is no need to adopt legislation this year because the state is under contract with the current vendor for another year,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in a statement to Rhode Island Current.
Rhode Island Lottery, however, is now starting to consider upping the number of apps beyond the existing Sportsbook RI. Director Mark Furcolo informed the legislative committee that oversees the state’s gambling sector on Monday that the lottery intends to issue a request for information (RFI) on the matter in early 2026.
“The purpose of the RFI is to gauge the level of interest in, and by which companies, providing a sports wagering product here and if not, why not,” Lottery spokesperson Paul Grimaldi said in an email.
But companies may not be fully interested in expanding to Rhode Island due to its 51% tax on operators’ revenues — which is tied with New York and New Hampshire for the steepest in the country. When the state inked IGT’s initial contract in 2018, it was the only bidder to respond to the lottery’s request for proposals.
Spectrum suggests the state lower the tax rate.
The report also recommends that the state allow online betting servers to be hosted outside of the state’s two existing casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton — where any company would have to pay a 17% hosting fee to Bally’s Corp. Such a change would require a constitutional change approved by Rhode Island voters. 
Spectrum’s recommendations come as legislators have introduced bills this year to open up the market beyond the single app managed by the gambling company that exclusively supplies the state’s lottery equipment and technology.
The companion bills by Rep. Matthew Dawson and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone would allow at least five sports betting vendors to open by July 1, 2026 — opening the door for companies such as DraftKings and FanDuel to take wagers in a state where they’ve been barred from doing so since the state first launched sports betting over five ago.
Sports bettors have one app in R.I. More may be on the way.

Ciccone’s bill received its initial hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Gaming, which he chairs, on April 30. Dawson’s bill was heard by the House Committee on Finance on May 1. Both were held for further study, as is standard for an initial vetting by a legislative panel.
“We need more competition,” Dawson, an East Providence Democrat, said in an interview. “If you have a monopoly, you have no reason to innovate.”
The state was the first New England state to legalize sports wagering in 2018, but neighboring Connecticut and Massachusetts have since entered the market and have only eaten away Rhode Island’s revenue.
Massachusetts, which launched online sports betting in March 2023, collected nearly $10.4 million in taxable revenue solely from wagers on the seven apps available there in just March of 2025. 
Connecticut, which has three sports betting vendors, brought in $21.4 million in tax revenue in fiscal year 2024.In the same time period, Rhode Island saw $19.2 million in sports betting revenue transferred to the state’s general fund.
“There’s a significant amount of tax revenue we’re not getting because we’ve decided we’re going to let one company run the whole thing,” Dawson said.
Fiscal notes on what Rhode Island could receive should it expand to five sports betting vendors have not been filed by the House and Senate. But Ciccone and Dawson point to Washington D.C., where wagers increased 172% in the last year after its Council approved expanding sports betting to additional platforms.
“That’s significant,” Ciccone, a Providence Democrat, said in an interview. “And with the problems we’re having, why not try to bring in more players and see what we can do?”
Ciccone was referring to the state’s TK deficit heading into the fiscal year starting July 1, 2026.
Along with additional revenue, Ciccone and Dawson argue that many users don’t like the existing Sportsbook RI app. Dawson told Rhode Island Current he knows several bettors who go to the McDonalds in Seekonk, Massachusetts to place bets from apps other than IGT’s.
Lack of promotions and bonuses have made up many negative online reviews users have left on App Store and Google Play. Ciccone said his friend, the late Senate President Ruggerio, also had issues with the limitations of IGT’s online sportsbook.
“He hated that app,” Ciccone recalled.
Shekarchi said he has never used the app, but that he has heard both positive and negative experiences from others who have used it.
IGT spokesperson Mike DeAngelis said the feedback the company receives tends to be positive.
“We work with the Lottery to ensure a great player experience with the Sportsbook RI app,” he said.

Political corruption has been our brand for a Long time – pun intended. There are few corners of the state that haven’t been touched by greed, envy and every other sticky finger of those in power.
This sordid history serves as the backdrop for what would be a very significant rewriting of Louisiana’s ethics laws, with Gov. Jeff Landry behind the pen.
In this episode of “The Light Switch,” senior reporter Julie O’Donoghue walks us through just a few of the changes being proposed. They include increasing the limits on gifts for elected officials and government employees, ranging from the governor down to your local building inspector.
Read Julie’s coverage of the ethics proposals lawmakers are considering:

Confidential complaints against elected officials, gov’t workers might be eliminated
Lawmakers might lift limits on gifts to officials, gov’t employees
As charges linger over Landry, Louisiana House votes to overhaul ethics investigations

Also weighing in on the ethics topic is Steven Procopio, president of the Public Affairs Research Council. The 75-year-old good government group doesn’t take stands on legislation, but its leader says he’s concerned about the possible changes in the works.
For our News from the States segment, we head to Indiana where there are changes in store for the naturalization ceremonies where new U.S. citizens take their citizenship oaths. Reporter Leslie Bonilla Muñiz with the Indiana Capital Chronicle explains how some traditions are being eliminated – and why.

At first, in the haze, they look like birds, perched on fence posts along the road. But they don’t shift or take flight, and there’s one on every post for as far as I can see. They are upside-down boots.

“I’m so grateful to the people who get up every day and do the work in the grueling and the awful conditions,” says Jozee Zuñiga, an environmental activist and the daughter of a man who worked in the oil fields. “But I want people to know that, yes, we depend on it. Yes, we need it. But that doesn’t mean we have to surrender.”

The road, Buck Jackson, cuts south through southeastern New Mexico, across the fields where companies are drilling for oil. I drive for almost three miles before I stop seeing boots above the sparse grasses and the thorned mesquite and the trash. A Chevron sign marks a plot of land beside them, and the heavy silhouettes of pump jacks and processing plants hover behind them. Bootheels point up to the sky.

The oil workers wore them. Then they retired and hung them up, or traveled to oil fields elsewhere and hung them up, or died, and their relatives and friends placed them there. On a black rubber boot, in white marker, someone wrote “6/13/20, R.I.P.” and a name that has worn away.
“6/13/20, R.I.P.” David Cox/Searchlight New Mexico
“They leave their memories there,” a former oil worker, who asks to go by the pseudonym Diego García, tells me. García, 36, is undergoing chemotherapy treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which he developed while cleaning sites contaminated with drilling waste. He’s worried that employers won’t hire him again if they learn he spoke to a journalist. “Some people leave pants, too.” He laughs.
I think about what the workers stood on when they wore the boots — rigs, spilled oil, tanks, truckbeds, caliche — and how many hours they wore them, during shifts that could span five straight days and nights, no sleep. These were hours of absence, when the workers were away from home, and the people who loved them couldn’t see them. And the fence becomes a fence between the fields and home.
Separating from the world
“A good day,” says Marcos Carranza, “is a day without danger.”
It’s 6:30 p.m. or so, November, at a house in the city of Hobbs, about an hour northeast through the fields from Buck Jackson. Two highways that lead to the worksites cross through town: State Road 18, north to south, and U.S. Route 62, west to east. Billboards for injury attorneys mark city boundaries. At night, the neon signs and floodlights of hotels and motels illuminate the highways. The parking lots are full of work trucks. The hotels are interspersed with smoke shops and restaurants and stores that advertise workboots and beer. Rows of houses, mostly brick with pitched roofs, line the quiet streets that stem from the highways.

The Carranza family’s front door is wide open, a rectangle glowing bright on the dark row of houses. The children and grandchildren of Carranza and his wife, María Elena, sit together on big couches beneath family photographs. The rich smells of rice and chicken with mole rise out of pots and pans on a table in the back of the room. Carranza is at the table, exhausted. He got home maybe 20 minutes ago from his job constructing pipelines for an oil company.
“A bad day is an excess of hours working and a lot of danger, because you can fall asleep driving, or on-site, and a machine hits you, and you can lose your life,” he says. (We’re talking in Spanish, which I use when interviewing most of the workers I meet.)
On previous jobs, Carranza says, he’s had to enter tanks where oil and natural gas are stored, to clean them. The containers are metal and round. They usually range in size from 10 feet tall and 12 feet wide to 30 feet tall and 15 feet wide. Even in bigger ones, it’s difficult not to feel claustrophobic inside. They contain hydrogen sulfide, a gas found in natural gas deposits. Exposure to low levels can cause nausea, headaches and insomnia. Exposure to high levels can cause memory loss and death.
“Sometimes when you wash the tanks, hydrogen sulfide is released, and when that happens, you can pass out,” Carranza says. “That would be a very bad day.”
Though he’s never passed out himself, he’s seen fellow workers collapse many times. Sometimes they survive falling into the liquid at the bottom of the tank. Sometimes they don’t.
Over the chatter of television news, Carranza’s children and grandchildren are teasing each other and arguing about politics. His voice mixes with theirs as he tells me about a slower, quieter toll the industry has exacted on him over the past 17 years. He’s 67 and technically retired, but he receives no employer-sponsored benefits, and the meager Social Security payment he gets — around $1,000 a month — isn’t enough to sustain his family. He’s continued to work for the oil and gas industry, at $16 an hour, 50 or 60 hours a week, because it’s “the economic activity of New Mexico,” he says.
The companies that have employed him haven’t consistently provided proper safety training or equipment, and the exposure to dangerous chemicals and loud machinery is gradually separating him from the world. He can’t smell the dinner María Elena prepared. He thinks it’s because he’s inhaled so much hydrogen sulfide, which can cause olfactory paralysis. He’s losing his vision, hearing and memory.
Because he’s losing his memory, he loses hours on the road. He’ll be driving somewhere and suddenly can’t remember why he’s there or where he’s going. He can’t drive María Elena to medical appointments because he has to work during the day. He turns his head to show me a golf ball–sized lump in his neck and says he’s not sure whether he’ll be fired when he asks for a day off to go to the doctor.
“The money that one earns, one pays a very steep price for,” he says. “There are times when I’ve felt depressed. You work so much, but it’s not worth it, because health can’t be bought. And there are irreversible effects, and you can’t be the same as before. As much as I want to think well, see well, I can’t now.”
Because of his disabilities, he can’t find other work. He’s so experienced at building pipelines that he can keep doing it despite the challenges he faces. No one else will hire him.
“There’s no alternative,” he says. “My back is against the wall.”

“Thank you, Chevron”
When I look out my car window at the gas flares leaping into the sky, I imagine the roar and snap of flames. According to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 60 percent of all workers in the “mining and oil and gas extraction” industry have been exposed to hazardous noise, and a quarter have difficulty hearing.

But on the dirt roads beside the flare stacks — the tall metal chimneys where gas is being burned off the crude oil so that it doesn’t explode — all I hear of the flames is a rush of heat through metal pipes. It’s hard to distinguish it from the whoosh of moving trucks, which you could pretend is the sound of the ocean that filled the Permian Basin hundreds of millions of years ago, were it not for the clank and rattle of equipment and the constant machine buzz.
The sea creatures and algae in the ancient ocean decomposed into the oil that a water-well driller found south of Carlsbad in 1901. Speculators began drilling throughout southeastern New Mexico. Nearly three decades later, in 1928 — with crews working 12-hour shifts and sleeping in bunkhouses full of rattlesnakes, and wooden rigs catching fire and burning to ash — they struck enough oil to start a boom. Within two years, 20,000 people flocked to Hobbs, according to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
New Mexico’s dependence on oil and gas revenue is historically high: Roughly 40 percent of the state’s general fund comes from fossil fuel production in the Permian Basin, in the state’s southeast corner, and in the San Juan Basin, in the northwest corner. Drilling in the San Juan has been slowing down, but the Permian, which covers roughly 86,000 square miles in eastern New Mexico and west Texas, is booming. It’s the most productive oil field in the United States. Almost half of all U.S. oil comes from the basin, and about a third of that comes from New Mexico. As a producer, the state is second only to Texas, which has a larger share of the resource.
In the counties of Lea, Eddy, Chaves, Otero and Roosevelt, New Mexico’s Permian covers around 13,000 square miles. When people fly over the region, they see a flat, mottled landscape with various small cities — Hobbs, Artesia, Carlsbad, Lovington — clumped around highways.
Throughout these communities, you can smell the hydrogen sulfide. People suffer from cancers, respiratory illnesses, chronic nosebleeds, headaches and thyroid problems — all conditions that have been associated with industry air pollution. Creosote and mesquite choke out native grasses. Among the creosote and the mesquite are old tires and beer bottles and Red Bull cans and broken pipes. Birds ingest toxins and have been seen falling dead out of trees and sky, and the noise and the floodlights interfere with animals’ circadian rhythms.
“They can’t sleep, they can’t eat properly, they can’t properly forage for food and they can’t reproduce,” says Charlie Barrett, a field ecologist and thermographer with Oilfield Witness, a nonprofit that uses infrared cameras to expose emission levels.

In Hobbs, there are pump jacks on signs and murals around town. In Carlsbad, Jozee Zuñiga, an environmental activist, tells me that representatives of the oil companies give children coloring books and tell them about how they protect animals in the fields. “The school I went to my last two years of high school has a ‘Thank you, Chevron’ on its sign because Chevron donated to fix the school’s labs,” she says.
She tells me that support for the industry drowns out any talk of workers’ conditions. At local boutiques, she sees hats that say “Rig Daddy” and shirts that say “Permian Proud.” She went to a feed store to pick up dog food and heard a man at the register shout at the cashier, “Drill, baby, drill!”
“It’s not only their livelihoods, but it’s the culture that they participate in,” she tells me. “If you speak out, or you go against the grain, you are considered a threat. And not just a threat to a company or a specific procedure or operation. People consider you a genuine threat to their personhood, their lives.”
Zuñiga’s father was a supervisor in the oil fields before he passed away in 2016. She still has his work number in her phone, and his work clothes and boots are in a closet. She describes herself as privileged, because his hours were somewhat regular, but he was always on call, even during vacations, and he woke up at three every morning to head for the job.
“I remember hearing him walk down the stairs,” she says. “And I remember being so excited some days coming home from school, because, from the road, I could see that his truck was already there, and he had come home early. But that was not all the time.” Some days, coming home, she still looks for his truck.
“I’m so grateful to the people who get up every day and do the work in the grueling and the awful conditions,” she says. “But I want people to know that, yes, we depend on it. Yes, we need it. But that doesn’t mean we have to surrender.”
Two million barrels a day
On the roads and at gas stations, there are workers everywhere. Trustworthy data on the size of the workforce is hard to find, however. Fossil fuel employees account for less than three percent of New Mexico’s total labor working population, according to the state’s Department of Workforce Solutions (NMDWS), but other estimates are much higher — closer to 10 percent. A study done by the University of New Mexico found that around half of oil and gas workers are Latino, but advocates in the Permian say that the number is probably much higher.
Jorge Estrada, a public relations coordinator at the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED), told me it would be “extremely difficult” to provide a complete list of oil and gas companies operating in New Mexico’s Permian, a claim reflected in state documents. Driving around the region, I pass dozens of company names on buildings and vehicles. In 2024, almost 400 fossil fuel companies were operating across the state, including Chevron, ConocoPhillips, EOG, Coterra and ExxonMobil, according to an annual production report from the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division. Together, these companies ramped up production from around 800,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 to a little over 2 million barrels per day in 2024.

Just how much oil money funds the state is in dispute. According to the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, in 2024, oil and gas brought in $13 billion in state and local revenue, $7.4 billion of which went to the general fund. Ismael Torres, chief economist of the New Mexico Legislative Finance Committee, says that at least $4.7 billion from the industry went to the general fund, though he noted that the figure could be higher. Either way, the money is used for public education and health and human services, among other state programs. But politicians and state officials, who receive large donations from fossil fuel companies, rarely acknowledge the toll the industry takes on workers.
Scanning thousands of pages of state legislation from the past 30 years, I found few mentions of the workers. I saw no bill that has as its sole aim bettering their workplace conditions, and no memorial acknowledging the costs of what they do — though I did find memorials honoring uranium workers and promoting safety in the mining industry.
Some bills contained sections intended to help fossil fuel workers transition to other industries, or to direct agencies to implement rules for their safety. Those didn’t pass. In the 2025 session of New Mexico’s legislature, the House signed a memorial recognizing “the oil and gas industry … for its vital contributions to the state” with no substantive mention of the workers. The office of Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declined my request for an interview. Grisham, alongside state lawmakers and political action committees, received roughly $800,000 from fossil fuel companies in 2023.
State agencies seem to be taking little action to protect workers. Estrada wrote that the NMED’s “primary attention is on maintaining the well-being and safeguarding of all employees or workers,” noting that New Mexico established a safety program in 2005 to “reduce fatalities and catastrophic events” and to enforce the New Mexico Occupational Safety and Health Act (NMOSHA) industry-wide.
“The potential for serious accidents, catastrophic accidents, and worksite fatalities has been recognized for the Oil and Gas Well Drilling and Servicing Industry,” says an official state notice announcing the program. “Statistical data shows this industry accounted for a far greater percentage of workplace fatalities and serious accidents in New Mexico than would be expected for such a relatively small workforce.”
The program aims to conduct 25 random, unannounced inspections per year, though they only did 23 last year. In a landscape of close to 400 companies, that number is hardly comprehensive. “It is not possible to keep an accurate or current universal listing of employers or their equipment,” the notice states.
Federal labor law has not been consistently enforced in the state — standards for overtime pay have not guaranteed that oil and gas workers will be justly compensated for working more than 40 hours per week. A federal investigation in 2014 found that companies owed upwards of 1,300 fossil fuel workers in New Mexico and west Texas at least $1.3 million in overtime. And the law sets no limits on how many hours employees may work.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who serves southern New Mexico, is trying to pass a bill that would require oil companies to compensate workers for respiratory and heat-related illnesses. “I’ve personally sat down at the dinner table with folks that have been working in the industry for 16 years and lost their job and were offered a $200 check with no medical care or compensation,” Vasquez tells me. “That is just outrageous to me, considering the record profits that oil and gas companies are making.”
The pushers
Fossil fuel companies in the Permian are private operations that lease drilling rights on both public and private land. “No Trespassing” signs are posted everywhere to mark off worksites, and environmentalists documenting pollution told me stories about workers chasing them away from well pads.
My attempts to visit worksites and “man camps” — rows of mobile homes where companies house employees, with as many as 20 people reportedly crammed into a single trailer — got nowhere. Using state documents, I contacted 40 companies listed as producing large amounts of oil in the region. Three smaller companies politely declined what one secretary described as “the opportunity.” The others didn’t respond. So I learned about the labor conditions by talking to workers off-site, in parks, restaurants, homes and over the phone.
During one call, a former oil field worker named Félix Rodríguez tells me that many workers receive no safety training and have to provide their own safety equipment. He began building tank batteries — collections of tanks that store crude oil before it gets processed — when he was 19. But he quit a year in, after witnessing an explosion. He’s now an organizer at the Roswell chapter of Somos un Pueblo Unido, a statewide workers’ rights organization headquartered in Santa Fe.
Small companies are “trying to cut costs at all times,” he says, while big companies will often contract with small ones, going for the “cheapest bidder” and not “batting an eye at the working conditions.” The small business Rodríguez worked for — which built both tank batteries and flare stacks — provided him with a hard hat. He and his fellow workers had to buy all other safety gear, including glasses and monitors that record hydrogen sulfide levels. The company appointed him safety manager, he says, because he speaks Spanish and English, but he had no training. “If I didn’t have any training, and I’m training these people to be safe, how safe is it?”

The state does not appear to have a reliable method for tracking worker deaths. The NMED told me that five workers died in oil and gas extraction and support industries in 2022. The count is less than half of what the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) reported: 11 deaths that year. The agencies are consulting different databases — the NMED count is based on reporting by employers, while the NMDOH count comes from the data an occupational health surveillance team compiled using the department’s vital records. Neither includes deaths that were caused by labor conditions and occurred after workers left the fields: fatalities connected to the long hours, grueling effort and diseases developed from exposure to toxic chemicals.
Even if it were possible to resolve the discrepancy between the different counts, the numbers would probably still be incomplete. “Sometimes, companies cover these things up because it saves them a lot of money,” Marcos Carranza says.
Even so, by sifting through 20 years of investigations conducted by the New Mexico Occupational Safety and Health Bureau, I found disproportionately high numbers of accidents in the oil and gas industry, compared to other industries in New Mexico. In 2022, for instance, slightly less than half the accidents described in the bureau’s investigations for that year involved activities in the oil fields.
The summaries listed at the top of the investigations were blunt descriptions of workplace accidents: “employee is killed when struck by pressurized air and sand”; “employee is killed when struck by falling support beams”; “employee is burned when hydrogen sulfide gas ignites”; “employee thrown from oil well rig platform and is killed”; “employee is killed by explosion while gauging levels of crude oil”; “three employees are killed when oil tank explodes”; “employee sustains burns when sprayed with sodium hydroxide”; “employee dies from a 90 foot fall”; “drill field worker is crushed and killed under truck”; and “employee is struck and killed by flying material.” There were dozens more.
One man I interview, who asks to go by the pseudonym Juan Campos for fear of retaliation, shows me one of his hands, which he can’t close into a fist. He injured it on a shift in the 1980s while facing pressure from supervisors. He and other workers call the supervisors “pushers.” He says one pusher forced him to approach a tire that was filling up with air while he was carrying a lighter, and the flame ignited the air. The explosion knocked him to the ground. “If the pusher didn’t pressure you,” he says, “there would never be accidents.”
“We experience disillusionment, impotence and anger”
The harm the industry inflicts on workers goes beyond violent accidents. “If it’s not a full-on explosion, it’s rarely talked about,” Rodríguez says. “This is an industry where you have to be a macho man and have to work hard to succeed. Mental health is downplayed.”
Workers and their loved ones suffer from depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress. According to a 2023 CDC report on 2021 suicide rates by industry and occupation, workers in “oil and gas extraction and support activities for mining” experience one of the highest rates of suicide of any labor force in the country: 73.9 per 100,000, which is more than double the overall rate in the civilian non-instutionalized working population. Daniel Radabaugh, a chief operations officer at a national pipeline company called Xccelerated Construction Unlimited, has estimated that workers’ mental health challenges cost the oil and gas industry $200 billion a year due to high turnover and reduced productivity.
A recent survey of 126 workers in the New Mexico Permian — conducted by political scientists at the University of New Mexico Center for Social Policy — found that they often struggle with substance use disorder and mental health issues. The study reports that workers experience loneliness and exhaustion, often having to sleep through their days off. One woman described her husband becoming “really skinny” and “drying up” because of exposure to the chemicals required for extraction. “Those tanks are like death,” she told the researchers. “We experience disillusionment, impotence and anger because we are completely hopeless.” Close to 80 percent of the oil field employees surveyed didn’t want their children to work in oil and gas.
Maria Romano, a lead organizer at the Hobbs chapter of Somos un Pueblo Unido, says she’s observed workers turning to drugs and alcohol for relief. Campos lost several friends — fellow oil workers — to cirrhosis, and he suspects it’s because they drank so much. While building flare stacks, Félix Rodríguez once found himself 50 feet in the air with a coworker who wasn’t safely hooked to any part of the structure, and who was high on cocaine.

Romano also describes “a lot of disintegration of the family, many divorces.” She says that her ex-husband — who she divorced 20 years ago — worked in the oil fields when they were married, putting in such long hours that her daughter asked whether he lived in the same house with them. “When he got home, she was already asleep,” she says. “And when he left for work, she was asleep.” The girl’s teachers assumed Romano was a single mother.
Another organizer, Gladys Resendes, who’s currently married to an oil worker, says, “When my children have a problem, they go to me, because he’s never there.” Rodríguez says that most of his coworkers were divorced “at least once.”
Workers often say they choose the industry for the money. Annual mean wages range from around $50,000 to $77,000, according to 2023 estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These wages are significantly higher than New Mexicans’ per capita median income between 2019 and 2023, which was $34,823. According to the UNM survey, though, 20 percent of workers who responded were making less than $25,000 a year. More than half didn’t have health insurance, and nearly half reported experiencing accidents on the job. Eighty five percent of those who experienced an accident said they felt it could have been prevented.
Workers I talked to laughed when I asked whether companies provide access to mental health professionals. Community organizers told me that workers tend to be closed off to conversations about the emotional challenges they endure.
Many belong to a population statistically less likely to receive treatment for mental health, for reasons of stigma, racial and anti-immigrant discrimination and poverty. The majority of those who work in the fields are male, and research has shown that men in the U.S. are less likely to seek mental healthcare and more likely to struggle to express emotion. The rate of suicide among men is four times that of women. Studies indicate that Latinos in the U.S. — a significant portion of the state fossil fuel workforce — receive mental health treatment at roughly a 25 percent lower rate than the average population. Several of the workers are undocumented, which makes them vulnerable to exploitation by their employers and less likely to have reliable access to any medical care.
“No one else is going to do the work they do,” Romano says.
Usually workers are too afraid of being deported or losing their jobs to consider approaching attorneys, advocates or therapists if they experience abuse. “A lot of people feel very uncomfortable even reporting an accident,” Rodríguez says. One worker he knew ended up in a coma for two weeks, with fourth-degree burns, after an oil tank he was cleaning exploded. The company paid the hospital bill and gave him $35 in compensation. He stayed on because he couldn’t find work elsewhere. “He’s undocumented,” says Rodríguez. “He can’t really fight it.”
To make matters more precarious, the future of the industry is not stable, even with President Trump’s promise to boost production. Economists predict that drilling won’t increase dramatically in New Mexico in the years ahead. And the president’s stances aren’t consistent — he promises to expand drilling, and he also promises to deport the undocumented people who do most of the work. “Donald Trump wants to ‘drill, baby, drill,’” Rodríguez says, but “you’re not going to be able to without the immigrants.”
The threats of deportation and state violence are likely to intensify the pain workers already endure: studies demonstrate that anti-immigrant policies lead to higher rates of depression, anxiety and PTSD among undocumented immigrants. ICE has reportedly been arresting and disappearing people from around New Mexico, including the Permian, but their identities and whereabouts are unknown. Advocates predict that undocumented oil field workers will not be safe from ICE raids, despite the industry’s power.
Uncertainty stems from the positions of New Mexico’s state government, too, as officials discuss a possible turn to green energy and to a new reliance on permanent fund investments. Workers fear they’ll be left without jobs. “Whenever the time does come that oil and gas is shut down — the boom is no longer booming — we need to be able to have an education to be able to transfer to new jobs,” Rodríguez says.

A pain too severe
U.S. 285, one of the highways that runs through the Permian — Roswell to Artesia to Carlsbad, all the way down to Sanderson, Texas — is known as the “highway of death.” In the heavy traffic of oil industry vehicles, exhausted drivers lose their grip on the wheel, drift across the road and crash. “There was an accident almost every single day that we drove there,” Rodríguez says.
Then there are the state and county roads that lead to the drilling sites — NM 128, for instance — and have only two lanes. Workers often get stuck behind long lines of trucks they can’t safely pass, so even when a workday is over, they have to spend hours waiting to get home — to their houses in Hobbs or Carlsbad, or to the man camps throughout the region.
The man calling himself Diego García tells me that he worked such long hours that he lived on the oil fields in his truck for two and a half years. For $23 an hour, he hauled soil — contaminated by chemicals from fracking and drilling — away from work sites to waste sites off 285 and 128, replacing it with new soil and a cleaning agent.
“I don’t know the names of the chemicals, but they’re chemicals so strong that you don’t need to inhale them close-up for them to contaminate you,” he says. “We worked hard to get rid of the contamination quickly because we knew the wind carries it and spreads sickness.”
The soil he cleaned probably contained radionuclides — radioactive forms of elements, found deep inside rock, which are dredged up during the drilling process.
For months, García and his team worked 10-hour days, waking at 4 a.m. His body adapted to the schedule so that he’d wake at 4 even on days off. But the hours could “grow longer.” There would be a site that required immediate remediation, and the supervisors would push workers to go five days and nights straight, without sleep, “working, working, working.” They agreed to the jobs, no matter the schedule, out of fear that companies would fire them if they said no or set limits.
Accidents occurred regularly. Sometimes workers were burned by chemicals or gas, or they lost limbs to heavy machinery. “One slip-up and there goes an arm or a leg,” García says. Sometimes the machinery blew up. “I watched machines catch fire,” he says.
The men had to eat on the job, often canned soup they’d packed in their trucks. The wind blew chemicals into their food and ruined it. Many downed Red Bulls or Monsters to stay awake. García preferred coffee or cold water. When the weather was bitter, they heated drinking water by turning on their trucks and placing bottles beside the engines.

García endured the long hours by listening to music — Vicente Fernández, Los Temerarios, sometimes Christian songs — and by taking care of his team members, just as they took care of him. The hardest times were in the middle of the night, when their bodies bent toward sleep, or the middle of the day, when the sun burned over them. “We’d say to each other, ‘I can’t bear it now, I need to sleep a little while,’” he says. Then, as one man slept for an hour or so, the others would look out for supervisors, who docked pay for sleeping. “We always covered each other’s backs.”
On the road to a job, García sometimes passed workers who’d parked in the desert to get drunk. He laughs when I ask whether the men talked about their feelings. That kind of talk, he says, would be “rare.”
“We chatted about the funny things, so we wouldn’t cry at the wheel,” he says. “Yes, one carries one’s things from work, but one buries them in the truck cab.”
One day at dawn on a worksite in the desert, after years of these irregular schedules, García felt a pain in his stomach so sharp he had to lie down in his truck. He woke up at two or three the next morning and got back to work, but the pain returned.
“It was a pain too severe,” he says. It brought him to his knees. He couldn’t stand. His friends drove him to a hospital, where doctors diagnosed him with ALL. Around two-thirds of ALL cases occur in children. When it shows up in adults, it tends to affect people over 50. García is 36. Patients are known to develop ALL after being exposed to high levels of radiation. García was responsible for clearing waste that was probably full of radionuclides.
Two other men García worked with got sick, though he doesn’t know the names of their illnesses. Much of the money they earned had to be spent on treatments. García did not ask his company for compensation, nor did they offer any. His family and friends have supported him through chemotherapy.
People choose to do the work “to get ahead,” he says. “But it brought me equal consequence, because with so many chemicals — well, look.” He motions to himself. During chemo, he lost his eyebrows, hair and beard. He says he recently passed good friends in a grocery store aisle, and they didn’t recognize him.
I ask whether he’d hung his boot on a fence post along Buck Jackson Road.
“No,” he laughs, “because I want to return to work!”
“A price that’s too high”
It was late January 2022, cold enough that ice glazed the roads. César Gómez, who was in his mid-thirties, had worked every night, maintaining wells and rigs from sundown to sunrise — sometimes past sunrise — for two and a half months. One sunrise, he was riding toward rest in a truck cab. But the driver hit ice, and the truck skidded across the road and rolled. Gómez was thrown through the windshield, shattering his spine and his foot. He woke up from a coma two weeks later in a hospital in El Paso.
“‘Work,’ ‘company,’ ‘accident,’ ‘lawyer’ and ‘money’: These are the five words that most people think about in this field,” Gómez tells me. With each word, he waves a finger. When I ask if he received compensation from the company, he issues a dry and hollow laugh. Then he nods. “It doesn’t matter the quantity of money I receive,” he says. “It won’t give me back my normal life.”
He’s wearing a T-shirt that says “Fatherhood.” We’re talking in a back office of Somos un Pueblo Unido. Sitting in a little swiveling office chair beside gray filing cabinets and newspaper clippings and succulents, he tells me about the other workplace, “el campo petrolero,” which feels distant but is all around us. He started working on rigs 12 years ago, when he was 24, for “more money, a better life — something like that.” There were no regular hours and no guaranteed holidays. He made $16 or $17 per hour. His day shifts, including driving time, could run from 3:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. His night shifts, including driving time, could go from 5:30 p.m. to 7 a.m.
“Working at night is super, super tiring, stressful,” he says. “It’s a sensation that I don’t know how to describe. But it’s ugly. Because, first of all, you’re not in your five senses. You’re sleepy, you’re cold.”
Supervisors blamed workers for accidents. “At work, they’d mention that someone had an accident, someone died, someone crashed,” he said. “We’re not indispensable to anyone. We’re only a machine to make money for the boss.”

As we talk, he rubs his legs to ease the pain in his back. He shows me an X-ray of his spine, which is full of metal pegs, and he looks at a photograph of his face, bruised and swollen and full of tubes, from when he was in a coma. “I’m talking without crying because I’m trying to hide it. But, obviously, I’m unwell, physically and mentally,” he says. “I don’t like talking about this subject. It sends me back in time.”
Gómez says his personality has changed. He can’t lift more than five pounds and isn’t sure if he’ll ever be able to work full-time again. He’s afraid of driving, especially in rain or snow, and he’s in so much pain all the time, in any position, that it’s nearly impossible to sleep. When he does sleep, he has nightmares. He forgets information and events from one day to the next. “For example, today, in this moment, I’m talking to you,” he says. “Tomorrow I won’t be able to remember parts of our conversation.”
His marriage is falling apart. He blames the accident and his resulting despair. As part of the compensation he received from the company, he meets weekly with a psychologist, and he’s been trying to talk about his marriage, but the psychologist says that he’s not interested in talking about relationships. He’s not a couples therapist, he tells him, he’s a psychologist of accidents and violent trauma. Gómez’s claims adjuster won’t respond to his messages.
“The accident damaged my mind most,” he says.
To help himself think less about his stress and his pain, he cuts other oil workers’ hair, listening to their problems and advising them. The week before we talked, he gave a haircut to a man who has to work Monday through Sunday with no days off. The man’s wife is struggling with his absence and has threatened to leave if he can’t spend more time with their family. He asked his supervisor for a weekend. His supervisor said no. “I’m at the point of losing my family, my wife, because I’m working so much,” he told Gómez. Gómez told him to look for another job, one with a set schedule, Monday to Friday.
“I would give everything — everything, everything, everything — to be well,” Gómez says. “If I could turn back time — obviously, I can’t — but if I could, I think I’d like a job in a shop. I don’t know. But I would never return to the oil fields.”
He imagines walking through the fields, telling the workers to be careful, to leave.
“It’s not worth it,” he says. “You pay a price that’s too high.”

“That’s good news,” said Walthall County Emergency Director Royce McKee on Friday, over two months since the storms hit. “Everybody will be happy we can start picking up the debris. People will start to see the light at the end of tunnel.”
The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency said it didn’t know yet how much money would come to the state. MEMA did confirm that the federal government would cover 100% of costs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Individual Assistance aid — a program that sends direct payments to those affected by the storms — and 75% of costs for FEMA’s Public Assistance, which pays for repairs to public infrastructure. The state and local governments will split the remaining those costs.
The 11 counties that qualified for Individual Assistance are: Covington, Grenada, Issaquena, Itawamba, Jefferson Davis, Leflore, Marion, Montgomery, Pike, Smith and Walthall. The 17 counties that qualified for Public Assistance are: Calhoun, Carroll, Covington, Grenada, Humphreys, Issaquena, Itawamba, Jefferson Davis, Lee, Leflore, Marion, Pike, Prentiss, Sharkey, Smith, Walthall and Washington.

Residents impacted by the storms can apply for assistance through this online portal, by calling 1-800-621-3362, or on FEMA’s mobile app. 
The March storms killed seven Mississippians and injured dozens of others, while damaging nearly a thousand homes, according to MEMA’s tally. Of those homes, the storms destroyed 164, and left another 204 with “major damage,” which usually means a home is no longer habitable. 
In Walthall County, McKee said over 100 homes were destroyed or received major damage. The biggest priority with FEMA’s support, he said, is taking care of displaced residents who are either living in hotels or staying with family.
“We’re a poor county and have a lot of people that don’t have insurance,” McKee said. “It’ll be leaps and bounds for them trying to get back to normal.”
Starting next week, FEMA will have in-person stations in Mississippi to enroll storm victims in assistance programs. MEMA Director of External Affairs Scott Simmons said the state agency will soon make information on those locations available on its website.
In Leflore County, where the storms damaged 314 homes, Emergency Director Fred Randle said it took a while for insurance companies to reach some places, and even then there were “a lot” of costs that insurance didn’t cover. 
“We had a lot of people (where) it was two weeks before the insurance adjuster could get out and check their home because there was so much damage everywhere,” Randle said, adding that while it was nerve-wracking waiting over two months for the decision on FEMA aid, it was good news to receive going into the holiday weekend. “It’ll help us tremendously. Something to help celebrate.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/17152739/Tylertown-tornado-damage-16.jpg,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 20:09:19+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT nursing home, group home strikes called off after deal reached",Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/ct-nursing-home-strike-called-off/,The SEIU 1199 president said a deal reached with the Lamont administration involved ‘meaningful progress on a pathway to $30’ per hour.,"The state’s largest health care workers’ union reached a last-minute deal Friday with Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration to avert strikes set to begin Tuesday that would have involved more than 6,400 caregivers at 51 nursing homes and 193 group homes for people with disabilities.
The president of SEIU 1199NE, Rob Baril, confirmed Friday afternoon that union leaders and worker representative committees had endorsed the package negotiated late Thursday night and early Friday morning with the administration.
Full details weren’t available Friday afternoon, but Baril said, “We did make meaningful progress on a pathway to $30,” referring to the union’s objective of boosting nursing home worker hourly pay — which currently ranges from $18 to $22 for most staff — to $30 within the next few years.
Group home workers also “move ahead in a way that is important and meaningful,” he said.
The deal also includes a state investment of $164 million over the next three fiscal years combined in nursing facilities and $149 million over the next two in group homes, Baril said.
“The workers in our nursing homes and group homes provide critical support and care to our most vulnerable residents, and in doing so deserve salaries that reflect their dedicated work,” Lamont said. “I am proud to reach an agreement that provides workers with a significant increase in their compensation for the next several years while also addressing the workforce crisis facing many of our nursing and group homes.”
Baril said he realized that negotiations were challenging for state officials, given that Congress is eyeing hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid and other programs, which could cost Connecticut huge amounts of aid from Washington.
Though the work stoppage planned for Tuesday morning is on hold, several more steps need to be accomplished, given that caregivers have been working under contracts that expired back in March.
Lamont and the General Assembly must approve a new two-year state budget that includes the Medicaid payments needed to implement this deal. The governor and legislative leaders are optimistic about wrapping up a new budget before the regular 2025 session ends on June 4.
And private nursing and group homeowners, who receive the bulk of their funding from the state, still must negotiate wage and benefit agreements with SEIU 1199NE. Baril estimated that process will require at least several more weeks.
Matthew Barrett, president and CEO of the Connecticut Association of Health Care Facilities, the state’s largest nursing home coalition, praised Lamont and union leadership for averting a work stoppage.
“A nursing home strike, which at its core separates caregivers from residents, is nothing short of harmful, traumatic and costly as was the case in 2001, when 40 homes went on strike and it was a full month before all the striking workers were back delivering care,” he said. “All parties who had a stake in this year’s strike threat, especially the nursing home residents and their caregivers, can rest easier tonight because of today’s announcement.” 
Gian-Carl Casa, who heads the CT Community Nonprofit Alliance, which represents group homes, said, “We’re relieved that a strike has been averted.”
But Casa added, “The fact remains that nonprofits of all types have problems attracting and retaining staff” and that the ultimate success of any state agreement with the union hinges on proper funding of human services. 
Both nursing homes and nonprofit social service agencies have struggled for more than a decade with state payments that haven’t kept pace with inflation.
And while state government has run up huge surpluses in the past seven years — an annual average of $1.8 billion, and is on pace for a $2.4 billion cushion equal to 10% of the General Fund this year — controversial budget caps limit investments in human services, education, early childhood development, municipal aid and other core programs.
Some legislators have said they expect that any agreement with the health care workers’ union would offer limited funding next fiscal year, which begins July 1, and then include greater funding two years out or later.
The upcoming fiscal year will be Connecticut’s first since 2021 that the state did not have access to billions of dollars in emergency federal pandemic aid — resources it could spend outside of budget caps to supplement core programs.
Further complicating matters, additional state investments in nursing and group homes can’t be focused solely on facilities with unionized staff. Many homes employ non-union staff.
The nursing home industry has challenged the legalities of past proposals to focus funds disproportionately.
“Nursing home operators will need to learn more about any proposal that would include any feature favoring compensation and benefits to union employees versus non-union employees,” Barrett added. “It is a well-settled issue that providing public Medicaid dollars to benefit only unionized employees is discriminatory on its face and violates federal law, and this would put hundreds of millions of Connecticut’s Medicaid resources at risk.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GROUP-HOMES-STRIKE-0515-SR-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 17:07:34.986743

Photo by Neal Goswami/VTDiggerWINOOSKI — Members of the teachers’ union have called for the removal of a Winooski High School principal, citing a recent staff survey and vote of no confidence.Ninety percent of the licensed staff at the high school participated in a survey conducted by the Winooski Education Association and voted 29-2 indicating a lack of trust in Co-Principal Jean Berthiaume’s leadership, according to union leaders.Two union leaders announced the survey and the subsequent vote of no confidence at the May 14 school board meeting and demanded “drastic action.”The survey data does not represent “a passing discomfort” or “a vocal minority,” said John McKelvy, secretary of the Winooski Education Association, reading from a prepared statement on behalf of Jacie Barber, the union president. “Rather, they respond to ever unfolding transgressions, a deterioration of trust and an undermining of systems.”The overwhelming vote further indicates that the relationship between Berthiaume and the high school staff is “irrevocably broken,” he added, in a way that “no amount of restructuring, reassignment of duties or new titles” can fix.The survey was supported by the Vermont-National Education Association. Data was collected anonymously, and questions were modeled on the state Agency of Education standards by which the principal is evaluated, said Annie Schneider, vice president of the Winooski Education Association, who spoke at the meeting on behalf of the high school staff.When presented with this data, she said members said the only way forward is for Berthiaume to be removed as the high school principal. She said staff members responded firmly in the negative to the question: Do you have confidence that Jean Berthiaume can be an effective leader of Winooski High School?“Today I’m telling you very clearly that this vote represents the voices of the overwhelming majority — 29-2 is definitive. We have no confidence in our administrator and our ask is that he no longer works here,” Schneider said, reading from a prepared statement. “We are not here to cause unnecessary harm or pain to our principal, but he has caused harm to our staff and our school, and we are asking you, the board, to step in and help rectify the situation.” Union leaders did not present the full survey and declined to comment beyond the statements read at the meeting. They said in their speeches the union first raised concerns with former superintendent Sean McMannon in June 2022, but they were never addressed. McMannon did not respond to an email seeking comment.The two statements read at the meeting also spoke of continued issues, including low morale, challenging working conditions, a breakdown of systems and negative outcomes for students and staff.Berthiaume, who was recognized by the Vermont Principals’ Association as one of the 2024-25 school leaders of the year, said in an email to VTDigger this week that he was “surprised and blindsided by this vote, especially given the lack of any substantive concerns or feedback tied directly to my job performance.”Berthiaume was previously principal at Fayston Elementary School and associate principal at Harwood Union Middle School and High School. He was hired in Winooski in July 2019 and draws a salary of $127,920, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria.As co-principal at Winooski Middle and High School, Berthiaume shares the position with Kate Grodin. Grodin did not respond to a request for comment.Robert Millar, chair of the six-member Winooski School Board, read a statement at the meeting submitted by high school teacher Ben Patrick in support of Berthiaume’s leadership. Patrick’s letter called Berthiaume “a skilled, compassionate and versatile administrator” and “an invaluable resource and advocate for students.” He alleged “a counterproductive herd mentality” led to the survey and vote, and he urged the board to be “wary” of charges made against the principal.For years Winooski has struggled with unmet critical learning goals, and Patrick’s letter stated he has seen how that frustration has often been unfairly directed at the administration.“We share a collective responsibility for our inability to fully prepare students for life after high school, and blaming one individual for these systemic challenges is a misdirection,” the letter stated.Chavarria wrote in an email to VTDigger he is unable to comment on personnel issues. He shared the two statements submitted by the union to the School Board. The School Board, via a brief emailed statement, said they appreciate staff feedback but made clear that it is the superintendent who is responsible for the hiring and evaluation of administrative roles in the school system. The three-sentence statement does not address the vote nor the union’s demand. It ends saying, “The Board is confident that all policies and procedures have been followed appropriately to date.”In his email, Chavarria urged the matter be handled with “care and consideration.”“They are all my staff, teachers and admin and they all work so hard,” he wrote.Berthiaume wrote in his email, “Leadership requires making tough decisions, many of which are not always popular in the short term. Still, I am proud and stand by the progress we’ve made. There are clear indicators of success in our students’ experiences and outcomes, and I remain committed to the work ahead.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Winooski teachers’ union calls for removal of high school principal, citing no-confidence vote.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Winooski-High-School-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 16:05:10.752486

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Attorney General Marty Jackley shared Friday that the new immigration enforcement agreement he aims to enter into with federal authorities is the same type Gov. Larry Rhoden aims for, but said his agents will only use that authority in limited circumstances.
The agreements let officials trained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) ask people about their immigration status and make warrantless arrests for suspected violations.
Jackley’s requested agreement between ICE and the state Division of Criminal Investigation is limited in scope, however, he said in a Friday press release. 
 “To be clear, I am restricting the use of this federal authority to violent criminals and drug dealers,” Jackley said. 
Governor, attorney general visit the border and seek a bigger immigration enforcement role

Jackley first announced his intent to pursue the agreement during a news conference this week with Republican attorneys general at the U.S.-Mexico border. At the time, the type of agreement was not specified.
The news came via the release of Jackley’s proposed agreement, which operates under Jackley’s direction. ICE had not yet signed the shared agreement signed stateside byDCI Director Dan Satterlee.
ICE offers three types of agreements under Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.  One, the Jail Enforcement Model, lets trained jailers ask those in their custody about their immigration status, and lets those jailers search ICE databases and issue immigration detention orders.  
Another trains local jail staff as ICE Warrant Service Officers, allowing  them to serve  immigration warrants obtained from a judge by ICE officers to inmates already in local custody. Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead and Hughes County Sheriff Patrick Callahan both made those types of agreements earlier this spring. 
The third type of agreement offers the broadest scope of authority to local officers. The Task Force Model trains locals who work outside detention centers to act as limited immigration agents, enabling them to ask those they encounter in the normal course of police business about their immigration status, and to arrest them if they’re suspected of violating immigration law. The Obama administration discontinued the type in 2012 due to concerns about racial profiling and civil rights violations. They were revived by the Trump administration earlier this year.
Jackley and Rhoden, both Republicans and potential 2026 gubernatorial candidates, have characterized their support for the agreements as moves showing them to be in lockstep with President Trump’s immigration policies.
While Jackley said in a press release that his agents would use their immigration enforcement authority in limited situations, Rhoden spokeswoman Josie Harms would not expand upon the scenarios under which state troopers would use their authority once an agreement is in place for the highway patrol.
Taneeza Islam, CEO of South Dakota Voices for Peace, said the general message will make victims of labor and sex trafficking less likely to come forward, and lets perpetrators threaten to turn their victims in for deportation if they attempt to flee.
“You have legal protections if you come forward, but victims don’t know that,” Islam said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Drought is starting to creep back into Utah on the heels of an average winter, with long-term forecasts pointing to an abnormally hot summer. 
According to the three month seasonal outlook from the National Weather Service, the Beehive State is expected to have above average temperatures through August. Meanwhile, the service says it’s unclear whether there will be above or below average precipitation this summer — according to its models, there’s an equal chance of both. 
“Hotter doesn’t always mean drier. We are right now showing for most of the state at about equal chances of average precipitation,” said Joel Williams, deputy director of the Utah Division of Water Resources, speaking to lawmakers earlier this week.

Those three month outlooks are not an exact science — but they do come amid increasingly bleak water conditions for much of the state. Despite an average snow year for northern Utah, the southern regions had a “dismal” winter, Williams said. 
The snowpack for some basins in the southwest veered into unprecedented territory this winter and according to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, much of southern Utah remained below 45% of normal moisture. 
And across the state, drought is starting to rear its head again after two good years. This time last year, about 25% of the state was considered abnormally dry, while just 0.2% was in moderate drought — now, 39% of Utah is in severe drought, with 3% in extreme drought, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.

Just the high elevation areas of Utah, Salt Lake, Wasatch, Summit and Morgan counties, and a sliver of Box Elder County, are in the clear. The rest of the state is facing at least abnormally dry conditions. 
Most of Washington County is in extreme drought, extending into parts of Iron County. And Tooele, Juab, Millard, Beaver, Iron, Kane, Garfield, San Juan, Grand and Uintah counties all have areas in severe drought. 
“The last two years of above average snowpack helped us but now we’re starting to see the drought creep back in. And as we say in Utah, we’re either in drought or preparing for the next one,” Williams said. 
Those conditions led Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to issue a drought-related emergency declaration, giving farmers in the state access to low-interest loans to help weather the dry conditions. 
Eligible farmers can apply for seven-year loans of up to $100,000 each, with two years of no interest and 2.75% interest thereafter, according to the department. Applications for the loans will be accepted until Oct. 23. 
The good news, Williams said, is Utah’s reservoirs are in healthy shape. Across the state, reservoir levels are about 20% higher than normal, with nearly every reservoir in northern Utah above 80% capacity. Utah Lake, Strawberry, Jordanelle, Deer Creek, Rockport, Smith and Morehouse, Pineview and Starvation reservoirs are all around 95% or higher. 
“Those full reservoirs that we have, those could really help us if we’re heading into another drought,” said Williams.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050725_Provo-River-Delta_16-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 16:05:10.752486

Gretchen Whitmer's Fiscal year 2026 budget recommendations on Feb. 19, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonDownsizing and mass job cuts put forth by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have already hampered public health officials in Michigan, Department of Health and Human Services Director Elizabeth Hertel declared in court filings earlier this month.
Kennedy announced in March that his department would be working to eliminate 20,000 total employees, consolidating DHHS’s 28 divisions into 15 and closing half of its regional offices. 
However, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and 19 other attorneys general took action, arguing these cuts would functionally dismantle the DHHS, leaving it unable to do its job, with Nessel warning the decision could bring “immeasurable harm” to the nation and healthcare if the courts do not step in. 
A federal judge has since blocked the Trump Administration from issuing further job cuts and reorganizing the Executive Department until a lawsuit brought by a collection of government workers’ and healthcare workers unions is resolved.
As part of these cuts, the DHHS is eliminating roughly 3,500 employees at the Food and Drug Administration, 2,400 at the Centers for Disease Control, 1,200 at the National Institutes of Health and 300 at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.

HHS Dismantling_Hertel Decl as filed_5.9.25 
In a declaration filed as part of the case, Hertel detailed how the reduction of staff and closure of several labs at the CDC alongside cuts at the FDA are hindering the state’s work on disease testing, public health and tobacco monitoring. 
While the Michigan Department of Health and Human services runs its own Bureau of Laboratories, which is enmeshed with labs operated by the CDC and other states’ public health agencies, the CDC’s lab closures and staffing cuts have left states to fill the gaps. 
The Bureau was directly impacted by the closure of the CDC Viral Hepatitis Laboratory Branch and its discontinuation of hepatitis testing, and according to Hertel has not received consistent communication from the CDC about test discontinuations.
“As a result of sporadic changes to test offerings by CDC laboratories, the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories has been unable to determine which tests to prioritize with confidence,” Hertel said.
MDHHS also expects to see higher levels of test submissions for Hepatitis C due to the CDC’s decision to discontinue testing.
“The MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories serves as the National HIV and Hepatitis C virus NAT Reference Center in cooperation with the CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories… if MDHHS shifts its lab capacity to Hepatitis C testing, the MDHHS Bureau of Laboratories staff will have less capacity to respond to other public health emergencies,” Hertel warned. 
The department has also felt a lack of central coordination on tests discontinued by the CDC, Hertel said, noting that if the national agency is not at full capacity, there won’t be a central coordinating agency for responding to disease outbreaks. 
Bureau of Laboratories staff have also reported difficulties contacting CDC staff, Hertel said.

In addition to its impacts on lab testing, DHHS cuts have also significantly impacted the state-level department’s work on public health, with Hertel noting that the state relies on a partnership with several CDC programs for infectious disease detection and response activities. As a result, MDHHS staff say communications with CDC subject matter experts is now slow, reduced, or sometimes non-existent.
Because key program staff are no longer with the CDC, there has also been confusion on points of contact and a reduced knowledge base, Hertel said. 
“As a result, the CDC has failed to provide timely response to inquiries of urgent nature, reduced or eliminated national calls, and can no longer effectively serve as a national coordinator of infectious diseases efforts,” she said.
As an example, Hertel pointed to reports from her staff that the CDC is no longer sending out-of-state travel notifications about potential disease exposures to Michigan residents, including notices for diseases with critical timelines, like measles. Staff reported that the CDC was not able to coordinate a recent multi-state effort to investigate a complex and urgent case of human rabies, and is no longer hosting 50-state calls on the Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza response, despite ongoing concerns of a global bird flu outbreak.
“ Overall, the mass termination of CDC personnel appears to have created a climate of fear for remaining staff, thereby undermining the ability of remaining CDC staff to effectively carry out their jobs by supporting state health departments like MDHHS,” Hertel said. 
These cuts have similarly left MDHHS without access to updated health data and data systems needed to identify emerging health crises and address disparities in healthcare, Hertel said. 
Cuts at the CDC have also bled into state-level efforts in preventing HIV, AIDS, viral hepatitis, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis. 
The CDC has also cut the entirety of its Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System team and shut down the program’s data collection system. While Michigan was able to retrieve its 2024 data before the system shutdown, the CDC’s team would normally statistically weight that data, meaning the unweighted data obtained by the state is unusable. 
“To use the data, MDHHS would be required to contract with a survey statistician to properly weight this data, expending significant resources that would otherwise have been available from CDC staff,” Hertel said. 
The CDC also assists the state in monitoring and responding to lead poisoning in children, Hertel said. However, following significant cuts at the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, the MDHHS Environmental Health Bureau has received zero communication from the program. 
While the CDC previously sent notices about newly identified food and consumer products containing lead, those notices have stopped, Hertel said. 
MDHHS has similarly experienced issues in its environmental public health efforts including less frequent communications, the end of public health programming work groups with other states, and limited and inconsistent guidance from the CDC leaving the CDC Tracking Data Explorer without updated state-level data on drinking water, biomonitoring and radon.
While the CDC also helps the state administer several chronic disease and injury control programs, significant staffing shortages and the loss or potential loss of CDC contracts has left MDHHS with little or no guidance, Hertel said, creating uncertainty regarding the future of these programs.
The MDHHS Division of Child and Adolescent Health has also been impacted, Hertel said, with the Administration for Children and Families indefinitely postponing annual training for Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) teen pregnancy prevention grantees.
Hertel also pointed to the effectively shuttering of  the CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health as a major loss, noting the important role it played in preventing and reducing cigarette use by collecting and sharing information on smoking and its health impacts, including state level data on tobacco-use cessation treatments and high-quality reports on tobacco use trends. 
She also noted the loss of the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products, which was effectively shuttered when all members of its staff were terminated on April 1.
“Among other duties, [the Center for Tobacco Products] conducted compliance checks on vendors and retailers to ensure that tobacco products are not sold to those under the age of twenty-one, reviewed premarket applications for new tobacco products before they can be marketed in the United States, enforced advertising and promotion restrictions, and educated the public about the risks of tobacco use including the dangers of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products,” Hertel explained, later noting the state relied on both the Center for Tobacco Products and and the Office on Smoking and Health for its Tobacco programs. 
If Michigan does not receive support and funds from the Office on Smoking and Health, it stands to lose $2,347,639 in grant funding and other resources, Hertel said. Most of that funding supports Michigan Quitlink, which provides services to all Michigan residents for tobacco dependence treatment at a cost of just over $1.2 million annually. It also supports efforts to prevent youth tobacco use, offer healthcare provider training on tobacco dependence treatment and offer improved resources for schools to address vaping.
A loss of support from the Center for Tobacco Products could also shutter the state’s program ensuring retailers comply with laws banning the sale of tobacco products to underaged customers, as it has been unable to approve and process MDHHS’s request for additional funds to remain fully operational during a 2-month contract extension, or issue a solicitation for new state funding. 
If the state program is shuttered, eight full time staff members would be laid off and $1.485 million dollars would be lost annually, Hertel said.
An MDDHS spokesperson declined a followup interview on Hertel’s behalf.

,DC,2025-05-23 19:51:58+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/more-3-million-people-would-lose-snap-benefits-under-gop-bill-nonpartisan-report-says,,"The massive tax and spending bill passed by U.S. House Republicans would likely result in 3.2 million people losing food assistance benefits, and saddle states with around $14 billion a year in costs, according to a new analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.Democrats have argued the bill, which the House passed, 215-214 early Thursday without any Democrats in support, would cut programs for the needy to fund tax breaks for high earners.The CBO document, issued late Thursday, responded to a request to the office from the top Democrats on the Senate and House Agriculture committees, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Rep. Angie Craig, both of Minnesota, and somewhat bolsters that claim. The panels oversee federal food aid programs.“This report is truly devastating,” Craig said in a Friday statement to States Newsroom. “As a mother and someone who at times relied on food assistance as a child, these numbers are heartbreaking. It is infuriating that Republicans in Congress are willing to make our children go hungry so they can give tax breaks to the already rich.”A provision in the bill to tighten work requirements, including by excluding single parents of children older than 6 and by raising the age of adults to whom the work requirements apply, of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, would result in 3.2 million people losing access to the program in an average month, the CBO report said.Of those, 1.4 million would be people who currently have a state waiver from work requirements that would be disallowed under the bill and 800,000 would be adults who live with children 7 or older, the report said.Republicans want to use the legislative package to extend the 2017 tax law and its cuts, increase spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, overhaul American energy production, restructure higher education aid and cut spending.Toll on statesThe cost-share changes, which would require states for the first time to pay for a portion of SNAP benefits, would also limit participation and add a massive line item to state budgets, according to the CBO.Starting in 2028, states would be responsible for paying 5% to 25% of SNAP benefits, with a state’s share rising with its payment error rate. The federal government currently pays for all SNAP benefits.Under the House bill, which will likely undergo substantial changes as the Senate considers it in the coming weeks, states collectively would be responsible for just less than $100 billion from 2028 to 2034, about $14 billion per year.States would respond in a variety of ways, CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote, including potentially dropping out of the program.“CBO expects that some states would maintain current benefits and eligibility and others would modify benefits or eligibility or possibly leave the program altogether because of the increased costs,” he wrote.The office took a “probabilistic approach to account for a range of possible outcomes” to determine what the effect on households would be and estimated that 1.3 million people would lose benefits because of state responses to the new cost-share.CBO’s forecasters determined the impacts of the work requirements and cost-share provisions separately, meaning some people potentially losing benefits could have been counted in both categories.Move to the SenateThe House vote Thursday sent the measure to the Senate, where the debate over SNAP benefits may fall along similar party lines.Republicans who hold control in that chamber are planning to employ the budget reconciliation process, which allows them to skirt the Senate’s usual 60-vote requirement for legislation.During the House Agriculture Committee’s debate over its portion of the legislation, Republicans on the panel said the work requirement and state cost-share measures were needed reforms to SNAP that would protect the program for those it was meant to serve, while limiting the costs associated with benefits to adults who were able and unwilling to work or in the country illegally.In a Friday statement, Sara Lasure, a spokeswoman for Senate Agriculture Committee Chair John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, also said the panel would seek reforms to the program but did not offer specifics.“The Senate Agriculture Committee is in the process of crafting its budget reconciliation package and will work as good stewards of taxpayer dollars to make commonsense reforms to SNAP that encourage employment,” she wrote in an email.Klobuchar, in a statement after House passage Thursday, blasted the House bill and indicated she would oppose efforts to cut SNAP benefits.“House Republicans are pulling the rug out from under millions of families by taking away federal assistance to put food on the table,” she said. “They’re doing that even as President Trump’s tariff taxes raise food prices by more than $200 for the average family, all to fund more tax breaks for the wealthy. That’s so very wrong —and we will fight against it in the Senate.”",,,,2025-05-23 16:05:10.752486

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill that would eliminate certain transgender protections established by a 2018 anti-discrimination law in New Hampshire was approved by the state Senate Thursday and now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
​​If it becomes law, House Bill 148, which was sponsored by Wilton Republican Rep. Jim Kofalt, will allow businesses and organizations in New Hampshire to classify certain services, such as locker rooms and restrooms, by biological sex. It would also permit schools and organized sports teams in the state to keep transgender athletes off teams that are consistent with their gender identity. It would allow prisons, mental health facilities, and juvenile detention centers to place transgender people with members of their at-birth sex even if they ask to be placed according to the gender they identify with. The bill doesn’t require any of these things, but it allows whoever owns the restrooms, administers the sports teams, or runs the prison to do so without facing discrimination charges. This reverses parts of 2018’s Law Against Discrimination, which was enacted to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, or national origin.”
The Senate passed the bill, 16-8, along party lines Thursday, with all Republicans voting yes and all Democrats voting no. The House passed the legislation, 201-166, in March. Only two Democratic House members, Reps. Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, both of Peterborough, voted in favor.
Ayotte will now have the option to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature. Her predecessor, former Gov. Chris Sununu, was given the same options in 2024 when the House and Senate approved House Bill 396. This year’s bill, HB 148, is a word-for-word copy of last year’s HB 396. Sununu ultimately vetoed the bill, calling it “unacceptable,” and saying it “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves,” per his veto message.
LGBTQ+ rights supporters sang outside the State House restrooms in protest of the bill during the Senate session Thursday.

(Screenshot from Iowa PBS video)Gov. Kim Reynolds said Friday that eliminating Iowa’s income tax may not be on the table before she leaves office — but that she plans to focus on reducing property taxes in the 2026 legislative session.
In her public statement following the adjournment of the 2025 legislative session, Reynolds did not bring up income taxes as a goal for 2026. Instead, she highlighted her plans to work on “reducing Iowans’ property tax burden” next year.
During an interview on “Iowa Press,” moderator Kay Henderson of Radio Iowa asked Reynolds if she had abandoned the goal to end Iowa’s income tax or planned to move on cutting both income and property taxes in 2026. Reynolds said, “that would be aggressive.”

“I want to create a foundation that when I do leave, the next Republican governor that sits in that chair will be able to continue to reduce the individual income tax rate,” Reynolds said. “But I do need to focus on property taxes. That is what we hear about all the time.”
Reynolds announced in April she will not seek reelection in the 2026 general election. During her tenure as governor, Reynolds has put a major focus on cutting taxes, particularly focusing on Iowa’s income taxes. Iowa’s individual income tax rate fell to a flat 3.8% rate in January following a law the governor signed in 2024 that sped up 2022 cuts to individual and corporate income taxes.
While Reynolds has celebrated these reductions, she has also said in previous years that she wanted to go further and completely eliminate the state’s income tax. At a Cato Institute forum in 2023, Reynolds said her goal was to “get to zero individual income tax rate by the end of this second term.”
The governor said in 2025, legislators had “asked to take the lead” on property taxes, but that she planned to be more involved in this work and finding a solution to reduce property tax costs through discussions with local governments and other stakeholders over the summer.
Republican legislative leaders, Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs and Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton, the Ways and Means Committee chairs in the Senate and House, had introduced a bill in 2025 to eliminate Iowa’s “rollback” system for calculating property taxes and instead move to a “revenue-restricted” system that would limit most property tax levy rates to 2% growth each year. The proposal, which went through multiple iterations but failed to come to a floor vote, also included other measures intended to lower property taxes like a shift of $426 million in K-12 funding from property taxes to the state.
Reynolds said she did not believe that shifting funding to the state necessarily would be the correct solution, as “it’s still taxpayer dollars” that would come from state taxes instead of local property taxes to back this K-12 funding. She said her focus on putting together a package to cut property taxes would involve looking at “how we deliver services to our citizens.”
She said it’s not feasible for Iowa communities to have “level of government that we have and expect the property taxes to go lower.” She said her discussions will involve ways Iowa can streamline government to cut costs, but will also likely involve changes to how Iowa local governments have operated in the past 40 years.
“It’s disruptive, but that means people are going to probably be a little uncomfortable, and we’ll have the conversation,” Reynolds said. “And I’m not going to wait until January to have it. We’re going to have it all summer as we’re working on it.”
Most of the governor’s priorities, which she laid out during her Condition of the State address in January, were met before the 2025 session ended earlier this month. Measures like restricting cellphone use in classrooms, increasing medical residency slots and making changes to Iowa’s rural health care system and backfilling some natural disaster aid for Iowa areas impacted by 2024 extreme weather all passed this session.
Disaster aid
When asked by moderators about the proposed elimination of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the federal agency that played a large role in Iowa’s recovery efforts after the 2024 natural disasters, Reynolds said there still needs to “be a partnership” with the federal government but that she sees areas for improvement in FEMA’s response system.
“I’m telling you, it takes way too long, it’s way too bureaucratic,” Reynolds said. “You know, we’ve got people on the ground that can act quickly. We were able to stand up some really unique programs because they gave us the flexibility to do that. That’s what states do, that’s what we could do. So I think it really is something we need to take a look at.”
Child care
Some of Reynolds’ proposals, like measures on child care infrastructure and energy programs, did not make it to her desk.
The child care bill included a provision to shift funding from the existing Early Childhood Iowa (ECI) and federal Child Care and Development Fund Wrap Around Child Care funds to a new $16 million grant pilot program for preschool providers and child care centers. The focus would be on providing full-day care for children. 
Though the legislation did not pass this session, Reynolds moved forward Tuesday to establish a Continuum of Care grant with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services releasing an initial Request for Proposal for the grant. The governor also extended the child care assistance pilot program, allowing child care workers to receive child care assistance for their own children.
Carbon pipelines
One bill that Reynolds has not weighed in on is House File 639, the legislation proposing multiple changes related to the use of eminent domain in carbon sequestration pipeline projects. The bill passed the Senate following heated debate during the last week of session. Republican leaders in the House, including House Speaker Pat Grassley, have said they believe Reynolds will sign the bill into law despite opposition from the ethanol industry and some high-profile Republicans.
June 14 is the deadline for Reynolds to sign bills from the 2025 session into law; if she does not sign or veto a bill by this deadline, it is considered a “pocket veto” and not enacted. The governor said on “Iowa Press” she is meeting with stakeholders to discuss the legislation, but is still in the process of researching and considering the impacts of the bill with her policy team and with advocates both for and against the measure.
“Almost every meeting has led to some additional research on my team, I have legal counsel looking at it,” Reynolds said. “So it’s been a really good process, and we’re going to continue that through at least the next week. So I want to make sure that I have given individual stakeholders the opportunity to weigh in, so that I can, again, make make the best, informed decision that I can based on information I’ve heard.”

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers are seeking to extend lawsuit protections to regular news reports following a recent ruling by the state’s Supreme Court that allowed a defamation suit against the Chicago Sun-Times to progress.

The measure, Senate Bill 1181, would explicitly name the press in an existing state law that aims to protect against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” otherwise known as SLAPP lawsuits.

The case that inspired the legislation was brought against the Sun-Times after the paper published multiple articles about investigations into the former executive director of the Illinois Property Tax Appeal Board.

The Sun-Times had obtained a copy of a complaint made to the Office of the Executive Inspector General against Mauro Glorioso, a former chair of PTAB who later became its executive director.

The complaint, which has since been ruled unfounded by the OEIG, claimed that Glorioso, a Republican, told staff “he wanted a large reduction in the assessment of Trump Tower because the owner of the property was the president of the United States.”

Staff at PTAB had not initially recommended reducing property taxes but ultimately altered their decision to recommend a $1 million reduction. An administrative judge later said that decision was made to rectify an overassessment that occurred in 2011, and the recommendation to reduce the assessment was upheld by an appellate court in 2023.

Glorioso sued the newspaper in 2021, claiming he was defamed and that the paper’s coverage mischaracterized the OEIG investigation, misstated Glorioso’s motivation as political and overstated his involvement in the decision.

Lawyers from the Chicago Sun-Times sought dismissal under the 2007 Citizen Participation Act that defines a SLAPP suit as frivolous litigation that “chills and diminishes citizen participation in government.”

More than three years after Glorioso initially filed his suit, the court ruled in November that the Sun-Times’ articles weren’t investigations, which would have been protected under the law. Instead, the court wrote, the articles were news reports about something a government agency was doing and lacked any intent to elicit action or a solution from the government – which was needed for SLAPP protections to be applicable.

The court’s opinion also said there wasn’t any mention of the press or news media in the act, so they allowed the lawsuit to continue at the lower court level.

“This is not to minimize or understate the importance of the press and other news media in our democracy,” Justice David K. Overstreet wrote in the opinion. “Our jurisprudence is replete with privileges and other protections designed to protect these concerns, many of which remain at issue in this lawsuit. We are simply holding that the (Citizen Participation) Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern.”

SB 1181 directly addresses that sentiment. The bill states, “The press opining, reporting, or investigating matters of public concern is participating and communicating with the government,” meaning organizations doing so would be protected under the law if the bill passes.

The measure also provides that all legal proceedings in a case, including discovery, would be stayed while a party’s Citizen Participation Act lawsuit motion progresses in court.

Rep. Dan Ugaste, R-Geneva, voiced concerns on the House floor about that provision.

“I believe we're going to have a unintended impact of actually harming individuals who are just trying to protect themselves from what could be very irresponsible journalism, all under the guise of protecting the constitutional right of the freedom of the press,” Ugaste said before he urged a “no” vote.

Rep. Dan Didech, D-Buffalo Grove, explained the reasoning behind the provision.

“We are amending the statute so there still has to be a nexus to that exercise of constitutional rights, but the conduct does not have to be solely related to that exercise,” Didech said.

The bill cleared the Senate 55-1 in April and passed the House with a minor amendment on a vote of 75-38. Because of the amendment, it heads back to the Senate before it can be sent to the governor.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice) OKLAHOMA CITY – The head of the financially troubled state mental health agency is accusing Oklahoma’s attorney general of misusing his office and bullying after he posted copies of her tax liens on social media.
Attorney General Gentner Drummond posted on X that the Oklahoma Tax Commission had placed three liens on Allie Friesen’s property for “thousands in unpaid taxes.” 
He wrote Friesen’s most recent lien was released the same day she was appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt to lead the Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.
“How can we expect a taxpayer who doesn’t properly handle their own personal finances to be in charge of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars?” he wrote. “Gov. Stitt needs to stop protecting Allie Friesen and start protecting our tax dollars.”
In response, Friesen, the state’s mental health commissioner, sent her staff an email saying the liens were paid off  “long ago” and do not reflect her ability to lead.
“To be very clear: this is a non-issue being weaponized for political gain,” she wrote. “What is an issue – and one I cannot ignore – is the blatant violation of character, the disturbing misuse of public office, and the sustained campaign of political bullying I have endured at the hands of the Attorney General of our state.”
Drummond has called on Stitt to fire Friesen amid reports of financial disarray at the mental health department, cut or canceled provider contracts and warnings that the agency would not be able to pay nearly 2,000 employees without an emergency legislative appropriation. 
Stitt appointed Friesen to the post in January 2024 after his prior appointee resigned.
Friesen wrote in her email that  Drummond was angry with her after she removed him from a position of influence. 
Friesen terminated his office’s representation of the agency in a class action lawsuit which accused the state of failing to provide competency restoration services to indigent criminal defendants.
Drummond backed settling it, but Friesen and Stitt initially opposed the agreement. They later agreed to settle it. 
Stitt has maintained support for Friesen.
Drummond said Friday his interactions with Friesen pertaining to the mental health litigation forced him to conclude “that, unfortunately, she is not competent for the position with which she has been tasked.” 
“Even before the escalation of scandals surrounding her leadership, she had shown herself not to be up to the job. It gives me no pleasure to say that, but it’s the truth,” Drummond said Friday. 
Maria Chaverri, a Friesen spokesperson, confirmed that Friesen had sent the email to staff. She said Friesen’s family had fulfilled all tax obligations.
She did not respond to questions about the dollar amount of the liens and years for the back taxes.
The Oklahoma Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services has been the subject of audits, legislative inquiries and investigations after it was revealed the agency had a significant budget shortfall, which Friesen blamed on prior administrations.
A recent audit by State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said the agency needed $28.7 million in emergency funding to make it through the current budget year.
“It needs a director with executive managerial experience and a mastery of basic budgetary and compliance skills,” Byrd said in a statement when she released the audit.

Mennen Williams Building in Lansing, Mich., on May 15, 2025. (Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel on Friday responded to accusations that her office was stonewalling the Republican-controlled Michigan House Oversight Committee this week, saying the committee’s member statements were inaccurate and misinformed.
Nessel in a letter highlighted the fact that she has been in constant communication with the committee and its chair, Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), and that she agreed to provide the full scope of the litigation expenses from her term and her predecessor’s. Although DeBoyer and his fellow Republicans threw barbs this week after only getting half of what was requested, Nessel said she needs additional time to produce the remaining documents.
Those documents that were handed over were also shared with members of the Michigan Capitol press corps, which was another area of frustration for House Republicans.
“By June 17, as committed, we will, likewise, share the second production with the chair and our Capitol press corps to ensure transparency,” Nessel said. “It has always been my belief that these documents and the evidence belong to the people, as allowed for under Michigan law, and I have committed to nothing less since the close of my department’s prosecutions.”

Nessel Letter 5.23.25 
The request revolves around the Flint water criminal prosecution that resulted in zero convictions after the cases were dismissed, but not before the Michigan Supreme Court ruled that the prosecution team violated the due process rights of the defendants by indicting them using a one-man grand jury.
The move disallowed several members of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder’s administration – who were accused of negligence that fueled a state-created danger – from having a preliminary examination that would have given them a chance to poke holes in the state’s probable cause arguments. Snyder’s associates were charged with felonies, but Snyder was only charged with a misdemeanor before all charges were dismissed.
The prosecution team was led by Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy and former Michigan Solicitor General Fadwa Hammoud, while Nessel spearheaded the civil litigation side of the Flint crisis, which resulted in a mammoth settlement.
When Republicans took back control of the Michigan House of Representatives this year, Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), chair of the House Oversight Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government, requested contracts, invoices, itemized lists of billable hours, memoranda of understanding with third-party entities and other financial items related to the investigation and prosecution that occurred under Nessel’s regime.
Her predecessor, former Attorney General Bill Schuette, led an investigation and began a prosecution of his own by employing a special counsel, attorney Todd Flood. That investigation remained active when Nessel became attorney general in 2018, but Nessel soon after dissolved Schuette’s case and began anew with her own investigation.
Although Rigas had asked pretty pointedly for documents related to Nessel’s time as attorney general, the department said it would endeavor to show the whole scope of the cost of the prosecution, which included Schuette’s tenure.
Those documents would take time to process and deliver to Rigas’ subcommittee, Nessel said from the outset, and requested an extension of the initial March 25 deadline. That deadline was Tuesday. Nessel delivered a document package on a secured hard drive on Wednesday.
But the documents delivered only covered Schuette’s term, and Nessel stated that the remaining document haul would take about another four weeks to produce.
The continued back and forth angered Rigas, who called Nessel’s office onto the carpet.
On Thursday evening, DeBoyer sent Nessel’s office a letter demanding production of the remaining documents.
“Most, if not all, of those records appear to be Verizon cell phone bills related to Todd Flood,” DeBoyer wrote. “Your office failed to produce any documents from your own tenure as attorney general. It is apparent that you and your office willfully refused to provide documentation relative to your own tenure in office and instead spent your time digging up irrelevant documents from a prior administration.”
DeBoyer demanded that the documents be presented no later than noon on May 30, and delivered electronically – and presumably not on a password protected drive.

DeBoyer Letter 5-22-25 
In response, Nessel said she was transparent with Rigas and agreed to deliver documentation from 2016 [when Schuette was still in office] to the close of the Nessel era prosecution in 2023.
“As requested, this includes documents from the prior administration, which began the prosecutions,” Nessel wrote in a letter to DeBoyer issued Friday. “I was also clear that this involved thousands of pages of documents, which would take some time to produce and require redirection of staff efforts to fulfill.”
Nessel also said she provided Rigas and DeBoyer with a link to a publicly available website including all costs incurred by the state in the matter. She provided that link again in her letter to DeBoyer.
“If you were not provided this information previously, you have it now,” Nessel wrote. “Also, despite your and Rep. Rigas’ claims, yesterday’s production included 28 megabytes of documents which satisfies the requested first and third categories through 2019, with the commitment to provide 2019-2023 by June 17.”
Nessel did not appear to budge from her position that the documents would be delivered by June 17, seemingly bucking DeBoyer’s new request for production by May 30.
Nessel said that there were no settlements or cost recoveries related to the prosecutions, so there was nothing to provide the committee or Rigas’ subcommittee in that regard.
The attorney general added that the documents her office turned over were not mere cell phone bills.
“In total, my department delivered over 450 documents, separated into subfolders under the headings, ‘invoices,’ and ‘contracts,’ to help navigate this extensive production,” Nessel wrote. “Billable hours for outside counsel, expense forms, associated costs and more are all itemized throughout those documents. If you had reviewed the entire production, you would see it was far more extensive than simply Verizon cell phone bills from one attorney.”

The case was dismissed on Thursday. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge cleared the way Thursday for CoreCivic to reopen its Leavenworth prison as an immigration detention center, saying he lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.
The city has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver.
“We need to confer with our attorneys,” said Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager. “We will probably discuss it with the city commission sometime next week.”
Peterson said he didn’t know whether further court action could occur before June 1, when CoreCivic officials had indicated they may begin receiving detainees.
“We may have further negotiations with CoreCivic themselves about this,” Peterson said.
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case, saying the city failed to establish subject-matter jurisdiction. During a Tuesday hearing, Crouse repeatedly questioned whether he had any basis to act, saying the city had not adequately outlined that issue.
Crouse, appointed to the bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump, highlighted two pending motions before him, including Leavenworth’s request for an injunction that would have stopped CoreCivic from reopening until it could be determined whether the company had to go through the city’s development process. CoreCivic had asked for a dismissal of the case.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said in court Tuesday that CoreCivic had agreed not to take detainees until June 1 while the case was decided.
After the hearing, Hatley said in an interview there were concerns that if detainees were housed in the prison before the legal disputes were resolved, the federal government could refuse to move the detainees regardless of the outcome of the case.
“The City asserts that Core Civic should be enjoined from operating its detention facility without the proper permit,” Crouse wrote in his ruling Thursday. “But it has not pled facts to establish that subject-matter jurisdiction exists in federal court to consider that claim. Accordingly, this action is dismissed, and the parties’ motions are denied as moot.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said the company was pleased with the decision.
“We remain focused on ensuring the Midwest Regional Reception Center is prepared to meet the needs of our federal partner,” he said.
Gustin did not answer questions about whether CoreCivic intended to begin housing ICE detainees in June.
 Move forward

Activists who have spoken out against reopening the facility are hopeful the city will appeal.
“We hope the city will explore all of its options as the concerns of the lawsuit since its filing in February — CoreCivic’s disregard for the city’s governance and its rush to fill the facility without accountability — have only grown more urgent,” Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said in an email.
Tseng also said the judge’s decision held hope with regard to whether CoreCivic would have to follow Leavenworth development codes requiring the company to apply for a special use permit.
“It’s also worth noting that in the dismissal, the court agreed that when CoreCivic ceased operation for 12 months, it lost its non-conforming status and that its initial application for the special use permit appeared to be a recognition of this fact,” she said.
CoreCivic was grandfathered into the city’s development codes when it was open and operating as the Leavenworth Detention Facility from 1992 to 2021. The codes were passed in 2012.
City officials, as laid out in the lawsuit, have told CoreCivic it must apply for a special use permit.
 ‘Great start’

CoreCivic’s reopening of the Leavenworth facility, which closed in 2021 at the end of its federal contract and under numerous accusations of inhuman treatment at the facility, is part of the company’s plan to reopen nine idle facilities.
In its May earnings report, CoreCivic announced total revenue of $488.6 million, with net income of $25.1 million.
“2025 is off to a strong start for CoreCivic. First quarter occupancy in CoreCivic facilities reached 77% of available capacity, an increase from 75.2% in the first quarter of last year,” said CEO Damon T. Hininger in a press release. “Based on cost management and increased bed utilization, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), we exceeded our internal expectations for the first quarter. Additionally, we have begun to re-activate three previously idle facilities under multiple agreements with ICE.”
In Security and Exchange Commission filings, CoreCivic said it had nine idle facilities, including the Leavenworth facility, renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“CoreCivic anticipates additional contracting activity as 2025 progresses,” Hininger said. “In addition to the facilities we are currently activating, we are making preparatory investments in many of our other idle facilities so that they will be available quickly, as our partners’ needs require and as their budgets allow.”
 Leavenworth contract

CoreCivic SEC filings and a press release said they signed a letter of agreement with ICE at the beginning of March to reopen the Leavenworth facility, which would house 1,033 detainees. As a result, ICE paid CoreCivic $5 million with a maximum of $22.6 million set over a six-month period to cover start-up expenses while the two hash out a long-term contract.
In its quarterly report, filed May 8 with the SEC, CoreCivic noted that Leavenworth filed a lawsuit.
“CoreCivic plans to vigorously defend this matter on the basis that the (special use permit) is not applicable under existing statute,” the filing said. “CoreCivic has agreed with the City of Leavenworth to not accept detainees prior to June 1, 2025 while this matter is deliberated. The Company can provide no assurance that it will obtain a favorable ruling in this matter or that ICE and the Company will ultimately enter into a long-term contract for the utilization of the Company’s Midwest Regional Reception Center.”

In the current two-year budget, which runs through June 30, services offered by the group, called Treehouse, were expanded. But the spending plan Gov. Bob Ferguson signed Tuesday includes cuts that are equal to a third of the group’s overall budget.
Graduation rates for foster children are the lowest among public school students in the state. However, rates increased from 36% to 53% in the past decade, according to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. Cuts to the nonprofit could undermine this progress, leaders of the group say. 
Foster children often face high levels of instability and uncertainty, which can include parents with mental health or substance abuse issues. This often contributes to them performing poorly in school when it comes to attendance, grades, test scores and graduation rates, said Dawn Rain, CEO of Treehouse. 
At times, students can change schools multiple times a year. Every time they switch schools, they can lose up to six months of academic progress. 
“I always say it’s really hard to worry about your math test this week if you don’t know if you’re going to see your mom,” Rain said.
Treehouse has two grants from the state. One with the Department of Children, Youth and Families and the other with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
In the current two-year budget, the Legislature allocated funding to support eighth graders in foster care as they transition to high school because the organization was seeing that a large group of students were being lost before they got to ninth grade. 
Confronted with a multibillion-dollar budget deficit over the next four years, the Legislature reduced funding for one Treehouse grant and cut the other entirely. 
The grant from the Department of Children, Youth and Families was reduced from roughly $1.1 million to $660,000 a year. This grant funded educational advisors who worked alongside caseworkers at the department to ensure educational stability for foster children. 
The advisors advocate for students to stay in the same school and help smooth transitions between schools when needed. They also assist with the transfer of education records, class placements and special education access.  
The entire $7 million a year grant from the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction was cut. This grant allowed the nonprofit’s advisors to meet weekly with students at school and work on attendance, academics, and behavioral issues to increase graduation rates. 
This staff provided students with social and emotional support and guidance and sometimes became the single, stable adult in a child’s life due to high turnover rates with caseworkers, foster families, and schools. 
Services from Treehouse are available to students in any school district in the state. The organization currently serves between 60% and 70% of foster children in the state and works in almost half of the school districts across Washington. 
While foster students only make up 1% to 2% of the student population, it can be hard for schools to pay close attention to their specific needs. Without support, they are more likely to end up unemployed, in poverty, homeless, or incarcerated.
The loss of funding could lead the nonprofit to scale back services and potentially lay off staff. Funding for the affected programs will run through the rest of this academic year but will stop on July 1, the start of the state’s fiscal year. 
“​​Our students are so highly mobile, they change placements a lot,” Rain said. “When we have services statewide, if a student moves across the state, we can kind of catch them.” 
Staff are located in child welfare offices or in school buildings across the state. Students who work with the organization for more than two years have a graduation rate close to 70%. 
“If we have this limited footprint, some of that is not going to be possible,” Rain said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/education-savings-1-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)There’s an old horror story: the call is coming from inside the house. In Columbia, that chilling metaphor might not be far from reality — and this time, it’s not a fictional villain on the line, but the possibility that someone elected to protect the city may have quietly worked to harm it from within.
Tuesday night Columbians of all stripes came out to tell the city: Don’t repeal the ban on licensed healthcare providers giving minors so-called “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that seeks to force a change in sexual orientation or gender identity.
Residents who had been victims of the barbarous practice shared heart-rending stories. Mental health professionals, religious and secular residents, gay and straight alike spoke – all in defense of keeping this important ban in place.
City Council punted on the decision, giving residents and advocates a small reprieve.
After the council meeting, Mayor Daniel Rickenmann told reporters that city leaders had “sequestered” hospitality and accommodations tax funding — bracing for the possibility that the state Legislature would withhold support.
That support, estimated at $3.7 million, now hangs in the balance because an ambitious, socially conservative senator from the Upstate disapproved of Columbia’s policy to protect LGBTQ+ kids.
Acting in the wake of Attorney General Alan Wilson’s letter, that senator inserted language into the Senate’s version of the budget making Columbia’s public funding a hostage to ideological retaliation.
And then a curious thing happened on Wednesday. After the conference committee completed its work of cobbling together the state budget, House Ways and Means Committee Chair Bruce Bannister — speaking about the inclusion of the proviso in their final package — said this about unnamed Columbia City Council members:
“They were supportive of us adopting the proviso … and that this would encourage their members to think a little harder about it.”
When a reporter asked if the mayor specifically talked with them, Bannister said, “I don’t – it was someone. I neither confirm nor deny who was doing the work on that end.”
That silence is deafening. Because if it turns out that any member of Columbia City Council lobbied state lawmakers to deliberately deny the city funds as a backdoor tactic to force the repeal of its ban on conversion therapy, then what we are dealing with is not just an instance of political pressure. It is a civic betrayal of the highest order.
That being said, we can’t lose focus. Columbia’s ordinance banning conversion therapy — a practice condemned by every major medical and psychological association — is a life-affirming law designed to protect LGBTQ+ youth from psychological abuse masquerading as treatment. It took courage for City Council to enact it. Resistance to repealing the ordinance is paramount now more than ever.
However, if now, through backroom dealings and veiled threats, city officials are attempting to reverse that moral stand by threatening a $3.7 million cut to Columbia’s public budget, then they have not only undermined public trust — they have weaponized the state budget against their own citizens and constituents.
That alone would be scandal enough. However, the intrigue doesn’t seem to stop there. What makes it even more audacious is the decision to tie that political coercion to hospitality and accommodations tax (HTAX) funding.
HTAX funding is the fuel behind the festivals that draw visitors from across the Southeast. It’s a support that keeps our local arts scene vibrant, our public events safe and staffed, our nonprofits operational, our parks clean, and our local businesses booming.
To tinker with that engine out of ideological spite — or worse, as a calculated move to pressure elected officials to fall in line — isn’t just reckless. It’s economically self-sabotaging.
This isn’t just a game of political chess. These are real dollars, real jobs, and real people whose lives depend on a functioning, forward-looking city government. And to even contemplate disrupting that system for the sake of dismantling protections for LGBTQ+ youth reveals a staggering disregard for both moral responsibility and fiscal stewardship.
If the rumors are true — if the mayor or other officials worked behind closed doors to cut Columbia off from state support in hopes of toppling a policy they couldn’t defeat in open debate — then they must be held accountable. Not just at the ballot box, but in the court of public opinion and historical memory.
Because when elected leaders lobby against their own city’s interests — when they betray the people they were sworn to serve — they don’t just break public trust. They break the very foundation on which local democracy stands.
And that, no matter what the political calculus, is indefensible.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC_0686-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

Medicaid provides coverage to over 1 in 4 Massachusetts residents, playing a vital role in our state’s health care system and the strength of our economy.
The post Tallying the crucial impact of Medicaid in Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FOR MOST PEOPLE in Massachusetts who receive health insurance from their employers, Medicaid is not top of mind. But the fact is that MassHealth, as Medicaid is called in our state, provides coverage to over 1 in 4 of our residents. Because of this, the program plays a vital role in our state’s health care system and the strength of our economy.If you think about the wide range of people who depend on MassHealth, chances are that someone in your life has relied on it at some point in their life.It could be the woman working as a cashier at a local business who can get prenatal care to give her baby the best chance at a healthy start in life, or your friend’s child with autism receiving the support services they need to reach their full potential.It may be a recent high school graduate who is pursuing higher education and job training to advance their career without the fear of losing insurance coverage, or your neighbors working in low-wage sectors who want to provide health security for their families. Or it could be relatives who are elderly or living with a disability who have services and supports that help them stay in their home instead of going to a care facility.Despite its importance, Medicaid is now squarely on the chopping block. On Thursday, the US House of Representatives passed its so-called “Big, Beautiful Bill,” a legislative package that includes nearly $700 billion in reduced federal spending on Medicaid that would significantly reduce funding to states and result in major losses in health coverage. The measure, designed to offset the cost of tax cuts proposed by the new administration, moves on to the Senate.It is crucial that we understand the major role MassHealth plays in ensuring that all residents of Massachusetts have access to health care, as well as the devastating impact federal cuts to the program would have on individuals and families (our friends and neighbors), doctors, home care services, nursing homes and hospitals – and the state’s economy.In Massachusetts, over 2 million people receive their health insurance through MassHealth. It provides coverage to two-thirds of people with low incomes (below 133 percent of the federal poverty level; about $20,800 annually for a one-person household in 2024). In contrast to common perception, over 75 percent of people covered by MassHealth under age 65 live in working families. Each year, MassHealth provides health insurance to hundreds of thousands of low-income workers who could not otherwise afford coverage, working in sectors such as food services, transportation, retail sales, cleaning, and construction.MassHealth covers residents across the lifespan, including almost 40 percent of all births in Massachusetts, 48 percent of children and young people up to age 20, almost 60 percent of people with disabilities, and 70 percent of residents in nursing homes.Because MassHealth funds are central to the financial support of our health care system, the impacts of cuts could threaten access for all of us. MassHealth funds account for over 50 percent of patient revenue for nursing homes and more than 45 percent of funding for community health centers and long-term services and supports (such as home health care and personal care assistants). Approximately 18 percent of all of hospital patient revenue comes from the MassHealth program.In addition to the direct and indirect hit on our economy, it is important to note that 86 percent of all federal revenue in our current state budget is generated by federal Medicaid reimbursement. That reimbursement totals more than $12 billion annually, covering half of the cost of the MassHealth program.Major federal Medicaid cuts could shift hundreds of millions of dollars in costs onto the Commonwealth and would make it more difficult, if not impossible, for our state to sustain the high coverage rates that MassHealth has made possible.It’s hard to overstate the harm posed by potential cuts to Medicaid. Even for those of us who do not use the program for our health insurance, it is important to recognize that, whether we know it or not, people in our lives and with whom we interact every day rely on Medicaid. Cuts would reduce funding for the health care system that our families use. And such cuts would harm the economy and competitiveness of Massachusetts.This is too big a threat to stay silent about. We can work with the federal government to continue to make improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of Medicaid. There is no mistaking, however, that we all need to defend the funding of this critical program.Audrey Shelto is president and CEO of the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation.The post Tallying the crucial impact of Medicaid in Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/b09ed834-68ba-4e30-909f-e21b56bc720a.jpg?fit=1024%2C1024&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

Arraj United States Courthouse in Denver on April 21, 2025. Macdonald represents plaintiffs who are suing the Trump administration over their potential deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. (Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Immigration advocates in Colorado say they have identified about 12 immigrants in Colorado whom they believe federal authorities have removed to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador.
Some details of their cases are uncertain, because immigration authorities, both in court proceedings and through public communication, have largely refused to release information about enforcement activities.
But lawyers and community groups working on behalf of the immigrants — through contact with family members, media coverage, videos from CECOT, and scant clues from federal sources — have constructed the best available profile of people who vanished from Colorado.
As Colorado Newsline previously reported, Tim Macdonald, legal director of the ACLU of Colorado, in April first revealed in federal court in Denver that at least 11 people had been removed from Colorado to the brutal prison in El Salvador. The ACLU represents two Venezuelan nationals, as well as a larger class of immigrants, who are being held at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in Aurora and fear deportation under the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime law invoked by President Donald Trump to hasten deportations.
The Colorado case is one of several throughout the country that challenges the Trump administration’s hyper-aggressive pursuit of mass deportations as unconstitutional, affording detainees little to no due process.

Attorney Laura Lunn, director of advocacy and litigation at Westminster-based Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, which has worked on the federal case of the Venezuelan detainees and others in Colorado, told Newsline this week that immigration advocates think there are “about a dozen” people the U.S. removed from Colorado to CECOT under the Alien Enemies Act.
“In some instances, we were in touch with their loved ones, who said, ‘We saw our loved one on the news, and he is in CECOT,'” Lunn said.
Numerous images and videos have emerged from the prison since March 15, when American officials, in possible violation of a court order, flew 238 migrants from the U.S. to be incarcerated in El Salvador. The roughly dozen immigrants transferred from Colorado to CECOT are believed to have been on one of three March 15 flights, Lunn said. 
Newsline requested responses to a set of specific questions for this story from a spokesperson for ICE Denver. The spokesperson referred questions to a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, who did not respond.
The Western region branch of the American Friends Service Committee helped to confirm, largely through interaction with family members, about six of the Colorado-to-CECOT detainees, Jennifer Piper, the region’s program director, said. They are Venezuelan men roughly between 19 and 25 years old. There is no indication any of the roughly 12 individuals from Colorado were legal residents or citizens of the U.S., but they were removed from the country before they could present facts on their own behalf, Lunn noted.
For some family members, the first indication a loved one had been transported to El Salvador was the release by CBS News of a list of detainees who were on the March 15 flights.










So, you know, you're talking two months, more than 60 days that you have no idea if your loved one is alive, dead, in El Salvador, disappeared into the immigration system in Guantanamo. No idea.


– Jennifer Piper, Western region director of the American Friends Service Committee


One Colorado detainee’s mother whom Piper works with spotted her son in a video from CECOT just this month.
“She finally was able to see her kid’s face, when they went walking down the halls,” Piper said. “So, you know, you’re talking two months, more than 60 days that you have no idea if your loved one is alive, dead, in El Salvador, disappeared into the immigration system in Guantanamo. No idea.”
Some details on at least three Colorado-to-El Salvador detainees have been reported through government and media sources. They include Jose Eduardo Moran-Garcia, Yohendry Jerez-Hernandez and Nixon Perez. Jerez-Hernandez and Perez appear on the CBS list. Sources for this story declined to give the names of other individuals they’re working with.
Colorado and Aurora became a focus of Trump’s plan for mass deportations as he campaigned for reelection last year, including during a rally in Aurora in October. Local and federal authorities in recent months have undertaken several operations against immigrants on the Front Range. They include the September arrests of four men in connection with a shooting at an apartment on Nome Street in Aurora, a raid on a “makeshift nightclub” in Adams County in January, a coordinated set of operations at residences in Denver and Aurora in February, and a raid on a “makeshift nightclub” in Colorado Springs last month.
At least some of the detainees sent from Colorado to CECOT were rounded up during these actions, Piper said, adding, “Not a single person was convicted of a crime.”
Trump administration officials often allege that some detainees in Colorado and elsewhere have ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
“It’s really important to understand that those ties have not been proven in any way,” Piper said. “They haven’t been able to provide any proof of that in any of the court documents where they’re being sued.”
Some of the removed immigrants faced criminal charges, but they were local, not federal, charges, often filed well after the individuals were initially detained, Piper said.
“No one gets to go to their final court date to argue their case” before removal, Piper said. Some detainees didn’t even face local charges and were removed to El Salvador because federal officials said, “Oh, we didn’t like your tattoo,” she said.
Lunn has appeared as a “friend of the court” during hearings for some of the Colorado detainees believed to be at CECOT. Government attorneys have never acknowledged the detainees were sent to El Salvador, she said. 
“I’ve been doing detained work for people in immigration proceedings now for about 15 years. It is unprecedented for somebody’s case to be docketed and for ICE to show up to court and say, ‘We don’t know where this person is, and we’re not at liberty to tell you where they might be,'” Lunn said.
The cases are devoid of typical due process and documentation.
“It would be one thing if there was like a legal basis that the government could point to as to why somebody was placed on one of those planes, but because they provided them no prior notice, because people were taken without the opportunity to review any allegations against them, that means that there really is no paper trail of what allegations existed,” Lunn said. “We don’t even know what the government supposedly alleged in order to invoke the (Alien Enemies Act) against people.”
She rejects the term “deportation” to describe these cases.
“It’s not a deportation, because they don’t have a deportation order,” Lunn said. “It’s lawlessness … People were disappeared.”
Earlier this month, U.S. District Court Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Denver issued a preliminary injunction that indefinitely blocks the Trump administration from removing detainees in Colorado under the Alien Enemies Act while the case is pending.

Clerk Becky Hadlock made “many serious mistakes” in the 2024 elections, but her actions did not amount to “misconduct” or “malfeasance,” Gordon determined. 
The post Governor won’t seek Weston County clerk’s removal for 2024 election errors appeared first on WyoFile .","Weston County Clerk Becky Hadlock’s actions in the 2024 election did not meet the requirements for Gov. Mark Gordon to seek her removal from office, according to the governor’s review of formal complaints filed against the clerk late last year. 
“Although I recognize that Clerk Hadlock made many serious mistakes in the 2024 Weston County elections, her actions do not rise to the level of misconduct or malfeasance, as I understand the meaning of those terms in this situation,” Gordon wrote in his decision, which was released Friday. “I do not believe there is a clear path to proving guilt.”
An error by Hadlock caused an initial ballot miscount in her county’s results, drawing fierce criticism from Weston County voters. Eight local qualified electors submitted a complaint to the governor’s office in December, asking him to begin the process laid out in state statute for removing a county official from office. The governor received an additional formal complaint with the same allegations in January, according to his decision. 
State law did not task Gordon with deciding whether to unilaterally remove Hadlock from office. Rather he was required to determine whether to recommend the attorney general seek the clerk’s removal in district court. 
Gordon said two factors weighed heavily in his analysis — “the legal threshold required to constitute ‘misconduct’ or ‘malfeasance,’ and the serious nature of recommending the removal of a lawfully elected county official,” he wrote. 
“The decision of who should fill a county office is best made by the people of Weston County in the next election just a little over a year away,” Gordon wrote. “Preempting that privilege without a clear and obvious showing of willfulness or intentional acts rising to the level of misconduct or malfeasance is not justifiable.” 
Altogether, Hadlock faced accusations she mishandled election ballots by ordering and using multiple ballot versions in the general election; improperly tested voting machines during the primary and general elections; used incorrect ballots in the general election, which necessitated hand-recounts; and caused a significant undercount of votes, according to Gordon’s letter. 
“These acts were not denied by Clerk Hadlock,” Gordon wrote.

For the 2024 general election, Hadlock printed three versions of the ballot due to errors on the first two. It’s not unusual for clerks to reprint ballots to correct misprintings and other errors ahead of the election, but it became a problem when some voters were given the erroneous first and second versions. 
As a result, tabulators miscounted votes in a county commission race as well as the contest for House District 1, where House Speaker Rep. Chip Neiman (R-Hulett) was running unopposed for reelection. 
The initial, unofficial results for Weston County showed Neiman received 166 votes while 1,289 voters left that part of the ballot blank, also known as an undervote. 
That count caught Secretary of State Chuck Gray’s attention on election night, he told the state canvassing board in November. When Hadlock didn’t answer his calls, he sent the sheriff’s office to her home. 
Hadlock initially denied there was an issue, but ultimately agreed to Gray’s request that her office complete a hand tabulation of the ballots, which confirmed her mistake. The recount showed that Neiman received 1,269 votes, and the results were certified by the county canvassing board. 
“I will note that in Clerk Hadlock’s interview she was not as forthcoming as I would have liked for her to be. But when confronted directly about issues and problems raised by the complainants, she did not deny the matters,” Gordon wrote. “It was disappointing that she did not appear to understand the significance of her mistakes but, again, her interview did not reveal any intent or willfulness on her part.” 
Hadlock did not immediately respond to WyoFile’s request for comment Friday. 
Gray’s office conducted its own investigation into Hadlock and came to a different conclusion than Gordon and recommended the clerk be removed from office. 
Gray did not immediately respond to WyoFile’s request for comment Friday.

Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images).Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”
Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

You can read more about the section here.

If Mississippi has taught me anything, it’s that federal policy rarely trickles down as promised. For people with disabilities, especially in our state, Medicaid isn’t a political talking point—it’s survival.
Medicaid pays for in-home support, daily nursing care, medications, equipment and community access. Without it, the alternative is often institutionalization, isolation or worse.
But under the Trump administration’s proposed budget, this vital program is facing devastating cuts. Medicaid is on the chopping block, and Mississippi is standing directly in the path of the blade.
Recently, I spoke with a mother in the Mississippi Delta whose son has a rare degenerative condition. He’s nonverbal, uses a wheelchair and needs help with every aspect of daily life. For the past three years, Medicaid has provided her a modest stipend to be his paid caregiver—allowing her to stay home, care for him full-time and keep him out of a facility 90 miles away.
“If they cut this program,” she told me, “I’ll have to go back to work. But no one else can care for him. What happens to him then?”
She already knows the answer: He’ll be institutionalized. Not because he needs to be — but because that’s the only option left when Medicaid collapses and the community-based care disappears.
The Kaiser Family Foundation ranks Mississippi as one of the states most vulnerable to federal Medicaid cuts. We rely on federal funds for nearly three-quarters of our Medicaid budget. Unlike wealthier states, we don’t have the cushion (or the political will) to fill the gap if that money disappears.

And it’s not just one program on the line. The Urban Institute outlines how slashing HHS funding will kneecap services that help disabled people live independently. That includes everything from personal care attendants to case managers to basic home health. Families as Allies of Mississippi and the Mississippi Coalition for Citizens with Disabilities have issued repeated warnings, but so far, the response from many of our lawmakers has been silence.
We’ve seen this film before. And we won’t like the ending: more people forced into institutions, more families pushed to the brink and more lives lost. 
Even the Right Is Blinking. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri — hardly a progressive firebrand — was publicly opposing the Trump administration’s cuts in a recent New York Times op-ed. 
For those not familiar with Sen. Hawley’s typical position, this should raise alarm bells. 
“Medicaid isn’t a handout,” he writes. “It’s a commitment to human dignity.”
For once, he’s right. Message to current administration: If your policy has lost even Josh Hawley, maybe it’s time to ask yourself what exactly you’re defending.
What’s happening in Washington isn’t abstract. This is a direct threat to people in Mississippi, especially those with disabilities.
More than 700,000 Mississippians — about a  quarter of the state’s population — rely on Medicaid or the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program, according to the Mississippi Division of Medicaid website.  Medicaid covers 1 in 3 Mississippians with disabilities.  Medicaid provides not only health care, but also essential supports like personal care services, durable medical equipment and access to home and community-based services that allow people to live independently instead of being institutionalized.
The latest GOP proposals in Congress may avoid the most dramatic cuts for now, but they still set the stage for devastating consequences. Policies like work requirements and funding clawbacks are being framed as “moderate reforms,” but let’s be clear: they target the very people Mississippi’s system is already failing, including low-income families, disabled residents and rural communities with limited alternatives.
National experts at KFF warn that cuts of this scale could force states to reduce benefits, tighten eligibility  or shift costs in ways that make care harder to access. Recent Axios reports say Medicaid work requirements could lead to hundreds of thousands losing coverage. This is not because people can’t work, but because navigating paperwork shouldn’t be a condition for staying alive.
As of this week, Mississippi’s delegation has been largely silent, but the health care system they claim to protect is already in crisis. If these policies move forward, they’ll be accelerating a slow-motion disaster. 
The question isn’t whether cuts are “technically moderate.” The question is: Who gets left behind and who’s counting on us not to notice?
Here’s the deal: Medicaid in general is and never will be perfect. But when it’s paired with deep underinvestment and a cruel federal rollback, it stops being a policy failure and starts being a moral one. 
Mississippians with disabilities aren’t asking for special treatment. They’re asking to live in their homes. To go to school. To survive. If you gut Medicaid, you don’t just cut cost — you cut people off from their futures.
And from where I sit, the view is clear: We must sound the alarm, raise our voices and refuse to be complicit in policies designed to leave our most vulnerable behind.

Sears/Maryland Matters)Hoosiers will no longer be allowed to purchase candy and soda using taxpayer-funded food assistance, making Indiana the first state to receive a federal waiver for the restriction.
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Brooke Rollins signed off on Indiana’s request this week, according to a Friday news release from Gov. Mike Braun’s office.
The Republican governor signed an executive order in April as part of his “Make Indiana Healthy Again” plan to limit the use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. The new policy will take effect Jan. 1, 2026, per a spokesperson for the governor.
“More taxpayer-funded SNAP dollars are spent on sugary drinks and candy than on fruits and vegetables,” Braun said in a statement. “Indiana is proud to lead the way in the Make America Healthy Again agenda by making this common-sense move to return SNAP to its intended purpose: nutrition.”
RFK Jr., Dr. Oz kick off ‘Make Indiana Healthy Again’ initiative with Gov. Mike Braun

Braun said he requested the federal waiver to allow Indiana to impose its own restrictions on the program.
He pointed to USDA data showing that soda is the most purchased item with SNAP benefits. Nationwide, SNAP recipients spend more on sugary drinks, desserts and candy than on fruits and vegetables combined.
Research additionally shows children in SNAP households consume 43% more sugary beverages than children in similar-income households not enrolled in the program.
Indiana was one of the first states to apply for the waiver and is part of a broader push by the Braun administration to combat diet-related health problems and improve food quality in low-income Hoosier communities.
The announcement initially came during a rollout event for the initiative, where U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised Indiana’s approach.
“I urge every governor across America to follow your lead,” Kennedy said during the April 15 visit in Indianapolis. He called for other reforms, too, like banning certain food dyes and additives, expanding farm-to-school programs, implementing fitness testing in schools, and increasing SNAP transparency.
Related executive orders recently signed by Braun include those to add work requirements for more SNAP recipients; commissioning studies about food safety and diet-related illness; and various proposals to generally limit “waste, fraud and abuse” in the state’s Medicaid program.

Jared Polis signs House Bill 25-1309 into law on May 23, 2025 in Denver, Colorado. The law prohibits health insurers to deny affirming care coverage. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed legislation into law on Friday that codifies health insurance coverage for gender-affirming care.
“Today, we’re sending a clear message: Coloradans will not let politics get in the way of medical care. As we face national efforts to erase access to gender-affirming care, including threats to Medicaid and pending decisions at the Supreme Court, we’re stepping up to protect what we know is right,” bill sponsor Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat, said ahead of the bill signing.
House Bill 25-1309 prohibits insurance plans from limiting or denying gender-affirming care that a doctor identifies as medically necessary. That care is an array of interventions for people whose gender is different than their sex assigned at birth, and can include things like hormone therapy, facial reconstruction, hair removal and breast augmentation.
The law also shields testosterone prescriptions from the state’s Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. That program is intended to prevent duplicate or excessive prescriptions of opiates for people, but advocates worry it could be weaponized to go after providers who prescribe hormone therapy for transgender patients.
Brown sponsored the bill alongside Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat and Colorado’s first openly transgender lawmaker, Sen. Lisa Cutter, a Littleton Democrat, and Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat. It passed with entirely Democratic support with a 23-12 vote in the Senate and 40-20 vote in the House.
“Putting this into law today will keep the people who are relying on the services of their doctors to be able to get that, and for parents to be able to know that their kids are going to have the care that they need,” Titone said.
Twenty-six states have gender-affirming care bans in place at some level, according to the Human Rights Campaign. There are also threats at the federal level. An executive order from President Donald Trump in January restricts care for transgender youth, and the U.S. House of Representatives passed a budget reconciliation bill yesterday that bans gender-affirming care for people on Medicaid and plans under the Affordable Care Act.
“Regardless of what the federal government does to restrict our personal freedom and our privacy, in a ‘Colorado For All,’ we want to make sure we protect our basic freedom to keep the government out of the doctor’s office,” Polis said.
Polis also signed House Bill 25-1312 into law last week, which added protections for transgender people into the state’s anti-discrimination law.

Photo by Auditi Guha/VTDiggerA Vermont migrant farmworker, one of nine who were detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in April, has been released on bond, while two others had their bond denied during hearings on Thursday.Jose Edilberto Molina-Aguilar’s $10,000 bond will be paid by Vermont Freedom Fund, an independent nonprofit that Migrant Justice helped set up during the first Trump administration, according to Will Lambek, a spokesperson at Migrant Justice, an advocacy organization for migrant rights.Meanwhile, Meredith Tyrakoski, a judge in San Antonio Immigration Court, denied bond motions for both Jesus Mendez Hernandez and Adrian Zunun-Joachin, according to Lambek.All three are being held at the Karnes County Immigration Processing Center in Texas. Diblaim Maximo Sargento-Morales — who was also detained last month while working for Vermont’s largest dairy — was released on bond from the same processing center a week ago. He arrived at the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport over the weekend in an orange T-shirt and camouflage pants.“Thank you for all the support you’ve shown me and my coworkers,” Sargento-Morales told a group of supporters in Spanish, according to a social media post by Migrant Justice. Sargento-Morales’ bond was set at $1,500, the lowest amount possible by law.Four of the detained farmworkers — Juan Javier Rodriguez-Gomez, Luis Enrique Gomez Aguilar, Urillas Sargento and Dani Alvarez-Perez — have already been deported to Mexico by ICE without a hearing or an opportunity to request asylum. They were deported from a facility in Louisiana under “expedited removal” procedures, according to Brett Stokes, their attorney at the Center for Justice Reform at the Vermont Law and Graduate School. READ MORE
In the past, that authority has only applied to people seeking entry through a checkpoint or found crossing the border, but under the second Trump administration, it’s been used for people who currently live in the U.S. and don’t fall within the typical scope of that deportation process.Such removals are almost impossible to challenge, according to Stokes.U.S. Customs and Border Protection detained eight farmworkers on April 21. They were working on Pleasant Valley Farms, a dairy in northern Vermont, just a few miles from the Canadian border. The detainment has been described by advocates as the largest single immigration arrest of farmworkers in recent Vermont history.Arbey Lopez-Lopez, who was employed at Pleasant Valley Farms for at least five years according to his attorney, was arrested almost two weeks earlier at an intersection patrolled by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents. He was held in immigration detention for 42 days, primarily at FCI Berlin, a federal prison in New Hampshire, before he was released on a $3,000 bond by an immigration judge on Monday.He was transferred to New England’s Immigration and Customs and Enforcement headquarters in Burlington, Massachusetts, on Thursday, where advocates from Migrant Justice drove to pick him up. “I presented to the judge that if this guy isn’t released, his 5-year-old child is going to become destitute because his housing is tied up with his employment,” Lopez-Lopez’s attorney Enrique Mesa said on Thursday.Mesa said he plans to help Lopez-Lopez apply for a work permit, and he’ll ask U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services to cancel his removal proceedings, arguing that he is the sole financial support for his daughter.Like the other eight migrant workers, Lopez-Lopez is originally from Mexico. He has lived in Vermont since 2006. The government opted to close previous removal proceedings for Lopez-Lopez in 2018, said Mesa, adding: “It really has me scratching my head on why the government decided to detain him again.”Mesa said it was apparent at the bond hearing on Monday that Border Patrol officers “were stalking immigrants at a certain intersection.” As a member of Migrant Justice, Mesa said Lopez-Lopez knew his rights, but patrol agents told him he had an order of deportation and threatened to break down the window of his vehicle if he didn’t comply and go with them. Lopez-Lopez then left the vehicle and was detained, according to Mesa. He had gone to pick up groceries which he was delivering back to his co-workers at the farm.“I find it very irritating that people can’t practice their normal routines and their normal lives without thinking ICE is going to be there harassing them,” Mesa said. “I understand them going after criminals but this guy (Lopez-Lopez) was going to get his groceries.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Another detained migrant farmworker in Vermont has been released on bond.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/May-Day-2025-36-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 15:07:34.413351

(Getty Images)Two legal advocacy organizations filed legal action Friday over an executive order by Gov. Patrick Morrisey that requires the state health officials to recognize religious and philosophical exemptions to the state’s schools vaccine mandates — exemptions that are not a part of state law. 
The American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice filed the writ of mandamus Friday in Kanawha County Circuit Court on behalf of Marisa Jackson, of Kanawha County, and Dr. Joshua Hess, of Cabell County. Jackson and Hess are both parents of immunocompromised students. Hess is also a pediatric hematologist and oncologist practicing at Marshall Health’s Cabell Huntington Hospital. 
The petition asks the court to compel the state’s Department of Health and Bureau for Public Health to stop complying with the executive order. 
“The question before this Court is simple: Can the West Virginia Governor, through Executive Order, override a clear and mandatory directive created by state statute and, in so doing, relieve state actors of nondiscretionary duties assigned to them through state code?” the petition says. “To that, West Virginia Courts have a clear and decisive answer: No, he may not. For that reason, Petitioner files this action respectfully requesting this Court compel Respondents to engage in their nondiscretionary duties as it relates to granting and denying exemptions to the state’s compulsory immunization statute.”
The petition also names as respondents Justin Davis, interim commissioner of the Bureau for Public Health, and Dr. Arvin Singh, cabinet secretary of the West Virginia Department of Health.
All states require that school students be vaccinated for certain infectious diseases like measles, chicken pox and polio. Until this year, West Virginia has been one of five states that allow only medical exemptions to those requirements. 
In January, Morrisey issued an executive order directing state health officials to allow religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine mandates. The executive order is based on the Equal Protection for Religion Act of 2023, which states that the government shall not “substantially burden” someone’s right to religious freedom unless doing so is essential to further a compelling governmental interest. The order also directed the state health officer to come up with legislation and rules to facilitate religious exemptions.
Senate Bill 460, legislation that would have established religious exemptions in state law, did not become law during the 2025 regular session. The bill passed in the Senate, but was rejected by the House of Delegates. 
Despite the bill not passing, Morrisey has not rescinded the executive order. Schools in the state have had a fractured response to the order. Some private schools have said, despite the order, they will not recognize religious exemptions to the school vaccine laws. 
State Schools Superintendent Michele Blatt issued a memo May 2 to county superintendents recommending that students not be allowed to attend schools next year without the required vaccinations. Before the day was up, though, the memo was rescinded at Morrisey’s request.
“Governors do not rule by decree,” ACLU-WV Legal Director Aubrey Sparks said in an ACLU news release. “At the center of this lawsuit is who gets to make these decisions for our students. On this question, the state Constitution is clear that the authority lies with the Legislature, not the governor.”
“Parents should be able to know their child will be safe when they send them off to school,” Sarah Brown, executive director of Mountain State Justice, said in the release. “We are seeing the devastating effects of loosening vaccine requirements across the country, and that’s why the Legislature wisely declined to loosen the restrictions here in West Virginia. It’s vital that their decision not be undermined by the executive branch.”
The petition has been assigned to Kanawha Circuit Judge Kenneth Ballard.
Emails to Morrisey’s office and to the state Department of Health seeking comment were not immediately returned Friday afternoon.

Tracy McCreery, a Democrat from Olivette, prepares for Senate Republicans to force a vote on a constitutional amendment to ban abortion on May 14 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).On the evening of May 14, when the House side of the Missouri legislature was almost a ghost town, state Rep. Mark Sharp’s phone started buzzing with messages telling him that “things are getting ready to blow up in the Senate.”
Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, started making his way to the Senate when he heard chanting. Protesters were in the Senate expressing their opposition to HJR 73, which would put an abortion ban on the 2026 ballot.
After visitors were cleared out to stop the protest, security began to let people back in, and Sharp and dozens of other representatives crammed into the spaces along the edge of the Senate floor to watch what would happen next.
“You had about 50 reps on the Senate floor … maybe 20 Democrats and another 30 Republicans all mixed together. All kinds of camera crews. I’ve never seen the Senate that packed before,” Sharp said.
“Then, they moved for the previous question, and then did it again on Prop A,” he added. “Then they adjourned. I was literally stunned.”
After a session considered uncharacteristically productive and bipartisan by recent standards, the Missouri Senate, on the second-to-last day of the 2025 session, broke with its own longstanding tradition and overrode a filibuster.
To do it, Senate Republicans pulled out a rarely used procedural tool called a “previous question,” or PQ, to close debate and force votes on the abortion bill and a bill to repeal paid sick leave protections.
Senate Republicans’ use of the PQ shocked the Missouri legislature for a number of reasons, one being that the tool is very rarely used, because it’s seen as antithetical to the chamber’s tradition of unlimited debate.
The other is that the move came after a session in which Republicans and Democrats, despite their disagreements, were able to find some common ground and collaborate on legislation.
Legislating from the Missouri legislature’s ‘superminority’
Republicans have held a two-thirds supermajority in both chambers of the Missouri legislature since 2012. This year, Democrats held 10 of 34 Senate seats and 52 of 161 House seats.
Even so, this session was marked by considerable bipartisan cooperation — a stark contrast from previous years, when Republican infighting dominated the Senate and made it difficult to get much of anything to the governor’s desk.
While extreme political polarization nationally might make bipartisan cooperation seem impossible, it’s a requirement in the Missouri legislature if Democrats want to get anything done, said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat.
“I would not be successful as a legislator if I worked in a silo or if I worked on purely hyperpartisan issues. That’s not going to get me anywhere as a Democrat in the superminority of Missouri,” she said. “It all comes down to me finding common ground with others.”
State Rep. Mark Sharp, a Kansas City Democrat, speaks during a press conference during the 2025 legislative session ( Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Sharp said: “As a member of the superminority, we have to constantly, constantly be talking to these folks in the majority party daily. They’re the ones controlling everything.”
Republican House leadership — including House Speaker Jon Patterson of Lee’s Summit, Majority Floor Leader Alex Riley of Springfield and committee chairs — have control over every step in the legislative process, including whether a bill is introduced and referred to a committee.
Because of that, “at every corner, we should be working across the aisle to make sure that these bipartisan pieces of legislation are given a chance … because we know the partisan ones won’t,”  Sharp said.
He said “it can be frustrating” to be a Democrat working in the Republican supermajority-controlled Missouri legislature, but “you’ve got to have a short memory.”
Despite being in the supermajority, many Republicans were “absolutely” interested in working with Democrats, Nurrenbern said.
One of those Republicans was Sen. Kurtis Gregory from Marshall. He and Nurrenbern together represent Clay County in the Senate, and “as soon as we were both elected, we sat down and talked about what we could do together to move Clay County forward,” she said.
When Nurrenbern decided to file a bill to create a Clay County Sports Authority, she reached out to him and said, “I would like you to champion this with me.”
“He was an absolutely great supporter every step of the way to get that done,” she said. “He was … excited to carry that legislation with me.”
But the collaboration wasn’t just one-way, Nurrenbern said. Sen. Mike Henderson, a Desloge Republican, also asked for her input on a massive education bill he was working on.
“He came to me right away and said: ‘Maggie, I’d really like your input on this. You’re a former educator. I respect your opinion on these provisions, and I want to work with you on this,’” Nurrenbern said.
State Sen. Tracy McCreery, an Olivette Democrat, cosponsored several bipartisan bills this session and said it was “refreshing” to work across the aisle.
“I’m in a district that’s 50/50, and I feel like my constituents want me to work together with people of all political stripes and all backgrounds to find common-sense solutions,” McCreery said. “They appreciate that politicians aren’t fighting all the time and calling each other names.”
While some issues consistently divide Republicans and Democrats in the Missouri legislature, others offer more opportunities for bipartisan cooperation, such as economic development and health care.
“All of the things I worked on successfully with colleagues from the other side of the aisle are just issues that are going to help make people’s lives a little bit better,” McCreery said.
 Making legislation ‘a little less bad’

For Democrats in both chambers of the Missouri legislature, getting a policy over the finish line often means amending another bill to include their language. It’s especially critical in the House, Sharp said.
“Freshman Democrats feel like their specific House bills should be moving. That’s now how it works. … Republicans aren’t going to pass a bill in your name,” Sharp said.
McCreery said it’s “pretty common” for Senate Democrats, when they’re unable to block the passage of a bill, to try getting some of their own bills added as amendments to soften the impact.
“Once the supermajority decides that a bill is going to move and make it out of the chamber, you, as a senator, have to decide. Do I want to try to stop it, or do I want to try to make a bad bill a little less bad by putting some good things on it?” McCreery said.
McCreery said one example was a “terrible” omnibus utility law that passed early in the session, which she said will increase Missourians’ utility rates.
“I voted no on it, but I was able to get some consumer protections in there for low-income people,” she added. “It was a tough decision, but I didn’t have the ability to stop the bill, so then I had to make a decision to try to put some things in there that can make it a little less harmful to people.”
Nurrenbern said she tries to remember “that we, as Senate Democrats, are just 10 of 34 senators” and that “while we should have a mark on the legislation that is passed, it is going to be not as large a mark as the Republican supermajority.”
“I don’t think a single piece of legislation got across the finish line without Democratic input,” she added. “But we also recognize that we’re not going to be overdemanding or overbearing in our asks. The asks that we put forward are reasonable, I think, and are really in the spirit of serving Missouri well.”
Sharp said that unlike in previous years, House leadership — and especially Patterson, who just completed his first session as speaker — was more open to keeping an open dialogue with Democrats.
“I will give House Speaker Patterson this: he did a very good job of working with Democrats, (and) particularly African-American Democrats in Kansas City,” Sharp said. “He made time for us regularly in Jefferson City and in Kansas City.”
That shift meant that “a few more opportunities were thrown to members of my caucus,” Sharp said, with Patterson and various Republican committee chairs being more willing to help some of Democrats’ bills move through the legislative process.
Those opportunities meant that Democrats, including freshmen, were able to add their bills’ language as amendments to Republican legislation, including bills banning hair discrimination in schools, extending a tax credit for donations to diaper banks and eliminating sales taxes on diapers and feminine hygiene products.
But other House bills with bipartisan support were casualties of the Senate’s breakdown. That included Sharp’s bill requiring some people with DUIs to install ignition interlocks in their car, which he said was on the Senate agenda but was effectively “killed” when the PQ was used.
 The impact of a PQ in the Missouri legislature

With the use of the PQs, “all of that bipartisan cooperation and collaboration was pretty much thrown out the window,” according to McCreery.
At the time, Republicans and Democrats had been negotiating to find a compromise on Republicans’ bill to repeal Proposition A’s paid sick leave protections, passed by voters last fall.
“We were working right up to when we were given word that negotiations were finished,” McCreery said. “I went into that Wednesday still feeling hopeful that we would figure something out.”
According to the Missouri Independent, Democrats told Republican leadership they would stop filibustering the two bills if language were changed to remove references to gender-affirming care for minors — which is already illegal in Missouri — from the abortion bill and to allow for minimum wage to rise with inflation.
McCreery — who was leading the filibuster when the PQs were used — said “the PQ may have been used against me, but it’s bigger than me.”
“Shutting down the debate was done against the will of the people. And that’s what makes this more harmful and harder to look the other way on, because the PQ was used on me, but shutting down debate was used against 1.5, 1.6 million Missourians that voted for Prop A or voted for Amendment 3,” she said.
That move “eroded my trust and confidence to negotiate in good faith with Republican senators,” Nurrenbern said.
While Democrats said negotiators were on track to find a solution, Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance, said on the day of the PQ that “goalposts were being moved” in those negotiations, which ultimately “hit a logjam.”
Gov. Mike Kehoe was working behind the scenes in the lead-up to the PQ to try to prevent it and improve the chances of the Missouri legislature passing his proposed stadium funding plan, according to the Missouri Independent.
In the lead-up to the PQ, Nurrenbern and other Democrats said that while they enjoyed the bipartisan cooperation, “That is not going to be the case next session.”
“It marked a change in how we are going to operate as senators,” Nurrenbern said. “There are a lot of motions that happen throughout the legislative day in the Missouri Senate, and we are going to use every opportunity to make our point that it’s paramount to negotiate in good faith.”
McCreery said she didn’t want to speculate about how Democrats might proceed, but did say that “it’s going to be much harder to get things done, even things that are perceived as nonpartisan or noncontroversial. There was a lot of harm done not just to this session, but future sessions as well.”
“I’m certainly disappointed with how session ended this year, and I have a long memory,” she added. “I don’t anticipate that I’ll go into special session this summer or regular session next January with all of this disrespect just put behind me.”
 Preparing for the special session and 2026 in the Missouri legislature

Gov. Mike Kehoe recently announced that he will call lawmakers back to Jefferson City for a special session sometime this summer to vote on a bill to provide state funding for a new Royals stadium and a renovated Chiefs stadium.
Nurrenbern said she doesn’t know “what the call is for special session yet, but I would certainly expect to see some of that spill over.”
McCreery said Democrats “have not had any discussions” about the special session.
“I will say, as someone who is a proud resident of the St. Louis region, to see all of the destruction that happened on Friday night with the tornado, it’s going to be really hard to think about giving $900 million or more to a wealthy team owner when we’ve got so much destruction in the St. Louis region that is going to have to be dealt with,” she said.
Sharp — who has been a vocal advocate for finding a way to keep the Royals and Chiefs in Missouri — said an even bigger barrier to getting the stadium bill passed will be senators’ lingering resentment over the House failing to pass a massive construction bill.
However, he said he’s optimistic that House leadership will put it up for a vote during the special session to clear the way for the Senate to pass the stadium bill.
At a press conference after the end of session, Kehoe told reporters he understands lawmakers’ concerns about the construction bill.
“I’ve heard and listened to quite a few senators and representatives from both sides of the aisle on that very same issue, and I understand what their concerns are,” Kehoe said. “I think it’s fair to say everything is on the table of what that special session might look like.”
As Democrats prepare for the sessions to come, Nurrenbern said she hopes to see bipartisanship in the Missouri legislature again.
“Everybody comes from a different walk of life, from a different area of the state, and we work best — and the institution works best — when we come together for the common good,” she said. “I hope we get back there sooner than later.”

The mayors say they won't back down.","The Trump administration is suing, clockwise from top left, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, and Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, among others, in a complaint that targets the city's ordinances that protect undocumented immigrants from detention and deportation. (Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty and Fran Baltzer, Danielle Richards, and Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)The U.S. government sued Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken and their elected officials for city policies prosecutors say interfere with the Trump administration’s immigration detention and deportation goals.
Prosecutors want a judge to declare the policies an unconstitutional violation of the Constitution’s supremacy clause, which holds that federal law prevails over state law. They also want an injunction to block the cities from protecting their residents and visitors from immigration enforcement.
“The United States is currently facing a crisis of illegal immigration, and the Federal Government is set to put a stop to it,” the lawsuit states. “While states and local governments are free to stand aside as the United States performs this important work, they cannot stand in the way. And where inaction crosses into obstruction, local governments break federal law. That is what is happening across New Jersey right now. It is past time it ends.”
The complaint, filed Thursday, names as defendants Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Paterson Mayor Andre Sayegh, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla, and the cities’ council presidents (all four mayors are Democrats). Baraka and Fulop are among six Democrats running to become New Jersey’s next governor, and Baraka just two days ago beat another federal case against him over a contested immigration jail that recently opened in Newark.
Baraka blasted the latest prosecution as “absurd.”
“We are not standing in the way of public safety. We are upholding the Constitution, providing oversight, and following the laws and guidelines of the State of New Jersey,” he said in a statement. “Nothing in our policies prevents law enforcement from doing their jobs. What we refuse to do is turn our city into an arm of federal immigration enforcement, which the courts have already ruled is not our role.”
Fulop said he would not be “bullied” and vowed to fight the feds.
“Jersey City gets sued for being a sanctuary city — I guess MAGA ran out of conspiracy theories for the week,” he said. “Here is the truth: Jersey City’s policies protect families, reflect our values and have led to record low crime rates.”
And Sayegh dismissed the complaint as “a frivolous lawsuit and a flagrant affront to the rule of law.”
“We will not be intimidated, and we will fight this egregious attempt to score political points at Paterson’s expense,” Sayegh said.
Bhalla also said his city “will not back down.”
“The Trump administration’s treatment of immigrants, lawful residents, and countless citizens is truly disgraceful and often, unconstitutional. Families have been senselessly torn apart, and legal residents who have not been proven to have committed any crimes have been deported to jails overseas without due process. These actions of the federal government are truly barbaric, and Hoboken will not aid this lawlessness,” he said.
In the 24-page complaint, U.S. Justice Department prosecutors led by Yaakov M. Roth, acting assistant attorney general, accused the cities of denying federal immigration agents access to undocumented people in local jails, forbidding local police from delivering them to federal immigration agents, and barring “otherwise willing local officers from providing mission-critical information to federal immigration authorities.”
Prosecutors cite executive orders and police directives that the cities issued in 2017, 2018 and 2019 during President Trump’s first term, but that remain in effect. Such policies prohibit “even the most basic cooperation with federal officials” and undermine immigration enforcement work, prosecutors argue.
“These efforts to shield illegal aliens within the Garden State are unlawful,” the complaint states.
The complaint also accuses city officials of discrimination, because they bar local police and municipal officials from cooperating only with federal immigration agents, not any other entity. Singling out one agency for unfavorable treatment constitutes discrimination, the lawsuit says.
“Such discriminatory targeting of the Federal Government is unlawful,” the complaint says.
The complaint comes three weeks after federal authorities began detaining undocumented people at Delaney Hall, a 1,100-bed jail in Newark that has drawn protesters daily.
Jail officials initially had barred city officials from inspecting the facility, which led to Baraka’s arrest earlier this month when he visited the site seeking entry. Prosecutors on Monday dropped charges against Baraka but then charged Rep. LaMonica McIver (D-10) with assaulting officers by acting as a human shield to protect Baraka from arrest. She denies the charges, and Congressional Democrats from around the country have denounced that arrest.
Immigration advocates decried the lawsuit filed Friday as the feds’ attempt strong-arm local governments into carrying out federal immigration enforcement.
Amy Torres, executive director of the New Jersey Alliance for Immigrant Justice, said the cities’ policies don’t violate federal law but instead “reflect a clear separation between local and federal responsibilities.” She urged the cities to resist caving to federal “bullying.”
“Over the last few months, the Trump Administration’s DOJ has made it clear that they want to make an example out of New Jersey — first by raiding our cities, then by expanding ICE jails in defiance of local law, and most recently by arresting elected officials and charging sitting members of Congress with felonies,” Torres said in a statement. “It is clear that the DOJ remains hellbent on making a national example out of New Jersey. In return, NJAIJ calls upon the cities of Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken to be a national example of resistance, dissent, and champions for justice.”

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)The Federal Emergency Management Agency has denied North Carolina’s appeal of its April decision to stop matching 100% of the state’s spending on Hurricane Helene recovery.
The ruling came Thursday in a letter from the person serving as the agency’s acting leader, David Richardson, that provided little in the way of explanation. Richardson was elevated to the position of “Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Administrator” after the person President Donald Trump selected as Acting Administrator, Cameron Hamilton, was fired earlier this month, one day after delivering congressional testimony in he expressed disagreement with the administration’s plans to dismantle the agency.
This is from Ricardson’s denial letter:

“You specifically requested an extension of the 100 percent federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days.
After a careful and thorough review of all the information available, including that contained in your initial request for a cost share adjustment and appeal, we have concluded that an extension of the 100 percent federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days under major disaster declaration FEMA-4827-DR is not warranted.”

As NC Newsline previously reported, the ruling leaves the state on the hook for up to $200 million or more in additional expenses for debris cleanup and other emergency work.
In a statement responding to the ruling, Gov. Josh Stein expressed disappointment but promised to press on with Helene cleanup and recovery efforts:

“The first step to help western North Carolina recover is to clean up all the debris. So far, we have removed more than 12 million cubic yards of debris from roads and water ways, but given the immense scale of the wreckage, we have only scratched the surface. FEMA’s denial of our appeal will cost North Carolina taxpayers potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to clean up out west. The money we have to pay toward debris removal will mean less money towards supporting our small businesses, rebuilding downtown infrastructure, repairing our water and sewer systems, and other critical needs.
Despite this news, we are going to stay the course. We will keep pushing the federal and state governments to do right by western North Carolina. We will keep working with urgency, focus, and transparency to get any appropriated money on the ground as quickly as we can to speed the recovery. We will not forget the people of western North Carolina.”

The ruling came the same day the North Carolina House unanimously approved a bill that would provide $464 million in new relief for western North Carolina — roughly half of what Stein had asked for. That bill is likely to be part of the House-Senate state budget negotiations that will take place in the coming weeks.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

Philip Randolph Career and Technical High School on May 23, 2025 in Philadelphia and met with students, teachers, and legislators for public K-12 education. (Commonwealh Media Services)Gov. Josh Shapiro said he has “confidence in the leadership” at Penn State following a decision made by the university’s board of trustees on Thursday to close seven of its 19 Commonwealth Campuses.
“They know they need to right-size. They know they need to plan for the long term future, and to do that, they needed to make these tough choices,” Shapiro said. “And I have faith in (Penn State President) Neeli Bendapudi and her administration and the board who made those decisions.”
Penn State DuBois, Fayette, Mont Alto, New Kensington, Shenango, Wilkes-Barre and York are slated to close following the spring 2027 semester after a “two-year wind-down period.”
WPSU described the 25-8 vote by Penn State’s board of trustees on Thursday night to close those campuses as “contentious,” adding that leadership argued the move was necessary for future success for the university. Bendapudi said that enrollment dropped 43% over the past 10 years at the campuses that are slated to close.
However, critics of the decision say they believe the decision was “rushed and lacking community input.”
“I know that when a school like Penn State, a satellite campus leaves a community, that can leave a big hole, and so my administration is committed to working with Penn State and those affected communities to make sure they are taken care of going forward,” Shapiro said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State Sen. Wayne Langerholc and state Rep. Michael Armanini, both Republicans, represent districts that include Penn State DuBois. They issued a statement critical of the plan to close the campus.
“I am deeply dismayed that all of the advocacy and education of the significant benefit of Penn State DuBois have fallen on deaf ears,” said Langerholc. “For multiple years, this institution embraced the mantra and model of Penn State and produced students who contribute to the local workforce, drive economic activity, and make our region and commonwealth stronger.”

“Today that relationship was broken,” he added. “I am committed to working with my colleagues in the House to identify an entity that appreciates our rural area and will take the broken baton to repair and strengthen our community.”
Armanini described the school as a “hub of manufacturing businesses which include the carbon, and graphite industries.”
 “Not only does this decision impact the students of Penn State DuBois, it impacts our communities,” Armani said. “The campus provides jobs to residents of DuBois and the surrounding community, income for local businesses who rely on the student body and faculty, and the local industry which benefits from the research of the school and has a talented pool of students to employ after graduation.”
Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) also represents a district that includes one of the satellite campuses, Penn State New Kensington. He offered a different point of view from his GOP colleagues.
“The harsh reality is that higher education in general throughout Pennsylvania is greatly oversubscribed. We have too much physical plant in higher education to support the declining demographics that we are faced with, and there has also been a significant increase in the variety of job opportunities available that don’t necessarily comport with the deliverables of higher education in this state,” Pittman said. “Rightsizing is a necessary step that must happen across higher education. However, the process from a transparency perspective and the lack of messaging on what these campuses can be used for going forward has been far from ideal.”
Pittman said that he does not favor losing the campus in his district, but argued the “big picture view” of the issue was that change is needed in higher education and that conversations will be needed to ensure that “the launch box and digital foundry they have supported continue, and we figure out a path to make the property even more productive than it is now.”
“Ultimately, Penn State will have an obligation to make sure the campuses are all repurposed and brought to a higher and better use in the communities where they reside,” he said. “This is a responsibility the university bears, and their efforts must be supported by the state. We cannot allow closed satellite campuses to become blighted properties. The facilities must be repurposed in a thoughtful way.”
The university’s plan will need approval from the state Department of Education.

(Courtesy of Department of Game and Fish / Jim Stuart)The beloved fairy bee, the Sacramento Mountain Salamander and the jaguar share one common trait: a spot on New Mexico’s 2025 blueprint for animal conservation.
State wildlife officials released the New Mexico State Action Wildlife Plan earlier this month, identifying more than 500 species listed requiring need for conservation — more than double from the previous plan released in 2017.
Next week marks the halfway point for the public comment period on the guidance documents, which ends June 9. The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish is required to review and revise these plans every decade and submit them to the federal government. The plan will be considered for approval by the State Game Commission later this fall.
A warming climate, environmental fragmentation from development and threats like disease all pose threats for New Mexico species, even as it remains one of the most biodiverse states in the U.S., said Ginny Seamster, the assistant chief for technical guidance at the agency.
“Realistically, helping these species is an all-hands-on-deck effort,” she said. “We need everyone who’s interested to participate.”
The 2025 plan doubled the number of birds and includes pollinating insects (which help plants reproduce), which had been left off the species plan in past years,
“There are some species that are only associated with a single plant, so if you remove the pollinator from the ecosystem, you’re losing the plant, too,” Seamster said. “You’re multiplying the loss of biodiversity.”



How to participate
Public comment on the draft plan remains open until June 9, and can be submitted via email: dgf-SWAP@dgf.nm.gov
“Since this is a statewide plan, and we really want anyone who’s interested in a species of greatest conservation needs to be able to see themselves in it,” Seamster said.



The increase in species signals both the threats many animals in New Mexico face and the reforms underway at the wildlife agency. The State Wildlife plan dovetails with a series of changes the agency is enacting after the passage of Senate Bill 5 in the legislative session, which dramatically increased funding and expanded the scope of the department into the New Mexico Wildlife Department.
As states rethink wildlife management, New Mexico offers a new model

The Legislature approved a $10 million dollar three-year pilot project funding work related to species of greatest conservation need, and the department is now receiving several million dollars in interest from the Land of Enchantment Legacy Fund in addition to revenue from hunting and fishing fees.
The department is currently working to hire additional biologists to carry out the work, Seamster said, noting that previously,  it only assigned one biologist to non-game birds.
“There are over 500 species of birds found in the state, and nearly 150 birds are species of greatest conservation need. That is clearly too many species for one person to be able to address,” she said. “Having more staff means we can do a lot more research, a lot more habitat work.”
Advocates, who fought and succeeded in reforming the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, say they’re excited about the plan, which they hope will be the “gold standard” for wildlife agencies.
“Across the country, agencies are going to look at what New Mexico’s doing and see how we manage wildlife: from the top to the bottom, from the bumble bees to the bison,” said Jesse Deubel, executive director of the nonprofit New Mexico Wildlife Federation. “It’s all necessary for an intact ecosystem.”
Deubel said federal efforts to freeze and roll back conservation work exacerbate climate change impacts such as increased wildfire and shrinking wetlands. But funding for New Mexico’s wildfire agency comes from the state, he noted. That means: “We’re going to be able to continue doing unbelievable conservation and habitat work in New Mexico, despite the dysfunction that’s happening at the federal level,” he said.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The tax provisions in House Republicans’ so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” would overwhelmingly benefit Minnesota’s wealthiest families, according to an analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a progressive think tank in DC.
 
If the bill passes the Senate and wins the signature of President Trump, the bottom 20% of Minnesota households, with incomes of less than $36,000, would see an average tax benefit of about $250, or 1.3% of household income. Families in the middle of the distribution, with incomes between $63,000 and $100,000, would get an average benefit of $2,000, or 2.4% of household income.
 
But Minnesota’s one-percenters, with incomes of $928,000 and above, would receive an average tax break of $66,000, adding up to 3.5% of their typical income.
 
All told, more than two-thirds of the bill’s benefits flow to the richest 20% of Minnesota families, according to ITEP’s estimate.
 
Those changes are measured against the baseline of current law, in which the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions expire at the end of the year. 
“For working-class Americans, the tax cuts in the House bill are extremely modest and overall taxes would rise for these families when the impact of higher import taxes, or tariffs, are accounted for,” ITEP’s authors write.
At the national level, for instance, the poorest 20% of households can expect to see their take-home pay increase by 1% as a result of the changes. But that’s more than offset by a roughly 2.4% decrease in spending power due to the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs.
The law’s provisions are also relatively favorable toward wealthy overseas investors. “Foreign investors who own shares in U.S. companies would benefit more than the poorest fifth of Americans,” ITEP’s authors write. “These foreign investors would enjoy $23 billion in tax cuts in 2026 compared to just $4 billion for the bottom 20% of Americans.”
Because Republicans are using a procedural known as “reconciliation,” the bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Republicans control 53 Senate seats, meaning they can lose three votes and still pass the bill with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President J.D. Vance.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250425_1154-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

Weisman/Rhode Island Current)You wouldn’t suspect any opposition to proposed pay raises for state troopers and correctional officers based on public hearings Friday morning.
The requisite meetings on new collective bargaining agreements held just before the holiday weekend concluded in under 10 minutes, with no public feedback on either contract. But legislative leaders are less than thrilled about the salary increases and accompanying benefits for roughly 1,250 state employees, which require $15 million more than what Gov. Dan McKee planned for in his fiscal 2026 budget proposal.
Unlike most other state employee unions, the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers and the Rhode Island Troopers Association had not inked new deals with the administration when McKee unveiled his proposed $14 billion spending plan in January.  So McKee put in a $30 million placeholder for the yet-to-be signed contracts.
Turns out, the agreements are actually going to cost the state $45 million over the next  two years, rather than the $30 million McKee budgeted. 
Hardly welcome news to the leaders of the Rhode Island General Assembly already grappling with a budget deficit and potentially devastating federal funding cuts just weeks before the end of the 2025 legislative session. A spending plan must be approved by the start of the new fiscal year on July 1.
“Unfortunately, the newly revealed shortfall from the Administration’s contract settlements is not the only issue we need to address in the budget,” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi said in an emailed statement. “It certainly worsens the situation and is, frankly, beyond frustrating.”
Senate President Valarie Lawson also appeared caught off-guard by the unexpected cost hike, which she said she learned about on Wednesday.
“While this is deeply concerning, I will work with the Senate Finance Committee to address this unexpected challenge,” Lawson said in an emailed statement.
Laura Hart, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, defended the contract costs in an emailed response Friday, noting that the third-quarter revenue report from the state budget office shows an extra $60.9 million expected to flow into state coffers by the end of the fiscal year 2025.
“The Governor encourages the General Assembly to support the contractual increases for public safety personnel using these dollars in the upcoming budget,” Hart said.
Retroactive cost-of-living hike for State Police
Both contracts call for annual cost-of-living adjustments starting at 5% in year one, with a 4% second-year bump and a 3% adjustment in the third year — identical to the incremental scale adopted for 4,000 other state employees under contracts finalized last fall. So how did McKee mess up the math?
For one, the raises for 255 state troopers start earlier than expected: the 5% pay bump is retroactive to Nov. 1, 2023, rather than the July 1, 2024, start date for other state union workers, including correction officers, said Karen Greco, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Department of Administration. The tentative agreement, reached on Feb. 28, also features a “uniform allowance” not accounted for in the governor’s budget projections, Greco said.
Erik Jensen, president of the state troopers union, acknowledged but did not offer a response to questions about the agreement on Friday.
Richard Ferruccio, president of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, remained unsatisfied with the terms of the 1,000-member union’s new state contract, which was finalized on May 14 after months of arbitration.
“I don’t want to sound ungrateful,” Ferruccio said in an interview Friday. “But I still feel somewhat frustrated with it.”
His main grievance was not with the annual cost-of-living increases, but accompanying benefits that would make the union better able to attract and retain officers. Staffing woes at the Rhode Island Department of Corrections are well-documented, and costly; the 117 open positions as of March 22 is projected to lead to a $42.9 million overtime cost for the full fiscal year 2025, according to a presentation to state lawmakers in April. 










It certainly worsens the situation and is, frankly, beyond frustrating.


– House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi


Ferruccio blamed staffing shortages on uncompetitive benefits relative to other local law enforcement officers and neighboring states, where officers can reach the “top step” of pay in a shorter period of time. 
“There are only a handful of people that really want to get involved in any type of law enforcement,” Ferruccio said. “When you look at other local police departments, they have a significantly better situation with the top step than we do.”
He had hoped to lower the seniority requirement for union officers to reach maximum pay from its current 14 years to six years, matching the policy offered for correctional officers in Connecticut. But the compromise struck with the state cuts the length of service to 10 years beginning this June, and eight years starting in June 2026. The agreement also includes a 2.5% pay raise for anyone who stays at least 20 years. 
The governor’s budget did not account for the costs associated with these changes, either, Greco said. 
But Ferruccio said the final price tag should not have come as a surprise, noting that the changes to top step and retention benefits were longstanding asks by the union. 
“I think the governor was given bad information by DOC,” Ferruccio said. He pointed to the grossly underestimated cost to close the state’s minimum security facility — initially pegged at $1 million in McKee’s budget when a study found it would actually cost $67 million to $71 million — as an example of miscommunication by the corrections department.
J.R. Ventura, a spokesperson for the state corrections department, declined to comment when contacted Friday.
State worker contract costs are not the only expense McKee underestimated in his fiscal 2026 budget proposal. The state will also have to make up a $24 million shortfall in education aid to local school districts in its fiscal 2025 and 26 budgets due to corrected data on the number of students in poverty.

(University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture image.)President Donald Trump has declared a major disaster in Arkansas related to storms that caused widespread flooding and damage from April 2-22, according to a Federal Emergency Management Agency press release.
The disaster declaration covers a total of 39 counties, just over half of the state’s 75, through different disaster relief programs, according to the release. Sanders requested the declaration in a May 3 letter to Trump.
This will be the second major disaster declaration for the state this spring. Trump last week approved a major disaster declaration for nine counties affected by March 14-15 storms and tornadoes. He had initially denied the request but relented after a personal phone call from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, according to a May 13 statement from the governor’s office. Sanders served as Trump’s press secretary during part of his first term.
“As we recover from a long series of severe weather events, our state is incredibly thankful for President Trump’s leadership and work to deliver aid to storm-impacted communities,” Sanders said in a press release Friday. 
Friday’s disaster declaration makes federal funding available to affected individuals in Clark, Clay, Craighead, Crittenden, Desha, Fulton, Hot Spring, Jackson, Miller, Ouachita, Pulaski, Randolph, Saline, Sharp, St. Francis and White counties, the FEMA press release said. Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.

“Federal funding is also available to state, tribal, eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by severe storms, tornadoes and flooding in Clark, Clay, Craighead, Cross, Dallas, Desha, Fulton, Greene, Hempstead, Hot Spring, Izard, Jackson, Lafayette, Lawrence, Lee, Little River, Lonoke, Marion, Miller, Monroe, Montgomery, Nevada, Newton, Pike, Poinsett, Prairie, Pulaski, Randolph, Saline, Scott, Searcy, Sevier, Sharp, St. Francis, Stone and Woodruff counties,” FEMA said.
The federal disaster declaration comes after Sanders announced Thursday that the state will cover up to 35% of the cleanup and rebuilding costs county and local governments incurred from the March tornadoes and storms.
Local and county governments will have to submit expense documentation to the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management, according to a press release. ADEM staff will review the reimbursement requests and inspect the projects before funds are disbursed, the release said.
Roland W. Jackson has been named the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected areas. 
Individuals and business owners who sustained losses in the designated areas should first file claims with their insurance providers and then apply for assistance by registering online at www.DisasterAssistance.gov, by calling 1-800-621-3362 or by using the FEMA App, the release said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Flooded-store-Sharp-Fulton-0425-e1745602466140.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

DemasThe push to get Michiganders’ identification cards replaced with federally-compliant REAL ID cards has resulted in 200,000 IDs issued to residents over a period of three months, the Michigan Department of State announced Friday.
Department employees either issued new or upgraded REAL IDs over the past 12 weeks, bringing the state into more than 76% compliance with a new U.S. requirement for REAL ID in order to travel domestically by air.
A REAL ID is a driver’s license or state identification card that has been verified with proof of U.S. citizenship and proof of legal residence in the U.S. They are distinguishable by the gold star in the upper right-hand corner. Per a change in federal law, Michigan residents as of May 7 are required to present a REAL ID-complaint card when attempting to fly anywhere in the U.S. The IDs also allow entrance to certain federal facilities as allowed by federal law. Overall, the IDs have protections against copying or altering identification information.

REAL IDs are different from Michigan’s enhanced IDs and driver’s licenses, which allow entry to and from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda or the Caribbean by land or sea. Enhanced IDs, however, are also REAL ID compliant.
A news release issued Friday said Secretary of State branch offices served more than 90% of those customers within 20 minutes of their scheduled appointment times, signaling that the transition has been relatively smooth thus far.
“The hardworking staff at our branch offices throughout the state rose to this challenge and set a new standard of exceptional public service,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement. “I’m grateful for their dedication and commitment to excellence, which ensured a smooth process for Michiganders during a potentially disruptive transition. This is what it means to have a state government that truly works for people.” 
A total of 202,571 REAL ID-compliant driver’s licenses or state IDs were issued between February 23 and May 17. The week of May 4 was said to be the busiest this year, with 28,289 identification cards converted to REAL ID.

It’s a corporate giveaway. (Getty Images)As a proud Nevadan and Lake Tahoe resident who cherishes our public lands and forests, I feel compelled to speak out against the so-called “Fix Our Forests Act” (FOFA). Don’t let the title fool you! This federal legislation is no fix. In fact, it’s a reckless attempt to hand over the keys to our national forests to corporate logging interests under the guise of wildfire prevention. If passed, FOFA would open the floodgates to massive, unchecked logging projects that threaten the very landscapes we hold dear in Nevada and across the country.
Let’s start with the most alarming piece: FOFA would enable a Trump executive order to ramp up commercial logging across nearly 60% of America’s national forests. This is not hyperbole. It’s a direct result of language in FOFA that weakens environmental protections and strips the public of its voice in managing these lands. The bill allows agencies to bypass crucial environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Endangered Species Act (ESA). Incredibly, it even permits NEPA reviews to happen after logging projects have already been completed, undermining the entire purpose of environmental oversight.
It gets worse. FOFA dramatically expands the size of “Categorical Exclusions” (CEs), administrative loopholes that allow certain forest projects to dodge public review and environmental study. Under FOFA, logging operations up to 10,000 acres (15 square miles) could move forward without any public input. To put that into perspective, that’s roughly the size of more than 7,500 football fields, cleared without so much as a town hall meeting. That’s not forest management, that’s a corporate giveaway.
The bill also advances a deeply flawed narrative: that commercial logging and grazing are effective wildfire mitigation strategies. The science says otherwise. Study after study has shown that the most effective ways to protect communities from wildfire involve local measures, like creating defensible space around homes, hardening buildings against fire, and developing emergency response plans. FOFA includes no funding for these proven strategies. Instead, it funnels energy and attention into large-scale commercial logging, which may actually increase fire risk by removing old-growth trees that are naturally more fire-resistant.
Here in Nevada, we understand the value of healthy, resilient ecosystems. Our forests aren’t just scenic backdrops. They’re critical to our water supplies, our recreation, and our identity. The Fix Our Forests Act threatens that balance. It’s a Trojan horse for deregulation, designed to sideline science, slash public involvement, and clear the way for extractive industries. Worse yet, it aligns directly with recent moves by the Trump administration to prioritize timber extraction over environmental stewardship. Just days before FOFA was introduced in the Senate, Trump’s Secretary of Agriculture released a memo implementing an executive order to massively expand logging across federal lands.
This is the same administration that has gutted staff at the U.S. Forest Service and slashed funding for wildfire prevention. If President Trump and the U.S. Congress truly cared about protecting communities, we’d see investments in firefighter support, forest restoration, and climate resilience, not just more clear-cutting. Instead, his executive order and FOFA combine to create a dangerous one-two punch: under-resourced forest agencies forced to chase arbitrary timber targets, at the expense of meaningful wildfire mitigation.
Let’s be clear: climate change, not tree density, is the root driver of the catastrophic wildfires we’ve seen across the West. Rising temperatures, prolonged drought, and increasingly erratic weather patterns are drying out our forests and setting the stage for firestorms. Logging our way out of this problem is not just shortsighted, it’s counterproductive. More logging won’t bring back the rain. What we need is bold, climate-smart leadership that prioritizes long-term forest health and community safety over short-term industry profits.
Unfortunately, Congresswoman Susie Lee (NV-03) and Congressman Mark Amodei (NV-02) cosponsored FOFA in the House, and Congressman Steven Horsford (NV-04) voted for the bill. Congresswoman Dina Titus (NV-01) was Nevada’s lone “nay.” The bill will now make its way through the U.S. Senate and Nevada’s senators haven’t yet revealed how they plan to vote.
Whether we’re talking about FOFA or Trump’s executive orders, the bottom line is the same: this is an attack on our public lands. These are lands that belong to all of us, not just the timber lobby or political donors. Nevada’s senators, and senators across the country for that matter, should reject FOFA in its current form. We need our representatives to stop looking at our public lands with dollar signs in their eyes. Instead, they should champion legislation that supports fire-resilient communities through real solutions: funding for home hardening, local emergency planning, defensible space projects, and prescribed fire treatments guided by science and Indigenous knowledge.
We need forest policy rooted in stewardship, not exploitation. Nevada deserves better, and so do the forests we all depend on.

SPRINGFIELD – Illinois lawmakers have one week to pass a new state budget with little room for new spending and Congress presenting further challenges and uncertainty.

Revenue projections had already been declining as the spring session has progressed. Now, lawmakers who have long feared further federal cuts, are grappling with the U.S House’s passage of a spending plan that Illinois’ Senate president warns would be “catastrophic for working families” – as well as state finances.

“There's no state in the union that could survive the sorts of cuts they're proposing to health care for working families,” Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, told Capitol News Illinois about the bill that still needs U.S. Senate approval.

The General Assembly has through May 31 to pass a budget with a simple majority vote before the threshold increases to a three-fifths vote on June 1. House Democrats approved a portion of last year’s budget with the minimum number of votes required to pass a bill after several Democrats dissented over spending concerns.

The state’s fiscal picture is even more challenging this year. The Governor’s Office of Management and Budget lowered revenue projections earlier this month for fiscal year 2026, which begins July 1, by $536 million from its February estimate, to $54.9 billion in revenue.

Harmon told host Jak Tichenor on the latest episode of “Illinois Lawmakers” that Senate Democrats have been told not to expect spending for new programs this year.

“This is a tougher year than we've seen in recent years; certainly the toughest since I've been Senate president,” Harmon said. “We have some newer members who've never had to put together a budget like this one, so we tried to make sure people tempered their expectations.”

Gov. JB Pritzker’s introduced spending plan, which was proposed in February before the latest revenue projection cuts, called for a 3% increase in state spending in a budget totaling $55.2 billion. But outside of education, health care and pensions, spending was only projected to grow by 1%.

The revenue projection cut means lawmakers likely have even less room for spending increases than what Pritzker requested in February.

“The biggest thing that I've said to the caucus pretty consistently since day one is that no one's going to get everything they want, that we have to have reasonable expectations, that we have to balance the budget,” House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, told Capitol News Illinois last week. “We're going to spend what we bring in, no more.”

Federal budget uncertainty

The challenge of balancing the budget was complicated even further Thursday when, in the early morning hours, the U.S. House passed legislation to enact much of President Donald Trump’s domestic agenda, which includes slashing federal spending on Medicaid, education and clean energy programs.

“The Trump administration and his policies are throwing a lot of uncertainty and making it a lot harder for us to determine how we're going to pay for the programs and services that our families rely on in Illinois,” state Rep. Anna Moeller, D-Elgin, who chairs a legislative working group that focuses on Medicaid policy, said during an interview.

Medicaid, the health care program for low-income individuals that is jointly funded with state and federal dollars, is one of the largest categories of state government spending. The program is jointly funded with state and federal funds and provides health care coverage to more than 3.4 million people in Illinois, or about a fourth of the state’s population.

In fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of Healthcare and Family Services, the state received approximately $20 billion in federal matching funds for Medicaid. That represented about 62% of the program’s total cost.

But the legislation that passed the U.S. House Thursday morning would make substantial changes to the program that would both reduce the number of people covered by Medicaid and the amount of federal matching funds the state receives.

One of the most significant provisions that would affect Illinois, according to a summary by the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF, would reduce the federal match rate paid for people enrolled through the Affordable Care Act expansion group by 10 percentage points.

Under that 2010 health insurance reform law, also known as “Obamacare,” states were allowed to expand eligibility for Medicaid to include working-age adults, including those without dependents, with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.

In Illinois, more than 772,000 people are enrolled in Medicaid under that program and the federal government pays 90% of the cost of their care, according to IDHFS. But the House legislation would drop that matching rate to 80% for Illinois and other states that also provide health coverage or financial assistance to people who are not lawfully present in the United States.

IDHFS has estimated that provision would cost Illinois approximately $815 million in federal matching funds per year because the state currently operates two such programs – one for adults ages 42-64, and another for seniors over age 65 – although Pritzker has proposed eliminating the one for adults under age 65.

Under current state law, however, coverage under the ACA expansion program automatically ends if the federal government ever lowers its reimbursement rate below 90%.

Other provisions of the congressional bill would require states to impose work requirements on enrollees in the ACA expansion group and require those individuals to verify their eligibility for the program at least twice per year.

“We don’t have the resources to backfill that,” Moeller said. “It would be beyond the scope of our budget right now to be able to do that.”

The total impact the proposed legislation would have on Illinois remains unclear, and the bill still must be considered by the U.S. Senate, which could make changes of its own.

Illinois would also have to spend more on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, beginning in 2028. The bill would require states to pay for 5% of benefits and 75% of administrative costs, rather than 50% of administrative costs and nothing for benefits.

Other parts of the plan would slash federal tax incentives for clean energy and nuclear projects by the end of 2028, potentially forcing the state to pay more to reach its goal of carbon-free electricity by 2045.

It's possible lawmakers will return to Springfield later this year to update the FY26 budget based on changes at the federal level.

“This president can send out a tweet that changes the world, and we may have to come back,” Welch said. “And so, we've been preparing the caucus that that's a possibility: know that something could happen based on the federal budget that brings us back.”

But Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, said there might not be any reason to have a special session to adjust the budget later this year after reviewing what the U.S. House passed.

“I think that's pretty silly, considering nothing will be effective immediately. We'll have a lot of time to adjust,” Spain said.

Budget pressures in Illinois

Other legislative reforms being considered this spring also come with budget implications, and many may be off the table for now, according to Harmon.

Lawmakers are continuing to work toward a funding solution to cover a $771 million funding gap for Chicago-area public transportation agencies in 2026. Despite being close to agreements on reforms for the agencies, funding remains undecided.

Harmon suggested that people using the roadways rather than public transit could be a key funding source, while Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado, D-Chicago, who leads public transit talks in the House, said lawmakers are continuing to look at all options to close the gap.

Pension reform has also been discussed to improve benefits for public employees who entered the system since 2011 and fix compliance with Social Security law.

“All of the solutions, however, require more money, and this is a year when we just don't have much more money,” Harmon said. “So I expect some of those conversations to continue into the summer.”

The same is true for changing how colleges and universities are funded. Lawmakers have held hearings on a plan that would prioritize funding to universities not receiving an adequate level of funding based on a mathematical formula.

“I don't see the requisite amount of money being driven into higher education funding formulas to achieve the outcome this year,” Harmon said.

Pritzker has said he will not look at major tax hikes to balance the budget and asked lawmakers in February to come up with corresponding cuts for any new spending they want. He also proposed about $400 million in tax changes to balance the budget.

But as progressive groups rallied in the capitol Thursday in favor of $6 billion of tax increases they want lawmakers to consider, Republicans feared Democrats will be tempted to tap into taxpayers to fund larger spending increases. House Democrats reviewed possible tax increases in a closed-door meeting Thursday afternoon.

“The legislature has a great track record of using this time, squandering time for many months, and using the waning hours of the legislative session to enact gigantic changes that have real world consequences for taxpayers,” Spain told reporters.

Republicans hope Pritzker exercises caution.

“I know the governor in our first conversations before the budget address, when we sat down together, he wasn't celebrating,” House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told reporters. “He knew that this was going to be a tough year, and it's going to continue to get tough as we go forward.”

The budget is typically unveiled publicly a day or two before lawmakers leave Springfield for the year, meaning more details about spending and tax plans won’t be available likely until at least Thursday.

“Less than 10 days out, it’s exactly where you’d expect to be: more questions than answers,” Sen. Chapin Rose, R-Mahomet, told Capitol News Illinois.

Allen's home in Bayou Dularge on Sept. 12, 2024, one day after Hurricane Francine made landfall in Terrebonne Parish. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)As hurricane season begins June 1, new studies point to an increasing risk of loss from severe wind and water damage common during these intense storms.
Published in the Society for Risk Analysis’ journal, a study by University of Illinois researcher and civil engineer Eun Jeong Cha predicts the risk of loss from hurricane-related winds could increase up to 76% as soon as 2060 for states in the Southeast, including Louisiana.
“These states experience the highest hurricane activity and associated wind-related losses in the U.S.,” Cha said in a news release. “They represent a critical region for understanding how climate change may alter hurricane risk.”
While much of the damage from storms is caused by water, over 40% of residential storm-related losses from hurricanes are attributed to heavy winds, costing the U.S. economy an expected $14 billion annually, according to a 2019 Congressional Budget Office report. 
Cha and her colleague, Chi-Ying Lin, used artificial intelligence to simulate a “worst-case” scenario of how a hurricane – supercharged by warming oceans and global climate change – would affect a single family wood-framed home with concrete masonry. 
“We view it as a stress-test scenario for hurricane wind risk,” Cha said, explaining the worst-case scenario can help communities prepare for the most severe storm, even if reality is less impactful.
Her model is based on a predicted future with maximum fossil fuel emissions and no policy to mitigate the effects of climate change, as detailed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a United Nations offshoot. The scenario would see an increase in the global average temperature of at least 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit by 2065. 
Over time, the hurricane damage risk increases even more, with a 102% higher chance of storm-related loss in 2100 should the global average temperature increase the anticipated 6.7 degrees Fahrenheit. 
Cha said studies like hers do more than just spread alarm and awareness. Understanding how future risk increases can help experts understand how to build resiliency into communities, “providing valuable insights for policymakers, urban planners, and the insurance industry.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Home-damage-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

(John Gray/Verite News)A bill requiring local governments to enforce a ban on sleeping on public property passed through a Louisiana legislative committee Wednesday within the hearing’s final minutes, though housing advocates and groups that serve the homeless say it remains problematic in its current form.  
The proposal, House Bill 619 by Rep. Alonzo Knox, D-New Orleans, would direct local governments to enforce a ban on “public camping” or face possible lawsuits. Local governments could instead designate government-sanctioned encampments – much like the recent state-operated “Transition Center” in New Orleans – in areas where they wouldn’t “materially affect the property value” of homes or businesses.
Any resident or business within 1,000 feet of an illegal public camp, as well as a local district attorney, would be able to sue local governments if they failed to enforce the ban. 
Knox’s bill also requires homeless service providers who receive state funds to provide detailed documentation of their work to municipalities upon request or else lose their funding. Unity of Greater New Orleans, the leading nonprofit serving the city’s homeless population, has drawn scrutiny from Knox and others for not providing more specific data on how it spends federal dollars.

Knox has repeatedly accused housing nonprofits of waste and decried the “homeless industrial complex.” He pushed for the legislative audit of New Orleans’ Continuum of Care providers earlier this year. It found that the city and Unity spent $216 million between 2019-24, with the majority of funds going toward permanent supportive housing.
The audit also found that shelters need better oversight to ensure they’re meeting minimum health and safety standards. 
When Knox’s measure was brought up Wednesday in the House Committee on Health and Welfare, it was after hearings on two other bills spanned more than three hours. Chairman Rep. Dustin Miller, D-Opelousas, noted that 11 people wanted to speak against Knox’s bill but wouldn’t have time because the House had already convened on the floor. 
Committee members were given the option to defer Knox’s bill until next week but chose instead to continue the meeting. With limited time, Miller limited the opposition to just three speakers. Two attendees who’ve experienced homelessness were among those who didn’t have the chance to speak.
Knox agreed to amendments suggested by Rep Chris Turner, R-Ruston, which included changes in how the bill defines dwelling structures and extended the timeline for encampment clearing notices. Committee members suggested that the amendments should remove opposition to the bill.
But opponents said the amendments did not allay their concerns, and in some cases even increased the risk of harm. 
‘Serious legal and ethical conflicts’
The state-sanctioned encampments proposed in Knox’s bill parallel Gov. Jeff Landry’s recent transition center in New Orleans, set up at a warehouse in a remote industrial section of the city. Unsheltered people were taken there from encampments downtown just before the Super Bowl. 
Knox toured and praised the site while it was open, but his bill has sparked questions about how money for housing can be spent most efficiently.
Landry’s transition center, which cost about $17 million, ultimately placed 108 people in permanent supportive housing. Since 2023, Unity of Greater New Orleans has spent $2.3 million to permanently house 275 people, according to the audit.
The state spent about $100,000 per person on the warehouse site over 10 weeks, compared to the $20,000 per year it costs to provide housing and support services per person, said Angela Owczarek with the Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a housing rights advocacy.
A pandemic-era emergency rental assistance program, which ended last year, cost about $3,000 per New Orleans household to prevent homelessness for those facing eviction, Owczarek said. 
Elsa Dimitradis, executive director of Acadiana Regional Coalition on Homelessness and Housing, testified that she had “serious concerns” about Knox’s bill, particularly the mandate about sharing client information with local governments. She warned the potential violations of privacy and disability laws could jeopardize $93 million in federal funding for housing nonprofits across the state. 
Unity of Greater New Orleans is already suing the state for trying to compel the organization to produce protected information about its clients, such as medical histories and Social Security numbers. 
Dimitradis also testified that the bill as written “appears to allow for open-ended demands at any time without clear standards or limitations,” which is “an operational threat.”
Hannah Adams of the National Housing Law Project argued the bill should provide exceptions to the ban if local governments are actively working to rehouse people. 
“Clearing an encampment when social workers are actively working to rehouse individuals does interfere with their ability to maintain contact and secure long-term housing for their clients,” Adams told the committee. 
The audit, likewise, noted that unexpected NOPD sweeps and state pressure to clear encampments contributed to delays in the city’s rehousing efforts.
Monique Blossom, director of policy at Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center, also warned that by directing state officials to inspect group homes, the bill risks violating the federal Fair Housing Act, opening the state to liability. The bill could lead to the shuttering of some group homes, including domestic violence shelters, sober living homes and even homes for seriously ill children who need to stay near hospitals, she said
Donna Paramore, executive director of the Travelers Aid Society of Greater New Orleans, told Illuminator the group is in “strong opposition” to the bill despite the amendments. 
“The framework it proposes still undermines essential safeguards for vulnerable populations,” Paramore said. The issues outlined by Dimitradis “could jeopardize federal funding” and “create serious legal and ethical conflicts,” she added. 
Paramore also noted her nonprofit undergoes an independent financial audit each year and has never had an adverse finding. She said that instead of banning public encampments, the state should expand supportive housing, behavioral health services and trauma-informed care.
Knox dismissed objections at the close of the hearing, calling some “technical and nitpicking.” He rejected Adams’ request for leniency when social workers are actively working on rehousing someone.
“If that language were to be included, they will always be ‘actively working,’” Knox said. 
The representative’s office did not respond to a request for comment after hearing.

Emily Votruba’s love of animals was sparked early, during childhood summers at her grandma’s cottage on Old Mission Peninsula.
She’d watch frogs in the nearby pond and worry about how ultraviolet radiation from the hole in the ozone would harm them.
But when she moved back to Michigan in 2010, she started thinking about turtles.
After living in New York City for over a decade, she wasn’t used to driving. Here, she was confronted with a lot of roadkill.

Roads across the country have diced up habitats, devastating animal populations and their ecosystems.
Driving on those roads, it can be almost impossible to avoid sprinting deer or scurrying squirrels. But turtles are, well, slow. And to Votruba, it seemed they were unnecessary casualties in the otherwise unavoidable collisions between cars and wildlife.
“I saw one right on [M-22] in the village that had just been run over in the middle of the road and was still there,” she said of a sighting a few years ago. “I’m pretty sure it was still alive. It had a cracked shell, was mostly crushed, but was not dead yet.”
In the village of Elberta, the speed limit is 30 miles per hour or less, but Votruba said people often go faster. And there are sections of Elberta’s roads that are especially dangerous, like a bend on M-22 near the Betsie Valley Trail.
“Coming around that corner, it would be so easy to just hurt a turtle (or) hurt a person who was trying to help them,” she said.
So Votruba got together with fellow county residents Mark and Carol Carlin to do something about it. The Carlins own The Elberta Mercantile Co. and are also DJs at the community radio station WUWU 100.1 FM.
Motivating them was “a combination of traffic safety and turtle safety coming together, and also being concerned about the people like us who like to help turtles,” she said.
The grassroots group held the first Turtlefest last year.
People made turtle crossing signs to post at key areas. They also worked with the Michigan Department of Transportation to install an official turtle crossing sign in that area. The signs go up at the start of turtle crossing season in the spring and come down around the end of July. The Portage Lake Watershed Association and the Benzie Conservation District have also put up signs at some key crossing locations.


Turtlefest 2025:
Turtlefest takes place from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on May 24 at 654 Frankfort Ave. in downtown Elberta. You can expect sign painting, food for sale and more. It’s free to attend.


Michigan is home to 10 turtle species; three are threatened within the state according to the state Department of Natural Resources: the wood turtle, the spotted turtle, and the eastern box turtle. One — the Blanding’s turtle — is of special concern.
A recent DNR newsletter outlined the dangers of the road for these reptiles. Turtle eggs and young face high predation, but as they get older their survival rate increases drastically, so their conservation depends heavily on adult survival, wrote state fisheries biologist Tom Goniea.
Turtles are on the move in the spring and summer. Females look for nesting sites and males “just kind of wander this time of year,” Goniea wrote, asking drivers to slow down and keep an eye out for the reptilian travelers.
Since the signs went up last year, Votruba said, many people have told her they’re excited to see more awareness around the issue.
“I think a lot of people feel like they’re the only one who cares,” she said, and knowing they’re not alone in that feeling is powerful. “If that message gets out there, then maybe it makes it safer for everyone who’s interested in helping the turtles.”

How to help turtles

Stay alert around bridge crossings and roads near water
If you see a turtle in the road, slow down and try to avoid hitting it if it’s possible to do so safely
If you decide to help a turtle cross the road and it’s safe to do so, move the turtle in the direction its head is pointing — it knows where it wants to go
Be gentle with the turtle, don’t pick it up by its tail
If a turtle is on the side of the road, make sure it’s not digging a nest for eggs before trying to move it
Unless the turtle is in immediate danger, leave it alone",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Community-turtle-crossing-sign.jpg,,,2025-05-23 14:11:38.397241

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis has signed a measure (SB 472) that ensures that credits earned from prison-based classes count toward professional licensing, providing more opportunities for the formerly incarcerated to become self-sufficient.
The Correctional Education Program (CEP) within the Department of Corrections provides educational programming to inmates. The CEP provides 92 career and technical education courses in 37 vocational trades that are aligned to Florida’s in-demand occupations, including barbering, cosmetology, electrical contracting, landscaping, plumbing, and HVAC contracting, according to a bill analysis.
The CEP has awarded 36,689 certificates and industry-recognized credentials over the last four years. However, these certificates were largely only valid while the people receiving them were incarcerated, and they are not recognized outside of prison, according to the Florida Policy Institute.
“The measure signed [Thursday] will help remedy that by ensuring that credits earned from prison-based classes are recognized and counted toward professional licensing requirements,” said institute CEO Sadaf Knight in a statement. “Additionally, common-sense reforms like this one that bolster workforce opportunities for returning citizens can save taxpayer dollars spent on incarceration costs by reducing the rate of recidivism.”
The measure requires the Department of Corrections, in coordination with applicable licensing boards within the Department of Business and Professional Regulation (DBPR), or DBPR when there isn’t a board, to design a program that ensures credits earned from prison classes are recognized and counted toward professional licensing requirements.
The measure was sponsored in the Senate by Central Florida Republican Keith Truenow and in the House by Miami-Dade Democrat Kevin Chambliss and Seminole County Republican Rachel Plakon.
“The most important factor for reformed individuals in preventing recidivism is employment upon one’s release from prison,” said Chambliss in a statement. “For inmates that have shown that they wish to be productive members of society upon the completion of their sentence, the state has a responsibility to make their transition as smooth as possible.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 17:17:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Will CT lawmakers expand parole eligibility?,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/ct-parole-eligibility-expansion/,Current law makes parole available to certain individuals — but only for sentences rendered before October 2005. A bill would change that.,"This story has been updated.
Advocates, family members and friends of incarcerated individuals say it’s critical that a bill expanding eligibility for parole — the early release from prison under supervision and with certain conditions — be approved through by the Connecticut legislature before its 2025 session ends in two weeks. 
Current law allows those who have been convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 and 21 to become eligible for parole after serving a portion of their sentence. People sentenced to less than 50 years may become eligible for parole after serving either 12 years or 60% of their sentence. People sentenced to more than 50 years reach eligibility after 30 years in prison. 
That only applies to crimes for which the perpetrator was sentenced before October 1, 2005. The proposed bill would extend eligibility to individuals who committed crimes between the ages of 18 and 21 on any date up to the present day. 
The bill passed through the legislature’s Judiciary Committee last month and it awaits debate in the House of Representatives. House Democratic leaders told reporters that lawmakers intend to take up the bill for debate, but that they were not sure when. The legislature’s 2025 session ends June 4.
Majority leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, told The Connecticut Mirror Thursday that the delay wasn’t over political disagreement; rather, caucus leaders were still determining which bills they wanted to prioritize. 
House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he didn’t expect he would be in support of the bill, but he said he couldn’t say for sure until he’d seen it.
For families of incarcerated people, the legislature’s decision can’t come soon enough.
Nicole Spears, who grew up in Meriden, told CT Mirror that the proposed legislation would help her brother, Robert Marrow. Marrow was incarcerated for a crime he committed at the age of 20, and he was sentenced in 2006. That makes him ineligible for parole under current law. 
Spears said her brother fell in with the “wrong crowd” after their parents passed away. Marrow was fourteen when their mother died from a long illness, and their father had a fatal heart attack one year later. 
“ My father died in his arms,” she said of Marrow. “They were traveling and he died at a rest stop, and my little brother was with him. It’s just, I think, hard to take,” she said. 
Spears said it’s been difficult to visit her brother at times. They’ve kept in touch through letters and phone calls, and sometimes she sends money or packages. Spears said she brought her daughter, who is now 26, to visit as a small child, but her younger son has never met his uncle.
Personal impacts
Elizabeth Hinton, a professor of history, African American studies and law at Yale, said addressing sentencing policy was key to correcting racial disparities in the criminal justice system. She estimated that about 258 people would become eligible for parole if the bill passes, 166 of whom are Black.
Hinton said she hoped Connecticut would follow the model established in California, where people who committed a crime between the ages of 18 and 25 can apply for parole at certain intervals during their incarceration. 
Hinton said granting eligibility for parole wouldn’t automatically mean people’s sentences would be reduced or that they’d be released early. Incarcerated people would still have to go before the parole board, which makes final decisions on whether to approve people for parole. 
Expanding the parole program also has positive financial impacts for the state and local communities, Hinton added. “The amount of money that Connecticut taxpayers will save is huge. If we keep all of those people in for their full sentences, that’s going to amount to hundreds of millions of dollars overtime,” she said. 
Hinton recommended that the state consider how it might redirect those funds into things like education, housing access and expanded job opportunities.
Several Republican lawmakers, along with Connecticut’s Office of the Victim Advocate, opposed the bill.
Natasha Pierre, the state’s victim advocate, argued in testimony to the legislature’s Judiciary Committee in March that the state should conduct a 10-year study on the fallout of its recent criminal justice reforms before further opening up parole options. 
“Reform strategies should serve not only public safety and the interests of the accused; but must serve those personally harmed by crime. The ever-changing sentencing landscape in criminal cases has had and will continue to have a detrimental impact of victims of crime,” she said in written testimony. 
Many incarcerated individuals who submitted testimony in favor of the bill said that once they were incarcerated, they began taking steps to improve their lives. They took college courses and earned degrees and certifications, became involved in Alternative to Violence programs and other rehabilitative programs, and they mentored others in the prison. 
“Neighborhood notoriety is something that most kids in urban environments seek and will do abnormal things to receive. I was too immature and blind to identify any potential in myself and that made it easy for the wrong person with influence to guide me,” wrote Patrick Young, who was incarcerated at the age of 20 for assault with a sentence of 31 years. 
Maurice Blackwell, who was incarcerated for a murder he committed at age 19, was sentenced in 2002 to 60 years in prison. Under current law, he became eligible for parole and was recently released. 
Blackwell told CT Mirror that when his father died in 2003, it was an “eyeopener” for him, and he began taking advantage of more of the resources available to him in prison. He became part of the first cohort of the Yale Prison Education Initiative, which offers college classes to incarcerated individuals. He’s now a student at the University of New Haven, and says he plans to pursue a law degree.
“I thought I was a man, when I was younger,” Blackwell said, adding that his perception has changed. “I was still a child.”

Brandi Bradley speaks on the Colorado House floor during the last day of the 2025 legislative session, May 7, at the Colorado Capitol. Bradley is a vocal opponent of House Bill 25-1312's transgender protections. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Of all the bills introduced this year at the Colorado Capitol, one came to define the legislative session for much of the right in Colorado. Even now that the session is over and the bill has become law, it is taking on new life as opponents exercise their outrage in schoolyard-bully social media posts, depraved sermons and a legal challenge in federal court.
The legislation, House Bill 25-1312, enacted several new protections for transgender people. Though the law was a reasonable response to escalating attacks against a besieged segment of the population, especially since the start of the Trump administration and its extreme anti-trans bias, the backlash it prompted is disproportionate, sinister and full of misinformation.
The first thing to understand about the trans rights law is that, while it contains several technical passages and underwent extensive debate and revision, the source of opposition to it has very little to do with the bill’s actual provisions. It’s about hate. It’s about bigotry against transgender people.
That’s all.

Opponents have become adept at advancing talking points that might sound superficially plausible — rhetoric about threats to women in sports, supposed adverse medical outcomes to minors who transition, parental rights infringements — but these arguments have the inconvenient quality of withering under evidence and counterpoints, and, worse, they’re a cover for the ultimate justification bigots use for discrimination against trans people: Christian scripture.
Many of the most virulent activists against the law have ties to or are pastors at politically right-wing churches. They justify every other point of opposition by their interpretation of the Bible, which in their reading says trans people are dangerous and beset by evil. Opposition to the law is simply a repugnant form of Christian sanctimony that serves little more than hate of a very recognizably human kind.
Many of the most contested provisions of the bill were amended out of the final version, yet some anti-trans activists continue to allude to those passages as part of their denunciations. View with extreme skepticism any criticism that discusses whether anti-trans parents could be disadvantaged in child custody cases or a shield provision against anti-trans laws in other states. Language around those issues were in the bill at one time but later stripped.










If they see me get frustrated and angry, they'll just use it against me. I can't let them ... I can't show any kinks in the armor, so to speak, because otherwise they'll try to slay me, and I can't let that happen.


– State Rep. Brianna Titone


The provision of the governor-signed HB-1312 that has drawn the most negative attention boosts anti-discrimination protections for transgender people in the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.
Republican state Rep. Brandi Bradley in a social media post and video after passage of the bill told her audience that anti-trans parents could lose custody of their trans children if they discriminate against them, that private schools, churches and other places of public accommodation could be sued for anti-trans discrimination, and that there’s no telling when someone deadnames or misgenders a trans person at what threshold discrimination liability kicks in.
This is all misleading. CADA has always prohibited discrimination and harassment against certain protected classes, and the protected classes have always included “gender identity” and “gender expression.” All HB-1312 does is clarify that gender expression could involve a “chosen name” and pronouns.
“Their claim that it’s now illegal is false,” state Rep. Lorena García, an Adams County Democrat who sponsored the bill, told Newsline this week. “It’s always been illegal.”
And it’s fearmongering to suggest that someone is liable to a discrimination allegation the moment they misgender or deadname someone. CADA covers particular settings, including employment, housing, and places of public accommodation. Churches and other places used for religious purposes are excluded. Incidental or accidental acts do not qualify as discrimination.
“Within CADA already, it’s already like discrimination has to be intentional,” García said. “So the fact that this is just being wrapped into gender identity, we’re not changing the threshold of when something is actually considered discrimination.”
But discrimination, it turns out, is exactly what some of the most outspoken 1312 critics intend. Many are Christian leaders and pastors, including Jeff Hunt, conservative radio host and former director of the Centennial Institute at Colorado Christian University; Chris Goble of Ridgeline Community Church in Castle Rock; J. Chase Davis of The Well Church in Boulder; and Aaron Carlson of New City Church in Highlands Ranch. Each one of these bullies has singled out state Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat who is the first transgender woman to serve in the Colorado Legislature, to intentionally deadname and misgender her.
The only plaintiff named as an individual in the lawsuit against HB-1312 is Travis Morrell, a Grand Junction dermatologist who online broadcasts faith-based motivations. A social media account called Fight1312 has become a primary source of anti-trans sentiment. Its posts make it clear that behind every variety of opposition to transgender rights is essentially one complaint, that God, as conceived by 1312’s opponents, commands them to hate transgender people.
“Our good God does not make mistakes,” Goble said in a video of a recent sermon, facing the camera and addressing Titone directly. He aggressively misgendered her and called on her to “repent.”
Titone herself detects an additional motivation among anti-trans activists, noting there have been other episodes throughout history when transgender people faced persecution.
“The big difference now, because of all the social media and everything else, they’re making money off of it,” she said. “So it’s not just finding an enemy and a scapegoat you can pick on, to gang up on and get people to come along with you for the kicking fest, but they’re actually making money off of it.”
But hate does real harm.
“Kids are scared,” Titone said. “I’ve heard from kids. They’re like, ‘I don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m afraid my grandfather’s not going to like who I am and they’re going to not want to talk to me anymore.'”
Her own response to bigots is public poise, legislative fortitude and personal resilience.
“If they see me get frustrated and angry, they’ll just use it against me. I can’t let them,” she said. “I can’t show any kinks in the armor, so to speak, because otherwise they’ll try to slay me, and I can’t let that happen.”

A legislative panel will mull statutory changes to protect TerraPower's Natrium security force from civil liability, including when using lethal force.
The post Wyoming nuclear developer wants legal protections for private, armed security force appeared first on WyoFile .","Don’t mess around at a nuclear power plant facility. If you have no business there but insert yourself anyway, you will be met with armed guards who are directed to “detect, assess, interdict and neutralize” all threats — including with lethal force.
Use of force in securing such facilities, including TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer, is required by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, according to agency officials. So are a litany of other security measures to ensure the sensitive operations don’t fall prey to “nuclear sabotage” — among the highest threats to U.S. national security, they say.
Trained security guards must assume that “adversaries would be dedicated and willing to exhibit lethal force and, quite frankly, receive lethal force in return,” NRC Regional State Liaison Officer Ryan Alexander told members of the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee on Thursday in Casper. 
TerraPower officials, who will use a highly enriched uranium fuel to power an “advanced” nuclear reactor, presented a draft bill, “Wyoming Security,” to the committee. They’re asking lawmakers to extend protections against civil lawsuits to a private security force, which the company will be required to install when it begins handling nuclear materials. In addition to describing potential statutory changes to accommodate lawful “use of force” by private security guards and related civil protections, the measure refers to standard NRC security requirements and what would be considered criminal trespass.

“Wyoming law currently lacks clear legal authority for trained security personnel performing these duties without such [legal] protection,” TerraPower Nuclear Security Manager Melissa Darlington testified. Without expressed legal protection, TerraPower would still be held to federal NRC standards of security enforcement, she added, which “may result in hesitancy [upon private security personnel] in implementing their duties.”
The committee directed the Legislative Service Office to work up draft legislation based on TerraPower’s proposed language, and agreed to continue discussion at its next hearing in July.
Though most committee members spoke in support of rigorous security — among the primary concerns they’ve heard from constituents regarding Natrium and other potential nuclear facilities — they want to avoid unintended consequences. Such civil liability protections, for example, should not extend to private security guards while not on duty at the nuclear plant, Laramie Democratic Sen. Chris Rothfuss suggested.
“TerraPower will have more security guards than there is law enforcement officers in Lincoln County.”Shane Johnson, Lincoln County Sheriff
“We have to explore, a little bit, how Wyoming statute [currently applies to] use of lethal force if you are not law enforcement,” he said. “We don’t typically grant civilians the right to lethal force, and particularly when they’re not representing the state or the community, [but] they’re representing a corporation.”
NRC officials admitted it’s a “delicate situation” for each state that hosts nuclear facilities.
“These protections are not unlimited,” said Darlington, who noted she will move to Kemmerer this summer to help oversee security at the Natrium plant. “They only apply to security personnel at commercial nuclear facility sites who are acting with reasonable belief and within the scope of their employment.”
Though some communities opt to train local law enforcement to qualify in on-site security efforts, that’s not likely to be the case in Lincoln County, according to TerraPower and local officials. Law enforcement will work closely with the company and NRC to coordinate emergency responses, said Lincoln County Sheriff Shane Johnson. But local agencies simply don’t have the resources or expertise to take on federal nuclear security.
“TerraPower will have more security guards than there is law enforcement officers in Lincoln County,” Johnson told the panel.
Several committee members expressed anxiety over providing civil liability protections to a private, corporate security force. Rothfuss suggested the committee should consider forming a special task force to explore the issue.
“When we’re writing statute, we don’t want to provide somebody who’s an armed-nuclear-security guard the authority to use deadly force on the other side of town,” he said.

It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”

Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Two Montana men foraging for mushrooms in the north-central part of the state shot and killed a grizzly bear on May 21, after it reportedly charged them at close range.
According to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, the two men were not harmed during the encounter.
The two local landowners were picking mushrooms about a mile north of Choteau on Wednesday evening when they came across the adult female grizzly bear, which charged them. The men shot and killed the bear at close range.
“I spoke to John and Justin shortly after the incident and they were both still shook up,” Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks Director Christy Clark said in a press release. “They told me their story and it was clear it was very traumatic. What’s important here is they’re OK.”
FWP officials said the female grizzly killed had a cub of the year with her at the time of the encounter, and the agency is attempting to capture the cub.
This is the fourth known grizzly bear mortality in 2025, according to FWP’s grizzly mortality dashboard, and the second grizzly death in Teton County this spring. The other mortality in Teton County is listed as under investigation, but FWP at the time described it as self defense.
The dashboard was launched last year to help the agency increase transparency and educate Montanans on why grizzlies are killed or die when they are currently federally protected. Earlier this year, the federal government rejected petitions from Montana and Wyoming officials seeking to delist the species and return them to state management, a proposal that is likely to gain traction under the Trump administration.
Bears are active along the Rocky Mountain Front and in areas around towns like Choteau, Ulm and Cascade. If you are experiencing conflicts with bears, please call your local FWP bear specialist. You can locate their contact information here.

Jim Pillen posing with President Donald Trump in the White House Oval Office. April 30, 2025. (Courtesy of Jim Pillen)LINCOLN — President Donald Trump this week approved a federal disaster declaration for mid-March winter storms in Nebraska with damage estimates exceeding $64 million.
Gov. Jim Pillen announced that Trump had signed the April 11 request this week. The federal declaration, the first request from Pillen in 2025 and his first under Trump, opens federal funding to cover damage costs in 27 counties. Much of the damage resulted from downed electrical lines and damaged utility poles — more than 1,700 poles were downed or destroyed. 
Major roadways closed due to the storm — producing thunderstorms, sleet, high winds and blizzard conditions — including a 160-mile stretch of Interstate 80.

An estimated 200,000 customers were left without power at the height of the storm, and some communities established emergency shelters to help those without electricity for a prolonged time.
Pillen had written to Trump that it was “one of the most destructive winter weather events to impact Nebraska in recent history” and that “emergency services were pushed to their limits.” 
“I appreciate President Trump’s attention to Nebraska and his approval of this disaster request,” Pillen said in a statement. “Federal funding will help cover the tremendous costs that were incurred as a result of this weather event.”
It’s not uncommon for some disaster declarations to be denied, but with some calls to shut down the Federal Emergency Management Agency altogether, including from Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, some national and state leaders had expressed concern. 
A spokesman for the National Security Council previously said states had to take on a more extensive role in emergency preparedness, including “an appetite to own the problem.”
Some local officials have told the Nebraska Examiner that if Trump had denied the Nebraska request, the costs could have fallen back on local property taxes.

Trump approved the request for 27 counties: Boone, Burt, Butler, Cass, Clay, Colfax, Cuming, Dodge, Douglas, Fillmore, Hamilton, Jefferson, Johnson, Lancaster, Nuckolls, Otoe, Platte, Polk, Saline, Sarpy, Saunders, Seward, Thayer, Thurston, Washington, Webster and York.
Pillen’s office said the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency has begun working with local emergency managers and public entities now eligible for assistance, including public utilities.
In 2024, under President Joe Biden, Pillen requested and was granted five federal disasters as he expressed a greater willingness to seek federal funding than his predecessors. Those declarations opened up $120 million in estimated preliminary damage costs for Nebraska.
Pillen this year also signed a state-level disaster declaration in February for wildfires in Custer and Dawes County and in April for a prescribed burn that got out of control in north-central Nebraska. He did not file a corresponding federal disaster request for either.

SPRINGFIELD – A bill unanimously passed by the Senate on Thursday and on its way to Gov. JB Pritzker’s desk will increase the age that senior drivers in Illinois are required to take an annual driver’s test.

Currently, if a driver renews their driver’s license between the ages of 79 and 80, they are required to take a driving test. Drivers between 81 and 86 are required to take a driving test every two years, and drivers 87 and older have to take the test annually.

If Pritzker signs House Bill 1226, sponsored by Sen. Ram Villivalam, D-Chicago, only drivers 87 and older will have to take an annual driver’s test. Illinois drivers between 79 and 86 won’t be required to take a driver’s test to renew their license; instead, they’ll only have to take a vision test, and if they have a driving violation, a written test.

The bill would also allow a spouse, parent, grandparent, sibling or child of any Illinois driver to submit medical information about the driver to the secretary of state if they think the person’s medical condition interferes with their driving abilities. Currently, only medical officials, police officers and state’s attorneys can submit such information.

HB 1226, also called the Road Safety and Fairness Act, has garnered bipartisan support. Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias announced his support for the bill in January alongside lawmakers from both sides of the aisle. The bill was conceived by a constituent of Rep. Jeff Keicher, R-Sycamore, last year.

The bill has 86 cosponsors in the House and 35 in the Senate.

Illinois is the only state that requires seniors to pass a driving test solely due to their age. But state data indicates that older drivers tend to have lower crash rates.

In 2023, the crash rate for drivers aged 75 and older was 24.61 per 1,000 drivers, which was lower than any other age group, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation. The low crash rate has been consistent since at least 2018, according to the Secretary of State’s Office’s 2023 Study on Age-Related Driving Abilities.

The crash rate is more than double for many of the other age groups.

Tate Reeves a proposed budget for approval. 
House Speaker Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann said separately that they have reached a handshake deal on a $7 billion state budget, which was supposed to have been passed earlier this year in regular session. 
Still, Reeves will ultimately have to give sign-off on it and order a special legislative session before all 174 lawmakers can consider it. 
Hosemann, the Senate’s presiding officer, told Mississippi Today in a statement that: “The House and Senate have come to an agreement on the budget. We have notified the Governor and are awaiting the call for special session.”
White gave a similar account on SuperTalk radio station this week and predicted lawmakers will vote on the budget to fund government services “within the next couple of weeks.” 
Mississippi lawmakers control the purse strings and the budget process. But they adjourned their 2025 regular session earlier this year without passing a budget because of political infighting. Now, legislators must return to the Capitol to pass a budget in a special session before the new budget year begins July 1.
The state Constitution gives the governor the sole power to call a special session, and Reeves alone sets the parameters for what lawmakers can consider in a special session. 
Reeves’ office did not respond to a request for comment on what his criteria will be for approving the budget before he calls the special session. But he told reporters earlier this year at a press conference that he wants legislative leaders to send him a fiscally responsible budget. 
White and Rep. Karl Oliver, a Republican from Winona who serves as a House appropriations chairman, previously said that most state agency budgets will have level funding, with only increases for the public pension system and insurance costs. 
One of the significant points of contention between the two chambers has been how to spend cash not allocated to government operations. Lawmakers typically spend this money on capital projects across the state — including many lawmakers’ pet projects in their districts. 
The Senate wanted to spend only on projects for state agencies, universities and colleges. The House believed there is enough money to fund projects in counties and municipalities around the state, in addition to the state projects. 
The political reality is that legislative leadership tightly controls the bulk of the local projects in what’s often referred to as the “Christmas Tree bill.” Leadership can use these projects to reward people who buy into their agenda and punish members who buck the leadership. 
Such special projects for back home are often a key focus of rank-and-file lawmakers who don’t have prominent leadership roles at the Capitol.

The Mississippi Department of Archives and History helps manage the exhibits of the park, and state money typically flows through the agency. Because the state agency helps manage the area, this was part of the Senate’s justification for the project.
However, the House leadership has apparently balked at the request and views the Senate’s attempt to secure money for the park as an attempt to steer dollars to its favorite project while preventing spending on any pet projects for the House.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/06061413/3X0A2107-copy-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-23 13:12:41.665246

Although Huston’s second term officially ended April 1, he has remained in the role temporarily — and will continue to do so until a successor is appointed. He was originally named to the commission by Gov. Mike Pence in 2014 and reappointed as chairman by Gov. Eric Holcomb in 2018.
The IURC Nominating Committee is now seeking Huston’s replacement, the commission said in a news release.
“It is with a grateful heart that I announce my intent to retire,” Huston said in a written statement. “It is a blessing to work alongside our incredibly talented professional staff every day, and I am proud of the work we accomplish on behalf of Hoosier families.”

The powerful five-member commission oversees more than 600 electric, natural gas, steam, water and wastewater utilities operating in Indiana, according to its website. It regulates rates, financing, bonding, environmental compliance plans and service territories, with final say over changes to the utility bills millions of Hoosiers pay.
During his tenure, Huston worked to streamline agency processes and reinstituted semi-annual “Reliability Forums,” where utility stakeholders assess seasonal preparedness for energy demand.
In 2024, he testified before the U.S. Congress on state-level challenges facing electric service reliability.
Huston currently serves as co-chair of the Federal-State Issues Collaborative, and holds roles with the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and GTI Energy.
“I want to thank Chairman Jim Huston for his service with the IURC over the past decade. He is a lifelong public servant and is leaving the agency in much better shape than when he arrived,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “I wish Chairman Huston the best in retirement.”
Prior to his IURC appointment, Huston served as chief of staff at the Indiana State Department of Health. During Gov. Mitch Daniels’ administration, he separately served as executive director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. The office has since been absorbed by Indiana’s Department of Workforce Development as the agency’s “Serve Indiana” division.
Huston also worked for four members of Congress and former Gov. Robert Orr. He has twice received the Sagamore of the Wabash, one of Indiana’s highest honors.
Huston said he looks looks forward to “the next chapter” of his life, which will include “spending a little more time” with his family and grandchildren.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 16:11:50+00:00,CT Mirror,Report: Schools missed learning disabilities of students who were later incarcerated,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/schools-incarcerated-students-report/,A report found CT schools fail to recognize the learning difficulties and traumatic experiences of young people who became incarcerated.,"For most of his life, Anthony struggled in school. In first grade, he was held back a year. By middle school, he’d been placed in an alternative school for children with problem behaviors. Then, at age 16, he was incarcerated after being charged with larceny and attempted assault. 
It wasn’t until roughly two years into his stint at Manson Youth Institute in Cheshire that Anthony, whose real name is being withheld for privacy reasons, was identified as having a language and speech impairment.
And he isn’t the only one. 
A report from the Center for Children’s Advocacy, slated to be released this October, found that local school districts repeatedly failed to recognize the learning difficulties and traumatic experiences of young people at an early age. That left them vulnerable to disengagement from school, ongoing discipline problems and eventual involvement with the criminal justice system, the report found. 
CCA reviewed the special education records of 10 young men incarcerated at Manson — including Anthony — and found that most of them had experienced learning difficulties in elementary school. Yet it sometimes took years for them to be evaluated for special education services.
And while six of the 10 young people were eventually referred for special education services, most of them were already incarcerated by the time that happened. 
“What jumps out so much from these stories … is how much could have been done for these kids at a much earlier age. Because we are losing them by sixth grade, if not earlier,” Sarah Eagan, CCA’s executive director, told the state General Assembly’s Juvenile Justice Policy and Oversight Committee during a presentation about the report last week.
Andrius Banevicius, public information officer for the Department of Correction, said in a statement to The Connecticut Mirror that most young people who come into a DOC facility have already been identified as special needs, and that there are “well established protocols and procedures to refer students to the special education process.”
“The dedicated educational professionals of the department’s Unified School District (USD) #1 are committed to providing a supportive and effective learning environment for all of their students, especially those with special education needs,” said Banevicius.
According to the report, all 10 of the young people whose records the agency reviewed were reading below grade level. Four of them were held back a grade. One was held back three times. 
Andrea Spencer, an education consultant for CCA, said traumatic events “have a significant effect” on a child’s brain development. All of the young people were in some way affected by violence — ranging from experiencing child abuse to witnessing domestic violence or violence in the community. One was the victim of a gunshot. 
Yet in eight of the 10 cases, there was no documentation in their education records about the difficulties they experienced. Eight of the 10 students also had notes in their records indicating that they had difficulties paying attention. 
“It seems that nobody really made the connection between the backgrounds of trauma of these young men and the hypervigilance that comes with that,” Spencer said at the meeting. 
She added that the behaviors children exhibited after experiencing trauma sometimes resemble ADHD. Language difficulties were also a common thread among the young men, which Spencer said was linked to “problem behavior.” 
Other researchers have come to similar conclusions. A 2020 study published in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry found that young people with developmental language disorder were more than twice as likely to reoffend.
Spencer said that difficulties with reading reinforced a belief that these students couldn’t function in school settings. As they entered higher grades, where learning relies more on reading texts, they experience heightened stress. 
Being expelled or suspended multiple times and being sent to an alternative school for children with behavioral problems were common stories for the young people whose records the agency reviewed. 
Eight out of 10 were arrested before the start of high school. Four were incarcerated before ninth grade. 
Leo, another of the young men at Manson whose name was changed to protect his privacy, was expelled in seventh grade after getting into a fight with another student in the cafeteria. He didn’t go to school at all for a year. After that, he repeated seventh grade, then stopped going to school until he landed in juvenile detention, according to the report. 
“He had a very significant reading disability, and when he was actually given some instruction, he was identified as diligent, engaged, respectful, by all of his teachers,” Marisa Halm, an attorney with Brown and Patterson LLP who formerly worked with CCA — and directly with some of the young men in the report — said at the meeting.
Falling ‘through the cracks‘
Even when special education needs were identified, the young men weren’t assured of getting the help they needed. According to the report, the special education services they received at Manson were minimal.
Spencer noted that the youths at the facility already had “significant educational deficits” in reading and other areas that were important in order for them to thrive in the community. 
Last August, the federal Department of Justice reached a settlement with the Connecticut Department of Correction after a 2021 federal investigation found, among other things, that Manson Youth Institute was failing to adequately educate children with special education needs. Part of the settlement required the department to screen young men entering the facility for special education needs, create policies around reviewing and revising special education plans and document the services that the youths were receiving. 
Halm told CT Mirror that while DOC was evidently working to improve special education services in response to the settlement, she questioned whether they had enough time to give young people a full school day and the necessary number of staff to provide adequate services.
Spencer added that the youth typically received only about one hour per month in “transition services” — assistance for young people who are preparing to leave the education system and either attend college or enter the workforce. Halm noted that transition services were doubly important for these youth because they were not only leaving the school system, they were also preparing to exit prison and return to their communities. 
DOC’s Banevicius said transition services were offered to every special education student, “which aligns with state and federal mandates.”
Eagan, of CCA, said at the JJPOC meeting that it’s crucial to identify students with learning disabilities at a young age, particularly in schools that she called “feeder districts,” referring to the high proportion of students that end up involved with the criminal justice system. She said those schools — which are primarily in the state’s urban districts — needed resources to give students the support they needed.
The Center for Children’s Advocacy recommended that school districts conduct trauma screenings for students and that the Connecticut Department of Education increase oversight of alternative schools and private special education schools. 
“If we’re not looking under the hood at the programs in a systematic way, these are the kids who are going to fall through the cracks,” Eagan said.
Matt Cerrone, director of communications for the Department of Education, said in a statement that the department would consider the findings of the report, but added that there needed to be a broader response to address the challenges students face outside of school.
“As the report states, many of the challenges students face begin well before they enter school and are linked to early childhood adversity that can significantly affect long-term outcomes,” the statement read.
“Addressing these complex issues requires a coordinated, cross-sector response that begins early and extends beyond the school setting,” Cerrone continued. “That said, the Department will continue to examine how these findings may inform its role within the broader system of support for children and families.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Manson-Exterior-e1625765290544.jpg,,,2025-05-23 12:19:42.852937

Nevada Gaming Commissioner Rosa Solis Rainey asked Fontainebleau president Maurice Wooden about the investigation Thursday, catching the executive off guard as he sought licensing as a key employee. 
“With respect to AML (anti-money laundering), tell me about the issues that are currently going on at the Fontainebleau with respect to credit issuance,” Solis-Rainey said to Wooden. “Are you aware of those?”
“I’m not sure of any investigation as it relates to anything with AML. Is there something specific? I’m not sure,” Wooden responded. 
“I think that is something that staff is currently further investigating, prior to any further action,” Gaming Control Board member Chandeni Sendall chimed in. 
“It’s not listed in our materials as confidential, by the way,” noted a visibly irked Gaming Commission Chairwoman Jennifer Togliatti. 
“Is it confidential or not confidential?” Solis-Rainey inquired. “We have in our materials that there’s an investigation ongoing with respect to the credit practices not being followed.”  
The issue, she said, involved ownership approving credit without proper approval from compliance executives. Fontainebleau is owned by Jeffrey Soffer. The $3.7 billion property opened in December 2023.
“If those processes happened, they were certainly before my time. I was, you know, not on property for what I believe some of the questions you’re asking,” Wooden responded, adding he believes “at least one or two of those issues did happen, almost like the opening week.” 
Wooden is likely referring to a $2 million marker issued to gambler and illegal bookmaker Damien LeForbes, shortly after the resort’s opening in December 2023, according to Robert Cipriani, a professional gambler who provided information to the federal government about money laundering at MGM Grand and Resorts World. 
LeForbes and illegal sports bookie Mathew Bowyer have pleaded guilty to operating unlawful gambling businesses and to money laundering. 
MGM Resorts entered into a non-prosection agreement with the government in early 2024 and paid a $7.45 million fine. Its former president, Scott Sibella, agreed to a plea deal for failing to comply with AML regulations. The feds have yet to take any action against Resorts World, where Sibella also served as president until his termination in September of 2023, and where Bowyer and LeForbes were permitted to gamble without known sources of funds.    
The Gaming Commission fined Resorts World $10.5 million in March and imposed an $8.5 million fine against MGM in April. 
Cipriani contends the investigation has expanded to a handful of other resorts, including Fontainebleau.
In early January 2024, weeks after Fontainebleau’s opening, Cipriani tweeted the casino granted a $2 million marker to LeForbes, who eventually “blew thru it all,” according to Cipriani. 
“All the casinos that took DJ Leforbes’ and Matt Bowyer’s action are being investigated by GCB,” Cipriani said Friday.
No efforts have been made by Fontainebleau or Venetian, where the two also gambled, to recover the funds via the District Attorney’s Office, according to court records. 
Gaming Control Board Chairman Kirk Hendrick told Togliatti the information about the investigation, which was included in the Commission’s back up documents, should have been marked confidential.
“I don’t want to go any deeper into this matter until the board has an opportunity to review it and, of course, speak with the licensee,” he said.
Stacy Michaels, a Fontainebleau executive, said the GCB audited five player accounts and had concerns with three. Michaels added that agents were eventually satisfied the company had followed proper protocol.

Vasquez's office)The Republican reconciliation bill that cleared the United States House of Representatives by a narrow margin this week no longer authorizes the sale of thousands acres of public land in Utah and Nevada.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez (D-NM), who co-founded the Bipartisan Public Lands Caucus earlier this year, said the removal of that provision represents a “huge victory” for all Americans concerned about public lands being sold to the highest bidder. Vasquez said in a statement he started the caucus with U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, a Montana Republican, to beat back these attacks on public lands. 
“We committed to working across party lines to sit down and ensure the integrity of our land management system. We’ve worked together across the aisle to prevent this unprecedented public lands sell-off,” Vasquez said. “We will continue to work together to ensure our lands are public, accessible and well managed.”

The provision would have gutted protections for 500,000 acres of land near Zion National Park, along with critical habitat for threatened desert tortoises and other areas designated by Congress for conservation, according to New Mexico Wild, a conservation advocacy group. That could have meant the lands were turned into “golf courses, luxury resorts or strip malls,” the group said in a statement Thursday. 
Environmental groups nationally have applauded the removal of the provision, which Reps. Celeste Maloy (R-Utah) and Mark Amodei (R-Nevada) sponsored. New Mexico Wild’s executive director Mark Allison said the bipartisan pushback was a factor in maintaining the land’s protections, but he warned that this is the first of many fights in coming days to stave off efforts to privatize public lands.
“The fact that House Republicans were forced to retreat shows that when we unite to defend our birthright, politicians listen,” he said in a statement. “But make no mistake — this fight is far from over. The same forces that tried to sneak this land grab through would love nothing more than to come after New Mexico’s public lands next time.”

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)A bill that would eliminate certain transgender protections established by a 2018 anti-discrimination law in New Hampshire was approved by the state Senate Thursday and now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk.
​​If it becomes law, House Bill 148, which was sponsored by Wilton Republican Rep. Jim Kofalt, will allow businesses and organizations in New Hampshire to classify certain services, such as locker rooms and restrooms, by biological sex. It would also permit schools and organized sports teams in the state to keep transgender athletes off teams that are consistent with their gender identity. It would allow prisons, mental health facilities, and juvenile detention centers to place transgender people with members of their at-birth sex even if they ask to be placed according to the gender they identify with. The bill doesn’t require any of these things, but it allows whoever owns the restrooms, administers the sports teams, or runs the prison to do so without facing discrimination charges. This reverses parts of 2018’s Law Against Discrimination, which was enacted to protect people from discrimination on the basis of “age, sex, gender identity, race, creed, color, marital status, familial status, physical or mental disability, or national origin.”
The Senate passed the bill, 16-8, along party lines Thursday, with all Republicans voting yes and all Democrats voting no. The House passed the legislation, 201-166, in March. Only two Democratic House members, Reps. Jonah Wheeler and Peter Leishman, both of Peterborough, voted in favor.
Ayotte will now have the option to sign the bill into law, veto it, or allow it to become law without her signature. Her predecessor, former Gov. Chris Sununu, was given the same options in 2024 when the House and Senate approved House Bill 396. This year’s bill, HB 148, is a word-for-word copy of last year’s HB 396. Sununu ultimately vetoed the bill, calling it “unacceptable,” and saying it “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves,” per his veto message.

The merits of the state tax cuts and Republicans’ budget decisions have become partisan talking points in the early days of the 2026 campaign, as candidates begin to position themselves to run for governor and other offices.
Here’s a look at some of the key budget decisions lawmakers made this year:
The $9.425 billion budget came in above the $8.5 billion in projected revenue for FY 2026. To finance the difference, lawmakers approved taking an estimated $917 million in funding from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and budget surplus from previous years to fully fund state priorities. In later negotiations, legislators also agreed to use $26 million from the Iowa’s Sports Wagering Fund to provide money for priorities like paraeducator pay and the public safety equipment fund.
The FY 2026 budget will fund the state beginning July 1, 2025. It’s contains $478.1 million more — or 5.34% — than the FY 2025 budget of $8.947 billion.

House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst said Iowans should be aware that this year’s budget reflects an unsustainable spending model for the state, as the funds being used to make up for the revenue shortfall are one-time money.
“It’s important that Iowans know that we’re spending on ongoing expenses out of the state savings account, and that that’s not a sustainable way to govern,” Konfrst, D-Windsor Heights, told reporters at the end of the 2025 legislative session. “And the reason for that is because Republicans, who have been in charge for 10 years, have been unable to manage this budget in a way that’s truly going to be responsible and actually be good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”
The state’s budget — and the factors that led to decreased revenue — are likely to be a major talking point for Democrats heading into the 2026 election season. One of the largest reasons why Iowa’s revenue fell was because of recent cuts to individual and corporate income taxes.
In 2024, Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law a measure speeding up previous income tax cuts, which reduced the individual income tax rate from 5.7% in 2024 to a single 3.8% rate beginning in 2025.
House Speaker Pat Grassley said Friday on an episode of “Iowa Press” that Republicans chose to make this cut — knowing that the move would cause a loss in state financial returns — because Iowans had “overpaid” through income taxes in previous years, money that went into the Taxpayer Relief Fund. The Taxpayer Relief Fund holds $4 billion, and that’s just one of the state’s pots of unspent money. There’s also a $2 billion general fund surplus and $961 million in Iowa’s reserve accounts.
“The reason we felt confident in being able to do (tax cuts) is we felt we had an overcollection from Iowans, we needed to get that back into their pockets,” Grassley said. “I think what we’ve done as we approached this, we expected that there may be less revenue coming in, but typically when you cut taxes that is what comes with it. Thankfully, we have those backstops there that were in place for that reason. And, like I said, in a $9.4 billion budget, the state of Iowa is sitting on roughly $7 billion between those accounts that I just touched on. I think that puts us in a very strong position and why we felt confident and still feel confident moving forward.”
He said this funding is being used to “offset any of those bumps in the road” in the implementation of tax cuts, but said Republicans believe the state’s revenue will increase again because the tax cuts will stimulate the Iowa’s economy.
But Democrats said while these savings can be used to make up for current budget shortages, these should not be relied on to meet the state’s spending obligations. Following the March Revenue Estimating Conference, Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, released information from the Iowa Department of Management’s five-year budget projections, obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, that found the Reynolds administration’s budget plan for the next five years would continue to draw money from the state’s reserves, Taxpayer Relief Fund and Economic Emergency Fund.
“Republicans are breaking their own rule of using one-time funds for ongoing expenses, and Iowa taxpayers are footing the bill,” Petersen said in a statement.
During floor debates on appropriations bills, Democrats repeatedly emphasized the larger problems with the FY 2026 budget, saying the Legislature should not be drawing money from savings and reserves to fund annual expenses. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, criticized Republicans during floor debate on the health and human services budget bill for both irresponsible budgeting practices and for ot providing enough funding to meet Iowans’ needs in their proposal.
“One of the biggest pieces that we have to talk about here is how the majority party’s failed economic policies mean that we don’t have enough revenue to cover this inadequate budget,” Trone Garriott said. “… We could do a lot better for a lot of people, and I’m sorry that we’re not making that effort in this budget.”
Trone Garriott, as well as Konfrst, are running as Democratic candidates in Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District in 2026, and have been critical of both state and federal GOP budget practices. Discussions on Iowa’s budget could also play a role in statewide elected races, like in the gubernatorial race. As Reynolds announced that she will not seek reelection, multiple Republicans — including Speaker Grassley — have said they are considering running to become the GOP nominee in 2026.
Though the budget has been approved by lawmakers, the governor still must sign off on the appropriations bills. She has the ability to line-item veto specific funding provisions within these budgets, meaning funding for some of the provisions approved by the legislature could be cut by the governor.
As it stands, here are some of the ways state money is appropriated in the upcoming year’s budget:
Education
An expense that Democratic legislators have repeatedly criticized and pointed to as a place for cuts is the Education Savings Account (ESA) program. It provides state dollars for K-12 students’ private school tuition and associated costs. The program, approved in 2023, has limited Iowans’ eligibility based on income for the first two years of implementation. Beginning the the 2025-2026 school year, families of any income level can receive the public funding for private school costs through the program.
The most recent estimates put ESA spending at $314 million for the upcoming year, a roughly $96 million increase from the current fiscal year.
There is not an appropriations limit for the state program, meaning the estimate could differ from how much is actually spent. The money in ESA accounts is tied to the state’s state supplemental aid (SSA) rate for per-pupil spending for public K-12 schools — $7,988 per student for the upcoming school year.
Lawmakers passed a 2% SSA rate for the FY 2026 budget as part of a total $3.9 billion in spending for the state’s public K-12 school system.
This is not the only money going toward Iowa education in this year’s budget. Senate File 647, the education appropriations bill — separate budget from SSA — allocated more than $1.033 billion. Much of that funding went to Iowa’s higher education institutions, which included a $7.5 million funding increase for the Iowa community colleges and a $5.5 million increase for the Iowa Board of Regents governing the state’s public universities.
Additionally, lawmakers passed Senate File 660, a measure providing $14 million to fund a pay supplement for paraeducators and other educational support staff through the Sports Wagering Fund. This money, one of the hold-ups in budget negotiations between House and Senate Republicans, was a funding component approved in 2024 as part of the law making changes to Iowa’s Area Education Agencies (AEAs) but was not included in the budget proposal agreed upon between Senate Republicans and Reynolds.
The state’s standing appropriations bill, which contains SSA funding as well as other state spending obligations, also contained a $25 million reduction in funding for AEAs.
Health and human services
Another large piece of state spending was allocated through House File 1049, the state’s health and human services budget. The $2.469 billion appropriations bill funds the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Veterans Affairs.
A majority — $1.903 billion — of the spending goes to Medicaid and related state programs, including the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan (IHAWP, providing expanded Medicaid health coverage, and the Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa (Hawki) program for uninsured children of low-income families. This year’s budget included a $230.4 million increase to make up for expected funding shortfalls for Medicaid and Hawki.
Rep. Ann Meyer, R-Fort Dodge, said during floor debate the state was “fully funding Medicaid” through the bill, but Democrats questioned whether state funding will be sufficient considering Medicaid cuts currently being considered by Congress.
The appropriations measure includes $20 million for nursing facility providers’ Medicaid rate rebasing, higher reimbursements for maternal health providers, and an increase from $50 to $55 in personal needs allowances given to individuals on Medicaid in care facilities each month.
It also includes a restriction on Medicaid coverage, banning payments through the health plan for transgender Iowans seeking physical medical interventions for the treatment of gender dysphoria, such as sex reassignment surgery and hormone treatment therapy. The bill was amended from an earlier version that included language to stop Medicaid coverage for all forms of gender dysphoria treatment, including mental health care.
Democrats still argued the provision was unjust, as it prevented Iowans from receiving lifesaving medical treatment. Sen. Molly Donahue, D-Marion, argued the measure violated the Equal Protections Clause in the U.S. and Iowa constitution, as it would deny a group of people medical treatment that remains accessible to others. Cisgender people could still receive hormone therapy if deemed medically necessary, Donahue said as an example, while transgender people could not.
Medicaid coverage for transition-related treatments was brought up as one of the motivators to remove gender identity from the Iowa Civil Rights Act earlier in the 2025 legislative session. Previous attempts by Republican lawmakers to ban Medicaid coverage for transgender Iowans were struck down because of the protections provided by the Iowa Civil Rights Act, and the Iowa Supreme Court has not weighed in on the constitutionality of such a ban.
Another component of health-related spending passed this year was allocation of money from the Opioid Settlement Fund. Lawmakers have failed in previous legislative sessions to pass a bill distributing money from the fund, which currently contains more than $56 million, but were able to get House File 1038 to the governor’s desk in 2025.
The bill appropriates $29 million from the fund to HHS for disbursement to several specific organizations and programs working on addiction prevention, treatment and recovery programs in FY 2026. In future years, money will be allotted from the fund to state agencies, with HHS receiving 75% and the Iowa Attorney General’s office receiving 25%, with these entities then choosing where the money will go. Iowa is expected to receive more than $325 million in the fund between fiscal years 2021 through 2039, according to the AG’s office, with settlement funds split between local governments and the state.
House lawmakers including Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, said he was disappointed with some aspects of the measure, but that the compromise was needed or else “we would have gone a third year without using these funds to address opioid abuse in Iowa.” The Opioid Settlement Fund, created in 2022, is money collected by Iowa through lawsuits brought by states against drug manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies for their roles in the opioid epidemic. A majority of this money, 85%, is obligated through the cases to be spent on opioid addiction treatment and prevention.
Democratic lawmakers said they were frustrated that the Opioid Settlement Fund money will be distributed through HHS and the AG’s office under the agreement, arguing this structure will provide less oversight and input from communities in need, but supported the bill as a means to distribute money.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Justice and judiciary
The combined spending for Iowa’s law enforcement and courts systems came to a total of $924.9 million for FY 2026.
The judicial branch’s budget, Senate File 648, came to $221.83 million. It included $1.27 million more in funding for judicial officer salaries, amounting to a 2.5% pay raise for justices and judges — an increase Iowa Supreme Court Chief Justice Susan Christensen called for in January to help Iowa be more competitive and help current issues with filling judicial vacancies across the state.
Senate File 644, the budget funding state law enforcement entities including the departments of Justice, Corrections, Public Safety and Homeland Security and Emergency Management, appropriated $703.1 million from the general fund, $20.6 from other funds and several standing appropriations. The budget included a $7.6 million increase for the state Department of Corrections, allocated to several state facilities and department efforts.
It also had a a $2.1 million increase for the Office of the State Public Defender — including a $1.95 million transfer from the Indigent Defense Fund and $100,000 from the College Student Aid Commission designated for the Rural Attorney Recruitment Assistance Program. Rep. Brian Lohse, R-Bondurant, said the bill includes a total increase of $1.07 million for indigent defense, raising the pay for attorneys who represent people who cannot hire a lawyer themselves by approximately $2 per hour.
Lawmakers also approved adding $150,000 in new money for the victims assistance grant fund, run through the state Attorney General’s office, to provide services for human trafficking victims.
Agriculture and natural resources
The upcoming fiscal year’s funding for the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship, Iowa Department of Natural Resources and related state programs totaled $46.6 million from the general fund, in addition $99.4 million coming from other funds.
Senate File 646 shifts $2.5 million from the existing Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Fund and provides $1.05 million in new funding to create the Iowa Animal Disease Prevention fund, focused on efforts to research vaccines, track outbreaks and provide equipment to treat and prevent animal diseases. This was a change requested by Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig following the outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza.
The measure also makes changes to the Choose Iowa program focused on producers that sell food and goods grown in Iowa. It ends the Choose Iowa pilot purchasing program and creates the Choose Iowa Food Purchasing Program with a $200,000 appropriation going to food banks for the purchase of locally produced food. Democrats criticized the shift from the pilot program, that provided assistance to both food banks and Iowa schools, as the new food purchasing program did not provide funding for schools to be able to purchase locally grown foods.
The Resources Enhancement and Protection (REAP) program, funding local projects related to natural resources conservation and public spaces, received a $12 million appropriation from the Environment First Fund — a lower amount than the $20 million standing appropriation in Iowa Code given to REAP.
Other spending
Administration and regulation: House File 1044 provides funding for several of Iowa’s statewide elected offices as well as state agencies like the Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing (DIAL) and Department of Management and Department of Revenue. It also gives money for state entities like the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System (IPERS) and the state Utilities Board.
This year, the Legislature allocated $73.7 million from the general fund and $134.2 million from other funds through this budget. This year, lawmakers approved a $1.2 million increase for IPERS to hire new staff, and $600,000 for the state’s Insurance Division to increase oversight and regulation enforcement for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), the businesses that negotiate prescription drug prices between drug manufacturers, health insurance providers and pharmacies.
Economic development: The budget for economic development initiatives, Senate File 645, includes $74.7 million in total spending from the general fund and other state resources. The money from this appropriations pool goes largely to the Iowa Economic Development Authority, Iowa Finance Authority and the Iowa Department of Workforce Development.
This year’s budget reduced funding for the World Food Prize and state tourism office, as well as money for several grant programs. But it also includes a $322,000 bump in funding for the Iowa Arts Council and $350,000 for the Council of Governments (COGS), money which can be leveraged with federal and local dollars to provide $3 million in funding for housing renewal projects across the state according to Rep. Shannon Latham, R-Sheffield. Latham said these projects can be taken on through the continuation of the Housing Renewal Pilot Program, which was extended for three years through the bill.
Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund (RIIF): House File 1039 appropriates $163.8 million from the Rebuild Iowa Infrastructure Fund and the Technology Infrastructure Fund. Though House GOP lawmakers said during debate they could not reach an agreement for several RIIF funding priorities in budget negotiations with the Senate this year, there were still several projects that received funding through the fund this year. The Iowa Law Enforcement Academy received $15 million for the creation of a new driver training facility, and the state historical building received $5 million to buy new storage units for preserving historical artifacts.
Transportation: The state’s transportation budget, $502.8 million for FY 2026, does not come from the general fund, but from the Road Use Tax Fund and Primary Road Fund. Senate File 628, providing funding for the Iowa Department of Transportation, included a $20 million increase in Road Use Tax Fund money to modernize the state’s drivers and vehicles record system, as well as $18.9 million to renovate the DOT’s Waterloo maintenance garage.

Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.

Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Judge Richard Mark Gergel, of the U.S. District Court of South Carolina, Charleston Division, handed down that order Tuesday in the ongoing federal court case The Sustainability Institute et al. v. Donald J. Trump.
Gergel’s order calls for the Trump administration to reinstate roughly three dozen grants that had been awarded to the City of New Haven, the City of Baltimore, and a handful of other municipalities and nonprofits through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
According to a press release sent out by Mayor Justin Elicker on Wednesday, this order applies to three federal grants the city has been awarded by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): a $20 million Community Change grant, designed to promote energy-efficient homes and green transportation; a $9.5 million Climate Pollution Reduction grant to build out geothermal heat pumps for Union Station; and a $1 million Environmental Justice Government-to-Government grant, designed to help New Haveners transition their homes from oil to heat pumps.

New Haven had joined with fellow plaintiffs — like Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Madison, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California — in suing the federal government in March, alleging that the Trump administration had illegally frozen or terminated the congressionally appropriated funds underlying these grants.
Federal lawyers did not contest the plaintiffs’ claims that the Trump administration had acted in violation of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) in regards to 32 of the 38 relevant grants. However, they sought to get the district court from holding off on issuing ​“injunctive relief” for the plaintiffs while the Trump administration appealed the court’s jurisdiction under the APA.
Ultimately, Gergel decided to grant ​“permanent injunctive relief” for these 32 grants — including the three awarded to New Haven.
“Plaintiffs have produced substantial, highly persuasive evidence to support their claims that their grant funds were frozen and/or terminated because Defendants disfavored previously authorized congressional appropriations and that such actions were outside of the legal authority of the agency Defendants and in violation of the Constitution’s separation of powers,” Gergel wrote.
In response to the Trump administration’s request for the district court to hold off on granting injunctive relief, he wrote, ​“the public interest lies in upholding the rule of law and providing an effective remedy for those injured by the unlawful actions of government officials. For these reasons, Defendants motion to stay is denied.”

On Wednesday, the Trump administration appealed the district court’s decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
“Contrary to President Trump’s executive orders and actions, the way we ​‘Unleash American Energy’ is by leveraging our country’s own renewable resources, including solar, wind and geothermal,” Elicker is quoted as saying in Wednesday’s celebratory press release. ​“It’s better for our pocketbooks, our environment and our national security, and we are encouraged that this ruling will allow New Haven and other cities and nonprofits across the nation to do exactly that.”
City climate czar Steve Winter was also quoted in Wednesday’s press release, stating, ​“I’m thrilled that the court has blocked the Trump administration’s illegal and unjustified freeze of funding for important climate change and clean energy projects in New Haven. The work that our team does every day in partnership with City agencies and community partners helps improve air quality, lower energy bills, and address our climate crisis.”
This marks the second time in two months that a federal judge has sided with New Haven in one of a lawsuit filed against the Trump administration. In late April, a federal judge in California ruled that the Trump administration can’t withhold funds from New Haven, San Francisco, and a dozen other cities just because they are​ “sanctuary jurisdictions” that limit local cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
New Haven has been represented in both of these federal cases by Public Rights Project.

The case was dismissed on Thursday. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A federal judge cleared the way Thursday for CoreCivic to reopen its Leavenworth prison as an immigration detention center, saying he lacks jurisdiction to hear the case.
The city has not yet decided whether it will appeal the decision to the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Denver. 
“We need to confer with our attorneys,” said Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager. “We will probably discuss it with the city commission sometime next week.”
Peterson said he didn’t know whether further court action could occur before June 1, when CoreCivic officials had indicated they may begin receiving detainees.
“We may have further negotiations with CoreCivic themselves about this,” Peterson said. 
U.S. District Judge Toby Crouse dismissed the case, saying the city failed to establish subject-matter jurisdiction. During a Tuesday hearing, Crouse repeatedly questioned whether he had any basis to act, saying the city had not adequately outlined that issue.
Crouse, appointed to the bench in 2020 by President Donald Trump, highlighted two pending motions before him, including Leavenworth’s request for an injunction that would have stopped CoreCivic from reopening until it could be determined whether the company had to go through the city’s development process. CoreCivic had asked for a dismissal of the case.
Joseph Hatley, attorney for Leavenworth, said in court Tuesday that CoreCivic had agreed not to take detainees until June 1 while the case was decided.
After the hearing, Hatley said in an interview there were concerns that if detainees were housed in the prison before the legal disputes were resolved, the federal government could refuse to move the detainees regardless of the outcome of the case.
“The City asserts that Core Civic should be enjoined from operating its detention facility without the proper permit,” Crouse wrote in his ruling Thursday. “But it has not pled facts to establish that subject-matter jurisdiction exists in federal court to consider that claim. Accordingly, this action is dismissed, and the parties’ motions are denied as moot.”
CoreCivic spokesman Ryan Gustin said the company was pleased with the decision. 
“We remain focused on ensuring the Midwest Regional Reception Center is prepared to meet the needs of our federal partner,” he said.
Gustin did not answer questions about whether CoreCivic intended to begin housing ICE detainees in June. 
 
Move forward
Activists who have spoken out against reopening the facility are hopeful the city will appeal. 
“We hope the city will explore all of its options as the concerns of the lawsuit since its filing in February — CoreCivic’s disregard for the city’s governance and its rush to fill the facility without accountability — have only grown more urgent,” Esmie Tseng, spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, said in an email.
Tseng also said the judge’s decision held hope with regard to whether CoreCivic would have to follow Leavenworth development codes requiring the company to apply for a special use permit. 
“It’s also worth noting that in the dismissal, the court agreed that when CoreCivic ceased operation for 12 months, it lost its non-conforming status and that its initial application for the special use permit appeared to be a recognition of this fact,” she said.  
CoreCivic was grandfathered into the city’s development codes when it was open and operating as the Leavenworth Detention Facility from 1992 to 2021. The codes were passed in 2012. 
City officials, as laid out in the lawsuit, have told CoreCivic it must apply for a special use permit.
 
‘Great start’
CoreCivic’s reopening of the Leavenworth facility, which closed in 2021 at the end of its federal contract and under numerous accusations of inhuman treatment at the facility, is part of the company’s plan to reopen nine idle facilities.
In its May earnings report, CoreCivic announced total revenue of $488.6 million, with net income of $25.1 million.
“2025 is off to a strong start for CoreCivic. First quarter occupancy in CoreCivic facilities reached 77% of available capacity, an increase from 75.2% in the first quarter of last year,” said CEO Damon T. Hininger in a press release. “Based on cost management and increased bed utilization, particularly from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), we exceeded our internal expectations for the first quarter. Additionally, we have begun to re-activate three previously idle facilities under multiple agreements with ICE.”
In Security and Exchange Commission filings, CoreCivic said it had nine idle facilities, including the Leavenworth facility, renamed the Midwest Regional Reception Center.
“CoreCivic anticipates additional contracting activity as 2025 progresses,” Hininger said. “In addition to the facilities we are currently activating, we are making preparatory investments in many of our other idle facilities so that they will be available quickly, as our partners’ needs require and as their budgets allow.”
 
Leavenworth contract
CoreCivic SEC filings and a press release said they signed a letter of agreement with ICE at the beginning of March to reopen the Leavenworth facility, which would house 1,033 detainees. As a result, ICE paid CoreCivic $5 million with a maximum of $22.6 million set over a six-month period to cover start-up expenses while the two hash out a long-term contract. 
In its quarterly report, filed May 8 with the SEC, CoreCivic noted that Leavenworth filed a lawsuit.
“CoreCivic plans to vigorously defend this matter on the basis that the (special use permit) is not applicable under existing statute,” the filing said. “CoreCivic has agreed with the City of Leavenworth to not accept detainees prior to June 1, 2025 while this matter is deliberated. The Company can provide no assurance that it will obtain a favorable ruling in this matter or that ICE and the Company will ultimately enter into a long-term contract for the utilization of the Company’s Midwest Regional Reception Center.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5200641-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)A late spring nor’easter dumped 2 inches of rain on Newport Thursday. Not exactly the best weather for an outdoor display of over 7,000 combat boots.
“They’ve been out there for nine years, and they’re beginning to show their wear and tear and weather like this does not help,” Erik Wallin, executive director of Operation Stand Down Rhode Island, said Thursday afternoon as rain and heavy winds swept through the state.
But then combat boots are designed for rough terrain, extreme weather, and heavy-duty use. And the boots on display in the Boots on the Ground for Heroes Memorial are holding up thanks to the TLC from Operation Stand Down staff and hundreds of volunteers. The memorial opened Friday morning under cloudy skies at Fort Adams State Park in Newport. 
Each boot in the memorial organized by Operation Stand Down has a U.S. flag and a tag with the name and photo of a fallen service member killed in action since 9/11 in the Global War on Terror.
The memorial remains open to the public for viewing 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. through Sunday and 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday. Admission is free.


The boots are organized alphabetically and by state and U.S. territories. Visitors often leave coins on the boots, some are symbolic of a personal connection to the soldier, sailor, Marine or Coast Guard personnel who died. A quarter could mean you were with the service member when they died; a dime that you served with the deceased; a nickel that you were at basic training together; and a penny that you visited and paid your respects and thanked the veteran for their service.
With the exception of the possibility of a passing late afternoon shower Friday and a lesser chance on Saturday, Wallin is thankful the National Weather Service forecasts calls for a dry Sunday and Memorial Day.
The memorial has been installed each year at Fort Adams since 2019. One year, it rained throughout the holiday weekend and into the following days so the boots could not dry out. Wallin said the boots had to be hauled to the Rhode Island Army National Guard Armory in Warwick to dry out.
The boots spend most of the year stored in a trailer. But this past Monday, Operation Stand Down staff drew the grid on the field inside Fort Adams. Over 200 volunteers helped place the boots and flags over the course of Tuesday and Wednesday. 
“There was a little bit of mold on them,” Wallin said.
Not anymore though. Among the volunteers who came to help set up the memorial this week, the East Providence High School football team helped clean boots.
“We’re tremendously blessed, all of us at Operation Stand Down,” Wallin said. “It’s very moving to see a hundred volunteers show up on any one day, both as a tribute to those who have fallen and it’s a tremendous recognition of people appreciating the sacrifice and service of our U.S. military.
This year there are exactly 7,326 boots, the same number on display last year, Wallin said. More boots are added each year if additional U.S. service members are killed in action in war operations under the specific criteria of the Department of Defense.
Each fallen hero is represented by a single boot except for the 29 Rhode Island service members killed who are each honored with a pair of boots. A separate circle with pairs of desert tan boots pays tribute to the fallen veterans from Rhode Island.
The rest of the boots are black, acquired through military surplus a decade ago. Since then, the Defense Department has switched over to desert tan boots.
“Unfortunately these have been part of the memorial now for over nine years, and they do begin to show their age,” Wallin said. “We’re kind of at that vector point of having to make a decision about going out and investing in an entirely new set.”

Every day is a job interview. Don’t be limited by your current goals.
Those were a few of the messages former U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona gave to Southern Connecticut State University graduate students at their commencement ceremony on Thursday night.
Cardona was born and raised in Meriden, Connecticut. He graduated from Central Connecticut State University, taught 4th grade in his hometown, and was later the state education secretary. In 2021, he joined former President Joe Biden’s (D) cabinet, where he served all four years.
While speaking to SCSU graduates at Total Morgage Arena in Bridgeport on Thursday night, Cardona also made a handful of references to the hit Broadway show Hamilton (Governor Ned Lamont (D) was also once fond of referencing the play).
Cardona reflected on his job interview to join the Lamont administration — where the two found common ground as Hamilton fans.
“After we got all the serious stuff out of the way, I got up to leave, and I remembered what he said about Hamilton, so I got up all serious. I looked him in the eyes, and I said, ‘Governor, just like my country, I’m young, scrappy and hungry, and I’m not throwing away my shot.’”
“I’m not saying that’s why I got the job, but it didn’t hurt,” Cardona said. “It did not hurt.”
Cardona has been floated as a possible replacement for Connecticut State Colleges and Universities Chancellor Terrence Cheng. When recently asked about that possibility, Lamont said he wasn’t ready to comment.
During Thursday’s ceremony, multiple speakers referenced the value of Southern’s diverse class. The name Donald Trump was not mentioned — but the messages were clear: diversity was and is a vital part of education.
“Our nation is constantly made better by our beautifully diverse people, no matter what people are saying these days,” Cardona said.
Diversity, Dean of the School of Graduate and Professional Studies Dr. Rabia Hos said, was also a cornerstone of academic research at the university.
Hos rattled off a few of the projects students participated in while obtaining their degrees: the effects of systemic racism affect mental health care in African Ameican commnuities, how to break down language barriers for immigrant families, and the development of role playing therapy models for neurodiverse kids.
“I have spent my career researching and writing about multilingual learners and immigrant students, those whose identities and experiences are often pushed to the margins in classroom and policies,” Hos said. “I continue to write, publish and speak because I believe scholarship should live beyond the page. It must challenge inequity, elevate silent voices and create space for all students to thrive.”

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)As another school year ends, superintendents across the United States are staring down an autumn staffing crisis, with 1 in 8 teaching positions either vacant or filled by an underqualified educator.
States that are struggling with post-pandemic teacher shortages have spent millions to lure replacements and retain veterans with hiring bonuses and bumps in salaries. But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.
The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.
Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.
Why teachers leave: 2 educators share their experiences

“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.
“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”
Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.
A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.
In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.
And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.
It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.
Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.
“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”
The root cause? Teacher attrition.
“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”
North Dakota teachers leaving profession earlier

States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.
Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.
“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”
More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.
“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.
However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.
Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)
“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.
“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.”
How best to credential
Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.
“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.
And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.
“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.
Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.
In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.
According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.
Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.
She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.
There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.
Task force seeks to get new teachers past the 5-year mark

In West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.
Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.
“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.”
Low pay
A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.
As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.
While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.
To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.
At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.

That’s about 61.3 unwanted calls per 100,000 residents, a rate that trails only Washington.
So far in 2025, there have been 648 complaints, according to data from the Federal Communications Commission’s Consumer Inquiries and Complaints Division. 
Consumers can also file complaints about spam calls to another agency, the Federal Trade Commission. In the 2024 fiscal year, there were more than 2 million complaints about unwanted spam calls. In Connecticut, there were 23,048 complaints, which is about 639 per 100,000 residents.
Consumers can tell companies that they do not want telemarketing sales calls through the Federal Trade Commission’s Do Not Call registry, According to its website, “companies that make unwanted calls to consumers may be violating the Do Not Call rules.”
Connecticut ranks second in most the active registrations per population, behind only New Hampshire.
Even if a number is not in the registry, robocall sales are illegal, unless the caller has written permission from a consumer. However, robocalls still account for the majority of telemarketing sales complaints and lead the list of methods of contact.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-22-at-3.22.00 PM.png,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

Lawmakers agree to double unemployment for miners
Some 630 idled workers at two northern Minnesota mines will be eligible for a full year of unemployment benefits under a bipartisan agreement between the House and Senate announced on Thursday.
Workers are typically only eligible for 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, which cover about half their earnings while they look for new jobs. But six-figure mining jobs won’t be easy to find in the area until Cleveland Cliffs restarts operations at Minorca Mine in Virginia and Hibbing Taconite, raising the prospect that workers would have to move out-of-state.
“We have to make sure that the steelworkers that are laid off at our mines stay in our communities on the Iron Range … for when our mines are ready to get back up and operational,” bill author Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said on the Senate floor last month.
Doubling unemployment benefits for miners was never in doubt even as Republicans looked to repeal all unemployment benefits for bus drivers, cafeteria workers and other hourly school workers. Republicans championed their own bill extending benefits to laid off miners, and the Democratic version passed off the House floor on Monday 132-0.
That underscores the importance of miners as much to the local Iron Range economy as the state’s identity as the country’s largest producer of iron ore and taconite. It also reflects the rightward shift of the Iron Range, which now sends mostly Republicans to St. Paul to represent its interests.
The number of mining jobs have been steadily eroded by automation, but those that remain are some of the highest paid in the region and support numerous adjacent industries.
Mining giant Cleveland Cliffs announced in March that it would temporarily layoff about 630 workers, who are unionized with the United Steelworkers, as demand for steel in the auto industry cratered under worsening consumer sentiment, high interest rates and tariffs from the Trump administration.
Trump’s trade war has not seemed to dent enthusiasm for tariffs among the laid off steelworkers or Cleveland Cliffs CEO Lourenco Gonclaves.
The Department of Employment and Economic Development estimates the additional benefits will cost the state about $15 million, assuming 630 workers receive $914 a week on average.
Unemployment benefits for hourly school workers cost around $57 million in 2024, helping workers who earn around $17 an hour on average make ends meet through the summer. The state Legislature passed a bill this year that would give school districts an additional $100 million to pay for the benefits, while a Republican effort to repeal the benefits in 2029 failed.
Democrats also hope to extend unemployment benefits to federal employees who are laid off as part of the Trump administration’s assault on the federal workforce. There were only about 200 federal jobs lost in Minnesota last month — many of Trump’s layoffs have been reversed or paused — but state officials said they expect to see a large drop at some point.
Legislators reach impasse over noncompetes 
Lawmakers deadlocked, again, on Thursday over a Republican push to roll back the state’s 2023 ban on noncompete agreements.
Repealing the ban for white collar workers is a top priority for the Minnesota Business Partnership, which includes more than 100 executives of the state’s largest companies. They argue the ban undermines companies’ right to protect valuable trade secrets, even though proprietary information is already protected under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.
The ban’s author Rep. Emma Greenman, DFL-Minneapolis, said large companies are pushing to restore noncompetes to stifle competition and push down wages.
“It gives them power to restrict their employees from leaving, from going to a competitor, from starting a small business … Trade secrets are actually very well protected,” Greenman said during a meeting between House and Senate members of the jobs “working group” on Thursday.
About one in five American workers — in jobs ranging from medicine to child care — are bound by a noncompete agreement, which costs workers more than $250 billion per year by decreasing competition, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC proposed a national ban on noncompetes under the Biden administration.
Workers in California have famously been able to hop from employer to employer because the state doesn’t enforce noncompete agreements, which Berkeley political scientist AnnaLee Saxenian and other experts have cited as a key factor that fueled the immense, wealth-creating innovation of Silicon Valley.
Rep. Dave Baker, R-Willmar, proposed the working group insert a provision in their larger jobs and labor agreement that would allow companies to enforce noncompete agreements for employees making more than $120,000 and whose primary duties include “research and development or the creation, analysis, or modification of confidential, proprietary, or trade secret information.”
Greenman said the proposal’s vague language was “trojan horse” that would effectively allow companies to require any worker earning more than $120,000 a year to sign a non-compete agreement.
She asked Baker if he could define “confidential” and “proprietary.” Baker said it was “extremely technical,” and then called for a recess, during which he conferred with a lobbyist from the Minnesota Business Partnership in the hallway.
The proposal failed to get enough support to be adopted, as did a Democratic proposal that would have raised the income threshold for the noncompete ban and required companies to pay the full salary of employees during the enforcement period of the noncompete.
Without a deal, the issue will likely be sent to legislative leaders and the governor to find a compromise; lawmakers are already working past Monday’s adjournment to pass a two-year budget. Without a budget by July 1, swathes of the government shutter.
Nurses union accuses hospitals of skimping on charity care

The largest hospital systems in the Twin Cities and Duluth areas receive tens of millions more in tax exemptions than they give back through charity care, according to a report released this week by the Minnesota Nurses Association.
The union estimates seven hospital systems — Allina, Children’s, Essentia, Fairview, HealthPartners, North Memorial and St. Luke’s — received $3.9 billion in federal, state and local tax exemptions between 2018 and 2022 but only spent $607 million in free or reduced cost care for poor patients. The union also estimates hospitals’ spending on charity care relative to their overall budgets has fallen by nearly half on average over the past decade, from .78% in 2013 to .41% in 2022.
“The nation’s earliest hospitals were founded principally by religious and charitable organizations to tend to the sick and poor. Today’s not-for-profit hospitals and systems, often monumentally wealthy and glittering institutions, are their distant cousins,” the report says.
The union is currently negotiating new labor contracts on behalf of some 15,000 nurses with the seven large hospital systems scrutinized in the report. The nurses are seeking higher pay and staffing levels ,and the report serves as a response to health leader’s assertions that their demands are unaffordable. As during the last round of negotiations, the union also takes aim at sky-high hospital executive compensation.
Hospitals will point out that charity care represents just a small fraction of the community benefits they provide, including research, education, contributions to community groups, and losing money on Medicaid patients.
Earlier this year, the state Office of the Legislative Auditor released a report finding that Minnesota’s 104 nonprofit general hospitals appear to give back more to their communities than they receive in tax breaks, although it depends on what is counted as a community benefit, and with the caveat that tax benefits are difficult to estimate.
The OLA report looked at individual hospitals’ finances, whereas MNA analyzed health systems as a whole, which include many hospitals in addition to clinics, pharmacies, assisted living facilities and more. Unlike the MNA report, the OLA report does not account for indirect benefits of hospitals’ tax exempt statuses like being able to issue bonds and receive charitable gifts.
The health care reform think tank Lown Institute used a more limited definition of community benefit when it estimated that 90% of Minnesota’s hospitals receive more in tax breaks than they give back to the community, adding up to a $1.1 billion loss for the state.
Nonprofit hospitals are exempt from taxes on income, property and sales with the expectation that they reinvest those savings back into the community. Minnesota and the federal government require hospitals to report this spending, at least in vague terms, but don’t require a minimum amount of spending in exchange for their tax-exempt status.
The nurses union has sought legislation requiring greater disclosure and more restrictions on community benefits from hospitals.
Colorado governor vetoes pro-union bill
Colorado’s Democratic Gov. Jared Polis vetoed a bill this month that would have repealed the state’s unique anti-union law that effectively makes it a right-to-work state.
Under Colorado’s 80-year-old Labor Peace Act, unions must win a second election with 75% support in order to collect dues from all represented workers. The law was passed before the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, which enabled states to pass right-to-work laws banning unions from collecting mandatory dues from all workers represented by their collective bargaining agreements.
Repealing the requirement was a key priority for unions in Colorado, and it passed with wide margins along party lines in the state Legislature. Polis said he wanted unions and businesses to find common ground, and that there should be a “high threshold of worker participation” for mandatory dues.
The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute noted that Colorado’s union density of 7.7% is closer to the 6.2% average for right-to-work states than the 15.8% in non-right-to-work states. In Minnesota, which does not have a right-to-work law, 14.2% of workers are union members.
Minnesota state lawmakers have made it easier in recent years for public sector workers to join a union. Under a 2023 law, a public union may be certified once a majority of workers sign cards in support of unionizing without the need for an election as required in the private sector.
Resident physicians at Hennepin Healthcare and the University of Minnesota were able to quickly unionize using this “card check” process. Those workers may not be required to pay union dues, however, because of a 2018 Supreme Court ruling that bars public-sector unions from collecting mandatory fees from workers they represent.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/HibTac-Mine-view.webp,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

David Beasley asked her to join South Carolina’s Juvenile Parole Board some three decades ago, Terrye Seckinger was unaware there was a group of citizens deciding which incarcerated youth should be allowed to rejoin the community and which should remain in state custody for crimes they committed as children.
Since then, she has served on a total of five citizen governing boards covering criminal justice and education in the state. Once her tenure was over on one board, it wasn’t long before a Republican governor called her about another.
“It’s not like people are knocking down the doors,” Seckinger said. “In fact, most don’t even know there are these boards where citizens can come and make a difference and have a say in our state government.”
Keeping seats full on South Carolina’s vast and vague committees is a challenge for the state’s political leaders, especially the governor, who’s tasked with making most of the appointments, with the Senate’s approval.

High-profile boards, such as those overseeing the port or state-owned utility company, have a long line of hopefuls seeking a position.
But vacancies can linger for lesser-known but not necessarily less important groups.
The Palmetto State has just shy of 300 such boards and advisory groups with about 5,000 politically appointed positions, equivalent to the population of a small South Carolina town, said Brandon Charochak, spokesman for Gov. Henry McMaster.
They make decisions for South Carolinians on a host of issues, including public colleges, historic districts, disease prevention and professional licensing.
There are boards dedicated to the management of aquatic plants and waterfowl habitats, those that oversee operations at specialized K-12 boarding schools, and a group that makes maintenance decisions at the Governor’s Mansion.
Some have less responsibility, rarely meet or simply remain on the books despite being unfunded or out of existence for years.
A long list of vacancies
A list published by the Secretary of State’s office advertises some 425 vacancies, though how many seats are truly open is unclear. The office depends on the boards to keep the list current. Many don’t. At least a third of them don’t actually exist anymore.


How to apply
To be considered for appointment to one of South Carolina’s hundreds of citizen boards and commissions, you can fill out an online interest form to the Governor’s Office here.
A list of vacancies is maintained by the Secretary of State’s Office, though don’t rely on it to be accurate.
Qualifications for each board are listed in the Legislative Manual.
Most appointment decisions are left up to the governor and require confirmation by the Senate.


But for others, lingering openings on boards can have an oversized impact on the lives of South Carolinians.
A seat held for someone with a disabled family member living in a state institution remains unfilled on the Adult Protection Coordinating Council, which is tasked with improving the system of care for people with disabilities.
A doctor and a pathologist are needed for a panel that reviews death investigations for the elderly and disabled living in state-contracted facilities. The Vulnerable Adults Fatalities Review Committee aims to identify trends and prevent future deaths.
Spots for four business people remain unfilled on the Coordinating Council for Workforce Development, a board that comes up with the strategies for training workers needed to fill the many job openings in the state.
A prosecutor, a youth recreation organization, and a special education expert are missing from the Governor’s Juvenile Justice Advisory Council, which is tasked with plans for keeping children out of the juvenile justice system.
The board governing the Conservation Bank, which doles out grants to preserve land from development, has several openings. So does the board that oversees billions in bond financing for hospitals, schools and colleges.
There are also openings on the commission that reviews foster care placements to ensure children have a safe and stable home.
The list goes on.
SC woman sues over ‘racial quota’ for minority affairs board

A call for change
How active a board is depends greatly on how much its members are willing to work, said Seckinger.
Like many who sit on boards, she’s politically connected. Beasley was a family friend even before she and her sister worked on his 1994 campaign for governor. Her brother is state Sen. Chip Campsen, who was first elected to the state House in 1996.
Being known in political circles, combined with a willingness to devote her time, explains why she keeps getting those calls.
“I tend to find myself in the fox hole,” she said.
It’s up to the agency heads to keep things running day to day. A good board, according to Seckinger, does not micromanage but rather comes up with new ideas and thinks about government in terms of what could be.
“Members of the public bring a different perspective to agencies,” she said. “I think there’s wisdom in that different set of eyes.”
For Seckinger, that led to a successful push for public charter schools in the state after she spent time serving on the State Board of Education. And during her time on the Commission for Higher Education, she argued unsuccessfully for changing to a centralized Board of Regents rather than individual college boards, saying it would lead to better scrutiny of college tuition costs and spending.
“Looking with a business mindset, you see things in agencies that don’t make sense or ways to spend less,” Seckinger said. “Because it’s our tax dollars.”
Eliminate them?

The issue of board vacancies even led Gov. Henry McMaster to use his State of the State address this year to call for the review and potential elimination of the state’s more than 40 professional licensing boards. They regulate cosmetologists, construction contractors, chiropractors, real estate agents, nurses, doctors, dentists and more.
If the boards were eliminated, oversight would instead be handled directly by the state’s licensing agency, rather than board appointees.
But the General Assembly ultimately did not oblige that request.
Legislators did, however, combine a trio of health-related state agencies into a single, Cabinet-level agency, eliminating their separate governing and advisory boards.
“We have way too many boards and commissions,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey previously told the SC Daily Gazette. “It’s difficult for the governor to find qualified, interested people to serve. Not because we haven’t tried or think it’s not important.”
The Edgefield Republican was among supporters of consolidating the health agencies to one department overseen by a single director who answers to the governor.
“My position for years has been if you’re going to have a governor, let him be governor,” Massey said.
Beyond that, Massey said, those people who would best serve in these positions are often already too busy.
He recalls long-standing vacancies on the committee that oversees the state’s clay, gold, stone and sand mines. Vacancies have also resulted in boards lacking a quorum, meaning they can’t meet.
‘Not a simple process’
Some lawmakers call SC Arts Commission funding a ‘waste.’ Supporters say it’s essential.

Even boards without vacancies are stacked with people serving well beyond their prescribed term. They’re left in what’s known as holdover status, often for years — some for more than a decade.
Henry Horowitz of Greenville served on the South Carolina Arts Commission for 20 years, six of those as chairman, since being appointed by former Gov. Mark Sanford. While not an artist himself, Horowitz has been heavily involved in the arts, serving on half a dozen boards and founding the Artisphere festival in Greenville.
This year, he said, he told McMaster it was time to find someone new for the small but influential state board that last year distributed $18.4 million to support the arts, from emerging artists to Charleston’s long-running Spoleto festival.
His replacement is among five new members of the nine-member arts commission confirmed by the Senate earlier this month. All five are replacing people who had been serving six years or more past the expiration of their terms.
In all, the Senate made about 75 confirmations and reconfirmations to boards and commissions this year. More than a dozen other nominees went unconfirmed before the 2025 legislative session officially ended May 8.
Horowitz, like Seckinger, only knew of the opening in 2005 because the governor called him.
People can apply online, but those without political connections may not know the vacancies — or the boards themselves — exist.
“It’s hard to get on a board when you’re not aware of them,” he said. “Therefore, people don’t get invited.”
Many of these board members are not paid for their time beyond covering travel expenses. The screening involves a financial and criminal history check and hearings before Senate committees. Horowitz also recalls having to submit five letters of recommendation when he applied.
“It’s not a simple process,” he said.
Charochak, the governor’s spokesman, said it’s common for applicants to drop out once they find out about the six-month to year-long procedure.
“That’s truly the main issue we have,” he said.
The impact of vacancies
SC woman who killed her abuser again denied parole after nearly 5 years in prison

A state parole board decision last fall — when those supporting a woman’s release included her local legislator, police chief and solicitor — serves as an example of how vacancies and absences on a board can make a real difference in people’s lives.
If one more board member had been present, the Greenwood mother of five imprisoned for killing her abuser may have been released after nearly five years behind bars.
One parole board seat remains unfilled some eight months later.
McMaster pointed to another case in making his argument for doing away with independent governing boards at the state’s mental health and disabilities agencies. A lawsuit filed in December by the U.S. Department of Justice accuses the state of keeping adults with serious mental illnesses in institutions longer than necessary. It was filed 17 months after federal authorities warned a lawsuit was imminent if nothing changed.
McMaster said putting the governor’s office in charge would allow whoever’s governor to respond and hold people more accountable when things go wrong.
But advocates for these populations are less certain.
Bill Lindsey, who heads South Carolina’s chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said having mental health commissioners from each congressional district gave families direct access to decision makers when issues arose. While agency employees set policy, commissioners can serve as advocates.
Margie Williamson agreed. She’s spent the last 15 years leading a nonprofit advocacy group in Columbia for people with developmental disabilities, called The Arc of South Carolina.
“Speaking as a parent, I had somebody who represented my child,” she said. “Otherwise, in the agency, (those with disabilities) can get lost, being seen as just a number and not a person.”
DOJ sues SC over claims of warehousing people with mental illness

With more than 20,000 people with disabilities on a waiting list for state services, Williamson is worried more people will slip through the cracks. Coupled with a multitude of proposed cuts to federal aid programs and possibly Medicaid, she said the lack of certainty has become overwhelming.
Lindsey said he’s hopeful, even as the Department of Mental Health is folded into a larger Cabinet agency, that the commission will remain intact in an advisory capacity, keeping family members informed of what’s going on as the agency restructures.
Lindsey also said he was surprised by the legal action taken by the U.S. Department of Justice. While there was still more work to be done to improve the quality of housing for those transitioning out of mental health hospitals, he had felt the state had made great strides.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_2074-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-23 14:23:58+00:00,Mississippi Today,78-year-old death row inmate pins hope of reprieve on timing and PTSD,Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/23/78-year-old-death-row-inmate-pins-hope-of-reprieve-on-timing-and-ptsd/,Vietnam War vet Richard Jordan's crime and sentence came after the U.S. Supreme Court said capital punishment was unconstitutional.,"In the remaining weeks before his scheduled execution, Richard Jordan, Mississippi’s oldest and longest serving death row inmate, is looking for ways to fight his death sentence. 
Jordan was sentenced to death for the kidnap and murder of Gulfport resident Edwina Marter in January 1976. Marter’s sons, who were 3 and 9 at the time of her death, and her husband are still alive, according to public records. About a decade ago, her family told The Advocate they were hoping to receive closure from the execution after years of its delay. 
The decision to let the execution proceed rests in the hands of the Mississippi Supreme Court, the U.S. Supreme Court and a federal district court judge – two courts that have rejected his previous requests and a judge who has allowed another execution to be carried out while a challenge to the state’s execution protocol continues. 
Attorneys filed two motions asking the Mississippi Supreme Court to rehear its denial of the 78-year-old’s petition for post conviction relief and to rehear its order setting his execution. 
They wrote that when the court denied his post-conviction relief petition, it “misapprehended the facts and the law.” To fix it, Jordan asked the court to vacate his death sentence or at a minimum return it to the trial court for another look. 
His attorneys argue Jordan’s death sentence is not valid because in 1976, when the murder was committed and Jordan was sentenced, Mississippi and all other states had ceased executions based on a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Furman v. Georgia that capital punishment was unconstitutional. 
On July 2, 1976, four months after Jordan was sentenced, the Supreme Court overturned this ruling in Gregg v. Georgia. Mississippi passed a statute allowing discretionary death penalty sentences in 1977.
“Here, because there was no constitutional provision for the death penalty at the time of Jordan’s offense, his death sentence is unconstitutional,” the May 15 filing states. 
Jordan went to trial multiple times and his sentences were overturned. His death sentence did not stick until decades later in 1998. Since his first trial, Jordan has been incarcerated for nearly 50 years. 
In another recent court filing, Jordan’s attorneys argue the state’s motion to set Jordan’s execution didn’t follow state law because he has not exhausted all state and federal remedies. 
Jordan asked the U.S. Supreme Court in March to hear his case. As of May, that petition for writ of certiorari is awaiting a decision. The state opposes and has asked the high court not to take up Jordan’s petition, saying the Mississippi Supreme Court was correct in its ruling. 
That petition centers around his access to a mental health expert separate from the prosecution to develop and present sentencing mitigation as an indigent defendant, which was established as a constitutional right through the U.S. Supreme Court’s Ake v. Oklahoma decision. The other issue is how the Mississippi Supreme Court handled Jordan’s Ake claims in his appeal and post-conviction. 
At trial, Jordan was evaluated by a state psychiatrist whose report was also given to the prosecution, which his attorneys argue undermined his mitigation case since the Ake decision specified the evaluation was to be used on the indigent defendant’s behalf.
The petition states he was not diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from his combat service in Vietnam, but instead incorrectly as having antisocial personality disorder. 
“Review of that decision is manifestly warranted to ensure appropriate respect for this Court’s decisions, vindicate the supremacy of federal law, and ensure that those defendants in Mississippi whose mental health will be an issue at trial receive the right to the expert assistance to which the Due Process Clause entitles them,” the March court filing states. 
Additionally, Jordan and fellow death row inmate Ricky Chase are lead plaintiffs in a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the drugs used for lethal injection. 
Since 2022, the state has since added alternative execution methods if lethal injection drugs aren’t available: execution by gas chamber, electrocution or firing squad. To date, a handful of states have used these other methods, including the use of nitrogen gas in Alabama and firing squad in South Carolina. 
The Mississippi lawsuit did not stop the December 2022 execution of Thomas Loden, another inmate who was part of the legal challenge. 
The same day Jordan’s attorneys filed motions with the Mississippi Supreme Court, Jordan and Chase filed a motion with U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate, asking for him to order the state to provide essential documents to the plaintiffs about the state’s possession and planned use of execution drugs as well as documents related to the most recent executions of David Cox in 2021 and Loden. 
Plaintiffs wrote that access to this information would help them seek an injunction to stay Jordan’s execution and help with discovery, which is the process of obtaining evidence from other parties before trial. Trial for the lawsuit has been scheduled for Dec. 1, 2025. 
“It is unconscionable for Defendants to seek the execution of Richard Jordan while continuing to stonewall Plaintiffs’ repeated demands for supplementation of discovery in this case,” a May 14 court filing states.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/22091856/Mina-RichardJordan-FeatImage-04.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)Amid ongoing raids in Florida immigrant communities, Gov. Ron DeSantis’ signed a bill Thursday creating an avenue for relief against people unlawfully providing immigration legal services.
HB 915, one of 17 bills DeSantis signed Thursday, prohibits notaries public from advertising their services using language that implies they possess professional legal skills in immigration law. Notaries public are authorized to serve as witnesses and verify signatures on documents such as powers of attorney, deeds, and estates.
Thomas Kennedy, a policy analyst with Florida Immigrant Coalition, said in a phone interview that the group sought help from lawmakers in addressing the problem of notaries public providing immigration legal services, which he described as an epidemic in Central and South Florida. He called the signing of the new law good news.
“This is happening all over the place. People are very, very desperate for some sort of solution or adjustment of status that leaves them vulnerable for people that are preying on them,” Kennedy said, pointing to the hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in Florida at risk of deportation after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling earlier this week allowing the Trump administration to strip the immigrants of temporary protections and work permits.
A series of special sessions at the beginning of the year yielded hundreds of millions for local law enforcement to engage in immigration enforcement, plus new laws heightening penalties for immigrants living in the country without authorization. However, during the regular legislative session, lawmakers didn’t pass other proposals cracking down on legal aid for immigrant children and companies hiring people unauthorized to work in the country.
But nearly all lawmakers agreed to pass the bill from Orlando Democratic Rep. Johanna López, allowing people to recover damages in civil lawsuits from notaries public providing representation in immigration law matters.
Further, notaries public won’t be able to refer to themselves as “notario público,” the term in Spanish, because in some Latin American countries “notarios” can file legal documents, give legal advice, and represent people in court, according to the final legislative analysis of the bill.
Still, Kennedy said passing a pro-immigrant law in this climate was no easy feat.
“I guess common sense prevailed in this matter,” he said.

On Wednesday, U.S. District Judge David Joseph in the Western District of Louisiana, Lake Charles division, ordered the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to rewrite employer guidelines in a pregnant workers protection law, according to court documents.
The statute requires employers with 15 or more staff to provide reasonable accommodations — think time off for appointments, additional rest breaks, a stool to sit on while working — for pregnancy, childbirth or related conditions, as long as the requests don’t place “undue hardship” on the company or organization.
Joseph, who Republican President Donald Trump appointed during his first term. He ruled that former Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration exceeded its authority by including abortion in rules finalized last year.
“This court’s decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women’s rights and reproductive freedom,” said Inimai Chettiar, the president of paid leave advocacy group A Better Balance, in a statement.

The ruling is a victory for state officials in Louisiana, Mississippi and a group of Catholic Church organizations.Plaintiffs sued the EEOC over the inclusion of abortion in the guidelines, which the agency released in April 2024 following a lengthy public comment process, Illuminator reported.
Roughly 54,000 Americans said abortion should be excluded from the definition of “pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions,” while some 40,000 said pregnancy termination should be included.
Lawyers for the states — both have near-total abortion bans — argued the rule doesn’t align with the Dobbs v. Women’s Health Organization decision from the U.S. Supreme Court, while Catholic groups said the abortion provision violates freedom of religion.
“This is a win for Louisiana and for life,” Republican Attorney General Liz Murrill said on social media.
Several other lawsuits against the law are in play. A federal judge ruled in April that a separate group of Catholic employers do not have to protect their employees’ access to abortion and fertility treatments, North Dakota Monitor reported.
In February, another judge ruled that a lawsuit filed by 17 GOP attorneys general against the EEOC over abortion accommodations in the workplace can move forward, according to The Associated Press.
And the Texas government and its agencies don’t have to comply with any part of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. A judge temporarily blocked the law’s enforcement in February 2024 after the attorney general argued it was unconstitutionally passed in December 2022 by proxy vote, The Texas Tribune reported.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/abortionpills.jpg,,,2025-05-23 11:07:21.629634

(Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current))Lawmakers are looking to pass a law that would require utilities to fully refund energy customers who are overcharged, closing loopholes that have allowed utilities to withhold full refunds from wronged customers.
Assembly Bill 452, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown-May, would ensure customers receive full refunds with interest for overcharges, address high utility bills by shifting some cost volatility back to utilities, and extending regulatory timelines for rate case reviews.
The bill comes after years of customer complaints detailing partial refunds by NV Energy which is only required to reimburse customers up to six months prior to the data the error is discovered in certain cases. 
Last week the bill became more relevant than ever after state utility regulators disclosed that over several years NV Energy overcharged more than 80,000 customers over $17 million, with only 20,000 receiving partial six-month refunds that amount to a fraction of what customers overpaid.
Following the disclosure, NV Energy’s president and CEO stepped down amid a call from regulatory staff at the Nevada Public Utilities Commission for an investigation into whether NV Energy used an inapplicable rule to cap refunds at six months.
Several advocacy groups said the disclosure that the statewide electric utility overcharged tens of thousands of customers for years only highlighted the need for the bill’s passage. 
“It is outrageous that NV Energy would harm so many customers like this and not report it or fully repay them,” said Audrey Peral, program director of Chispa Nevada in a statement. “Nevada lawmakers must pass Assembly Bill 452 quickly to protect utility customers from these kinds of abuses. Hard-working families can’t keep paying the price for NV Energy’s wrongdoing.”
Under the bill, “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the Commission determines that a utility has charged a customer more than any applicable rate or tariff allows, the utility shall refund to the customer,  with interest, the full amount of any overcharge.”
The bill passed the Assembly on a 35-7 vote in April, with some bipartisan support. Under legislative deadlines, the bill would need to pass the Senate Friday.
The bill is also supported by the Nevada Bureau of Consumer Protection, which said in a letter to lawmakers the bill would ensure “a full and equitable refund to ratepayers who are unfairly overcharged.”
However, the bill has been strongly opposed by NV Energy, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy. 
Ryan Bellows, the vice president of government and external relations at NV energy, told lawmakers last week that the statewide electric utility complies with Nevada Public Utilities Commission approved rules on customer refunds.
“The rule is that it’s a six month payment back to the customer. We are currently communicating with the commission on this issue, on how to address and improve and correct this rule going forward,” Bellows said, adding that any changes to the rule is best left to utility regulators.
The Nevada Public Utilities Commission disputes NV Energy’s interpretation of the rules on customer refunds, telling lawmakers the issue is currently being examined by the Commission’s consumer complaint resolution division.
Garrett Weir, general counsel for the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said the bill and “the proposed change to statute would certainly clarify” the rules on customer refunds.
 Price spikes and cost sharing

NV Energy also opposes other aspects of the bill, especially language that would direct utility regulators to potentially adopt a fuel cost-sharing structure so ratepayers are not left covering the full cost of fuel price spikes caused by global events or weather disasters.
“It’s our position that the adoption of fuel cost sharing would lead to increased costs for customers,” Bellows said.
The bill would ask utility regulators to investigate how to best navigate energy price spikes and to study if fuel cost sharing is in the best interest of Nevadans and the utility. State energy regulators would submit a report on their investigation to the Interim Committee on Growth and Infrastructure by July 1, 2026.
Nevada law prohibits utilities from profiting from fuel and purchased power costs, however in Nevada every dollar NV Energy spends to purchase fuel is passed fully through to customers. Fuel accounts for about one-third of NV Energy customer costs.
Bellows argued revisions to price spike policies are unnecessary because NV Energy does not mark up purchases and the Public Utilities Commission has the authority to deny cost recovery for any purchases deemed imprudent.
“I would tell you that the purpose of this bill is really to prevent us from utilizing natural gas to serve our customers and to build out Nevada’s energy infrastructure for economic development,” Bellows said. 
NV Energy is heavily reliant on out-of-state natural gas sources, which have seen sporadic but sharp price fluctuations in recent years.  In 2022, the price it paid for natural gas — which accounts for more than half of Nevada’s power supply —  spiked by 70% in January 2023, according to NV Energy.
Several unions and trades groups echoed concerns about the bill’s potential negative impact on economic development and job opportunities, including the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Building and Construction Trades Council of Northern Nevada, and the National Electrical Contractors Association.
Nevada residents who spoke in favor of the bill’s language to investigate a potential cost-sharing structure highlighted the financial strain on families and seniors due to rising energy costs.
“I hear from families and seniors who are stretched to their breaking point by high energy bills. They’re cutting back on life saving air conditioning, skipping meals, rationing medicine, and they’re still falling behind. For those living on low income and fixed income, the cycle of high bills is relentless and dangerous,” said Mary House, co-founder of a local faith-based nonprofit community organization called Caring, Helping & Restoring Lives.
Conservation groups and energy advocates emphasized the bill’s potential to reduce high utility bills, promote clean energy, and ensure consumer protection. 
The bill is supported by Advanced Energy United, Western Resource Advocates, the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, and the Sierra Club.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NVEnergy_RC_004.JPG-ronda-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

The Supreme Judicial Court decided against adopting a rule that would allow an employer to retaliate for union activity just because they met the terms of a collective bargaining agreement.
The post Pay increase doesn’t undercut union retaliation claim in Newton, SJC rules appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MONEY CAN’T BUY LOVE, according to the saying. It also can’t buy an employer the right to take action against a worker that, on its own, would qualify as illegal retaliation.  That is the essence of a Supreme Judicial Court ruling issued Thursday in a dispute between the City of Newton and a sergeant on the city’s police force. A state board correctly concluded that transferring a Newton police sergeant, who also serves as a union leader, to night and weekend shifts was illegal retaliation for his union activities, the state’s high court ruled. It can be retaliation, the SJC said, even though the officer had a blemished work history and the new position came with a pay raise. John Babcock was transferred from his six-year position as a specialty sergeant working regular daytime hours with weekends and holidays off to a sergeant position working irregular nighttime hours, weekends, and holidays.   This transfer, in 2018, came after union-related activities lead to some disputes with city’s chief of police, David MacDonald. The city argued, and a lower court agreed, that the shift change came with a “significant” pay raise in line with the union’s collective bargaining agreement, so it doesn’t count as an adverse employment action – or something an employer does that negatively impacts terms or conditions of employment.  In its opinion and during arguments in March, the SJC skewered that logic. It was a shift from a “more humane schedule” for a man with a family, as Justice Serge Georges put, to a “crazy schedule with half days” according to Justice Frank Gaziano. “We decline to adopt a rule that would allow an employer that takes such materially disadvantageous action against an employee in retaliation for union activity to evade the protections [of state law], because the employer also complies with the terms bargained for as part of a collective bargaining agreement,” wrote Justice Dalila Wendlandt for a unanimous SJC on Thursday. Babcock’s history with department leadership was messy, as laid out by the court’s decision.  He was promoted up through the traffic division over the decades while serving in leadership positions with local police unions, finally receiving promotion to sergeant specialist in the traffic bureau in 2012. Babcock became union negotiator for city contracts and then president of the superior officers union, while MacDonald was an executive officer and later chief of police for the city. Over the years, the court noted, the two had “several disputes.” On the union side, contract negotiations got heated, the two clashed over a proposed change to special leave policy, and Babcock challenged MacDonald’s authority to place a bargaining unit member on paid administrative leave and immediately order the member to take a psychological test. The city failed to properly bargain over the fitness requirements that could have involved an on-the-spot psychological test, an appeals court declared in 2021 when reviewing the case. While the union’s challenge to the psychological test continued, Babcock was running into issues with his role overseeing paid details, where off-duty police officers are hired for vendors in the city.  Citing overstaffing problems, MacDonald removed Babcock from detail staffing, but Babcock continued to “cause confusion in the detail system and to overstaff police details” according to the city’s brief, and continued offering opinions on detail staffing even when told expressly to refrain from doing so. The city provided no evidence that Babcock continued to be involved in traffic details after the order, the SJC wrote. Babcock also got into a verbal altercation with a subordinate, according to the court, yelling at a parking control officer and bringing her to tears. MacDonald issued a letter of reprimand in late March 2018, warning that “further misconduct by you may result in additional discipline.” A month later, MacDonald informed Babcock he would be transferred to the patrol bureau working night shifts with an 8 percent pay raise. The police union filed a charge arguing that the transfer was retaliatory and barred by law. While a hearing officer agreed that Babcock had made a case for retaliation, the officer dismissed the claim because the city had produced evidence of Babcock’s insubordination and misconduct as a reason for the transfer.  But the Commonwealth Employment Relations Board (CERB) disagreed on appeal, deciding that the city had not provided enough evidence to support a reasonable conclusion that Babcock was transferred because of the poor conduct. The board concluded the union proved its case, and ordered Babcock reinstated to his day shift position.  The Appeals Court, reviewing the board’s decision, considered whether the union had to prove that Babcock had a generally good work record, whether the pay increase defeated the claim of an adverse employment action, and whether the city proved that the motive for Babcock’s transfer was because of work performance and not union activity. A unanimous Appeals Court decision written by Justice Gabrielle Wolohojian – now a justice of the SJC who did not participate in Thursday’s opinion – concluded that the good work record showing was not necessary, but the board should not have allowed the claim to go forward because the transfer came with the pay raise negotiated under the union’s collective bargaining agreement. Further, she wrote, the city offered “circumstantial evidence” to prove that the transfer was for lawful reasons. A lateral transfer can be considered an adverse employment action if it results in material differences in “any term or condition of employment.” Since the night shift move came with the pay raise laid out under the union’s collective bargaining agreement, the union did not prove that the transfer was a significant departure from the terms of the agreement. “We, of course, do not minimize the importance of family life or the effect that a change in work schedule may have on it,” Wolohojian wrote. “But that is not the question here, which instead turns on whether the union established an objective material change in the terms and conditions of Babcock’s employment.” She said it is also important to consider “the inherent authority of police chiefs to assign officers to duties and schedules as they see fit to preserve public safety.”  Other police unions balked. “If the Appeals Court’s decision is permitted to stand,” the Boston police officers union wrote to the high court in support of the transferred officer, “it will grant public employers with license to retaliate against employees who engage in concerted, protected activity by transferring them to undesirable assignments involving non-traditional hours of work and effectively eviscerate the ability of public employees and/or their exclusive bargaining representatives to prove that the employer’s actions were unlawfully motivated.” The SJC disagreed with Wolohojian’s logic. The collective bargaining agreement may have made the day-to-night transfer “more palatable,” Wendlandt wrote, but there is still clearly a material disadvantage to being forced to work nights and weekends when previously working day shifts with weekends off. A transfer that complies with the collective bargaining agreement, she wrote, can still cause legal harm. The difference between these shifts is underlined, she noted, because transferring a sergeant or lieutenant from a specialty assignment had never been done before in the Newton Police Department.  That there was misconduct is only relevant if it is concretely tied to the decision to transfer the officer, Wendlandt noted. Nothing in the court’s history, she wrote, shows “that an employer is free to retaliate against an employee for union activities because the employee’s employment record is blemished.” The city did show that there was a history of insubordination by Babcock, the SJC agreed, but it offered no evidence that the incidents factored into the decision to transfer him, even after the incident with the parking control officer.  “The city produced no evidence of any misconduct by Babcock following the letter of reprimand,” Wendlandt wrote. “The only evidence in the record related to MacDonald’s transfer decision was that when Babcock asked MacDonald for an explanation, Babcock did not receive one.” The post Pay increase doesn’t undercut union retaliation claim in Newton, SJC rules appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/5F65B303-7231-4027-9244-80F95C116CD9-scaled-e1715032375383.jpeg?fit=1024%2C575&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

(AJ Dome for Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Drought-stricken governments in west-central Kansas have escalated their fight for water rights from state to federal court, which could impact how cities across the state handle future disputes.
The cities of Hays and Russell, located in neighboring counties just off of Interstate 70 near the middle of the state, sued the nearby Edwards County in 2024 for blocking a planned water transfer. The cities do not have enough water to supply future residents. They concocted a plan beginning in 1995 with the purchase of the 7,000-acre R9 Ranch in Edwards County. The ranch contains 32 water rights the cities wanted to use for their public water supply.
The cities say the county has been opposed to the project since before the property was purchased, but county officials have cited concerns over a large amount of water being transferred out of a prominent agricultural community.
In district court filings, the cities said Edwards County deliberately thwarted their plans through zoning regulations, a rigged planning committee and other hurdles. After years of fighting, a decision from the district court was delayed, and a case record filled with a 30-year history of newspaper clippings, meeting minutes and government documents turned into a constitutional debate.
Attorneys for Edwards County moved the case to federal court in late March after the cities modified their petition for relief to include claims under federal law. Hays and Russell want it moved back to district court, attorneys said in a May 15 filing. County attorneys want the case thrown out entirely.
“Despite holding this land for thirty-years and a stated desperate and urgent need for additional water supplies, Plaintiffs have only just now brought suit seeking to declare a set of ordinances and regulations enacted by the Board of County Commissioners of Edwards County, Kansas as unconstitutional and unenforceable against Plaintiff,” county attorneys wrote in a February district court filing that was transferred in April to federal court.
The cities evaluated other options for municipal water supply for years before beginning the process in 2014 to transfer the R9 Ranch’s water. They have rooted their case in a 1918 Kansas Supreme Court decision that said “city authorities may go wherever it is practicable and necessary to obtain the supply of water for the people of the city.”
Sending the case back to state court is appropriate, the cities’ attorneys argued, “because Kansas State law claims significantly predominate over federal claims in this proceeding, and judicial economy and fairness support litigating this matter in Kansas State district and appellate courts.”
Plus, they said, the cities have two related cases already navigating their ways through the state court system — one before the Kansas Supreme Court and another before the state Water Transfer Panel, which determines whether certain large-scale water transfers can take place.
Roughly 10 years ago, officials in Hays and Russell were ready to begin bringing their plan for the R9 Ranch into fruition, so they requested to change the ranch’s water use permissions from irrigation to municipal use. Local irrigators responded in kind, fearing the cities would take up too much of the area’s water reserves. And Edwards County, too, responded with concerns, which the cities saw as blockades. County officials expressed worry over transferring a large amount of water away from their agricultural community.
In 2024, the county established new zoning regulations, which the cities’ lawyers called “unreasonable, arbitrary, capricious, draconian, highly subjective, and blatantly protectionist permitting requirements.”
The cities’ plan isn’t a one-off. As jurisdictions across Kansas and the western U.S. confront dwindling water supplies because of climate change, overconsumption and aging or inadequate infrastructure, litigators and water officials view the case as having the potential to set the stage, depending on the outcome.
Drought outlooks in the three counties range from moderate to abnormally dry, the lowest drought classification, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor map published Thursday. Ellis County, home to Hays, is entirely in the abnormally dry category, while Russell and Edwards counties contain both abnormally dry and moderate drought predictions.
Hays and Russell get their water from the Dakota Aquifer, the Smoky Hill River and Big Creek, which branches off of the Smoky Hill River, according to public water source data from the Kansas Water Office.
Even as the population has fluctuated in Hays, leading to a slight overall increase in residents, daily water usage has decreased. In 2024, the city’s 21,000 residents used an estimated 86 gallons of water per day. In 2010, the city’s 20,500 residents used about 91 gallons per day. At its highest, residents used 101 gallons daily in 2012, and at its lowest, they used 76 gallons daily in 2020 and 2021.
At every Russell City Council meeting, council members hear updated drought predictions, precipitation outlooks and temperature estimates. In January, the city of Russell found that water conditions had improved, which led to Mayor Jim Cross reducing the town’s water watch severity from stage two to stage one. Stage one includes forbidding the waste of water and a prohibition on public and residential outdoor watering during the daytime.
Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and Republican leadership created a water task force during the 2025 legislative session to shape state water policy and establish a reliable funding source for water conservation efforts.

With the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season expected to bring more frequent and intense storms, Delaware officials are urging residents to prepare now, as Governor Matt Meyer has declared May 26–30 as Hurricane Preparedness Week in coordination with DEMA and local agencies.
The warning comes amid record-breaking global temperatures. The World Meteorological Organization confirmed 2024 as the hottest year on record, extending a decade-long trend of rising land, ocean, and sea surface temperatures. These changes, along with increasing sea levels, pose heightened risks for low-lying states like Delaware.
According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, this year’s hurricane season, which officially runs from June 1 to November 30, is expected to be more active than usual, with an above-average chance of major hurricanes making landfall along the Eastern Seaboard. Forecasts from Colorado State University anticipate 17 named storms, nine hurricanes, and four major hurricanes, surpassing the 30-year average.
“The time to mitigate against storm-related damage is before Hurricane season begins,” said A.J. Schall, Director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. 
“PrepareDe.org empowers everyone to plan for all potentialities by being informed and storm ready. While the fallout from extreme weather can be unpredictable, there are simple ways everyone can plan for the unexpected,” said Schall. “Have a meetup plan for families that kids understand; shore up your home, windows, and landscaped environments; review, print and back up insurance documents, and make a go bag with basic necessities. Always follow evacuation orders and check in with your neighbors and the elderly who may need assistance in emergency situations.”
Officials stress that water remains the deadliest element in hurricanes, with storm surge and inland flooding accounting for most fatalities. As the frequency and strength of storms increase, Delaware residents are encouraged to make emergency plans, assemble supply kits, and stay informed.
DEMA’s preparedness website, PrepareDE.org, provides resources for developing evacuation plans, building emergency kits, and accessing real-time alerts. Residents are also encouraged to check their flood risk, review insurance policies, and plan for pets, seniors, and individuals with special needs.
For emergency alerts, residents can sign up for the Delaware Emergency Notification System (DENS) and download the FEMA app for weather updates. Local officials advise monitoring television, radio, and social media for evacuation notices and storm tracking information.
Hurricane Preparedness Week is part of a broader effort to ensure Delawareans are equipped to face increasingly volatile weather. The state’s emergency management infrastructure, led by DEMA within the Department of Safety and Homeland Security, coordinates response and recovery efforts to minimize damage and safeguard lives.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hurricane-DE-1-1024x576.png,,,2025-05-23 10:01:09.334746

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Before adjourning their regular session for the year, Alaska legislators passed 33 bills through both the House and Senate. Two were vetoed before lawmakers left the Capitol. One of those became the subject of the first successful veto override since 2009.
Here’s a look at what’s passed and is headed to Gov. Mike Dunleavy for final approval or rejection.
Education took top billing
Except for the budget, no subject took more of the Legislature’s attention than education. In April, lawmakers passed House Bill 69, which would have increased the base student allocation — core of the state’s per-student funding formula for public schools — by $1,000 per student. 
Dunleavy vetoed that bill days later, which caused legislators to switch their attention to House Bill 57, an alternative proposal that had a $700 BSA increase and some policy measures proposed by the governor. The House and Senate passed that in late April, but Dunleavy vetoed that bill, too. On Monday, legislators overrode that veto by six votes, marking the first time since 2009 that the Legislature has overridden a governor’s veto and the first time since 2002 that it did so to a sitting governor.
Legislators also passed Senate Bill 95 and Senate Bill 96, which would create a tax credit program that rewards companies that invest in child care programs for their workers. It also offers a new grant program for child care and expands the number of families eligible for child care assistance from the state.
The Legislature passed both of those bills last year but had to redo them this year because of a legal challenge. These new versions have yet to be considered by the governor.
Budget and finances on the table
The veto override for HB 57 likely won’t be the last word on education. The new education formula in HB 57 is subject to funding through the state operating budget, House Bill 53. Dunleavy has the ability to veto line items from the budget, and overriding his decisions on that document would take 45 votes, not the 40 it took to override him on HB 57.
In addition, a part of the education bill is contingent upon the enactment of Senate Bill 113, which changes the way the state handles corporate income taxes assessed on internet businesses. It doesn’t increase taxes, but it does divert revenue from other states to Alaska’s treasury, and Dunleavy implied on Monday that he would veto that bill because he doesn’t view it as a stable way to pay for part of the education bill.
In addition to HB 53, the operating budget, lawmakers also passed House Bill 55, the state’s comprehensive mental health budget, and Senate Bill 57, the state’s capital budget, which is used to pay for construction and renovation projects across the state.
Because of low oil prices and the Legislature’s reluctance to pass new revenue measures, all three budget bills were smaller this year than last year.
Few services will see budget increases, and this year’s Permanent Fund dividend is $1,000, down from $1,403 last year. Alaskans received another $298 last year as a one-time bonus atop the regular dividend.
Help for tourism
Early in the legislative session, lawmakers approved a bill that allows the state-owned Alaska Railroad to borrow money for a new cruise ship dock in Seward. The Legislature passed an identical bill last year, but it was one of five that Dunleavy vetoed, citing the fact that the House voted on it after the legal end of the legislative session. This time around, the governor had no problem signing the bill into law.
The governor also signed SB 15, another after-midnight bill that was redone by the Legislature. That law allows teens as young as 18 to serve alcohol in restaurants, breweries and distilleries, but not package stores or bars. Teens as young as 16 may work in those places but not serve alcohol. The measure was intended to increase the labor force during the summer tourism season.
Legislators also cleared up a long-running tax dispute involving the car-sharing company Turo by passing a bill that requires Turo to collect and remit the state’s car rental tax. Turo rentals are a common feature of the summer tourist season.
Previously, individual car owners who rented out their cars through Turo were required to independently account for and send in their taxes. State records show few people followed that procedure.
The Legislature passed a different version of the bill last year, and Dunleavy vetoed it. The new version cuts the state’s car rental tax and institutes an even lower tax for Turo users.
This version has not yet been examined by the governor.
Changes for commercial fishers
Following some of the recommendations of the state’s seafood task force, legislators passed three bills dealing with commercial fishing.
Commercial fishers who form cooperatives to collectively pay liability and damage claims would see these payments be exempted from being regulated as insurance if House Bill 116 becomes law. At least three co-ops are already operating in the state, but under Washington state law.
House Bill 31 would exempt many commercial fishing boats from the requirement that they register with the state Division of Motor Vehicles. The exemption applies only to Coast Guard-documented boats with a current license from the Commercial Fisheries Entry Commission.
Alaska’s Commercial Fishing and Agriculture Bank would receive a small grant from a defunct state loan fund, allowing the bank to issue low-interest loans to fishers. The Legislature passed the change, recommended by the seafood task force, in Senate Bill 156.
All three bills have yet to cross the governor’s desk for final review.
Tablet computers in prisons
Alaska is one of the last states to forbid prison inmates from regularly using tablet computers. House Bill 35, passed by the Legislature, would change that by instituting rules for tablet use. The bill was encouraged as a means of rehabilitation and education for people in Alaska’s prisons but the 33rd Legislature failed to pass it. Reintroduced this year, the idea moved quickly.
Ban on payday loans
After failing to pass a ban on high-interest, short-term loans during the 33rd Legislature, lawmakers in the first year of the 34th Legislature rapidly passed and advanced Senate Bill 39, which eliminates an exemption from the state’s normal lending laws.
If enacted, SB 39 would restrict loans to a maximum 36% annual percentage rate. Many payday loans have annual interest rates that amount to several hundred percent.
The bill has not yet been sent to the governor.
Insurance and accounting updates
Alaska’s insurance laws are in line to receive significant updates under two bills that the House and Senate passed this year. Senate Bill 133 regulates the prior authorization process used by doctors and other medical specialists when getting permission from an insurance company before undertaking a procedure on a patient. If enacted, it’s designed to speed up the medical treatment process, and the state’s division of insurance is required to keep statistics on how well the changes are working.
The House and Senate also passed a broader insurance bill, Senate Bill 132, that includes a series of minor changes to the state’s insurance laws. It was amended late in the process to include components of a separate bill regulating pharmacy benefit managers.
Accountants also got some attention from the Legislature this year with the passage of House Bill 121, which eases the work requirements for new accountants to become certified to work in Alaska.
None of the three bills have yet been considered by the governor.
Encouraging local housing growth
The Legislature voted to encourage local governments to make long-term housing plans by passing Senate Bill 50, which amends state law to say that boroughs’ comprehensive plans may include housing development. Comprehensive plans are long-term planning documents that set expectations for a borough’s growth and future.
The bill hasn’t yet reached the governor’s desk.
Changes for big-game guides
After more than a decade of work, the Alaska Legislature passed Senate Bill 97, which changes the way the state regulates big game hunting guides. If enacted, SB 97 would permit the state to limit the number of hunting guides in a specific area by selling hunting concessions, much like the federal government already does on federal land in Alaska.
SB 97 was the result of a yearlong process in 2023 by the state’s Big Game Commercial Services Board, which formed a task force to make recommendations and conclusions.
The bill has not yet been sent to the governor for final approval.
Stricter audit procedures by the Legislature
Amid a long-running dispute with the executive branch, the Alaska Legislature passed Senate Bill 183, which would require state officials to turn over data in the format requested by the legislative auditor.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXLegislators say that since 2019, they have been unable to properly audit the part of the Alaska Department of Revenue that audits tax payments by oil and gas companies.
The executive branch, legislators and audit officials say, has refused to compile reports that it previously provided without difficulty.
As a result, legislators don’t know whether the Department of Revenue is cheaply settling tax disputes with oil companies.
Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, and Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham, each sent a letter to Dunleavy, asking him to not veto the bill because of its importance.
The governor has yet to take final action.
No inflation-adjusted raises for state executives
Early in the session, the Legislature voted unanimously to reject a recommendation that the pay of legislators and other top state officials be automatically adjusted for inflation each year.
Dunleavy signed that bill into law on March 6. 
Small changes to state laws
The House and Senate passed a handful of bills that make relatively small changes to state laws. In each case, these changes were requested by Alaskans who ran into trouble and asked for help from their legislators.
House Bill 70, for example, would allow ambulance crews to help some police and rescue dogs who are injured on the job and need to be taken to a veterinarian. Existing law allows bystanders to help, but not certified medical technicians.
Some laws pertaining to the Permanent Fund dividend division, which handles the annual distribution of PFDs, would be updated if House Bill 75 becomes law.
The state’s rural school fund would be able to pay for teacher housing and Mount Edgecumbe High School in Sitka if House Bill 174 becomes law. Currently, MEHS isn’t eligible for grants from the rural school fund under the process used by other rural schools.
Senate Bill 47 clears the way for the Municipality of Anchorage to use local money to pay for pothole repairs on Canyon Road, within Chugach State Park. Those repairs are currently blocked by state law.
All four bills have yet to receive consideration by Dunleavy, who may veto them, allow them to become law without his signature, or sign them into law.
Boards and commissions extended
Alaska has dozens of boards and commissions that regulate various professions and industries, and each of those boards needs to be regularly reauthorized by the Legislature. This year, because of a lawsuit filed by a former legislator, the House and Senate had to redo a boards bill that passed through the Capitol last year, as well as pass their regular bill.
In addition to those two bills, legislators passed a bill that would allow the regulation of some interior designers, affecting the Board of Architects, Engineers and Land Surveyors. 
All three bills have yet to be considered by the governor.
Ceremonial bills
Every year the Capitol sees at least one bill ceremonially renaming a state-owned landmark or establishing a ceremonial holiday. This year was no different.
Legislators voted to rename the airport in Ruby after Harold Esmailka, a well-known Interior pilot who operated air services, including medevac service, for decades. 
They also added two ceremonial marks on the calendar, passing bills that made May 12 the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Day of Recognition and March as Women’s History Month. 
Dunleavy signed Women’s History Month into law in April; he has not considered the other two bills yet.
Letters of protest and praise
In addition to the bills they passed, the House and Senate also approved 15 resolutions — official letters from the House and Senate that stated their positions on specific issues. Among the approved resolutions were ones opposing cuts to Medicaid, praising the sovereignty of Canada and Taiwan, asking for more international immigration for teachers and Afghans, and celebrating the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th birthday.
In addition to those 15 joint resolutions, the Alaska Senate passed a unilateral resolution asking Congress to allow people from American Samoa to vote in federal elections and serve as officers in the U.S. military.

Mark Alford from Missouri said the bill “strengthens and restores the integrity” of SNAP in order to “ensure it is a temporary life vest for the needy — not a lifestyle”(Getty Images).Missouri could lose around $400 million in federal funding for food assistance under a plan approved by Congressional Republicans Thursday — which would strain the state budget and likely strip thousands of low-income families of food aid across the state.
Those cost-shifts could put pressure on the legislature to slash the state’s SNAP program or fill in the federal funding gaps by cutting other state services.
Roughly one-tenth of Missouri’s population, or over 650,000 people, receive SNAP benefits.
“This is about parents not eating so their kids can, or children going to school hungry,” said Amy Blouin, president and CEO of the progressive think tank Missouri Budget Project.
Another provision in the bill that cleared the U.S. House would create stricter work reporting requirements for SNAP, which could cut or reduce benefits for 150,000 Missourians, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates. 
“This bill would raise costs on families and make it harder for Missourians of all ages to meet their basic needs,” said Blouin. 
The legislation aims to extend President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, a move the Congressional Budget Office projected would decrease resources for low-income families while increasing resources for top earners. The  package passed in the House early Thursday could cut $267 billion from SNAP over 10 years, according to the CBO’s preliminary analysis earlier this week. It would also cut over $600 billion from Medicaid. 
Under the proposal passed by the House, SNAP costs would be shifted to the states starting in 2028.
The federal government currently covers 100% of SNAP benefits and 50% of the administrative costs. Under the proposal, states would need to cover between 5% and 25% of benefits and 75% of administration.
The share of costs the federal government shifts to states would hinge on states’ error rates, meaning the rate at which states over or underpay benefits recipients. States would need to pay a greater portion of the benefits depending on how high their error rate is.
In 2023, the most recent data available, Missouri’s error rate was 10%, which would mean the highest cost share. Missouri would need to cover 25% of the cost of benefits. 
A Department of Social Services spokesperson said more recent data isn’t available.
Missouri’s Republican House delegation voted for the bill and Democrats voted against it.
Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Alford said the bill “strengthens and restores the integrity” of SNAP in order to “ensure it is a temporary life vest for the needy — not a lifestyle.”
Democratic U.S. Rep Emanuel Cleaver said the bill amounts to “ ripping health care and food assistance away from vulnerable families, to give another tax break that lines the pockets of billionaires.”
Several parts of the package are expected to change in the Senate and come back to the House for a final vote in the coming months.

Scheduling note: WhatMatters is taking Memorial Day off and will return to your inboxes on Tuesday.
California officials moved quickly to start another legal battle against President Donald Trump’s administration after the U.S. Senate voted Thursday to revoke federal waivers that allowed the state to phase-out gas powered cars and combat air pollution.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and California Attorney General Rob Bonta said they plan to file a lawsuit on the grounds that Congress’ use of the Congressional Review Act to rescind the waivers is illegal. The law allows Congress to overturn actions of federal agencies, under specific circumstances, without a supermajority vote. California secured the waivers last year from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden. 

Bonta: “California has received approximately 100 waivers since waivers have been given and the CRA has never been applied to any of those waivers before. … This is a workaround for Trump to punish California for defying his efforts to bring us backward.”

While Bonta emphasized that Trump’s actions aimed to obstruct California’s authority to enforce its own state laws, Newsom focused on how revoking the waivers threatened California’s public health and the country’s electric vehicle industry. Saying that the administration was “doubling down on stupid,” the governor argued that this would further enable China’s dominance over the electric vehicle market.

Newsom: “Big day for Big Oil. … Big day for China. Terrible day for your kids, terrible day for air quality, terrible day for innovation and entrepreneurship.” 

As the state readies itself for its 23rd lawsuit against Trump since his second term, more California laws may be under threat from the administration and GOP members in Congress, including dozens of existing and proposed laws regulating artificial intelligence and laws that benefit immigrants lacking permanent legal status.

LA fights LAPD over false complaint warning

Can a 36-word warning about making a false complaint against a police officer be a violation of free speech? The city of Los Angeles argues that it does, as its case against the union representing Los Angeles Police Department officers lands before the state’s Supreme Court.
As CalMatters’ Nigel Duara explains, when filing a complaint against an LAPD officer, complainants are shown this warning on the form, in bold and in all caps:
 “IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO MAKE A COMPLAINT THAT YOU KNOW TO BE FALSE. IF YOU MAKE A COMPLAINT AGAINST AN OFFICER KNOWING THAT IT IS FALSE, YOU CAN BE PROSECUTED ON A MISDEMEANOR CHARGE.”
The city of L.A. wants to strike that language, arguing that the warning discourages people from filing complaints and curbs their rights protected under the First Amendment. But the Los Angeles Police Protective League union says the warning is constitutionally sound, and it’s necessary to prevent false complaints that could disrupt an officer’s career.
The California high court is expected to issue a ruling sometime this year.

Google shrinks pledge to help news organizations

A week after Gov. Newsom revealed his plans to reduce the amount of money the state is expected to provide to help fund local news outlets, Google said it too will cut some of the support it had previously agreed to pay, writes CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang.
The tech giant said it will now pay $10 million in its first year contributing to California’s local news fund, rather than the $15 million it initially pledged less than a year ago. The company agreed to only put money into the fund as a match to state dollars, and it got the green light to do so after Newsom proposed to reduce the state’s first-year contribution from $30 million to $10 million. 
Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has a market cap of more than $2 trillion. Ten million dollars is 0.0005% of $2 trillion. There are three bench players on the Los Angeles Lakers who earned more than $10 million last season. 
Together, California and Google have shrunk their commitment to assist the state’s struggling news industry from $45 million to $20 million. So far, no newsroom has received money from the fund.
The money is part of a compromise lawmakers made with Google last year: In exchange for the Legislature pulling bills that would have forced tech companies to pay outlets for their content, Google and the state would put millions of dollars into a fund over five years to support California journalism.

Some campuses are stepping up with innovative free meal programs.,"In summary
A majority of California’s college students experience food insecurity. Some campuses are stepping up with innovative free meal programs.


Since 2022, California has been offering free lunches to all students in elementary through high school. But once they reach college, more than two-thirds of students experience food insecurity.
The federally funded CalFresh program feeds some college students, but the complicated application process and eligibility rules prevent many from accessing funds. More than 70% of eligible students don’t receive CalFresh, according to a 2024 California Policy Lab report.
To improve CalFresh outreach and enrollment, California started setting aside annual funds in 2021 for public colleges and universities to establish and operate basic needs centers with food pantries, where students obtain free food staples. The California State University and University of California systems each receive $15 million and California Community Colleges receives $30 million annually. As of 2023, every public higher education campus in the state has a basic needs center and food pantry.
However, for many campuses, these solutions still aren’t enough. To fill the gaps, some have created their own innovative solutions. From free meals to food lockers, staff and students at five campuses around California offer creative alternatives.
Humboldt students level up their food pantry
At Cal Poly Humboldt, through the full-service food program “Oh SNAP!,”  students stock the shelves, fill pantry orders and offer CalFresh application support. They also greet their peers as they enter, offering them tea or coffee.
To reduce food waste, students negotiated in 2016 with the campus dining services department to collect unused food to offer at the pantry at no cost to students. The department notifies the basic needs center when leftovers are available; students bring their own containers to package up what they need.
Oh SNAP! has hired a local organic farmer to provide produce and give classes on cooking and gardening. The program also offers pop-up thrift stores where students can fill a bag with clothes and housewares for $5; proceeds go back into the program.
Oh SNAP! “provides peace of mind,” said Anna Martinez, a student studying political science, law and policy at Cal Poly Humboldt. “I don’t have to really worry too heavy on whether or not I can afford food, because if I can’t, there’s always Oh SNAP! I can go to.” 
As the social justice, equity and inclusion officer for Cal Poly’s student government, Martinez successfully advocated for the student board to increase funding for cultural foods. She values the sense of community Oh SNAP! provides.
“They’re very welcoming when it comes to different needs,” she said.
The program, vital for the 6,000 students at Cal Poly Humboldt, clocked 30,000 visits to Oh SNAP! last year, according to Mira Friedman, health education and clinic support services lead.
Compton College serves free meals to all
Sara Goldrick-Rab, a Philadelphia sociologist and advocate for college student basic needs,  thinks a free meal every day is “exactly what is needed” on college campuses. She conducted a study giving students free, daily meals for three semesters at Bunker Hill Community College in Boston.
“It allowed students to eat in a regular way in the school cafeteria, just like they would in the National School Lunch Program. And lo-and-behold, it increased graduation rates,”  Goldrick-Rab said.
Compton College President Keith Curry read about the Bunker Hill pilot program and decided to implement a similar program at Compton. Now, every Compton student  — and employee  — receives a daily meal. Students also get $20 each week to spend at the campus farmer’s market. Students enrolled in CalFresh receive $50 each week for the farmer’s market and can use their EBT card at campus dining services. The college uses a mix of grants and various campus funds to cover the costs of the meal program.
“We’re doing more than any other community college in the state of California and also nationally,” Curry said. “How many schools can say that students receive one meal per day on their campus from their cafeteria?”

Some California colleges offer a limited number of free meals, such as UC Davis, where a food truck serves between 300 and 400 meals per day and students pay what they want. In fall 2025, West Valley-Mission District in Santa Clara County will begin offering free meals. 
Student Corinthia Mims said the first time she entered Compton’s cafeteria, “it was joy, always buzzing,” she said. Her twin, Cynthia Mims, said the free meals bring everyone together like family. 
“[Students] feel embraced and they feel important. It’s a feast,” she said.
Feeding students keeps them in school. According to data the college gathered last year, students who received free meals and money for the farmers’ market were more likely to stay in their classes for the entire semester with a completion rate of 1% or 2% higher than the general population.
Curry visits the cafeteria to get feedback from the students. “They’re proud to tell me what they like and what they got today. Because there’s no negative stigma around it, because everyone is treated equally,” he said.
Goldrick-Rab highlights the program at Compton College as an example of what a college student universal meal plan could look like. “It’s a very nice modern version. … It’s not really a cafeteria in the classic sense. It is refrigerators full of prepared meals, the way that adults would go into a Whole Foods and get a grab-and-go,” she said. 
In 2019, U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from California, introduced the Food for Thought bill, which proposes universal meal pilot programs on college campuses. The bill failed and was reintroduced in 2022 and 2023 but never enacted.
Contra Costa College fills food lockers with free meals 
At Contra Costa College, students who work full time have difficulty accessing the food pantry during open hours. In April, the college unveiled 20 refrigerated lockers in the campus cafeteria where students can pick up their pre-ordered, free groceries between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. Students order online and student staff fill the orders.
The campus basic needs center, called the Compass Center, also offers free meal vouchers to students three days a week, giving out 50 for breakfast, 75 for lunch and 15 for dinner. 
Teddy Thollaug, a first-year student studying art and journalism at Contra Costa College, says they appreciate the hot meals and food lockers, especially on days when their disability makes it too hard to stand and cook. Because Thollaug’s classes are all online, they are not on campus regularly.

A typical order includes fresh fruit and vegetables, butter and cheese, and a “mystery package,” which contains grains, sauces and canned food. “Honestly, I feel like a kid on Christmas every time I open a mystery package,” Thollaug said.
In 2024, the center served 5,008 students and 14,785 families of students, according to Hope Dixon, the basic needs center coordinator.
Antelope Valley College students earn points for food
To encourage and support students to take full course loads, Antelope Valley College initiated Fresh Success, a CalFresh program that “pays” enrolled students in points for enrolled units. 
Full-time students get more points, “because that’s our goal. We want you to get your degree, and [if you’re a full-time student,] you’re less likely to be able to run around and get all the other community resources,” said Jill Zimmerman, dean of the Antelope Valley College student health and wellness center. 
Fresh Success is part of CalFresh’s Employment and Training program, and is overseen by the Foundation for California Community Colleges. Currently 20 colleges across 18 counties participate in the program, which partially reimburses schools with federal dollars for workforce development services such as job training and job search assistance for low-income students.
Fresh Success allocates points for each unit enrolled, up to 40 points per week. Students use their points at the on-campus pantry to purchase food, toiletries and laundry soap.
For Alliza Wade, having access to Fresh Success means being able to put more time toward school rather than working more hours. Wade, a STEM major at Antelope Valley College, is enrolled in CalFresh but it doesn’t cover all of her food expenses. 
“[Fresh Success] has a very, very significant impact on how I’m able to live and eat, and how I’m going to be able to pursue my future, because [it helps with] saving and being able to eat healthy,” Wade said.
Since the college is reimbursed 45 cents for every dollar spent, the Fresh Success program benefits the college as well by providing funds to put towards employment and training support like job-specific clothing and gear, cooking classes and car tune-ups through the campus automotive program. 
Cerro Coso feeds students who aren’t eligible for CalFresh
When Lorena Moreno started as the basic needs coordinator in early 2024 at Cerro Coso Community College in the southeastern Sierra region of the state, she noticed that students without permanent legal status were in dire need of assistance. Non-citizens are not eligible for CalFresh. 
Moreno tackled the need by creating an on-campus food program called WileyFresh — modeled on Aggie Fresh at UC Davis, which serves students who meet CalFresh requirements but lack citizenship. Eligible students receive a monthly Albertson’s gift card valued at $291, comparable to the amount an eligible single student receives on a monthly CalFresh EBT card.
Like the Aggie Fresh program, students who qualify for WileyFresh are required to participate in workshops that support academic and personal growth. Moreno offers the workshops as a webinar to protect student identities.

Last fall, Moreno increased outreach efforts. Her team of part-time student employees passed out flyers at events to raise awareness. They saw visits to the Wiley Food Pantry grow from about 350 per month in the spring semester to about 500 per week in the fall. 
This summer, Moreno intends to expand the program to include more students who can’t enroll in CalFresh. “Because at the end of the day, that’s what it’s intended for — this population who is missing out.”
Research shows students can’t rely on each other’s charity
Many colleges now offer a way for students to donate unused card swipes from their campus meal plans to each other. However, research shows that these donations only reach a tiny fraction of students.
Before 2017, college dining services did not allow students to share their meal plans with other students. This didn’t sit well with students at Morehouse and Spelman colleges in Atlanta. They began a hunger strike to challenge meal plan policies that forbid sharing meal swipes. Their activism convinced their colleges to change the policies and led to a nationwide program, Swipe Out Hunger. 
Meal-swipe programs, as they’re called at the approximately 850 colleges nationwide that offer them, allow students to donate unused meal swipes to fellow students who need them. In California, 17 colleges participate in Swipe Out Hunger. 
But they are not effective, Goldrick-Rab said. She evaluated Swipe Out Hunger and found that the active programs see just 300 swipes a year.
“At the bottom line, I would rather give people money than food, but I still think the National School Lunch Program is important. I just want all of it. I want the guaranteed basic income. I want a higher minimum wage. Because all of it is scientifically working,” Goldrick-Rab said.

“Until there is more data to demonstrate that this concept will increase access to food for our most vulnerable neighbors, we are concerned that this approach could disrupt an established, high-performing food rescue system,” Beth Martino, the CEO of Three Square wrote in a March 27 letter opposing the proposal. 
Assembly Bill 476, which is scheduled to be heard by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee Saturday morning, would require the Division of Welfare and Supportive Services to create a “Smart Surplus Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.” 
The program would seek to reduce food waste via technology by directing SNAP recipients to areas with a surplus of food where they can also get discounted rates. 
The legislation would allocate $5 million to administer the program. 
Between potential for major federal cuts and the state’s shaky economic outlook, the fate of many bills that require new or additional spending remains uncertain.
A Connecticut company founded by Priceline, r4 Technologies, has been used to develop the program elsewhere. 
The legislation “proposes allocation for the development of AI to help grocers better assess needs,” said Jason Frierson, a former Speaker of the Nevada State Assembly and Nevada U.S. Attorney who is now a lobbyist with Cornerstone Government Affairs, which represents r4 Technologies. 
“It allows the grocers to sell more food and helps to decrease waste so there is less food going to places that aren’t being purchased. It also helps SNAP recipients get a better bang for their buck,” Frierson said. 
The company’s program was launched for the first time last year in Delaware, funded by $1.5 million from the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.
Three Square Food Bank, which provides assistance in Clark, Esmeralda, Lincoln, and Nye counties, as well as the Food Bank of Northern Nevada opposed the legislation.
Shane Piccinini, the government relations director for the Food Bank of Northern Nevada, wrote in his opposition testimony in March that he didn’t understand how the legislation would improve access. 
“Many Nevadans facing food insecurity, particularly seniors, struggle to reach grocery stores—even when food is offered at discounted prices,” he wrote. “Our research shows that transportation is a major obstacle to accessing food, which is why many of our neighbors rely on local food pantries or direct delivery services provided by nonprofit organizations like the Food Bank of Northern Nevada.”
AB 476 was first heard by the Assembly Health and Human Services Committee in March and hasn’t received a vote yet. It is exempt from all deadlines. 
Since that March hearing, U.S. House Republicans passed a massive budget reconciliation bill that is now headed for the U.S. Senate — Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” — that slashes Medicaid, food assistance and other programs.
Also since the bill’s hearing in March, the body charged with making state revenue estimates that legislative budgeting can’t exceed revised those estimates downward, citing projected negative impacts on Nevada’s economy largely as a result of Trump’s trade war. 
Democratic Assemblymember Tracy Brown May in the March hearing raised concern that deep cuts to federal assistance programs – only proposed at the time – would limit the availability of the service described in the bill. 
The legislation is sponsored by the Assembly Ways and Means Committee. Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, who chairs the committee, said those currently eligible for SNAP benefits would be eligible to use the r4 Technologies application, but acknowledged that could change with shifts in federal policy.
“I wish I had a crystal ball and could say that any changes would not impact this program,” said Monroe-Moreno, who also chairs the Nevada State Democratic Party. “I can’t sit here and say that at this moment.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/formula-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 09:04:01.300257

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Misconduct complaints against educators in Utah public schools have been on the rise during the first months of 2025, representatives of the Utah State Board of Education told legislators on Wednesday. But, requests for funding to hire more attorneys to review the cases have failed since 2023.  
The Utah Professional Practices Advisory Commission (UPPAC), a panel that reviews and investigates complaints on educators to determine whether they get to keep their licenses, usually takes about 11 months until making a final decision.
There are various reasons why a case may take a long time, Ben Rasmussen, executive secretary of UPPAC told the Education Interim Committee — it may be the time it takes to investigate it or reach an agreement with the educator’s attorneys. The commission’s staff capacity can also delay the process, and sometimes, whenever there are criminal charges involved, the panel waits for courts’ decisions before taking disciplinary action.

Since Rasmussen started his role in 2015, the number of cases his office investigates has almost tripled, going from 63 to 173 in 2024. This year alone, the panel has already received 93 complaints.
“Leading up to the last couple of years, it was typical that UPPAC would review maybe 10 to 15 cases on a monthly basis,” Rasmussen said. “Given changes in board rules that have increased requirements for (schools’) reports and given increases in hotline complaints, you can see that it’s not uncommon for us to be reviewing closer to 50 cases a month now.”
During the discussion of the delays, committee chair Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, said she was already planning to submit a funding request to help clear out the backlog. 
Since 2015, the most frequent cases centered around “boundary violations,” accounting for 222 allegations. That’s followed by “violence and discipline” with 150 cases, and “miscellaneous ethical violations” with 118.
“The trend that I’ve seen increasing the most is getting cases in the ‘violence and discipline category,’ which is teachers that are generally getting hands on, to some extent, in their discipline of students or losing temper with students,” Rasmussen said. 
There were also 75 alleged sexual misconduct cases, 48 pornography allegations and 29 investigations of sexual harassment since 2015. Those were the ones that prompted lawmakers to study how schools address issues of child abuse and misconduct during this year’s interim. 



Let us know what you think...


 


According to the description in the committee’s study list, legislators intend to review local and state discipline procedures, the process for background checks, and seek solutions to the cases backlog accumulated at UPPAC. 
Additionally, now that HB497, a bill the Legislature passed this year, is effective, the state requires the commission to create a system to address complaints “in a timely and expedient manner.”
That includes changing the way the commission prioritizes cases to ensure the safety of students. However, for the most serious violations, schools usually terminate educators before the case is referred to UPPAC.
“Most cases where it’s like a sexual misconduct case or a serious student danger issue, these are cases where the (school) has removed the teacher from the classroom, and so that’s usually not a priority,” Rasmussen said. “But if that kind of case were still in the classroom, we would certainly prioritize that.”
At the same time, while acknowledging the importance of kids’ safety, lawmakers who are also educators questioned whether the process did enough to protect teachers who are later found innocent. 
“Something that somebody has brought up to me more than one time is that they felt like it was very lopsided and that they didn’t really have a voice in the process, and they felt that all of the questioning was very one-sided,” Sen. Kathleen Riebe, D-Cottonwood Heights, said. 
Riebe also described the action of flagging licenses for potential misconduct in the state’s credential database while an investigation is underway as “really punitive.”
“It’s kind of shocking that you’d be guilty the minute somebody brought you up on an accusation,” she said.
Pierucci pushed back on that, arguing that whenever there’s a serious allegation, especially of sexual abuse, the teacher should not be in the classroom anymore.
“I want to be really careful saying this isn’t everyone, but there are some people who are dealing and interacting with their children that should not be there,” she said.

Most bills aimed at reforming the criminal justice system failed in the session, though advocates were encouraged by the progress of some proposals. (File/Getty)It was the same story for criminal justice reform in the Alabama Legislature this year as in previous years: bills got filed, but most never made it to Gov. Kay Ivey’s desk.
Legislators did enact laws making incremental changes, such as a bill to make it easier for people who were formerly incarcerated to obtain occupational licenses and create more opportunities for diversion programs were approved.
And advocates said they were encouraged that legislation they continue to support moved further along in the process than in the past.

“Giving a grade on criminal justice reform in Alabama is always a challenge because the steps that are taken forward are, oftentimes, minimal, although they are impactful to certain segments of the population,” said Jerome Dees, policy director for the Southern Poverty Law Center. “However, what we as a collective community need to do is change the narrative around what actually is public safety and what drives making neighborhoods and communities safe.”
Bills to reform the parole and bail system in the state; allowing reconsideration of sentences for nonviolent offenses imposed before reforms of the Habitual Felony Offender Act, and delaying sentencing for those who are pregnant failed within their committees or stalled and were not considered by either the full House or Senate.
“There wasn’t any legislation passed for criminal justice reform, but there were still some very meaningful conversations about it that did move the needle forward, including a very frank discussion about the parole board to make sure there is oversight and attention to that fact that the parole board is not in compliance with the law,” said Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa.
The Republican-dominated Legislature instead approved measures that increased existing penalties or provided an advantage to law enforcement in some way, including a bill enhancing immunity protections for law enforcement.
Reforming parole and bail was a focus of advocates, particularly as Republican legislators had shown growing impatience with the Alabama Board of Pardons and Parole missing deadlines to implement parole guidelines.
“I think one of the many things that we hoped to see coming out of the 2025 legislative session was legislation that created more accountability and transparency around the parole process,” Dees said. “There were a number of bills that were filed to specifically address that.”
HB 40, sponsored England, would have created a commission to create updated parole guidelines and require the board to stick with them. Under the bill, if the board deviated from the guidelines, it would have to publicly state why.
Parole applicants would also have been able to appeal denials to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals.
Another bill, SB 324, sponsored by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, would have increased the number of members who serve on the Parole Board from three to five and require the Senate to confirm the appointments. It would also have changed the timeline that an applicant who has been denied can reapply for parole.
The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 16-8 in April and the House Judiciary Committee approved the bill soon afterward by the narrowest of margins. The bill did not come out for a House vote.
Chambliss later amended the state’s 2026 General Fund budget, which goes into effect on Oct. 1, to withhold the Board of Pardons and Parole’s funding until they develop parole guidelines.
Lawmakers have scrutinized Alabama’s parole system since 2019 when the state’s parole system decreased dramatically. The figure has increased to about 25% recently but remains below the original rate.
Legislators also turned away proposals to allow Alabama judges to issue a percentage bond to those in pretrial detention.
HB 42, also sponsored by England, would have left much of the Alabama Bail Reform Act of 1993 in place except to add three words, “a part of” to current statutes to give judges the authority to allow defendants to pay a portion of the total bond amount they owe so that they can be released from jail as their cases proceed through the court system.
The bail bond industry strongly opposed the legislation during two public hearings at both the House and Senate Judiciary committees.
The bill passed the House in April. But the Senate Judiciary Committee deadlocked on approval of the measure along party lines.
The Alabama Legislature also allowed another bill, SB 156, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, to fail.
The bill allows some of those incarcerated in Alabama’s prisons to have their sentences reconsidered by a judge if their crimes did not involve physical injury to others.
The bill would have allowed people who were convicted and received lengthy sentences before the state made substantial changes to the Habitual Offender Law  in 2000 to give judges more discretion regarding sentencing. Defendants who were convicted of homicides, sexually based offenses and violent offenses were not eligible for reconsideration.
The bill required two rounds of voting in the Senate chamber after members of the Senate Judiciary approved it in February.
In March, Senate Republicans rejected the legislation with a tie vote 16-16. Hours later, senators approved a motion to reconsider the legislation, and after discussing the bill, passed it by a vote of 17-8.
The House Judiciary Committee then approved the legislation in April, but it never came to a vote in the House.
“We were of course disappointed to see the Second Chance bill fail to pass the House, especially in light of the broad, bipartisan support it had this time around,” said Elaine Burdeshaw in a statement, policy director for Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice, a criminal justice reform organization. “Despite the bill’s failure, we saw legislators across the aisle, all the way up to Gov. Ivey, understand this issue and why it matters– why it really is smart on crime policy.”

HB 244 got approval from the House on April 18 and from the Senate Education Policy Committee on May 1. Sen. Donnie Chesteen, R-Geneva, chair of that committee, told Butler after the bill was approved that it is unlikely the Senate will pass it because of the timing and said it needed to be in his committee earlier in the year to have a chance of passage; at the time, there were four days left in the session.
A Democratic filibuster launched in protest of the House’s handling of local bills on the last day of the session doomed Butler’s bill and many others.

Butler said he was offended by Chesteen’s comment that he should have filed the bill sooner but said both men remedied that after the committee meeting. A message seeking comment from Chesteen was left Thursday afternoon.
Butler filed the bill in February, but it did not go before the House Education Policy Committee until April 3, when the committee held a public hearing. The committee did not approve it until the following week. Butler said he asked Rep. Terri Collins, R-Decatur, chair of the committee, for it to be put on the agenda many times earlier in the session.
“I repeatedly asked for it, and I was assured it was coming, it was coming, it was coming,” he said. “The chair had other things she said she was dealing with, and I think they waited to deal with several controversial bills at one time.”
A message seeking comment from Collins was left Thursday afternoon.
Butler said next year he plans to have a companion bill in the Senate to improve the bill’s chances of passage, “so we can move on both at the same time, and whoever gets there first wins,” he said. 
Butler said Sen. Keith Kelley, R-Anniston, was handling the bill in the Senate and plans to ask him to sponsor the Senate version next year. Kelley said in an interview that he and Butler will be meeting soon about companion bills for next session soon. 
“There may be some changes to it, a little bit here, a little bit there,” Kelley said. “We’re planning on bringing that back next year.”
The law currently prohibits such discussions in K-5. Butler’s bill would expand it to pre-K-12, which he said would bring it inline with an executive order issued by President Donald Trump in January.
Critics of the bill said at the April 3 public hearing that the legislation is unconstitutional and unnecessary.
A spokesperson for the Southern Poverty Law Center, a consistent critic of the legislation, said in an interview Thursday she was relieved that the bill did not pass but she still had concerns for the legislation next year.
“I’m hoping that it stays dead, and I’m hoping that we don’t see a new extension, a revival of it,” Makhayla DesRosiers, state community organizer for the Alabama SPLC office, said.
Many members of the LGBTQ+ community spoke against the bill throughout the legislative process, all with similar concerns: what defines instructional time. DesRosiers said the lack of a definition opens the door for a complete prohibition of discussion.
“If I do extracurricular activities, is it also instructional time? If I’m learning something outside of my regular school hours, is that instructional time?” she asked. “Who gets to define instructional time?”
Butler has repeatedly said discussions of gender identity and sexuality are only prohibited when a teacher is teaching, but that is not explicit in the legislation.
“People keep saying the student can’t do this or that. No, they carry their First Amendment rights with them into the school, and they absolutely can talk to the teacher, the principal, the nurse, the counselor, about whatever they want to talk about,” he said.
Butler said the bill next year would be the original bill that was filed in February. A House amendment this spring removed a part of the bill that would have prohibited teachers from referring to students by their preferred gender if it conflicts with their assigned sex at birth. He said that is because another bill would have done the same thing.
HB 246, sponsored by Rep. Scott Stadthagen, R-Hartselle, would give public educators legal immunity and students immunity from discipline for using a person’s legal name and pronouns aligned with their reproductive organs, instead of the name and gender with which they identify. It did not receive final passage either.
DesRosier said that while the people speaking out against the legislation may be small in number, legislation like this is not reflective of the state.
“Just because there is a majority of folks that are proposing and voting on these bills at the State House, that is not reflective of the communities they are elected to represent,” DesRosier said. “As long as bigotry and hate and human rights violations are proposed and passed, there are always going to be folks that are resisting that.”

It’s mostly hidden by trees and bushes, except for a narrow opening with an aging chain-link fence and a “no trespassing” sign. Even from the air, the green synthetic liner that covers 65 years’ worth of coal combustion residuals looks like an extension of the Twin Bridges Golf Club that borders the pond to the west.
“There are people that boat by this all the time and have no idea what it is,” Coosa Riverkeeper Justinn Overton said as the boat idled in the channel. “Because it just looks like it’s an extension off the golf course, or nothing to be concerned about. It doesn’t look like it’s the leftover waste from the coal-fired power plant.”

Alabama Power’s Gadsden Steam Plant was demolished last year after 109 years on the river, but the unlined coal ash pond remains, and, according to the Coosa Riverkeeper, continues to leech potentially harmful substances like arsenic, boron, chromium and cobalt into the groundwater.
Now, Coosa Riverkeeper has filed a formal notice of intent to sue Alabama Power over the groundwater pollution from the old pond, based on groundwater testing results that Alabama Power is required to post twice per year.
The Riverkeeper, represented by the Southern Environmental Law Center, says it will file a lawsuit under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule, which regulates coal ash disposal. Such lawsuits require a formal notice at least 60 days before filing.
“Alabama Power has zero excuses for leaving its leaking waste dump in the middle of the commercial riverfront area of Gadsden and exposing the community to this hazard,” Barry Brock, director of SELC’s Alabama office, said in a news release announcing the move. “Other utilities across the South are cleaning up unlined coal ash dumps and moving waste to safer storage away from our waterways. Alabama Power must do the same in Gadsden.”
Alabama Power did not immediately respond to multiple requests for comment by phone and email.
A test case for cover in place?

At 77 acres and 1.2 million cubic yards of coal ash, the Gadsden ash pond is much smaller than some of the other massive coal ash lagoons in Alabama. The one at Plant Barry, in Mobile County, is nearly 600 acres.
But Gadsden’s was the first coal ash pond in Alabama to fully close after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency implemented federal coal ash disposal rules in 2015. In fact, plans for the closure were already underway before the final rule was issued.
Coal ash, or CCR, is an umbrella term that refers to several waste materials generated by the process of burning coal for electricity production. These waste materials can include fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag and flue gas desulfurization sludge.
Often, energy utilities combine these waste materials with water and store them in ponds at or near electrical generating plants, a practice environmental groups have criticized because they risk contaminating groundwater. Currently, Alabama has nine coal ash disposal sites across the state, most of which are located near waterways.
The Gadsden ash pond was covered in 2018, but still appears to be releasing significant levels of toxins into groundwater. The Riverkeeper says that the October 2024 sampling results show arsenic at 40 times the legal standard for groundwater.
The Gadsden ash pond is also close to the city’s riverfront area, including numerous boat launches and areas where people can fish from the banks. There’s also a drinking water intake just 0.6 miles downstream from the ash pond.
Overton said it’s concerning that the pond is still contaminating groundwater at high levels years after closure.
“We’ve been asking for the same thing, over and over again, which is [for Alabama Power to] move your ash to an upland lined landfill,” Overton said. “Unfortunately, it takes litigation at times to force movement.”
For all of its coal ash lagoons, Alabama Power elected to “dewater” and cover the ponds where they are rather than excavate the ash and move it to a lined landfill. In that process, the remaining ash slurry was dewatered and compacted into a smaller footprint. A low-permeability liner was then installed on top of the slurry to keep rainwater from entering the disposal area and carrying contaminants into the environment.
Environmental advocates and concerned citizens have urged the company for a decade now to move the coal ash to lined landfills away from the rivers to prevent groundwater contamination. They are also concerned about the potential for a catastrophic incident like the one at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Kingston, Tennessee, plant in 2007, when a dam breach sent 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash slurry into a holding pond and then the Emory River.
In 2014, a steel sewer line under a North Carolina coal ash pond collapsed, allowing the waste material to flow into the pipe and, eventually, into the nearby Dan River, polluting the water and putting dozens of marine species in harm’s way. The disaster was among more than 160 cases of water contamination at coal ash sites that spurred adoption of the Coal Ash Rule in 2015.
The 2015 EPA coal ash rules allowed for cover in place, as long as certain conditions were met. The Alabama Department of Environmental Management signed off on the company’s cover in place plans, approving closure permits for all ash ponds in the state.
However, last year, the EPA rejected Alabama’s coal ash permitting program, saying it was “significantly less protective of people and waterways than federal law requires.”
“Under federal regulations, coal ash units cannot be closed in a way that allows coal ash to continue to spread contamination in groundwater after closure,” the EPA said, in denying Alabama’s program. “In contrast, Alabama’s permit program does not require that groundwater contamination be adequately addressed during the closure of these coal ash units.”

A 2019 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and other advocacy groups found that 91 percent of coal-fired plants still had ash landfills or waste ponds that leak highly toxic metals and chemicals such as arsenic, lead, mercury, selenium and cadmium into groundwater at dangerous levels, often threatening streams, rivers and drinking water aquifers.
“Exposure to coal ash can lead to serious health concerns like cancer if the ash isn’t managed appropriately,” then-EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan said of the federal government’s denial of Alabama’s coal ash permitting plan at the time. “Low-income and underserved communities are especially vulnerable to coal ash in waterways, groundwater, drinking water, and in the air. This is why EPA works closely with states to ensure coal ash is disposed of safely, so that water sources remain free of this pollution and communities are protected from contamination.”
An executive of Alabama Power, which owns most of the state’s CCR units, claimed at a September 2023 EPA hearing that the utility’s storage ponds are “structurally sound.” Susan Comensky, Alabama Power’s vice president of environmental affairs, told EPA officials that allowing the company to “cap” CCR waste in place, even in unlined pits, will not present significant risks to human or environmental health.
“Even today, before closure is complete, we know of no impact to any source of drinking water at or around any Alabama Power ash pond,” Comensky said at the time.

However, Alabama Power has been repeatedly fined for leaking coal ash waste into groundwater.
In 2019, ADEM fined the utility $250,000 after groundwater monitoring at a disposal site on the Coosa River in Gadsden showed elevated levels of arsenic and radium, according to regulatory documents.
In 2018, ADEM fined Alabama Power a total of $1.25 million for groundwater contamination, records show. In its order issuing the fine, the agency cited the utility’s own groundwater testing data, which showed elevated levels of arsenic, lead, selenium and beryllium.
The EPA denial notice cited Gadsden, among other coal ash ponds in Alabama, where waste ash material remains in constant contact with groundwater.
Overton said about 40 percent of the ash at Gadsden is saturated by groundwater.
“Alabama Power created this mess,” Overton said. “They shut this facility down and demolished it, but now they want to leave [the ash] here. Alabama Power claims to be a good neighbor, but I was taught that to be a good neighbor, you clean up after yourself.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,The future of New England’s electric grid can be described with one word: uncertainty,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/new-england-electric-grid-future/,"Even if in-the-works transmission projects get built, headwinds from the Trump administration could be strong enough to derail them entirely.","Late last month — with considerable fanfare — nine northeastern states, including Connecticut, announced they were embarking on a groundbreaking interregional electric grid transmission effort.
It came just a few weeks after an announcement by the New England grid operator that it was soliciting proposals for new transmission to bring power — most likely land-based wind — from northern Maine into southern New England.
And that followed an announcement by the Biden administration’s energy department last August that the region would receive $389 million for a project called Power Up New England, which is primarily intended to provide the onshore connections and transmission for offshore wind power.
Here’s the problem, though. Even if all these transmission projects get built, the new power they’re supposed to connect to, such as offshore wind, faces headwinds from the Trump administration that could be strong enough to derail them entirely.
That potential became even more likely early Thursday with passage by the U.S. House of Representatives of a budget that could make any renewable power not already under construction financially implausible.
While concerning, the reality of a transmission and power mismatch is garnering less hand-wringing than you might expect. But one word you do hear over and over and over is uncertainty.
“The future is inherently uncertain,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, DEEP. “And uncertainty as well as rapid changes in development and the developments in the energy world are nothing new. Think about the fracking boom, or the Great Recession, or the COVID pandemic or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. These all upended prior assumptions and created short-term and sometimes long, long-term disruption.”
And then she made another point: “Energy infrastructure takes a really long time to build.”
That last point is also made repeatedly for why this seeming mismatch of problematic additional power and more transmission is less concerning to some.
“The worst time to be building transmission is when you have the generation all constructed, ready to go,” Dykes said.
The overwhelming sentiment – get going on that transmission and other infrastructure.
“Yes, we should move ahead. This is an important step forward. We need more transmission, full stop,” said Kat Burnham, the state lead for Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island for Advanced Energy United, AEU, an advocacy group for all aspects of advanced energy.
Francis Pullaro, president of RENEW Northeast, which works towards renewable energy in New England and New York, said the fact that New England hasn’t built out its electric grid is one of the biggest challenges to developing renewable energy here.
“But this isn’t a chicken and egg problem. The transmission has to be built first. You can’t connect the generator to nothing,” he said.
Even in the most stable of times it is tricky to predict what needs and conditions on the ground might be years in advance. What if that demand growth ends up being higher than expected or lower than expected, and what about different rates of technological development and availability and different cost trajectories? How do you ensure transmission additions or upgrades are flexible to accommodate a range of scenarios or changes?
Circumstances right now are anything but stable.
Trump, wind and powering up
Wind power has long been viewed as key to the region’s power needs and goals. It can provide large amounts of power while also meeting individual state renewable energy goals and helping to forestall the use of more fossil fuel power whose emissions are the primary culprits in climate change.
But President Donald Trump notoriously dislikes wind power. His Day 1 executive order halted all leasing, approvals and permitting for offshore wind, effectively shelving any offshore wind development in the pre-construction pipeline. And then in April the administration ordered construction stopped on the partially-built Empire Wind — destined to provide offshore wind power to New York.
One month later, as project developer Equinor was poised to pull the plug for good, more than three months of lobbying by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul paid off with a reversal of the stop-work order.
But the incident still leaves the remaining handful of offshore wind projects permitted and under construction, including Connecticut and Rhode Island’s Revolution Wind, fearing for their own survival.
The Interior Department, which houses the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, has been reviewing existing projects as part of the original executive order and in late April the wind opposition group Green Oceans released a report prepared for them by Planet A* Strategies that alleges fraud, among other problems, with the projects. Green Oceans subsequently used those findings as the basis for its request that the Environmental Protection Agency rescind permits for Revolution and Sunrise Wind, another New York project also under construction.


BOEM did not respond to questions about the status of the Revolution and Sunrise projects.
A spokesperson for Orsted, the Danish company developing Revolution Wind, said in an email that the project is about 75% done, remains on track for completion next year and that they “have an ongoing and constructive dialogue with our regulators.” But Orsted did not respond to whether the project was under review by BOEM and if so, what information was in question.
Orsted also did not respond directly to questions about the Green Oceans report and permit revocation requests. The company provided a statement that reads in part: “Revolution Wind received its federal construction approvals following years of reviews and scientific studies as well as public comment and other stakeholder engagement.” 
Maine’s first-in-the-nation floating offshore wind research installation is also among projects on hold after the Trump administration halted a $12.6 million grant while it reviewed the project. The move comes as Trump is in an open political feud with that state’s governor, Janet Mills, over transgender students and sports. It has spilled over into attempted financial retribution against the state in unrelated areas.
The state’s land-based wind potential may get caught in the crossfire. Trump’s order also targeted land-based wind projects for review. While mainly aimed at projects on federal land, it left the door open to going after other projects.
In early May, Connecticut, along with Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maine and New York were among 18 states filing a lawsuit that argues the original wind executive order violates federal law.
But now any new renewable power could face stiff restrictions to qualify for the federal tax credits that for years have helped make them affordable. Under the House budget approved this week, a project needs to begin construction within 60 days of the bill’s passage to get the credits — an impossibility for any new wind project. It must also be operational by the end of 2028.
If the Senate does not force changes, Burnham said it “would make it effectively impossible for any onshore or offshore project not already under construction to qualify for these long-standing, bipartisan tax credits.”
That could mean serious trouble for a Massachusetts and Rhode Island project called SouthCoast Wind, which doesn’t have contracts in place yet. The Massachusetts Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs declined to comment on the project’s future. SouthCoast did not respond to an email.
Now even Power Up New England, the transmission/interconnection component for future offshore wind may be in trouble. In March that project appeared as the biggest single item on a “hit list” seen by some news publications of proposed project cuts to the Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office.
On May 15, Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the department was requesting additional information from 179 Biden administration awards it had been reviewing. It’s not clear which awards were targeted.
The Department of Energy did not respond to specific questions to clarify the status of Power Up New England. It provided an email statement that said in part: “The Department is conducting a department-wide review to ensure all activities follow the law, comply with applicable court orders and align with the Trump administration’s priorities.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Environmental Affairs in Massachusetts, the lead state on Power Up, declined to comment on the recent development specifically, referring to an earlier emailed statement.  
“The federal grant for Power Up New England has been conditionally awarded to the New England states, obligating the $389 million. We secured these funds through an agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). We will continue to coordinate with our fellow New England states as we work through the final phases of the award with DOE.”
The spokesperson declined to elaborate further on the project status — specifically what “conditionally awarded” means, but there is no evidence that any money has been accessed by the participating parties. Those parties include two utilities that are slated to build interconnection points, substations and battery storage to distribute power – especially new power anticipated from offshore wind projects.
One project, known as the Huntsbrook Offshore Wind Hub is to be built by Eversource in Montville, Connecticut. The other by National Grid is slated for Brayton Point in Somerset, Massachusetts.
Assuming Power Up moves ahead as a transmission project, it is designed to be flexible enough to enhance power distribution even if the offshore wind it was conceived for does not exist.
Predicting future power needs
What may complicate this uncertain dynamic even further is that, after years of flat energy usage on the New England grid, demand is poised to increase. The latest long-term forecast released on May 1 by grid operator ISO-New England projects regional energy demand will increase 11% in the next decade.

Up until now, demand had been held in check through energy efficiency measures and by residential rooftop solar that has been shown to take the edge off power demand during certain times of day — even through the winter when demands on gas for both heat and power generation can strain supplies. The ISO also predicts that the longstanding summertime peak demand season, due to air conditioning use, will switch to equal peak demands between summer and winter as more electric-powered heat pumps supplant gas and oil heating systems.
While New England has also seen robust adoption of electric vehicles, it has not experienced the massive surge in power needs other parts of the country are seeing from the growth of data and AI centers.
The prediction mirrors changes the Energy Information Administration is anticipating nationally over the next couple of years — with the bulk of the increased demand coming in the commercial and industrial sectors.
But predicting future EV and heat pump adoption, the cost of components from solar panels to steel and what generation will be available is difficult, said Matt Kakley, spokesman for the ISO.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty involved in pretty much everything,” he said pointing to the balance of three key factors — growth on the demand side, additions of generation and retirements of older power plants. “I think if those three work in lockstep, things are fine. If they get out of whack and the demand increases, but the generation doesn’t show up, or the retirements go quicker than you would like, then that’s where you start to run into problems. So what makes it difficult is that there is uncertainty on all three fronts.”
In other words – navigating what could shape up to be a mismatch between transmission and power. 
“The bigger fundamental challenge for Connecticut and New England at large is offshore wind, where the states have made really big bets on offshore wind as the scalable large capacity factor, clean energy source that is more directly interconnected into New England than just about any other similar technology,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association. “With that being so pulled back and at best, a long pause being put on that industry, we are now having to do a fundamental reassessment on where else is large scale electricity supply growth going to come from.
“We are in massively uncharted territory with respect to energy policy.”
North to south transmission
The broad plan to provide New England with more wind power from its windiest on-shore area of sparsely-populated northern Maine has run into difficulty in the past because there’s no transmission to get it to southern New England where it’s most needed.
The formal step toward finally doing that came in April when the ISO issued its request for transmission proposals. Those proposals are due in September, with project selections a year after that.
“There is no doubt in my mind that we need greater connections between northern New England and southern New England, and that has been well known for years,” said Melissa Birchard with the Georgetown Climate Center. She also served in the Grid Deployment Office during the Biden administration and is a former New England climate activist. “The ISO-New England’s own studies show that there needs to be much greater connection, and this is just one of them. So is that a smart plan to move forward with? Absolutely.”
Whatever projects are chosen might also be useful to transmit grid-scale solar, or power from Canada, where plans to expand hydropower from Newfoundland and Labrador are in the works. Whether the current political situation between the U.S. and Canada might jeopardize the potential for the use of that power in the Northeast is anyone’s guess, as is whether the Trump anti-wind mindset will stall or derail northern Maine wind projects.
The FERC, tariffs and other factors
Many kinds of major grid activity such as transmission, especially something brand new like the interregional strategic action plan unveiled in April, face approval processes from what will likely be a Trump-majority regulatory body — the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC. It has five members with fixed terms. It allows no more than three members from one party and had been 3-2 Democrat when Trump came into office in January. But one of the Democrats resigned recently, with more than a year left in his term. That leaves the commission potentially deadlocked until another commissioner is appointed — more than likely a Republican.

The ISO’s Kakley said not all these projects will need to travel back through FERC for approval. “I wouldn’t say we’re concerned about it,” he said.
The next big thing is ISO’s revamp of what’s known as the capacity market. The plan is to switch from a so-called dynamic model, in which the ISO has to predict three years in advance what generation will be available for the grid, to a “prompt market” system that allows the ISO to wait until power is built and ready to go before incorporating it into grid planning.
“It won’t go [to FERC] till probably the end of the year …  in the fall or early winter,” Kakley said.
For the interregional effort – any FERC signoffs are likely much further off.
“These are long-term plans, and we’re not going to build these things overnight,” said RENEW’s Pullaro. “When the current president is long gone is when we’re going to be building these projects. And we really need to think long term.”
Not that he doesn’t have concerns. “It’s a hyper challenging environment right now,” he said. “This president, despite what he says, he only has a four-year term, and there are midterms that are going to happen next year.” 
A lot could happen – or perhaps more to the point, not happen – between now and then to upend the dynamic the way COVID and the Russian invasion of Ukraine did to the energy world not all that long ago.
The Trump administration could slash multiple in-progress projects as they attempted to do with Empire Wind. Their desire to expand fossil fuel use could succeed despite state renewable energy policies such as the kind Connecticut has. Supply chain issues, high prices and fraught international relations resulting from tariffs and other international policies and alliances could have an impact on every aspect of life, not just energy.
Ken Gillingham, an economist at Yale specializing in energy systems and a former senior economist for energy and the environment with the Obama administration White House Council of Economic Advisers, is not convinced rushing ahead with some energy projects is advisable.
“Right now my main thought is that you don’t plan or start anything until the uncertainty is at least somewhat resolved. Especially with tariffs potentially raising costs of a lot of materials, including those used in transmission lines and the fact that at the moment, we are heading towards a recession, which would reduce electricity/energy demand,” Gillingham said. “We are in a chaotic period right now, so it seems to me that the prudent course of action is to sit tight and wait. That seems to be what most firms are doing. It would mean slow walking or not moving forward with “Powering Up New England.”
He said the only reason to move forward right now would be if permitting could be expedited. “But I think the overall business uncertainty is a much stronger force influencing decisions,” he said.
The interregional plan also concerns Gillingham because it was researched and pulled together under more favorable pre-Trump economic and regulatory conditions.
“I wonder how they are thinking about all of this planning now that so many of the assumptions their analysis was built upon are thrown out the window,” he said in an email.
Should states step up?
AEU’s Burnham agreed there’s a lot of uncertainty now at the federal level, with tariffs and with changes in FERC leadership. 
“This is not our first time facing uncertainty, but the pressure is absolutely there,” she said. “That’s why I think we are looking to state collaboration and regional coordination, because we are not getting the regulatory certainty or the market certainty that we rely on from the federal level.”
The mantra that states need to step up has become widespread among advocates, but the unanswered question is where will the money come from if federal funds dry up, or worse, if existing funds are rescinded? And how can projects even attract investors in an economic climate that could be headed for recession?
DEEP Commissioner Dykes skirts the question, pointing to the roughly $1 billion in federal infrastructure and IRA funds the agency competed successfully for during the Biden administration. It’s not clear how much of that may be in jeopardy as the Trump administration ends programs and seeks to halt distribution of funds.
“We’re continuing to move forward with the implementation of those funds and to assert our legal rights,” she said.
Georgetown’s Birchard points out that the infrastructure and IRA funds were designed as a jumpstart, not to be permanent. “Those pots of funds were always time limited. They were never perpetual,” she said.
To her, it shows why the nine-state interregional effort is so important, and not unrealistic even in the current environment. 
“It has states working together in ways that they’ve never worked together before. But the reason they’re doing that is not because of the federal government, is because that’s what the moment demands,” Birchard said.
She said multi-state coordination and planning is needed to get offshore wind built off the northeast coast. It’s needed to have an electric system that is more resilient to extreme weather. And she said it’s needed to attain what she sees as four key goals: keep the lights on and people safe; bring costs down; ensure the transition to clean energy continues; and keep the country open for business.
“What the federal government does may change on a day-to-day, year-to-year, administration-to-administration basis, but those four things aren’t changing. They’re not changing right now, and they’re not going to change next year,” Birchard said. “But we are dealing with a situation where there is a great deal of uncertainty at the federal level, and so I think the easiest way to deal with uncertainty is to create certainty, and the states are taking that opportunity.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP21323785755341-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 08:07:05.321607

Dozens of demonstrators rallied with signs in hand at the doors of the Kent County Courthouse to share their frustration and anger against the decision by Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker not to seek a second trial against former Grand Rapids Police officer Christopher Schurr.
Schurr was charged with second-degree murder and later fired from the police force after fatally shooting Lyoya, a Black Congolese refugee, in the back of the head while he was facing the ground following a traffic stop on April 4, 2022. The confrontation escalated into a struggle when Lyoya tried to flee after failing to produce a driver’s license.
During the announcement of his decision, Becker noted his decision was based on the fact that “there was never a majority for a guilty verdict” among the 12 jurors, whom he interviewed after the mistrial was declared May 8.

Thursday’s “emergency rally” was organized by organizations including the Grand Rapids Alliance Against Racist and Political Oppression, demanding a retrial on the Schurr case.
“I’m going to be very clear in saying that if the Grand Rapids City Commission is not willing to listen to us and reform the police, there may be a time for us to escalate. That doesn’t mean being violent, but it does mean maybe we need to disrupt the way that things are done in this city,” said Ivan Diaz, 27, a Michigan State senate candidate.
The rally was just the latest outlet for members of the public to vent their anger. Days after the mistrial, community members gave passionate comments at the Grand Rapids City Commission meeting, demanding justice for Lyoya and accountability over police actions. Additionally, on May 15, the NAACP organized a community listening session where residents expressed their experiences with police abuse and their outrage over the mistrial.
“I am going to keep showing up with everyone of you until we get the changes that we need. Because if we don’t, one of us, or one of our family members or friends, we will continue to be at risk of becoming Mother Patrick, Mother Rowley, Mother Sammy,” Erykai Cage, 44, said during her speech.

As the rally continued, more people began to approach the crowd, including Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand and Kent County Commissioner Robert S. Womack. However, only Womack stayed and took the microphone to address the public, while LaGrand limited himself to speaking to a few media members and some demonstrators around the crowd before leaving.
“What you have seen is supposed to be a trial. But what it has come down to is a test of our resilience. Does Grand Rapids go back to business as usual? Do the politicians who refuse to help change the policies and laws surrounding police and community relations, do they go back to business as usual? We have to be resilient,” Womack told the crowd.

Womack’s speech raised concerns among the audience about the absence of other politicians, with people asking why other commissioners weren’t present.
“The only thing they care about is their careers. They do not care about anything else. And if you want to test me, you can say, ‘Hey, maybe Commissioner Womack is just saying that.’ Okay, then where the hell are they right now?” Womack said.
Before the rally ended, the demonstrators chanted pro-Lyoya slogans and held up their signs. There was little police presence around the rally, and no counter protesters, so the gathering ended without incident.
“To me, this is personal because I’m a Black mother, and these children are, at the end of the day, somebody’s children, and they are also members of my community.  We’re unheard. They [politicians] have everything that they wanted. This is what their decisions made, not ours,” Cage said.
“As long as I have breath in my body, I’m optimistic because I’m going to continue to do what I need to do in order to make sure that I see justice,” she finished.

Alas, it simply turned its guns on a different political foe.","Rep. LaMonica McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka were both present for a May 9 protest at a migrant jail in Newark that led to Baraka's arrest and now charges for McIver. (Photos by Jemal Countess/Stephanie Keith/Getty Images)President Trump is finding out that it’s harder to prosecute his political foes for no reason than he thought it would be.
This week saw the implosion of the Trump administration’s case against Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat arrested two weeks ago and charged with trespassing on the property of a migrant jail used by the feds — even though video evidence available to the public shows he was not trespassing.
Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal attorney for Trump who was given the job of our state’s chief federal prosecutor in March despite zero credentials, made dismissing the charge against Baraka seem like an act of goodwill, saying she was doing it “for the sake of moving forward.”
That statement bemused U.S. Magistrate Judge André Espinosa, who was overseeing Baraka’s case.
“What does that mean?” Espinosa asked Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Demanovich during a hearing Wednesday.
“Your honor, we believe just, in the interest of justice in this case, in considering all factors, that it was the most appropriate resolution in the interest of justice to move forward with this charge and dismiss. We weighed all factors and took it under careful consideration, and considering all that, the decision was made to dismiss the charges, with prejudice,” Demanovich said.
That’s a lot of words to say: We screwed up. Demanovich did not mention that his office spoke to a guard who admitted inviting Baraka onto the jail’s property. 
Espinosa, who formally dismissed the trespassing charge Wednesday, lit into the U.S. Attorney’s Office for its handling of the case, calling agents’ arrest of Baraka “hasty” and the decision, 10 days later, to dismiss the charge “embarrassing.”
“Federal prosecutors serve a singular, paramount client: justice itself. Your role is not to secure convictions at all costs, nor to satisfy public clamor, nor to advance political agendas. Your allegiance is to the impartial application of the law, to the pursuit of truth, and to the upholding of due process of all,” the judge said.
Habba was not present for this extraordinary dressing-down — perhaps she was busy with her alleged investigation of our governor and attorney general — though she should have been, since her public intention to use her office to punish New Jersey Democrats is clearly the reason the mayor of our state’s biggest city was placed under arrest on a charge so flimsy that Habba’s office couldn’t keep it alive for even two weeks.
Wednesday’s lecture from Judge Espinosa should serve as a warning for Habba. Alas, it won’t. We know this because moments after announcing Monday that she was dropping the Baraka case, she said she was filing criminal charges against Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was involved in the melee that transpired when federal agents moved to arrest Baraka and now stands accused of assaulting federal agents. A prosecutor with an ounce of shame — faced with having to admit publicly that their 10-day-old prosecution of a political foe was a complete sham — would have taken a moment to reflect before then siccing her office on a different political foe, but shame is not an emotion Habba feels, I fear.
Trump is clearly on a revenge tour for the various criminal charges filed against him during his four years out of the White House, one that is sweeping up Democrats who had nothing to do with any of the charges he faced. He lit into McIver on Wednesday, saying she was “shoving federal agents” and proclaiming that “we’re going to have law and order” now that he’s president again. This was just a week after he extolled the new president of Syria, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who was until recently on the U.S. list of designated terrorists for his past links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State, as a “young, attractive guy, tough guy” with a “strong past.” Interesting, isn’t it, who gets his stamp of approval and who gets called a thug.
Unfortunately, a byproduct of the prosecutions that Trump faced is a public inured to the prospect of their political leaders jailing one another. An Emerson poll from last week found that 44% percent of respondents supported Baraka’s arrest, despite there being evidence from the start that he didn’t do the thing he was arrested for doing. This is a dangerous road we’re on, and I worry there’s no way back.

This year at the University of Vermont, the campus once again engaged in questions of Israel and Palestine — but this time through dialogue, scholarship and academic inquiry.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Matt Vogel: The difference a year makes.","This commentary is by Matt Vogel, executive director of UVM Hillel.This time last year, we stood on edge. An encampment had settled for nearly two weeks into the center of campus, its chants and signage echoing a narrow and often exclusionary narrative about Israel and Zionism.Many Jewish students felt unsafe and unwelcome on their way to study in the library for finals. There were threats of protests during graduation, and many of our students debated whether to even attend. Fear, confusion and isolation were all too present.What a difference a year makes.This year at the University of Vermont, the campus once again engaged in questions of Israel and Palestine — but this time through dialogue, scholarship and academic inquiry. Rather than shouting past one another, students and faculty came together to think deeply, listen curiously and ask hard questions.Instead of protests designed to silence, we saw programs designed to expand understanding. Instead of posting statements online, we listened, we convened, we learned and we adapted.The university hosted a symposium on Israel/Palestine this fall after a listening session last year where students said they wanted a chance to intellectually engage with these serious issues. It was an ambitious and important initiative rooted in history, nuance and learning and the first of its kind at UVM. While it hit the mark in some respects and missed it in others, the important thing to note is that this university was trying and it was doing so publicly.Renowned Harvard historian Derrick Penslar spoke about Zionism not as a monolithic idea, but as an evolving idea shaped by the Jewish people’s search for safety, self-determination, and moral responsibility.Earlier this spring Peter Beinart met with students to discuss “life after Gaza,” engaging in a thoughtful conversation about the human cost of war, the future of the region, and the weight of hope. Students of differing ideologies met, talked, and engaged in a conversation that was open and honest and would have been nearly impossible under the polemic debates of last year.These events didn’t ignore the pain or the politics; they embraced them. They modeled what it looks like when a university lives up to its promise: to teach, to challenge and to care by providing access to opportunities to learn.While it may have been federally compelled through the Title VI investigation and resolution, UVM was acting to improve campus climate by upholding their policies to prohibit antisemitism, anti-Arab and anti-Asian bias and harassment.We at UVM Hillel have seen the shift firsthand. Jewish student participation has grown significantly from last year’s lows to more than 1,500 meaningful student interactions this year. Students are hungry for spaces where they can be both intellectually curious and spiritually grounded, where they can celebrate Shabbat with friends one night and study ancient Jewish texts on protest, God, and artificial intelligence the next, all while sharing good Vermont food together.This past year, our team took bold steps to meet students where they are: off-campus dinners with Hillel Fresh, on-campus celebrations from Purim to Pride, Skinny Pancake Shabbat, Camel’s Hump hikes, and new Jewish learning fellowships that foster conversation rather than confrontation.These aren’t just programs. They’re invitations to belong and engage.When UVM students walked across the stage at graduation, many proudly wore blue and white cords from Hillel — a symbol of their Jewish identity, resilience and connection to one another. There are no calls to hide, no whispers of fear. There is pride. There is joy. There is community.We also introduced a new honor this year: the Patricia A. Prelock Ally to the Jewish People Award, named for UVM’s outgoing interim president, a steadfast partner who has consistently shown up for Jewish students with empathy, courage and action. This award recognizes university leaders who listen, who learn, and who lead with integrity. It’s a reminder that allyship isn’t performative, it’s personal and it makes a difference.There is still so much work to be done. The forces that seek to divide us remain real and recalibrating. But this year proved something powerful: that change is possible. That healing can happen. That dialogue can replace dismissal, and scholarship can replace slogans on our campus.Looking ahead, I hope UVM continues to lead not only in addressing antisemitism, but in uplifting all marginalized communities through compassion, education and accountability through policy. I hope we keep building spaces where complexity is welcomed, and where no student has to choose between who they are and where they learn.A year ago, we were bracing for the next impact. Today, we are building momentum.What a difference a year makes.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Matt Vogel: The difference a year makes.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

Impunity for foreign governments makes us all less safe.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isaac Evans-Frantz: The Leahy Law can help us change course.","This commentary is by Isaac Evans-Frantz of Brattleboro. He is the director of Action Corps, an organization active in 30 states that campaigns for U.S. policies to save lives around the world. In 2022 he challenged then-Congressman Peter Welch for the seat that Sen. Patrick Leahy had previously held.Over the past two years, Vermonters have directly felt the impact of U.S.-backed Israeli violence against Palestinians. Vermonter Dylan Collins, a journalist, was injured by tank fire from the Israeli military on October 13, 2023, with no ensuing accountability.The following month a gunman shot three Palestinian students in Burlington. And on April 14, 2025, masked U.S. federal agents kidnapped another Vermonter, Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian U.S. resident.And throughout all this, the transfer of U.S. weapons have caused astronomical death and destruction in Gaza, violating U.S. law governing provision of such weapons. Our tax dollars are being used to harm civilians in Gaza, rather than strengthen our communities.And the violence has directly struck Vermont journalists, activists, residents and visitors. In protesting the violence, we and our neighbors are becoming targets of state repression. Decades ago, as a Vermont fourth grader, I attended a classroom talk by a Jewish man who had survived a Nazi death camp. His story was harrowing, and left me with the strong belief that when we face atrocities, we must not turn away — no matter the personal price. These are moments when we are called to stand with one another.We are witnessing crimes against humanity in Gaza and beyond, propelled by our federal government. Parents are pulling children from the rubble and grieving entire neighborhoods reduced to ashes. Many Americans are left asking why our government continues to contribute weapons and military support for these atrocities. Is there a way for us to stop our tax dollars from fueling abuse and devastation around the world? The Leahy Law offers a solution. When I first heard D.C. colleagues reference this law several years ago, I was proud to learn that its name comes from our own Sen. Patrick Leahy.The law prohibits the U.S. from providing assistance to foreign security force units when credible information shows they have committed gross violations of human rights. It allows the U.S. to target particularly egregious units of foreign security partners. This accountability encourages respect for human rights more broadly.The Leahy Law has been applied around the globe, halting aid to thousands of security force units across numerous countries, with one glaring exception: Israel. Despite years of credible reports of gross violations of human rights committed by Israeli security force units, including in the State Department’s own annual human rights reports, all U.S. administrations since the law’s adoption have failed to enforce the law in regards to Israel.This selective enforcement sets a dangerous precedent of impunity that emboldens the state of Israel to continue to commit gross violations of human rights. To the rest of the world, this double standard from the U.S. government sends the troubling message that some countries, because of political convenience or strategic alliances, can commit grave abuses without consequence.READ MORE
In an unprecedented move organized by DAWN, last December seven Palestinians and Palestinian Americans filed a lawsuit against the State Department to compel the Secretary of State to follow the Leahy Law with regard to Israel. It is absurd that it should require a lawsuit to uphold U.S. law and basic human rights standards, but this is an important step forward.On the congressional front, Vermont’s delegation to Washington has led the way in efforts to uphold the law. Building on Sen. Leahy’s legacy, Sen. Peter Welch has repeatedly pressed the State Department to apply the Leahy Law to Israel. In the House, just days after the Brattleboro Representative Town Meeting overwhelmingly passed a resolution to halt additional weapons to Israel until a permanent ceasefire is achieved, Rep. Becca Balint announced her opposition to sales of offensive weapons to Israel.When Sen. Bernie Sanders visited Brattleboro last summer, Action Corps Vermont members and friends asked him about the Leahy Law and requested that he introduce the first-ever joint resolutions of disapproval against certain U.S. arms transfers to Israel. Soon after, he did just that.Vermonters can be proud of our leadership on this issue, and rightly expect our congressional delegation to continue seeking accountability and an end to exceptions that undermine the law. Impunity for foreign governments makes us all less safe. I felt this myself last month when, returning home to Vermont from a weekend trip to Quebec, federal agents at the border pulled me over, interrogated me and searched my car. I couldn’t help but wonder if I was being targeted for my activism for human rights and against war.The longer the U.S. supports oppressive foreign governments, the more the U.S. has to become like those oppressive governments which suppress dissent. It seems that while the U.S. is imposing tariffs on imported goods, the U.S. is accelerating the import of repression to prevent Vermonters’ and our fellow Americans’ criticism of Israel.While the U.S. continues to look the other way when it comes to Israel’s crimes, Vermonters are less safe. Our members of Congress must continue to stand up for accountability under the Leahy Law. It’s the least we can do.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Isaac Evans-Frantz: The Leahy Law can help us change course.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

(Photo by Justin Casterline/Getty Images)I remember the first time I went to the Indianapolis 500 after moving to Indiana. It was a muddy mess with little sleep. It is also one of the best memories I have with my friend Anita, and it brings us laughter to this day.
Another fond sports memory is my spontaneous decision, driving through Indianapolis after a morning work assignment, to grab a friends and snag tickets for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks in 2000. Talk about an electric atmosphere.
This year’s 500 coincides with the Pacers being back in the finals, and I am reminded how lucky we are to have a vibrant sports world right here in Indiana.
So, I put together a Hoosier sports-related bucket list. Go make some memories!
— Go to the Indianapolis 500: I don’t go every year because, frankly, it’s a lot. Plus, my husband likes to go early. This year, he is taking our daughter, and I am excited for them to have that experience together for the first time. He’s a spectator now, but at one point he was engine tuner for Vitor Meira’s Team Menard car. And three years ago, as a splurge, I gave him a ride in the two-seater, which blew his mind. The speedway is an absolute gem that we should be proud of — from holding races to hosting citizenship ceremonies, vaccination clinics and solar eclipses.

— Indiana Fever game: I have been to many Fever games but not since Caitlin Clark arrived. I must rectify that soon. The hype and excitement is contagious. And Clark is someone I want to say I saw play, because she will undoubtedly be an icon.
— March Madness in Indiana: Basketball doesn’t get any better than the NCAA college basketball tournament in Indiana. Whether it’s the first or final round, it’s fun to see fans of other teams come to the city and discover its hospitality and love of the game. While heartbreaking, watching Butler University play Duke in the 2010 championship game will forever be a highlight of my personal sports bucket list.
If I could make a subcategory here, I would add going to a game at Hinkle Fieldhouse. It has an old-school feel that easily trumps new, fancier facilities.
— Olympic trials: Indianapolis has hosted swimming and diving trials at multiple locations. I spent a few hours watching diving years ago and was amazed at the precision and power. I am still kicking myself for not going to the last year’s swimming event at Lucas Oil Stadium. So many friends have said how great it was to immerse themselves in a new sport.
But the fun isn’t just in Indianapolis.

— Notre Dame football: Find time to see the Fighting Irish at Notre Dame Stadium on a fall day. Nothing beats it. My husband and I went a few years ago to the Navy game and it was everything we had hoped. We walked the campus a bit before the game, taking in the revelry and the beauty. By far the best part of the day was seeing all the traditions on display.
— Parkview Field: The stadium in downtown Fort Wayne hosts the TinCaps and is a delight for families. I have only been to one game there, but it was full of quirky entertainment, with a great location and reasonable food prices (for a stadium).
This is not an exhaustive list. I’m sure I will hear from a few Colts fans and my dad won’t forgive me for leaving out the U.S. Nationals at Indianapolis Raceway Park. The point is that Hoosiers are lucky to have such a rich sports ecosystem and should make sure to enjoy it!

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida A&M University has weathered its share of storms, the most recent being a deeply embarrassing debacle when a Texas donor conned former FAMU President Larry Robinson and a close circle of school officials into believing that the hallowed institution was the recipient of a $237.75 million gift. 
After discovering the gift was a hoax, Robinson resigned, which led to the uproar over the past several weeks surrounding the choice of Robinson’s successor. During a presidential search process shrouded in secrecy, the Ron DeSantis-dominated FAMU Board of Trustees voted 8-4 for Marva Johnson, a last-minute addition to the presidential finalist list.
  Marva Johnson via FAMU
“The late entry of Marva Johnson into the pool of candidates to become FAMU’s president has sparked concern about her allegiances, the selection process and her apparent lack of qualifications, MSNBC said. “Johnson, who has been appointed to boards by Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Gov. Rick Scott, has no college administrative experience and has remained an ally of DeSantis as his GOP administration has undermined Black history lessons in the state.” 
The likelihood that Johnson might be chosen provoked in a multipronged campaign of resistance, including a Change.org petition against her candidacy that gathered more than 10,000 signatures.
Florida’s state NAACP president threatened legal action over the selection process. Popular film director Will Packer, a FAMU graduate who has produced films like “Takers,” “Straight Outta Compton,” and “Think Like a Man,” warned that “a group of activist Republicans are trying to put in the highest position of power someone who is solidly and objectively unqualified for it.
A range of Black media personalities online also sounded the alarm on Johnson. 
There have been calls for boycotts and other punitive measures to express displeasure over how all this has played out. The primary objections involve Jonhson’s connections to DeSantis, who throughout his time as governor has exhibited barefaced hostility towards Black Floridians while implementing a raft of racist ideological MAGA policies aimed at institutions of higher learning.  
A WFSU story in the days following last Friday’s selection captures the temperature.
“Florida A&M University is ablaze following the appointment of Marva Johnson to the school’s presidency. Alumni, students and other FAMU stakeholders are weighing how best to move forward,” the story said. 
“Johnson is a controversial candidate for her ties to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, as he works to remake higher education in the state. Now, the school’s interim president is urging calm amid backlash and boycott threats in response to Johnson’s appointment by the FAMU Board of Trustees,” the story continues.
“I urge you to stay engaged and remain connected,” Interim President Tim Beard wrote in a statement. “Your advocacy, your feedback and your financial support are crucial to ensuring that our institution continues to thrive.” 
Wrecking ball
To describe DeSantis’ assault on higher education as a remaking is a grave understatement.
Since 2023, he has taken a wrecking ball to Florida’s higher educational system in his misguided effort to stamp out liberalism and “woke” ideology and install university presidents, educators, board members, and others who embrace the governor’s conservative agenda.
A 2024 report by the American Association of University Professors (AAUP), details the “the various manifestations of political and legislative interfer­ence in Florida’s higher education system under the DeSantis adminis­tration and that of his predecessor, Rick Scott.”
“These include attacks on faculty academic freedom and tenure; the assault on the curricu­lum; the elimination of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs; the development of a patronage system marked by politically connected administrative appointments; the stacking of the statewide board of governors with Republican former political officeholders and profes­sional political operatives beholden to the governor and the legislature; the passage of legislation making confidential identifying informa­tion of applicants for presidential positions at state universities or Florida College System institutions; political and legislative attacks on the higher education accreditation system; legal challenges to public employee unions; and the broader assault on the rights and social gains of LGBTQ+ communities.” 
In short order, DeSantis – term-limited from running again for governor – has enacted hostile takeovers of the New College, the University of Florida, Florida International University, and the University of West Florida. As the Florida Phoenix has reported, DeSantis is installing his political allies at state universities so that they can purge these institutions of ‘ideological concepts.’ To date, five of 12 schools have new presidents and another four are looking. 
People like Packer and Adora Obi Nweze, president of the Florida State Conference NAACP, issued calls to scrap the entire process and start again.
Nweze urged the FAMU Board of Trustees to “recommit to a fair and untainted process” that reflects the university’s legacy of academic excellence. 
She and others were ignored and Johnson now will become FAMU’s 13th president.
Introduction to campus
During a volatile meeting that ran about two hours, as Johnson introduced herself to the community, tempers ran hot. Packer warned trustees that choosing Johnson would be detrimental to FAMU’s future, but she sought to assuage those fears.
“I know that the comments you’re bringing – while they’re coming to me in a way that may evidence angst – are coming from your love for this university, your love for this university’s legacy, and your interest in making sure that you protect it. If I am selected, I would fight and win for FAMU,” Johnson told the crowd. 
“No, I’m not a Trojan horse. I was not sent here to dismantle FAMU. … “I would love the opportunity to work with you and to grow FAMU.” 
Johnson also said: “I understand the gravity of this moment. I’m grounded in the importance of FAMU’s legacy, and I’m energized by the opportunities that we have in front of us.” 
The new president served as vice president for governmental affairs (meaning she was a lobbyist) for Charter Communications, a telecom company, and is a former member of the State Board of Education.
I reached out to Desirée Nero, a corporate and government consultant and “a very proud alum,” said she understands the concerns but now that Johnson has been selected, FAMUANs must figure out how to work with her. 
“Universities are moving more in the direction of being managed like businesses. The president’s job is to raise money, build relationships, and increase the universities’ global impact and reputation. Marva Johnson can do that,” Nero said.
Nero gives Johnson props for succeeding as a Black woman in business – “I’m sure she has had to fight some battles in her rise to leadership,” she said. 
“She’s well educated; a Georgetown undergrad, an MBA from Emory and a J.D. from Georgia State,” said Nero, who has 20 years of experience working in leadership development within Florida State government. “Republicans and MAGA are not one and the same. There’s nothing recently that indicates she will walk the MAGA path.”
Disproportionately underfunded
FAMU, the state’s only public historically Black institution, was established in 1887 during the height of Jim Crow and segregation because African Americans weren’t allowed to attend white institutions. Racism and purposeful underinvestment has always dogged the university. 
In 2023, the Biden administration sent letters to 16 governors – including DeSantis – urging these states to review $12 billion in funding disparities among land-grant universities. The U.S. Department of Education alleged that the states disproportionately underfunded Florida A&M University by nearly $2 billion compared to University of Florida – the second largest funding disparity among all land-grant universities.
This disparity has resulted in “inadequate resources and delay critical investments in everything from campus infrastructure to research and development to student support services,” then-U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona wrote. 
The Trump administration recently rescinded a $16.3 million grant that had been awarded to FAMU’s College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. Meanwhile, FAMU is struggling to properly prepare its students to pass board examinations in its nursing, law, pharmacy, and physical therapy programs. Alan Levine, vice chair of the Florida Board of Governors, last year threatened to get rid of the programs if there’s no improvement.  
Those who support Johnson hope she has the political connections, fundraising acumen, and leadership skills to reverse these challenges. And they hope she will convince DeSantis not to mess with FAMU the way he did New College.  
“Change is inevitable and history has shown us that those who fight change are subject to be left behind,” Nero said. “Change isn’t coming to FAMU, it’s here. FAMU may be in the fight of its life and we need a warrior to champion this fight. This is too important to be confrontational.”

Minnesota is the second largest producer of hogs in the United States. With a population of roughly nine million, hogs outnumber humans here. Maybe that’s why, when I passed by a transport truck near a pork processing plant in Austin, Minnesota, I felt compelled to look inside.
As I peered through the slats, I locked eyes with one pig in particular. His body was covered in scratches. At only six months old, the typical age of slaughter in the pork industry, he was just minutes away from a brutal death.
What you may not realize is that the pork industry isn’t just a nightmare for hogs — it takes a tremendous toll on people, too. And right now, new policy stands to further endanger the health and safety of Minnesota’s roughly 17,000 meatpacking workers.
In March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would allow slaughterhouses to permanently increase the speed of production. The USDA claims that the move eliminates “outdated administrative requirements that have slowed production and added unnecessary costs for American producers.”
Most meatpacking workers see faster line speeds as a direct threat to their health and safety on the job. Even before the threat of increased line speeds, meatpacking was one of the most dangerous jobs in the country, with some of the highest rates of workplace injury and illness across all industries. From 2013 to 2017, an average of eight workers per year died as a result of incidents in meatpacking plants.
More commonly, workers suffer from chronic musculoskeletal disorders caused by standing on the line for hours and repeating the same motions thousands of times a day. Carpal tunnel syndrome is especially common. Higher line speeds are likely to increase both the frequency and severity of these debilitating injuries.
The meatpacking industry relies heavily on workers from vulnerable populations, including immigrants and people with limited economic resources. This reality often leaves workers less likely to speak out about unsafe conditions or publicly advocate for labor rights.
Yet the situation has become so dire that, on April 17, hundreds of JBS meatpacking workers marched in shifts to speak out against increased line speeds and demand safer working conditions. This march marks the first demonstration of its kind at the Worthington plant in more than a decade.
Currently, JBS workers are processing more than 1,000 hogs per hour. Now, that rate could climb to more than 1,300. At some plants, like Quality Pork Processors in Austin, the faster pace is already a daily reality.
UFCW Local 663 — the union representing JBS workers in Worthington — is now in contract negotiations with JBS, advocating for conditions that would uphold safer line speeds and staffing levels.
“The decision to allow facilities to operate at higher speeds without any additional safety measures only puts workers and consumers at risk,” UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement.
The courage of JBS meatpacking workers to march reflects just how grave their health and safety concerns have become in the face of faster line speeds. When meatpacking companies prioritize corporate profits over worker well-being, the results are devastating. Minnesota’s meatpacking plants now face a critical choice: they can continue down a path that sacrifices health and dignity for efficiency, or they can lead by maintaining or reducing line speeds to protect workers.
In a 2019 interview with Human Rights Watch, Ignacio Davalos, a worker at a Smithfield-owned hog plant in Nebraska, put it this way: “When we’re dead and buried, our bones will keep hurting.”
With enough pressure from unions and consumers, Minnesota meatpacking workers may have a fighting chance at their fundamental right to safety.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz.)One of the nation’s largest real estate companies has transferred its corporate registration back to Indiana from the state of Delaware, in what Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales has dubbed a “big win.”
“We are proud to welcome Simon Property Group home.  This move is a big win for Indiana — and it sends a strong message that our state is open for business,” Morales said in a news release. His office’s Business Services Division managed the redomestication process. 
The domestication certificate was dated May 14, 2025 and took effect the next day.
The company cited “strong historical ties” with Indiana in a 2025 proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ahead of an annual shareholders meeting last week in Indianapolis.
Simon and its predecessors have maintained headquarters in Indiana for more than 60 years, and in 2006, the company built its new physical home just steps away from the Statehouse. The company owns eight properties in Indiana and more than 70% of its corporate employees reside in-state, or about 3,000.

“Given our significant presence in Indiana, the Company is committed to the state’s business community and continued economic growth. We believe that redomesticating the Company to Indiana emphasizes this commitment in a meaningful,” the statement read. It also cited Elevance Health, Eli Lilly & Co., and Cummins as other “successful public companies” that are both headquartered and incorporated in Indiana.
“The legislators and judges making corporate law will be fellow members of the Indiana community, not residents of a state in which the Company has no substantial connections beyond being the historical state of incorporation of (Corporate Property Investors),” it continued. “The Board and (Governance and Nominating) Committee believe that local decision-makers have a deeper understanding of our business and, therefore, are more likely to make decisions on a more fully informed basis and lasting way.”
Simon acquired and merged with Corporate Property Investors and Corporate Realty Consultants in 1998, according to the document. It was previously incorporated as a real estate investment trust in Maryland in 1993.
The board and committee “did not find that aspect of Delaware domicile compelling such that it justifies a split between the Company’s legal home and its physical home,” the statement read.
But another main motivator was “meritless litigation” against the company “brought by financially interested law firms” — even though it has no pending litigation related to Delaware law, according to the statement.
Simon described Indiana’s approach to corporate law as “statute-focused” and Delaware’s as more dependent on judicial interpretation. The company noted that even proposed legislation to ease litigation-related risks couldn’t convince it to stay because “Indiana still has the better balance,” but it acknowledge that Hoosier case law is more limited.
Indiana Code would also explicitly let Simon’s board members take into account customers, employees, suppliers, surrounding communities and other stakeholders — not just shareholders. The company said that “can help foster a more holistic governance model and potentially reduce distraction, short-term bias, and missed opportunities.”
The company also expects to save money. Instead of paying Delaware a $250,000 franchise tax annually, it would owe Indiana $50 every two years when it files business entity reports.

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”


A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.

Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
New laws proliferate
Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
Washington state compromises
For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

Dave Griffith, a Republican from Jefferson City, speaks at the House Health and Mental Health committee Feb. 17,(Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri Veterans Commission has received $80 million from sales taxes collected from marijuana dispensaries and other fees since the state’s cannabis program began in 2020.  
Of that, $33.8 million has come in during the current fiscal year, which began in July and ends June 30.
The money goes towards the operational needs of the state’s seven veterans homes, including payroll and maintenance of existing infrastructure, a commission spokeswoman said.
While it may appear that the money is a big boon for veteran homes across the state, the cannabis funds have rolled in just as revenue from casinos has rapidly dropped off, said Democratic state Sen. Steve Roberts of St. Louis, who is vice chair of the commission.
The commission receives funds from the $2 fee people pay to enter a casino, he said, but those numbers have declined significantly since the pandemic. The marijuana funds are helping fill that hole, he said, but money for the state’s veterans home remains in limbo every year.
“We still need to find a mechanism to ensure that [veterans homes] have the funding they need,” Roberts said, “because just with the casinos and marijuana funds, it’s not enough. And it’s forcing the commission to continue to have to go back to the legislature to ask for additional money.”
Republican state Rep. Dave Griffith of Jefferson City, who is also a board commissioner, compared the situation to a business unable to make a long-range plan. 
“The Missouri Veterans Commission can’t do that,” Griffith said. “They have to go from year to year to year to see what is appropriated by the General Assembly.”
He disagrees with House members who believe that marijuana funding is the solution, he said, and that general revenue can be appropriated elsewhere. 
“The Senate actually has done a better job of taking care of the veterans commission and some of the properties that we’ve got,” Griffith said. “It’s frustrating for me that it seems like every time we want to try to do something for veterans, we’re looking at vices — gambling and drug use.”
Missourians voted in November 2018 to adopt a constitutional amendment legalizing medical marijuana, and it also requires fees and taxes generated by the program, minus operational expenses, be transferred to the commission. 
Then in 2022, voters approved another amendment to legalize adult-use marijuana. With these sales, revenues from taxes and fees are divided between three causes: grants for substance use prevention, the public defenders system and the veterans commission. 
In fiscal year 2024, the commission received $19.4 million between both medical and adult-use sales, and $33.8 million in 2025.
 The Division of Cannabis Regulation transfers funds from medical marijuana sales tax revenues and fees to the Missouri Veterans Commission. Similarly, the division transfers funds from adult-use cannabis sales tax revenues and fees to the commission, Missouri Public Defender System and DHSS for its substance use disorder grant program. 
In the fiscal year that begins in July, the commission is set to receive $32.6 million.
However, future funding depends on the health of the cannabis industry, which can experience ups and downs, Griffith said.
Both Roberts and Griffith said they’re committed to finding more stable funding for veterans. 
“We’re very fortunate that this is a bipartisan issue,” Roberts said. “There are veterans homes in Democratic and Republican districts, and all the senators I’ve talked to seem to be very supportive.”
Roberts pointed to Gov. Mike Kehoe’s State of the State address in January, where he addressed the underfunding of the homes and need for continued support. 
“Under the Kehoe administration,” the governor said, “no veterans homes will close due to a lack of state funding.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021725-0270-1-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

The state Public Disclosure Commission levied the civil penalty on Service Employees International Union Healthcare 1199NW following a short hearing in which the union did not contest the punishment. SEIU represents more than 30,000 nurses, health care workers, and behavioral health workers in Washington.
Under a stipulated agreement, SEIU 1199NW will pay $3,000 within 30 days of the signing of the final order. The remaining amount is suspended if the union complies with campaign finance laws without significant violations for four years.
Let’s Go Washington filed the original complaint last November. The group alleged the union did not report a substantial sum of expenditures made in October until after the Nov. 4 election. That violated campaign finance laws intended to give voters campaign spending information before they cast their ballots, the group said.
Commission staff investigated and found SEIU1199NW made three expenditures totaling $430,000 on Oct. 3 and two others, totaling $2,400, on Oct. 21, that were not reported until Nov. 11. 
Those included a pair of $200,000 contributions to the political campaign committees of the state House and Senate Democratic caucuses, according to the commission’s online database.
On Thursday, assistant attorney general Susie Giles-Klein, representing the commission staff, said there was no evidence the union acted intentionally to deceive voters. But, she said, this is an established committee and its finance officials should have known the rules.
Commissioners deliberated briefly in executive session before emerging and voting 3-0 to impose the penalty.
Union officials did not speak at Thursday’s hearing.
In December, an attorney for SEIU1199NW acknowledged the late filing but denied it was done willfully.
“The Union regrets its error and supports the work of the PDC and its mission. However, as the error was unintentional, the Union requests that a written warning be used as a remedy for this inadvertent violation,” attorney Carson Flora wrote to the commission’s compliance officer.
Let’s Go Washington founder Brian Heywood criticized the commission’s action as too lenient for “one of the most active political organizations in the state.”
“They knew what they were doing by hiding that information,” Heywood said in a statement. “This is one of the most serious public disclosure infractions and should be treated as such, but they were given a relatively minor penalty by the PDC despite admitting their guilt.”
He said it raises questions about whether the campaign watchdog is “giving preferential treatment to politically aligned organizations.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/money-closuep-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

(Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)Maryland added around 4,900 new jobs in April, but labor officials said those gains were dragged down by a loss of 2,600 jobs in the federal workforce in the same month.
The Maryland Department of Labor reports that mass federal layoffs and other actions by the Trump administration are “tempering the state’s overall jobs growth,” according to new data released Wednesday. The federal impact was even sharper in March, when the state’s 2,300 new jobs were eclipsed by the loss of 2,700 federal jobs for the month.
“April’s report is the second to reflect actions taken by the new federal administration that impact federal employees and contractors, including reductions in force (RIFs), terminations of federal contracts, and grant cancellations,” according to a state Department of Labor press release Wednesday.
And the March and April numbers may not even show the full scope of the problem in the state’s federal workforce, the department said.
“The April jobs report does not reflect the most recent RIFs, employees who were placed on administrative leave or who accepted ‘buyout’ offers and are still being paid, federal employees who selected deferred retirement, or the ongoing tariff situation,” the department statement said.
March was the first month that Trump layoffs began showing up in the state’s data.

“Layoffs among federal workers and contractors are impacting every county in Maryland,” Labor Secretary Portia Wu said in written statement Wednesday. “These workers have dedicated their careers to public service and they are an incredible asset to our state, so it’s essential that we do everything that we can to support them.”
The U.S. Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that Maryland’s preliminary unemployment rate rose to 3.1% in April, up slightly from a flat 3% in March.
The Maryland unemployment numbers come as the Trump administration continues its push to bring down federal spending by slashing the federal workforce, among other things. The result is hundreds of thousands of federal workers suddenly without jobs over the last few months – many of whom live in Maryland.
About 269,000 Maryland residents are employed by the federal government, as of late March data. Maryland has the nation’s second-largest share of residents who work for the government, trailing only Washington, D.C.
And Maryland has another 225,000 federal contractors – reflecting about 10.5% of the state’s total gross domestic product in 2023, according state data. As the Trump administration cuts down on federal spending, some state contractors are also in danger of being on the chopping block.
Wu said in a recent interview that federal unemployment claims are at a “significantly higher level than what we typically see” and noted that the state has not seen the full scope of impact due to layoffs and other moves in the Trump administration.
She said getting a full scope of the impact on the state is also challenging: Some workers who live in Maryland may file unemployment documents with Washington, D.C., or nearby states, for example. Ongoing lawsuits challenging federal layoffs can also muddy the picture by temporarily ordering jobs restored.
Maryland federal contractor layoffs increase as Trump slashes federal spending

“Many people don’t file for unemployment right away,” Wu said. “With all the litigation, maybe they haven’t lost their job yet, or have taken some kind of administrative leave or delayed layoff or a separate situation.”
According to May 10 data, the Maryland Labor Department had received more than 1,600 federal unemployment claims since the start of the Trump administration.
Some of the federal workers who have been laid off are finding refuge in Maryland agencies.  A communications official with the Department of Labor reports that since February, 150 former federal workers have landed a job with a Maryland state agency.
“We have a bunch hired in our own agency,” Wu said. “We know that there are a lot of talented people out there and we’re excited to welcome them to state government.”
The labor department is not the only Maryland agency picking up laid-off federal workers. Others include the departments of Health,  Human Services, Public Safety and Correctional Services, Education and Information Technology, the Office of the Attorney General and the Comptroller of Maryland.
“They are in a very broad range of roles – from administration and program management to health, IT, and legal fields. This includes experts in specialized and technical positions, such as information systems auditor, GIS (Geographic Information Systems) analyst, natural resources biologist, veterinarian and hydrographic engineer,” according to a labor department official.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-28-at-9.38.23 PM-1024x679.png,,,2025-05-23 20:03:48.559897

(Courtesy of Feeding South Dakota)As Congress weighs the latest budget reconciliation bill, it’s important to take a step back and consider how these decisions will affect everyday people in South Dakota. Reducing federal spending and promoting self-reliance are important goals, but some of the proposed changes could unintentionally create more problems than they solve.
If you’ve been to the grocery store lately, you’ve likely noticed how much harder it has become to afford the basics. For many families in South Dakota this isn’t just a budget concern – it’s a daily challenge.
We urge Rep. Dusty Johnson, Sen. Mike Rounds and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to consider the concerning impacts that the current proposal by the House could have. Federal support for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would be significantly reduced, shifting more of the cost to states. South Dakota’s share of that expense could range from $9 million to $18 million as early as 2028 — an increased pressure on a state budget already stretched thin.
SD Rep. Johnson votes yes as U.S. House Republicans push through budget reconciliation bill

At the same time, it would impact the South Dakota economy as SNAP supports 789 retailers in the state to the tune of over $156 million. Each SNAP dollar has up to $1.80 of economic impact, supporting the supply chain from farmer to store. Reduce the program, reduce the revenue.
The increased state cost and reduced revenue would force states to make tough choices: cut benefits, limit eligibility or raise taxes to cover the gap.
Proposed Medicaid cuts would hit rural hospitals especially hard, many of which are already stretched thin. These facilities are often the only source of care in their communities, and losing access would be devastating.
The bill also includes new requirements tied to work. SNAP already includes work incentives and gradually reduces benefits as income rises. In South Dakota, over 80% of SNAP recipients live in a family that has one working adult.
Congress modernized SNAP by requiring regular updates to the monthly benefits. However, the current bill includes a proposal to limit future updates to the Thrifty Food Plan, which determines SNAP benefit levels. This would reduce support over time, even as food prices remain high. The average SNAP benefit is still just $6.57 per person, per day, in our state.
At Feeding South Dakota, we are seeing more working families, seniors, children and veterans through our programs and partners; in fact, 15% more than this time last year. We are operating at full capacity and have already felt the very real impact of federal changes after food for 147,000 meals was immediately discontinued in April. It is critical that federal programs stay strong to support the fight to end hunger, or the gap between need and resources will become too great for us to close.
If you take nothing else from this, know that the proposed cuts would:

Increase hunger.
Decrease local revenue.
Overwhelm already strained food pantries.


We urge our lawmakers to think critically about any cuts through a budget reconciliation bill that undermines SNAP and Medicaid.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMore than 100,000 income-eligible residents are going to have free access to Vermont’s state parks this year, thanks to a first-in-the-nation pilot program.The Park Access Fund Pilot Program will give people who receive benefits through the state’s Economic Services Division or the Women, Infants and Children program free entrance to any of Vermont’s 55 state parks during the season, which runs from May through October. To participate in the program, residents can show their EBT or WIC cards at the park entrance. Those who are eligible but do not have an EBT card can visit their local Economic Services Division District Office to request a card that can be used for state park entrance in 2025, according to the Park Access Fund website.Once inside, all guests have the option to participate in free park-led activities, such as bird walks, concerts and evening campfires. The state parks events and programs page contains information on upcoming programming. READ MORE
The initiative originated from an idea to bring park accessibility to Vermonters experiencing food insecurity, according to Sarah Alberghini Winters, the executive director of Vermont Parks Forever, which runs the program. This new program is an extension of the Parks Access Fund, which grants free park passes to 55 nonprofit community partners to help their clients get outside, according to Winters.Winters said she hopes this year’s expansion of the program is well-utilized. Depending on its success and donors’ willingness to support future efforts, the pilot program could continue in 2026 and beyond, she said. “It really takes a village,” Winters said. “We’re so thankful to have support from local and national foundations.”Vermonters not eligible for this pilot program can also receive assistance accessing state parks through library passes and the Green Mountain Passport.Financial barriers are not the only thing preventing some Vermonters from getting outside, Winters said, but this program is a starting point. She said her hope is that Vermont will set an example for other states to consider expanding programs for outdoor accessibility. “We’ll continue to learn about how we can help with other barriers that exist,” she said.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s state parks are offering free entry for income-eligible residents in 2025.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/plymouth-state-park-1-20230921-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

Greg Gianforte […]","A picture of a sprinkler on grass (Photo by Michael Mol via Flickr | CC-BY-SA 2.0). Montana’s public officials take an oath of office when they assume their positions.  This is not optional and is required by Montana’s Constitution:

Article III – General Government – Section 3.  Oath of office.  Members of the legislature and all executive, ministerial and judicial officers, shall take and subscribe the following oath or affirmation, before they enter upon the duties of their offices: “I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States, and the constitution of the state of Montana, and that I will discharge the duties of my office with fidelity (so help me God).”
 

Now, it appears that another enclave for the mega-wealthy is defying both Montana’s water rights laws and the constitution — and so far, they’re getting away with it as Gov. Greg Gianforte and Attorney General Austin Knudsen are lax in upholding their sworn duty “to protect and defend” our constitution.
As reported this week, the Crazy Mountain Ranch is an 18,000 acre super-upscale development by “Lone Mountain Land Co., a subsidiary of CrossHarbor Capital Partners, a private-equity firm behind the development of the equally exclusive Yellowstone Club, Spanish Peaks Mountain Club and Moonlight Basin Resort at Big Sky.”
By now Montanans are deep into learning the hard lessons that those with big money tend to do what they want, following the old adage that “it’s easier to ask forgiveness than permission.”  And in this case, neither permission nor forgiveness are even being asked for — merely a “we’ll do what we want and if you don’t like it, sue us.”
But there’s another old adage in the West that’s equally applicable here:  “Whiskey is for drinking, water is for fighting.”  And while the monied clients of the “ranch” may be eating thick steaks and sipping old whiskey, the multi-generational ranchers whose water rights are threatened are “lawyering up” and fighting — and they could use some help from the governor and attorney general.
In short, the Crazy Mountain Ranch spent a million bucks to “lay turf” on a 112-acre golf course — and they have stated their intention to water that high-price turf with or without state-approved rights to the water, even openly admitting they did so last year and intend to do so this year.  There’s a word for these kinds of people, and that word is “scofflaws.” 
The same constitution both Gianforte and Knudsen swore to uphold is clear: “All surface, underground, flood, and atmospheric waters within the boundaries of the state are the property of the state for the use of its people and are subject to appropriation for beneficial uses as provided by law.”
Despite wearing cowboy boots and jeans, Gianforte is not a rancher and may not understand the complexity of the Prior Appropriation Doctrine.  But Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who was raised in Culbertson in rural Roosevelt County, surely knows that water is the lifeblood of ranching in Montana.  As former Speaker of the House, he is also well acquainted with the state’s water rights laws — and the need to either follow those laws or be back to killing each other with shovels on irrigation diversion ditches. 
If these mega-wealthy developers want to defy Montana’s water laws, then let them take on the State and all Montanans, not just a handful of old ranchers they can easily outspend. Comes now the “call of duty” to Gianforte and Knudsen to honor their oaths “with fidelity,” protect the state’s water rights system, and immediately move to shut down the irrigation of the elite scofflaws’ “turf.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3767275297_684e1df395_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

He encouraged […],"Schoemann spoke at the Dane County Republican’s monthly “Pints and Politics” meeting on Tuesday. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann stepped up to the front of a room in the back of Kavanaugh’s Esquire Club on the east side of Madison with a grin and quickly started a chant about Gov. Tony Evers.
“Tony’s got to go. Who’s with me?” Schoemann said about the current second-term Democratic governor. He encouraged others in the room to join him. “Tony’s gotta go… Tony’s gotta go. I’d like him to hear it if you don’t mind.”
The crowd of about 30 clapped enthusiastically and slowly started to pick up the chant.
Schoemann, who wore a red UW-Madison quarter zip up, jeans and a camo hat with his campaign logo across the front, was at the restaurant for the Dane County Republican’s monthly “Pints and Politics” meeting. It’s the one of the latest stops for Schoemann, who is the first candidate of either major party to launch his campaign in the 2026 governor’s race. 
Evers’ decision on whether he will seek a third term is still up in the air. He recently told WisEye that he is “not spending very much time at all thinking about whether I’m going to run or not.” 
Getting a head start
With about 14 months before a Republican primary might be held, Schoemann is working to get a head start on other potential candidates. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is mulling a run for the office, was critical of Evers as he addressed party members at the state GOP’s annual convention. Bill Berrien, a Whitefish Bay businessman and Navy SEAL veteran, recently formed a political action committee.
Schoemann said that it’s “entirely possible” for Wisconsin to be more competitive for Republicans. He launches his campaign as the Republican Party of Wisconsin is reevaluating how to win after their preferred candidate lost in the state Supreme Court race and as Democrats have won 12 of the last 15 statewide elections.
Schoemann sought to start his “Tony” chant a couple times as he spoke to the group — at one point telling attendees that he is the son of a Lutheran Minister and “can’t handle a congregation unless they join with me.” The crowd joined the chant more quickly this time, but Schoemann cut it off quickly as he pulled his camo hat off and placed it over his heart and encouraged attendees to stand up to sing “My Country, ‘Tis of Thee” with him.
Schoemann has worked in Washington County as the elected county executive for the last five years and as the county administrator for six years prior. He owns a farm in the town of Trenton, located between West Bend and Grafton, with his wife and is the father of two.
Schoemann told attendees that he joined the Army National Guard, attended UW-Whitewater and then served in Iraq in 2003. Throughout the event, Schoemann returned to his faith and military service, telling the crowd that “love your neighbor” has been central to his work and will be central to his campaign. 
“It’s changed the trajectory of my life permanently,” Schoemann said, describing a memory of his time in Iraq when he gave bottles of water to a child who was drinking from a puddle.
“As he approaches the puddle, I’m thinking, ‘Oh, he’s just going to jump around in the puddle and play.’ He kneels down, and starts cupping his hands and starts drinking out of that puddle,” Schoemann said. 
“When I came back home, that moment kept coming back to me over and over and over, and I dedicated the rest of my life to the service and sacrifice of the guys and gals who didn’t come home, either in whole or in part, and of my Lord, Jesus, by loving my neighbor,” he continued, “ and that, ladies and gentlemen, is how we are going to win this election. We are going to turn Wisconsin red by loving our neighborhood.”
Rush Limbaugh and Ronald Reagan
Schoemann said he grew up a “Rush Limbaugh” and “Ronald Reagan baby” — with beliefs in smaller government, lower taxes and strong defense — and that those ideas have shaped his service in local government.
Schoemann repeatedly criticized Evers and spoke about his record.
“Under the education governor, are your schools better than they were six years ago?” Schoemann asked, with answers of ‘no’ coming from some in the room. “He’s filling potholes right now — getting his picture taken in every community can get to… Are your roads really all that much better than they were six years ago? No, no. They’re not, and if you look across the state of Wisconsin on every issue issue after issue, things aren’t better.”
Evers has been traveling across the state last week helping fill potholes as a part of an annual effort to call attention to the issue of improving the roads and his recent budget proposal of to dedicate funds for that purpose —  though Republicans have removed that from the budget. At one stop on his trip, Evers told reporters that he didn’t know much about Schoemann but thinks he’s “gonna have to be another Donald Trump.” 
“That’s the only way Republicans can kind of move forward in this day and age,” Evers said, according to WSAW-TV 7.
Schoemann said that he decided to run because he is “sick and tired of our kids, leaving the state for other opportunities in different states and not coming back” and “sick and tired of our retirees leaving this state that has become a complete tax hell.”
Schoemann also compared himself to former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson.
“Back when I was a kid in 1986, Tommy Thompson took out another Tony — [former Gov.] Tony Earl. A young, energetic Republican did very, very well in Dane County, and eventually by 1994, I believe he won Dane County,” said Schoemann, who is 43. 
Goal: Lose by less in Dane County
Thompson is the last Wisconsin governor to win a third term in office, and Schoemann wants to ensure that stays true by taking a page out of Thompson’s playbook. Schoemann said he would have three rules for his campaign: go to the Northwoods, go to Milwaukee and go to Dane County. He said that since his campaign launched he had visited Florence County to talk with a group of people, who, he said, likely “hadn’t seen a statewide elected official in decades,” had been on the radio in Milwaukee and his Tuesday evening stop in Madison was his second already. 
Schoemann said Republicans need to lose by less in Dane County, pointing out that President Donald Trump won the state of Wisconsin with nearly 23% of the vote in the deep blue county. 
“We’ve got to be pushing back towards 26, 27, 28[%], and we’re only going to do it by having conversations with our neighbors and physically being present,” Schoemann said. “I can tell you you’re going to get sick of seeing me because I will be back again and again and again. I want to hear from you what this state needs to be. I want to hear from you what direction the state needs to go.”
Schoemann then took questions from the audience.
One attendee asked about what he would do about property taxes. Local communities across the state have been strapped for funds in recent years due to restrictions in the ways that they can raise revenue with many turning to raising property taxes through referendums to help afford services.
“How many of you live in the city of Madison? How are you liking that new referendum for the school district and the city — one-two punch?” Schoemann replied. He added that property tax rates in Washington Co. are low because of decisions he’s made. He said that at times when they have “considered alternatives where we needed additional resources, we go to the people and ask.” 
The county went  to referendum in 2024 to help prevent cuts to its public safety services. While the referendum failed, a deal on shared revenue and a local sales tax for Milwaukee that  lawmakers and Gov. Tony Evers made helped the county avoid the cuts. 
That deal led to a back and forth over social media between Schoemann and Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson after Schoemann took a jab at the city because of the tax. Milwaukee leaders were prominent advocates in helping secure the state funding, which has helped communities across the state, including Washington County.
Banning ‘Democracy in the Park,’ encouraging early voting
In response to a question about elections, Schoemann said that he believes in purging voter rolls, banning voting events including ‘Democracy in the Park” — a COVID-era effort held by the city of Madison where poll workers picked up absentee ballots from voters who dropped them off  — and having “significant election integrity” measures. He also talked about promoting early voting in more rural areas. 
“The clerks are part time, most of them work out of their houses. They don’t have an office at the town hall… In those places. If you want to have in-person absentee voting, you have to schedule an appointment at the home of the clerk. In Madison and in Milwaukee… the convenience level is through the roof right now,” Schoemann said. “It’s not quite seven days a week, 24 hours a day for those 13 days, but it isn’t far either, especially as compared to those towns.” 
Schoemann said his county sought to incentivize local municipal workers to add in-person absentee voting days and times by paying them 150% of the cost. He said the state needs to “completely transform how we think about elections in Wisconsin.” 
Schoemann segued to criticizing Evers for his relationship with lawmakers and the number of bills he has vetoed, saying changes in law need to come as the result of the governor working as a “coequal” branch with the Legislature. He said that the governor should work with bills before outright vetoing them.
“The fact that this governor doesn’t have the leadership capability to walk down the hallway and talk to legislative leaders is an embarrassment to our state,” Schoemann said, referring to communication difficulties between lawmakers and Evers, who are currently negotiating the next state budget.
Schoemann said that he wouldn’t want to “throw money” to help address education problems, though he thinks the system currently in place is outdated. He also said that he would seek to help change the veto power that governors have. 
This will be the first time Schoemann runs in a statewide election. He promised the room that no one would “outwork” him. 
“There might be more money. There might be worse press, there might be all kinds of things, but no one will outwork me,” Schoemann said.
In the weeks before deciding to run, Schoemann told the room that he asked his wife if she was sure she wanted him to run. 
“You know what she said to me?” Schoemann asked. “‘Well, can’t be worse than Iraq.’”

It's not happening here, but critics want to make sure it doesn't.","New Jersey lawmakers are considering banning octopus farming. Supporters say it is cruel to octopuses and breeds germs that threaten public health, while critics in the seafood industry complain it would hurt their business. (Image courtesy of the NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research, 2013 Northeast U.S. Canyons Expedition)Aquaculture farmers in New Jersey grow everything from clams and oysters to trout, bass, and other fish popular with sport anglers.
They don’t farm octopuses. Several state lawmakers want to keep it that way and now are pushing legislation that would ban businesses from raising octopuses in captivity to sell as seafood.
Washington and California already have such bans in place. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-Rhode Island) introduced a bill last summer in Congress that would have enacted a national ban, but it failed to advance. The only known octopus farm in the U.S., in Hawaii, shut down in 2023 after years of advocacy by animal rights activists, and a plan to farm octopuses in Spain has also drawn opposition.
In Trenton Thursday, the Senate’s economic growth committee heard testimony on a bill that also would prohibit businesses from selling, possessing, or transporting farmed octopuses, with violators facing fines of up to $1,000 a day. They did not vote on the measure, with committee chair and bill sponsor Sen. Nilsa Cruz-Perez saying she would use public feedback to improve the bill.
Most of those who testified urged the committee to enact a ban, calling octopus farming cruel because octopuses are intelligent creatures who feel pain and stress.
They’re escape artists, too, so farming them threatens the broader ecosystem and its wildlife, as well as public health, should they break out of captivity, said Kerrie Espuga, New Jersey state director of the Animal Rights Initiative. They’re voracious carnivores and consequently create a lot of waste, she added.
“Wastewater from such facilities can spread harmful pathogens and parasites, which are transmissible to humans. Since octopuses are immune to vaccines, the farms could turn into pathogen incubators,” Espuga said.
Brian Hackett of the Associated Humane Societies seconded concerns about public health and the environment.
“Anytime an animal is factory-farmed, where mass numbers of animals are confined in a tiny space, given tons of antibiotics to prevent them from getting sick because they’re in disgusting conditions very close to one another, it’s a very bad situation for human health, environmental health, animal welfare, all things considered,” Hackett said.
The bill’s critics complained that a ban is pointless.
“Why are we passing a law now to ban something which isn’t even happening in the state of New Jersey?” said Scot Mackey of the Garden State Seafood Association, which represents more than 1,200 commercial fishermen.
Aquaculture is “the future of seafood production in the United States,” Mackey said. Banning octopus farming would be another restriction on an already overregulated industry, he added.
He reminded legislators of other sea creatures they’ve protected from commercial fishing, including striped bass, horseshoe crabs, and shark fins.
“Slowly and surely, we are dying, the commercial fishing industry, from the death of 1,000 cuts,” Mackey said. “As we continue down these paths of setting up these special rules and closing down these doors and windows of opportunity, you’re just making it harder and harder for hard-working people to make a living in the state of New Jersey.”
Hackett pushed back on that claim.
“Nothing in this bill would impact the Garden State Seafood Association from catching wild-caught octopus,” he said.
Kathleen Schatzmann of the Animal Legal Defense Fund said a ban is needed, even though octopus farming isn’t happening here, “to prohibit rolling out the red carpet for such an industry before there is an economic tie to this industry.”
“There’s research being done on octopus farming, but there is no viable way to farm octopus, and that’s why we want to ensure that big companies and those corporations do not come to New Jersey to try to get a foothold on this industry,” Schatzmann said.
The measure was one of two the committee considered Thursday that touch on animal welfare. They advanced another bill that would ban the surgical declawing of cats.
Supporters said these surgeries hurt cats and can cause long-term disabilities, with one likening it to an amputation. They also can drive declawed cats to resort to biting in self-defense, leading cat owners to surrender their pets to animal shelters, Hackett said.
A veterinarian opposed to the bill testified that pets’ medical care should be decided by pet owners and veterinarians, not legislators.
The Assembly versions of both the octopus farming and cat declawing bills have yet to be heard by any committee.

Kelda Roys, holding her toddler, speaks about legislation Democrats are proposing to provide ongoing funding for child care providers. (Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic lawmakers are circulating a draft bill to extend the soon-to-end state child care support program and fund it with $480 million that was stripped from the 2025-27 state budget.
The proposed legislation follows action earlier this month by Republican lawmakers to remove child care support and more than 600 other items that Gov. Tony Evers included in his draft budget.
Both Evers’ proposal and the Democrats’ bill aim to continue support that child care providers have been receiving since 2020 as part of federal pandemic relief.
“This funding has been essential in continuing successful programs that support our early educators, child care providers, parents, and most importantly, our kids,” said state Rep. Alex Joers (D-Middleton) at a Capitol news conference Thursday announcing the legislation.
The $20 million that Wisconsin paid out each month to providers through mid-2023 “kept our early educators in the workforce, held tuition down for parents and provided a direct investment in our children during the most crucial years of their childhood development,” Joers said.
Payments were cut to $10 million a month in June 2023, and the last of those funds will be paid out by early July.
“But with this impending deadline, child care providers and early educators are faced with the impossible decision to either raise rates or have to close altogether,” Joers said. “Without assurance of this funding lifeline, many have already made that decision and have devastatingly shut their doors forever.”
Citing recent reports, Joers said that there are 48,000 children on waiting lists for child care in Wisconsin. In a survey of providers, 78% said they would have to raise fees for infant care — the most expensive age group in most child care programs.
“Altogether, if nothing changes, parents are looking at having to find an additional up to $2,600 in their yearly budget,” Joers said.
First-term Sen. Sarah Keyeski (D-Lodi), the lead state Senate author on the legislation, said that when she was running for office last year, voters repeatedly shared their concerns about the cost and scarcity of child care.
“We have historically undervalued and underpaid child care and early education professionals,” Keyeski said. “This is no longer tenable.”
She described the plight of one constituent who had to change providers three times after the first and then the second provider went out of business because of financial difficulties or other constraints. The mother told her that her current provider — the third — had rates that are “at the top” of what the family could afford.
Keyeski said the provider has told the woman that unless the state can continue with its support, the center’s rates will go up $40 a week, or $160 a month. For the couple, “this increase is unsustainable,” she said. “Her family is left wondering, what to do next?”
Wisconsin’s rural communities have been especially hard hit, she added: In 70% of them, there are three or more children for every child care opening.
“In my district alone, over 34,000 children need care, but there are only about 26,000 available slots,” Keyeski said.
Child care should be viewed as essential infrastructure, said state Rep. Renuka Mayadev (D-Madison).
“And as a state, we support infrastructure. We maintain roads, we maintain bridges. Why is funding childcare such a fight?” Mayadev said.
Wages of less than $14 an hour are driving child care workers out of the field, she added. “There is no other industry where such high value work is being done at such dismal low wages.”
Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) — accompanied by her toddler son before she took him to his child care provider near the Capitol — said the legislation calls for $480 million in state funds over the next two years.
“But I think the real question is what it will cost the state if we don’t do it,” Roys said. She forecast “continued massive closures” of child care centers.
“Already over 60% of child care providers have classrooms sitting empty or slots that can’t be filled because they don’t have the teachers to fill them,” she added.
Roys said child care was a critical need in order for the state to address persistent shortages of people to fill jobs.
“In critical areas like public safety, in K-12 education, in health care — what is it going to mean if the parents of even more kids can’t get child care?” Roys said. “We can’t afford that. We have to make this investment.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250522_094444-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

Sen. Lummis and state lawmakers work, across the aisle, to encourage innovation while protecting consumers who invest in one type of cryptocurrency, writes Sen. Rothfuss and Rep. Singh.
The post Wyoming’s bipartisan leadership on digital assets is a model for the nation appeared first on WyoFile .","A recent WyoFile opinion piece by Kerry Drake offered commentary about the GENIUS Act, bipartisan federal legislation designed to provide regulatory clarity for stablecoins. While we always welcome thoughtful discussions about digital asset policy, Drake’s piece contained inaccuracies about the legislation’s current status and Wyoming’s ongoing bipartisan efforts.

Opinion

Since 2018, Wyoming’s Select Committee on Blockchain, Financial Technology and Digital Innovation Technology has approached digital assets with a clear and consistent vision: to regulate in a way that enables innovation rather than restricts it, while ensuring robust protection for consumers and financial markets. Our simple, but impactful, goal has been to encourage responsible innovation, protect everyday users and firmly position Wyoming as a national leader in financial technology.
This approach has yielded significant results. Wyoming is recognized internationally for its progressive, clear and responsible digital asset legislation, having passed more than 35 bipartisan laws covering everything from decentralized autonomous organizations to digital identity and custodial standards. Our state has proven government can work effectively and cooperatively to foster innovation while safeguarding the public interest.
U.S. Sen. Cynthia Lummis has been instrumental in advancing this bipartisan model at the federal level. She has worked closely for years with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, forging a rare and effective cross-party partnership focused on building a responsible digital asset framework for the nation. She has championed the GENIUS Act, which stands for Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins. The law would implement a comprehensive federal regulatory framework for stablecoins. These digital assets are designed to serve as a means of payment and maintain a stable value relative to a fixed amount of national currency. 
Sen. Lummis’ legislative approach mirrors Wyoming’s proven strategy: regulate to enable rather than restrict, balancing innovation with robust consumer protections.
The GENIUS Act itself is not about political posturing or partisan fights. Instead, it seeks to provide clarity and consumer protection in a sector — currently resembling “the bad part” of the old Wild West — that’s confusing, inconsistent and potentially risky. Clear regulatory guidelines at the federal level are essential if we want to avoid stifling innovation or leaving American consumers vulnerable.
Some have suggested that the GENIUS Act’s progress hinges on the support of Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat. It’s important to clarify that she was not directly involved in the negotiations surrounding this legislation and has consistently expressed opposition to digital asset frameworks of any kind. The reality is that there is no version of a stablecoin bill that would earn her support. That’s why bipartisan efforts like those between Lummis and Gillibrand are so critical — they reflect a genuine commitment to thoughtful policymaking rather than ideological opposition.
Despite assertions to the contrary, the GENIUS Act recently advanced through the Senate with substantial bipartisan support on a 66-32 vote, thanks to Lummis’ determined bipartisan negotiations. Wyoming’s leadership on digital asset regulation serves as a positive example of effective governance. This work is not about partisanship but about partnership, demonstrating how lawmakers from both sides of the aisle can deliver real solutions. Our collaborative efforts in the Wyoming Legislature, alongside Lummis’ leadership in Washington, show that Republicans and Democrats can navigate complex issues together, crafting policies that protect consumers, foster innovation and strengthen America’s position in the global digital economy.
In a time when cooperation seems increasingly rare, Wyoming’s approach illustrates what can be accomplished when lawmakers prioritize solutions over politics. We are proud to continue this bipartisan tradition and remain committed to making Wyoming a beacon of responsible, innovative governance in the digital asset space.

Moose, turkey, antelope and pheasant were among the delicacies highlighted at the Wild Game Cookoff in Lander.

Not so at the Wyoming Wildlife Federation’s Wild Game Cookoff. At this annual culinary competition in Lander, amateur chefs push the boundaries with exotic techniques and innovative combinations to showcase the harvested game in all sorts of unexpected ways. 
Here was moose, slow roasted for eight hours in a smoky chile and spice brine before being griddled in a soft taco with melted cheese and topped with avocado crema, pickled onions and cilantro. Dean Christianson, who was handing out plates, made sure eaters had containers of extra consommé for sopping up. Anders Christianson of team Kifaru International was forking out the tender meat of the bull he had harvested in Alaska and braised all day. 
Elsewhere, elk meatballs encased in rice were fried like the Italian delight Arancini — using cast iron skillets over an open-air cook stove for a chuck-wagon twist. These were dipped in chokecherry mayonnaise and washed down with chokecherry wine. Austin Chase of team Wild Iris had gathered the chokecherries and harvested the elk.

Maven, an outdoor gear company that also sponsored a team, had put out a staff call to contribute wild game for the event. The resulting mixture of pheasant, elk, antelope, and other game meat was chopped up and fried in the Japanese karaage style, and participants were served the crispy morsels with a squirt of Kewpie mayonnaise and pickled vegetables tart enough to cut through the richness. 
The Wild Turkey Federation, which kept it classic with savory turkey, elk and veggie kabobs charred just so and served alongside chokecherry chipotle sauce, won the judge’s choice for a simple recipe done exactly right.
And the people’s choice award? That honor went to Kifaru’s moose tacos. 
They were savory and satisfying on their own. Dipped in the rich consommé? Undeniable.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., running for his first full six-year term in 2026, is getting early outside ad support from Senate Republicans that shows he and the party are taking a potential matchup with registered nonpartisan labor leader Dan Osborn seriously.
One Nation, the best-known advertising arm of the Senate GOP’s Super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, is announcing a seven-figure digital ad buy on Ricketts’ behalf Friday, the Examiner has learned. It’s starting with a positive ad.
Chris Gustafson, communications director for One Nation, touted Ricketts’ “long and trusted record” of results in Lincoln and Washington, D.C., where Ricketts is already making waves as a major fundraiser for the Senate GOP.
The Ricketts record

The online ad unveiled this week reminds Republicans and others about the Legislature’s push while he was governor to remove income taxes from Social Security income and of his federal push to do the same with President Donald Trump.
It’s noteworthy in part because it appears aimed at shoring up Ricketts on Social Security, because Osborn, who made Ricketts’ senior colleague, U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., sweat in a close 2024 race is mulling a 2026 bid against Ricketts.
Osborn relentlessly hammered Fischer and congressional Republicans for doing too little to protect Social Security and has said he would make sure that the benefits were protected from potential budget cuts. He campaigned on the issue.
It’s also interesting because Fischer drew criticism from national Republicans for waiting too late in the race to spend money attacking and defining Osborn. She  eventually sought help from Senate Republicans to beat him back with outside ads.
Gustafson and other people familiar with the race agreed that Senate Republicans are willing to be more aggressive sooner in the Osborn race than is typical for a GOP-led state. Political observers saw it as a sign to donors to get and stay engaged. 
The Osborn threat
Osborn has shown the ability to raise funds, having raised and spent nearly $15 million against Fischer, according to OpenSecrets.org. But Ricketts is a prolific fundraiser, too. His family owns the Chicago Cubs, and his political team has a cut-throat reputation.

Ricketts’ campaign team had no immediate comment on the ad buy. Osborn is still building his campaign apparatus. But when Fischer needed outside help, Osborn said it was a sign the millionaires and billionaires were paying attention.
Fischer and many Republicans have criticized Osborn for taking money from Senate Democrats and major Democratic donors funded through normal PACs and dark money groups — and then calling himself nonpartisan.
She called him a Democrat in sheep’s clothing. Osborn has denied being part of either party, pointing to his registration and willingness to hear people out. He has said he’s more focused on the needs of working people than their political beliefs. 
Why Ricketts is running again
Ricketts is known for cutting spending and taxes at the state level. He focused much of his time as governor on remaking processes for applying for government help to boost response times. Critics have said he slashed too much.
In Congress, he has been a reliable Republican vote. He has said his goal is to bring the same approach he brought to Lincoln to Washington, D.C., saying that the federal government could be run leaner and more efficiently.
In November, Ricketts won a special election to the final two years of former Republican U.S. Sen. Ben Sasse’s term after Gov. Jim Pillen appointed him to the office initially. He agreed to run again as part of the appointment process.

The ban related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was announced Monday during a daylong visit to the Cornhusker state by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins. […],"Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins at a stop in Nebraska Monday signed what she called a “historic” waiver to ban Nebraska recipients of SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) from using the public grocery aid to buy soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. (Courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture)LINCOLN — Nebraska has become the first state in the nation to restrict low-income recipients of public grocery aid from using SNAP benefits to buy soda and energy drinks.
The ban related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program was announced Monday during a daylong visit to the Cornhusker state by U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins.
Rollins, accompanied by Gov. Jim Pillen on her three-stop tour, was following through on a request Pillen had made earlier. She said the waiver she signed while in Fremont was the first approved by the USDA. It becomes effective Jan. 1.
Pillen, in a news conference last month, said he planned to submit a request for the federal waiver to remove the drink items he describes as unhealthy “junk.”
‘First of its kind’
“There’s absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,” said Pillen.
Rollins called the move “historic” and, in a statement, called Pillen a pioneer, along with the governors of six other states, in improving health in the nation. The waiver amends the definition of food products to be purchased by SNAP benefits, excluding soda, soft drinks, and energy drinks.
“Today’s waiver to remove soda and energy drinks from SNAP is the first of its kind, and it is a historic step to Make America Healthy Again,” Rollins said, adopting the phrasing popularized by the Trump administration’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Rollins’ visit and approval of the move came the same day the Nebraska Legislature upheld a Pillen veto of a bill that sought to lift a lifetime ban on SNAP benefits for some Nebraskans with past drug felonies.
Morrisey formally requests WV’s food stamp program no longer pay for soda

Both measures received instant criticism from nonprofits that work low-income families and inmates reentering their communities.
Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed, said SNAP is designed to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping low-paid people buy groceries. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaiano said.
About 150,000 Nebraskans, or about 7.5% of the state’s population, participate in SNAP, including seniors, children, people with disabilities, working families and veterans. Nebraska Appleseed said the average SNAP benefit received in the state is about $5.82 per person per day.
Savaiano, in a statement, said research shows SNAP recipients buy the same things as everyone else, including soda, soft drinks and energy drinks. “By targeting just SNAP participants, we’re poverty-shaming the most vulnerable among us and adding complications to an already complicated system.”
He said carrying out the restriction would cause extra expenses to grocers, and he worried that could cause smaller stores to stop serving SNAP recipients altogether, and possibly shut off options in some rural areas.
‘Nothing nutritious’
Pillen said SNAP is to help families in need get “healthy food into their diets” and that there is “nothing nutritious” about the drinks to be ruled out under the waiver.
“We have to act because we can’t keep letting Nebraskans starve in the midst of plenty,” Pillen said.
Also with Rollins and Pillen during the Nebraska ag tour was Sherry Vinton, director of Nebraska’s Department of Agriculture and U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb.
The group stopped at the Cargill Bioscience 650-acre facility in Blair, Wholestone Farms in Fremont and the Ohnoutka Family Farm in Valparaiso.

Bill Lee over his veto of a bill expanding the authority of parole boards. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A move to override Gov. Bill Lee’s first veto is crumbling.
Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican who sponsored the bill that Lee vetoed in early May, told the Tennessee Lookout this week he will not pursue an override on the bill expanding authority of the Board of Parole and Probation to deny inmates’ requests.
Rose said he spoke with the parole board and was assured it has the authority to deny based on the “severity” of the crime.
“Somebody else may pick it up, but I do not plan to,” Rose said. “I don’t plan to die on that hill. Not that I’m expecting to die, but it’s just not one I want to fight.”
The West Tennessee lawmaker who consistently backs conservative legislation notified the Tennessee District Attorneys General Conference this week he would not seek to override the measure it brought to him for passage.
Rose could hand the measure to Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County. But Taylor told the Lookout he wants to consult with the Governor’s Office and the House sponsor, Republican Rep. Rick Scarbrough of Oak Ridge,  before making a decision. Taylor indicated that Lee might have a different view of the bill than the legislature, which passed it with little, if any, debate.
  “I don’t plan to die on that hill. Not that I’m expecting to die, but it’s just not one I want to fight,” said Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican who will not be urging an override of Gov. Bill Lee’s veto of a parole bill. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
Scarborough, a former Clinton police chief in his first legislative term, said immediately after the governor’s veto that he would work toward an override, which requires only a simple majority vote of both houses.
But Sen. Todd Gardenhire, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, predicted an override would fail if it does come before the Senate. 
Gardenhire added that it’s not the right fight to take to the governor, even if he has only a year remaining in his second term.
This doesn’t appear to reflect a rift, either, between the governor and legislature on law-and-order bills, even though they’ve had their share of disagreements. Instead, it stems from frustration within the DAs Conference that the governor would veto its bill. 
The conference released a fiery statement in the wake of Lee’s veto condemning his decision and calling the move “dangerous” for Tennesseans.
DAs Conference Executive Director Steve Crump gave a statement in response to questions: “We are aware of Sen. Rose’s position. We remain committed to expanding the Parole Board’s authority in a way that supports rehabilitation while affirming the seriousness of crime. We are already in conversations with Sen. Taylor and are open to all options in pursuit of the passage of this bill. 
The measure expands the number of offenses for which the parole board can refuse to grant parole, from 22 to about 50.” 
Maybe they’re not accustomed to losing.
But senators felt the missive went overboard in attacking the governor on an obscure bill that isn’t likely to have a major impact on the criminal justice system and protecting victims.
What bid-rigging?
The legislature’s Fiscal Review Committee, acting on advice from Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti, opted to postpone bids for six months for two contracts totaling $1 billion in mental health and health services for the Department of Correction.
New litigation filed by Wexford Health Source drove the delay, although few people expect the matter to be resolved by November.
The state awarded a contract to a company called Centurion Health even though one of its former officials pleaded guilty in connection with big-rigging accusations when a state official provided information to a company officer during bidding for a state contract.
Democratic Sen. Heidi Campbell of Nashville was the lone vote against extending contracts with Centurion in Wednesday’s Fiscal Review meeting.
“It’s absolutely indefensible that we are going to re-up a contract with a provider that has been big-rigging and had all kinds of issues with the service and is involved in a lawsuit, and this whole thing has been done with the recommendation of the AG,” Campbell told the Lookout. “It’s not only bad advice, it’s malpractice.”
The Department of Correction accepted contract offers from Wexford, which is represented by state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, and YesCare over the past year but held those up when Centurion protested. Wexford is challenging the decision with a lawsuit.
Visual analysis: Centene’s push in Tenn. comes as settlements with other states for fraud pile up

Prison contractor Corizon also sued the state in 2021 claiming the state and Centurion officials conspired in the bidding. At the same time, the Department of Correction raised the performance bond on mental health services to $118 million from $1 million, making it harder for Corizon and small companies to win state bids, according to the filing.
The bid-rigging lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice in early 2022.
Centurion was previously connected to Centene, a company that tried to persuade state lawmakers to pass legislation enabling it to obtain a TennCare contract for managed care after it failed to win a contract bid. 
House Speaker Cameron Sexton co-sponsored the bill, saying more “openness” was needed in TennCare contracting.
Former Democratic Rep. Jason Hodges of Clarksville called it a case of “bid-rigging.”
That mean green
In case anyone was wondering whether Tennessee parents and students would go for the $7,300 the state is offering with a new program for private-school vouchers, the proof is in the bank.
The Department of Education said this week it received more than 38,000 applications for the money, which can go toward 20,000 students this coming school year, followed by annual expansions. Of those, 18,852 applications were for kids who qualify based on income, at or below 300% of the federal lunch program, which would be about $173,000 for a family of four, while 19,300 were for “universal scholarships.” 
In other words, half the vouchers are to go toward those poor souls pinching pennies at close to $175 grand a year.
Lawmakers who argued for the vouchers said they hoped to help the single mother with two children to put her kids into a better school, proof that they have no faith in public schools or the children who attend them.

But this isn’t designed for poor people. 
During the governor’s bill-signing ceremony, he was backed by students wearing their private-school colors, not the poor, downtrodden kids whose mother is working 70 hours a week to put food on the table.
The program is slated to cost about $400 million next year and escalate to $1.1 billion in five years, Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons says, calling Gov. Lee’s program “a scam that will harm students, de-fund public education and expedite our state’s impending budget crisis.”
Lee and Republican lawmakers have continually defended the concept by saying students shouldn’t be stuck in failing schools because of their ZIP code. 
Here’s the question, though: Are the schools failing the kids or is the state failing the schools? Or are the students just failing to crack a book? The more lawmakers get involved in education, the worse it gets.
No shocker here
House Democratic Caucus Leader Karen Camper issued a blistering rebuke of AG Skrmetti this week, accusing him of “a breach of trust” that eroded his credibility in regard to absorbing Tennessee Human Rights Commission employees.
Lawmakers voted this year to merge the commission, which is designed to protect people from discrimination, into the AG’s Office. But at what cost?
The commission has been in place since the early 1960s. But lawmakers said it wasn’t doing what it was supposed to do, so they turned the politically independent agency over to Skrmetti, who has proven to be a bit partisan.
Tennessee legislature puts state watchdog agency under attorney general

Camper said in her letter that Skrmetti told her the 30 employees were to be absorbed into other state agencies to continue protecting people from discrimination. The Nashville Banner reported that they initially were told they’d be laid off July 1 but then were given a week to prep resumes and reapply for their jobs.
The report led Camper to say Skrmetti could be remembered “as the one who dismantled a vital institution and misled those trying to protect it” or one who “corrected course and chose to stand on the side of fairness, truth and the people of this state.”
The AG’s Office didn’t respond Thursday to a Lookout request for comment.
Talk about a switch
When Republican Rep. Andrew Farmer introduced a bill on the House floor this year to ban Glock switches, Democratic lawmakers hooted at him. 
They’d been trying to pass a similar bill for years, and Democratic Rep. Antonio Parkinson of Memphis made the point that their legislation was getting hijacked.
Regardless, Farmer moved on with the measure, enabling Republicans to take credit for a new gun control law signed by Gov. Lee. Speaker Sexton and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson sponsored the bill.
Moms Demand Action and Everytown for Gun Safety issued a statement this week commending them for joining a bipartisan movement supported by law enforcement.
Glock switches allow handguns to be converted into illegal fully automatic machine guns with after-market tools. They’ve been used in multiple mass shootings, including one in Memphis, according to the group.
Lawmakers could have done this two years ago in the wake of the Covenant School mass shooting that claimed six lives. But for some odd reason, they waited until few people were paying attention and passed it in the waning days of this year’s session when everyone was torn up about immigrant students and a Memphis school takeover.
Some would call that odd.
“Let me up, I’ve had enough”
The Tennessee Journal reports that former Sen. Brian Kelsey will have his state pension renewed after President Donald Trump pardoned him for a federal campaign finance conviction. 
This is great news for Tennessee taxpayers, coinciding with musician John Rich’s request for the president to pardon Cade Cothren, recently convicted on 19 counts in a political kickback scheme, with former House Speaker Glen Casada. Rich says in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Cothren was persecuted by the FBI and faces 20 years in prison for a “false, TN State, minor infraction.” Nevermind the mountain of evidence prosecutors presented showing he tried to cover up his involvement in Phoenix Solutions to tap into state funds and campaign and Republican Caucus money. 

I have personally advocated to @realDonaldTrump to pardon @CadeCothren who was targeted by Biden’s DOJ, persecuted by the FBI and other agencies, and is now facing 20 years in prison for what amounts to a false, TN State, minor infraction. See his story below and pls repost: https://t.co/IBiH2WsbGw
— John Rich (@johnrich) May 21, 2025
Caucus Chairman Jeremy Faison joined the fray, saying the pair was found guilty by “an impartial jury.” Faison drew a response from Cothren’s girlfriend, Ava Korby, who called him everything but sliced bread and said he got his talking points from the person who makes sure he keeps his post, an apparent allusion to Speaker Cameron Sexton.
Cothren had to promise the judge he would keep his nose clean and avoid text battles in order to remain free on bond until his Sept. 12 sentencing. It’s not clear whether this violates his word, but it could fall into the questionable category.
Likewise, the president might not have realized he set a precedent when he pardoned the people involved in the Jan. 6 insurgency at the Capitol who were responsible for the deaths of multiple police officers. 
If he lets them off the hook, he has little choice but to do the same with any political ally convicted of a lesser crime. But the bigger question is: Why do we have a justice system anymore if the president keeps letting felons go free on a whim? Just make him judge, jury and executioner, or have we already?

(Wesley Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Tensions are escalating at the State Capitol as a legislative package that attempts to lower auto insurance costs in Louisiana nears its final stage of approval.    
On Wednesday, the Senate advanced six of the more controversial insurance measures in a floor session that lasted late into the night. The debate included impassioned floor speeches and a heated clash between two lawmakers, both attorneys who stand on opposite sides of the issue.   
Gov. Jeff Landry has signaled support for the proposals. 
Only one of the bills cleared the chamber with bipartisan support, while the other five passed mostly along party lines with Republicans voting in favor of them and Democrats against. Those five are so-called “tort reform” proposals that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation, making it harder for accident victims to file successful lawsuits. 
Tort reform legislation from previous years has failed to reduce auto insurance rates, though most Republicans, including state Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple, have said those measures were not strong enough.
This lack of results was among the points of contention during Wednesday’s debate on Senate Bill 231, which took up most of the evening before the bill passed in a 27-8 vote. Sponsored by Sen. Mike Reese, R-Leesville, it would effectively reduce the money plaintiffs can recover for medical expenses in an auto accident lawsuit. The amount would be limited to what a plaintiff actually pays for care rather than what doctors and hospitals bill. 
Supporters of Reese’s bill argue it would provide medical billing transparency in personal injury lawsuits and prevent plaintiffs’ attorneys from basing claims on artificially inflated medical bills no one actually pays. 
Opponents argue transparency should apply to both sides. They pointed to a separate tort reform law that allows insurers to hide certain details related to their policyholder’s coverage during a trial. Jurors could lower a monetary award if they believe an individual defendant — rather than an insurance company — will be personally on the hook for paying it, according to their viewpoint.
“Current law allows the plaintiff to lie to the jury, and it does not allow the defendant to tell the truth,” Sen. Alan Seabaugh, R-Shreveport, an attorney whose practice includes insurance defense, said in support of the measure.

Sen. Jay Luneau, D-Alexandria, took issue over what he called Seabaugh’s “ambush-type” strategy to tack on a late-hour amendment to Reese’s bill that other senators had no time to review. 
Luneau, a personal injury lawyer, said the amended bill was being rushed because Seabaugh had a conflicting court date Tuesday, when the Senate convenes next after a long Memorial Day holiday.  
Standing at the Senate floor lectern within a foot of each other, Luneau and Seabaugh got into an exchange that quickly grew intense.
Seabaugh said the amendment, which was eventually adopted, requires judges and juries to be shown both the amount paid and the amount billed for medical expenses in auto injury cases, but confusion ensued over its text. The Republican senator, defending his amendment, said that Luneau, himself, had requested the provision. 
When Luneau denied this and offered to withdraw the purported request, Seabaugh, in a raised voice, accused Luneau of lying.
“You were pounding the table, saying ‘Let’s tell the jury everything. Let’s let them see the billed amount,’” Seabaugh said, pausing but drawing no response from Luneau. “You are just gonna come up here and blatantly bald-faced lie, and I’m not surprised.”
The accusation drew quick intervention from Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and prompted Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Louis Carral Jr. to swiftly approach the lectern, prepared to physically separate the two men.  
“Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Guys, guys, come on!” Henry told the two senators. “There’s a certain amount of decorum that we expect to have in the Senate. Y’all need to relax.” 
The amendment actually would have allowed defendants to try to lower jury awards following a trial
Later, Luneau delivered a lengthy speech against the bill, so long that he appeared to be mounting a filibuster to delay a vote. But he ultimately ceded the floor after detailing his comprehensive argument against tort reform. 
Luneau cited data from the Louisiana Department of Insurance that shows there are more than 100 auto insurance companies in Louisiana, countering arguments that more insurers are needed in the state to create competition. Overall, they received $5.9 billion in premiums and paid out $3.4 billion in claims and losses, the date shows.
The five largest auto insurers in the state — State Farm, Progressive, Geico, Allstate and GoAuto — control 70% of the market, according to state data Luneau shared. 
“This is a bad bill,” Luneau said. “It’s going to take money away from people who are legitimately injured, and it’s not going to reduce automobile insurance rates. And we’ll be right back here again with people screaming about the next round of tort reform we need to do.”
Reese’s bill next heads to the House for consideration. 
Rate history disclosure
Only one of the five proposals, House Bill 148, sponsored by Rep. Jeff Wiley, R-Maurepas, received bipartisan support. Republicans counted for all of the no votes in the 26-9 outcome. 
Wiley’s proposal would require homeowner and auto insurance companies to show customers what they paid previously for coverage when sending out renewal notices. It would let customers see whether their rates have changed before they decide to extend their policy.
The bill would also give the state insurance commissioner power to strike down any insurance rate increase considered “excessive” or unreasonably high. Temple has lobbied against this provision, arguing it would force him to choose between rates based on real market conditions and the perception that he’s lowering rates to improve his reelection chances.
Senate Republicans weakened the provision Wednesday when they inserted language into Wiley’s bill that could let Temple approve excessively high rates as long as an insurer shows that they weren’t chosen arbitrarily or randomly.
Gov. Landry’s approach to lower insurance rates could cast his political fate

Another amendment to Wiley’s bill allows the public to review documents insurance companies file with the state when seeking a rate increase, but only if the insurance commissioner determines the information shouldn’t be kept confidential as a proprietary trade secret.
The measure will return to the House for a final vote on amendments before heading to the governor’s desk.
Other insurance legislation the Senate approved included:
House Bill 450, by Rep. Michael Melerine, R-Shreveport, would end the Housley presumption, a standard of evidence explained in a 1991 Louisiana Supreme Court ruling that applies to auto accidents, medical malpractice and other injury lawsuits. In a nutshell, the Housley presumption says courts should assume a plaintiff’s injuries resulted from the accident in question if they were in good health beforehand. 
The bill received final approval in a 28-9 vote and awaits Gov. Landry’s signature. 
House Bill 434, sponsored by Rep. Jason DeWitt, R-Alexandria, would limit bodily injury claims by plaintiffs who did not carry auto insurance at the time of the accident. It would forbid them from recovering as much as $100,000 worth of damages.    
The bill received final approval in a 28-9 vote and has been sent to the governor. 
House Bill 431, sponsored by Rep. Emily Chenevert, R-Baton Rouge, would change Louisiana’s comparative fault statute, which assigns a percentage of blame to each party in an accident and allows for the recovery of damages in proportion with those percentages. 
Proponents argue comparative fault allows someone to recover damages for injuries sustained in accidents for which they are mostly at fault. Opponents say it is the fairest way to assign liability. 
Under current law, if a court finds one party in a lawsuit is 60% at fault for an accident and the other party is 40% at fault, they would each be liable for their respective share of the damages and could file claims against each other for the remaining amounts. Under Chenevert’s bill, anyone who is 51% or more at fault for an accident would get nothing. 
The bill passed in a 28-9 vote and will return to the House for changes made in the Senate.
House Bill 436, by Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, would prohibit “unauthorized aliens” — defined in the measure as individuals illegally in the United States under federal immigration law — who are injured in car accidents from receiving compensation for pain, suffering and lost income. The proposal would still allow recovery for property damages and medical expenses. Auto insurance companies could still sell policies to unauthorized immigrants.
It cleared the chamber in a 27-10 vote and will return to the House for a vote on Senate amendments.

Veterans Day in the United States honors those who have served in the nation's military and also coincides with the anniversary of the conclusion of hostilities on the western front in World War I.  (Win McNamee/Getty Images)Our soldiers have endured unimaginable hardships and faced profound challenges, testing the very limits of human resilience and strength. When they arrive home, the trauma many veterans experience abroad comes with them, and the toll it takes on their mental health can be devastating without intervention. Veterans will face additional challenges if promises of massive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs layoffs around the country and in Idaho go forward. 
Our veterans deserve better. 
Several Americans have protested cuts to the VA. Here in Boise at the VA campus, local community members have supported those protests, demonstrating just how important VA services are to Idaho veterans. Our communities are concerned about access to behavioral health care for our veterans and with good cause. Military veterans are 57.3% more likely to die by suicide than non-veteran U.S. adults. This stark statistic reveals the harsh reality that our service members face, particularly those living in rural areas like many veterans do here in Idaho. Our state has one of the highest rates of rural military populations, and it has a higher rate of VA reliance for health care than the national average. 
The Trump administration aims to cut 83,000 jobs from Veterans Affairs. The VA is tasked with caring for our veterans who return home, it provides crucial medical and behavioral health services including telehealth services for our rural vets. At the Boise VA campus alone, we may lose 300 employees, and this is a VA that already lacks staff for the vets it serves. 
Veterans and active-duty military personnel face unique challenges. Reintegrating into civilian life, Adverse Childhood Experiences (or ACEs) and post-traumatic stress all can contribute to poor mental health outcomes for our nation’s heroes. 
Many veterans shy away from seeking help due to stigma, barriers to care created by the isolation of rural living, or a lack of access to services, but the need is real. Veterans in rural areas often feel most comfortable accessing these services through the VA, a community that knows what they have gone through, specifically telehealth options which can allow access to behavioral health professionals working from home. 
Current changes by the administration have put into question these services, leaving our veterans uncertain about where they might find care in the future. 
Here in Idaho, one of the most pressing issues connected with this uncertainty is the disproportionate suicide rates among service members. Research consistently shows that veterans, especially those living in remote, rural regions — a common way of life in Idaho — are at greater risk of suicide. A lack of accessible mental health services can prevent veterans in need from receiving vital care. 
Furthermore, for patients at risk of suicide continuity of care, including consistent follow-ups with trusted health care providers is critical. Any threat to losing that continuity of care poses a significant danger, it is well known to be a key component of successful strategies to prevent suicide.  
Veterans health care provided by the VA removes barriers to care associated with insurance accessibility and affordability, and in many cases has been offered with telehealth options. However, any health services required outside of the VA falls on the service members to cover. If the VA’s behavioral health services are disrupted in a way that jeopardizes telehealth for rural veterans, it not only creates a crisis in continuity of care but also establishes a significant barrier to access for many low-income veterans.


For more information on the Idaho Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, go to www.idahoafcc.org.


For veterans who are unable to access mental health services through the VA, safety net options such as the Idaho free and charitable clinics are crucial. These clinics are closely monitoring the situation, hoping for continued care and support for our nation’s heroes.
 In the meantime, they can provide health care to any Idahoan without health insurance including our former service members. To ensure the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes, we must advocate for health care and behavioral health care as a basic human need, and work to improve and protect access to these services. 
Veterans and service members deserve the support and care necessary to thrive, both during and after their service.

Evers' Facebook pageAs Republicans in Congress struggle to deliver President Donald Trump’s massive cuts to Medicaid, food assistance, education, health research and just about every other social good you can think of, in order to clear the way for trillions of dollars in tax cuts to the richest people in the U.S., here in Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and state lawmakers are working on the next state budget.
The one thing our Democratic governor and Republican legislative leaders seem to agree on is that we need a tax cut.
After throwing away more than 600 items in Evers’ budget proposal, GOP leggies now say they can’t move forward with their own budget plan until  Evers makes good on his promise to meet with them and negotiate the terms for the tax-cutting that both sides agree they want to do. Evers has expressed optimism that the budget will be done on time this summer, and said the tax cuts need to be part of the budget, not a separate, stand-alone bill. Evers wants a more progressive tax system, with cuts targeted to lower-income people. In the last budget, he opposed expanding the second-lowest tax bracket, which would have offered the same benefits to higher earners as the lower middle class.
But what if we don’t need a tax cut at all?
It has long been an article of faith in the Republican Party that tax cuts are a miracle cure for everything. Trickle-down economics is  a proven failure:  The wealthy and corporations tend to bank their tax cuts rather than injecting the extra money into the economy, as tax-cutters say they will. The benefits of the 2017 tax cuts that Congress is struggling to extend went exclusively to corporations and the very wealthy and failed to trickle down on the rest of us. 
 In the second Trump administration, we are in new territory when it comes to tax cutting. The administration and its enablers are hell-bent on destroying everything from the Department of Education to critical health research to food stamps and Medicaid in order to finance massive tax breaks for the very rich. 
If ever there were a good time to reexamine the tax-cutting reflex, it’s now.
Evers has said he is not willing to consider the Republicans’ stand-alone tax-cut legislation, and that, instead, tax cuts should be part of the state budget. That makes sense, since new projections show lower-than-expected tax revenue even without a cut, and state budget-writers have a lot to consider as we brace for the dire effects of federal budget cuts. The least our leaders can do is not blindly give away cash without even assessing future liabilities.
But beyond that, we need to reconsider the knee-jerk idea that we are burdened with excessive taxes and regulations, that our state would be better off if we cut investments in our schools and universities, our roads and bridges, our clean environment, museums, libraries and other shared spaces and stopped keeping a floor under poor kids by providing basic food and health care assistance. 
Wisconsin Republicans like to tout the list of states produced annually by the Tax Foundation promoting “business friendly” environments that reduce corporate taxes, including Wyoming, South Dakota, Alaska and Florida. They also like to bring up ALEC’s “Rich States, Poor States” report that gave top billing last year to Utah, Idaho and Arizona for low taxes and deregulation. 
What they don’t track when they lift up those states are pollution, low wages and bankrupt public school systems. 
I’m old enough to remember when it was headline news that whole families in the U.S. were living in their cars, when homelessness was a new term, coined during the administration of Ronald Reagan, the father of bogus trickle-down economics and massive cuts to services for the poor. 
Somehow, we got used to the idea that urban parts of the richest nation on Earth resemble the poorest developing countries, with human misery and massive wealth existing side by side in our live-and-let-die economy.
Wisconsin, thanks to its progressive history, managed to remain a less unequal state, with top public schools and a great university system, as well as a clean, beautiful environment and well-maintained infrastructure. But here, too, we have been getting used to our slide to the bottom of the list of states, thanks in large part to the damage done by former Republican Gov. Scott Walker. 
We now rank 44th in the nation for investment in our once-great universities, and the austerity that’s been imposed on higher education is taking a toll across the state. Our consistently highly rated public schools have suffered from a decade and a half of budget cuts that don’t allow districts to keep pace with inflation, and recent state budgets have not made up the gap. 
Now threats to Medicaid, Head Start, AmeriCorps, our excellent library system, UW-Madison research and environmental protections do not bode well for Wisconsin’s future.
In the face of brutal federal cuts, we need to recommit to our shared interest in investing in a decent society, and figure out how to preserve what’s great about our state.
Tax cuts do not make the top of the list of priorities.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo illustration)The Lac du Flambeau (LDF) Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians is offering a reward of $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons responsible for the 1990 murder of Susan “Susie” Poupart, a LDF tribal member.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The tribe has also offered a $25,000 reward for information concerning a tribal member, Melissa Beson, 37, missing since March 17. 
“Poupart was last seen on May 20, 1990, in Lac du Flambeau in Vilas County,” the band stated in a press release issued May 16. “She had left a house party at approximately 4 a.m. on that date and was walking home alone when two men in a car pulled up next to her. Witnesses saw her enter the car but never arrived at her home, and her family reported her missing two days later.”
There was no LDF Tribal Police Department at the time of Poupart’s disappearance, so the Vilas County Sheriff’s Department investigated the case and is still the lead investigative organization.
“Deputies and fire department personnel conducted ground searches for four or five days, hoping to find her alive and return her to her two young children,” said the press release. “Eventually, specially trained tracking dogs were brought in from Minnesota to assist in search efforts, to no avail.”
The release said deer hunters found her remains, along with her purse and tribal ID card six months later, on Nov. 22, 1990. They were found in the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest, about 12 miles from her home. 
“Poupart’s death was determined to be a homicide, and in the decades since her murder, continuous improvements in DNA technology have kept her family’s hopes alive that her murderers will be brought to justice,” the press release states. “Investigators share that hope, as even now they await the results of DNA testing on evidence that was recently sent to sophisticated, high-tech crime laboratories for DNA analysis.”
The release also states that “police believe there are persons who have information that could result in the arrest and conviction of the persons responsible for Susan Poupart’s murder.”.
The tribe’s governing board said it was offering the $25,000 to “incentivize anyone with information relating to Poupart’s murder to come forward.”
The Wisconsin Examiner reached out to LDF Tribal Governing Board Chairman John Johnson to ask why the tribe was now offering a reward after over 35 years, but Johnson did not return phone calls.
Detective Cody Remick of the Vilas County Sheriff’s Department, who was assigned to the case two years ago, said he had heard from Poupart’s daughter that at one time there had been a $10,000 reward for information.
While the cold case is 35 years old, Remick said, his office only recently began working with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Office of Justice Services (OJS) Missing and Murdered Unit.
The only other Wisconsin case the BIA OJS is presently working on is the 1989 murder of Rhys Pocan, a Menomonie tribal member living in Milwaukee. Pocan went missing in August 1989, and her headless body was discovered in September 1989 in Sheboygan County. Later, her head and hands were found in Waukesha County.
Though the press release says DNA is being analyzed, Remick said his office has items it is “preparing for DNA examination” that may lead to a break in the Poupart case.
“It goes without saying that Poupart’s children, now grown, deserve answers in the death of their mother, who was so cruelly taken from them,” said the May 16 press release. “The Lac du Flambeau Tribal Community, too, deserves to know what happened to one of their own. Most important, Poupart deserves justice. She was only 29 years old when she was murdered. She had her whole life in front of her, and her two beloved children to raise. Her killers must answer for their crime, so that Susie can finally rest in peace, and her family and community can begin to heal.”
Anyone with any information regarding the disappearance and murder of Susan Poupart is asked to call the Vilas County Sheriff’s Office at (715) 479-4441 or the Wisconsin Department of Justice at (608) 266-1221 or the Lac du Flambeau Tribal Police Department at (715) 588-7717.
The tribe said the reward will be apportioned as deemed just by the governing board in the event, for example, multiple credible tips are received. Employees of law enforcement and correctional agencies are not eligible to collect the reward.

The first meeting will be from 5 to 7 p.m. Mountain Time Wednesday at the fire hall in Fairfield. The second meeting will be from 5 to 7 p.m. Mountain Time Thursday at the Memorial Hall in Belfield. Both meetings will be an open house format with a formal presentation at 5:30 p.m. Mountain Time.
The meetings will update the expansion of about 31 miles of Highway 85 from Interstate 94 to North Dakota Highway 200. The estimated construction cost is about $290 million.
There is no funding yet for that part of the expansion. Construction would start in 2028 if funding becomes available. 
Watford City is at the north end of the Highway 85 project. The widening project covers about 62 miles of highway in Stark, Billings and McKenzie counties. The south end of the project is at the Interstate 94 interchange near Belfield. 
Crews have already completed replacing the Long X Bridge over the Little Missouri River and widening the section from Watford City to that bridge.
Construction for the section from Highway 200 to the Long X Bridge is to begin in 2026. 
That includes a 6-mile area of the Badlands estimated to cost $95 million. The rest of that segment is estimated to cost about $117 million, which includes a roundabout at the intersection of 85 and 200. 
The Legislature in the recent legislative session approved $150 million for Highway 85. The state also is seeking a $55 million federal grant.

Wes Moore’s veto of the Maryland Reparations Commission bill came as a shock to lawmakers, but they are confident they can override the veto, making it little more than a temporary setback for the initiative.
“We’re not done in getting this bill into a law. That is the ultimately goal, no matter what hurdles are in front of us,” said Delegate Aletheia McCaskill (D-Baltimore County), who sponsored a House version of the measure and helped pass Senate Bill 587, sponsored by Sen.

For advocates around the country, however, the shock is still being felt. They worry what the bill’s troubles in Maryland — a state with a Black governor, a Black attorney general, a Black House Speaker, a Democratic super-majority and a powerful Legislative Black Caucus — portend for their states.
“Gov. Moore needs to realize that he’s not only impacting Maryland, but he’s impacting South Carolina and many other states with the veto,” said South Carolina state Rep. John King, a Democrat from Rock Hill.
The Maryland bill called for the creation of a commission that would assess specific federal, state and local policies from 1877 to 1965, the post-Reconstruction and Jim Crow eras, that “led to economic disparities based on race, including housing, segregation and discrimination, redlining, restrictive covenants, and tax policies.”
The all-volunteer commission would also examine how public and private institutions may have benefited from those policies, and would then recommend appropriate reparations, which could include statements of apology, monetary compensation, social service assistance, business incentives or child care costs.
Unlike previous years, when reparations bills had price tags of $1 million or more, the bill passed this year drew heavily on volunteers and existing resources. It was expected to cost $54,500 in its first year.
In his veto letter, Moore praised the work and the intentions of those behind the bill, but said “now is not the time for another study. Now is the time for continued action that delivers results for the people we serve.”
He cited a number of studies over the past 25 years on the legacy of slavery and promised that his legislative agenda next year would include a package of proposals to “address the barriers that have walled off Black families in Maryland from work, wages and wealth for generations.”
Those justifications appeared to be lost on many advocates, however, who called the veto everything from shocking to a betrayal.

There is no similar effort in South Carolina.
But King expressed his disappointment on his Facebook page Monday, when he called on the South Carolina Democratic Party to rescind an invitation to Moore, who is scheduled to be the featured speaker at the party’s annual Blue Palmetto Dinner on May 30.
Tickets start at $150 for the party’s largest fundraiser of the year, which has featured potential presidential candidates in the past. That includes U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who headlined last year’s dinner with Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia.
In 2019, King was the first South Carolina legislator to endorse Booker for president. (Booker dropped out of the presidential field in January 2020, a month ahead of South Carolina’s then-first-in-the-South primary.)
While Moore has said he’s not running for president, his speech in South Carolina can be seen as a 2028 audition of sorts. On May 31, the day after Moore’s address, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be the keynote speaker at Democrats’ convention in the state that last year held the party’s first presidential primary.
“I will still support [the] governor, if he decided to run for president,” said King, who spent summers in Maryland where his mother grew up in the Baltimore area. But in light of the reparations veto, “I don’t think the timing is right for him to come to South Carolina,” he said in an interview Tuesday.
South Carolina Democratic Party officials did not respond to requests for comment. But as recently as Wednesday, the party sent out emails urging people to buy tickets for the dinner and the chance to “hear from Maryland Governor Wes Moore.”
“Tickets will sell out,” the email said.
King’s colleague, Rep. Annie McDaniel, a Democrat from Fairfield County, said she also disagrees with Moore’s veto.
“I’m not saying whether the governor’s right or wrong. I’m just saying that the way he chose to handle this is not good,” McDaniel said in an interview Tuesday with Maryland Matters. “It’s not good for the plight that African Americans are on now in this state.”
But McDaniel, who chairs the state’s Legislative Black Caucus, also said Moore should attend the Blue Palmetto Dinner and explain himself.
She said she would also like to see an invitation extended to Delegate Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the chair of the Maryland Legislative Black Caucus.
“I think that would be an awesome opportunity,” McDaniel said. “I don’t want the conversation to be one-sided. I believe in fairness. I just think that having her [Wilkins] in the room and having him [Moore] in the room at the same time will give us an opportunity to hear both sides.”
Wilkins declined to comment. A spokesperson for the governor’s office also declined to comment.
 ‘Reparations now’

Moore’s veto Friday was announced hours after he spoke at commencement for the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, one of the state’s four historically Black colleges and universities, and the day before an unrelated reparations rally in Washington, D.C.

The governor’s decision has sparked some conversation on online broadcasts and among civil rights organizations. David Johns, CEO and executive director of the National Black Justice Collective, called the governor’s decision in a statement Tuesday “a betrayal of generational efforts to pursue truth, healing, and repair.”
“As the first Black governor of Maryland, Gov. Moore had an opportunity to lead with moral clarity, political courage, and historical awareness,” Johns said in a statement Tuesday. “Instead, his decision represents a dangerous step backward in the long and necessary march toward racial justice.”
Outside the State House on Tuesday, as the governor was inside for the last bill-signing of the year, a small group of protesters stood on Lawyers Mall, holding signs and chanting: “What do we want? Reparations! When do we want it? Now!” The rally was led by Malik Shabazz, an attorney representing Black Lawyers for Justice, who said the legislature should override Moore’s veto.

“Clearly, the governor’s not for reparations,” Shabazz said to reporters. “And clearly, he’s looking to cut off a study and calculation of an assessment of the damages of what has been done to the people and the constituents of his own state, and that’s unacceptable.”
But Linda Lee Tarver, with the Black conservative organization Project 21, said Wednesday that reparations aren’t the answer to help Black communities.
Tarver, who runs a political consulting business in Lansing, Michigan, agreed with Moore’s veto message that studies have been, and continue to be, done by other organizations.  She referenced her own group’s policy recommendations, which include election integrity, reducing “harmful ‘environmental justice’ agenda,” making health care more market oriented and protecting science, technology, engineering and math instruction “from the poison of ‘equity’ activists.”
She said she was surprised at the apparent disconnect between Moore and the Legislative Black Caucus, which had endorsed the reparations bill.
“I believe that Gov. Wes Moore got caught in pretending to care for reparations, and then his pen was required, and he punted,” Tarver said. “It’s shameful. Just say up front you don’t believe in it.”
Disconnect or not, McCaskill said the debate is healthy — and the debate will continue as the commission moves forward, as she believes it will.
“I am excited to hear that it’s on folks’ minds, in opposition or proponents for it,” she said. “This commission is important to hear from all Marylanders because it will eventually affect every Marylander.”

(Kayla Bartkowski | Getty Images)Private equity companies have gobbled up group homes and other services for people with disabilities, attracting the attention of state and federal regulators across the nation and alarming advocates.
People with intellectual or developmental disabilities have suffered abuse, neglect and even death while under the care of private equity-owned providers, according to a recent report from watchdog group Private Equity Stakeholder Project.
“Private equity firms are, more than many other types of investors, laser-focused on maximizing their cash flow, often trying to double or triple their investment over a relatively short period of time, usually just a handful of years,” said Eileen O’Grady, the report’s author. “The way that private equity firms will often do that is to cut costs.”
For companies that provide essential services for people with disabilities, she said, “those cuts can have really harmful impacts on people’s lives.”
In late 2023, Florida moved to revoke the license of NeuroRestorative, one branch of the private equity-owned health services company Sevita, which provides services for people with disabilities. State regulators cited repeat violations by NeuroRestorative and a failure to “protect the rights of its clients to be free from physical abuse.” Ultimately the state opted not to revoke the license and fined the company $13,000 in a settlement.
But in recent years regulators have documented instances of patient harm at Sevita’s affiliates in multiple other states, including Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Massachusetts and Utah. In 2019, a U.S. Senate committee conducted a probe into the company’s operations in Iowa and Oregon following multiple reports of patient abuse and neglect.
“Any entity that receives taxpayer dollars, but especially those charged with caring for our fellow Americans who may have an intellectual disability, ought to be doing everything under the sun to ensure quality care and continually improve,” U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a statement in 2020 following his investigation.
In a statement to Stateline, Sevita did not address the sanctions directly, but avowed its commitment to providing services and supports to give people greater independence, regardless of their intellectual or physical challenges.
“Since 2019, when new ownership acquired the company, there has been significant capital investment to improve and expand our services, enhance facilities, implement robust training and new technologies, and strengthen our workforce — all with the goal of better serving our individuals and communities,” the statement said.
The disability care industry has proven increasingly attractive to private equity.
In recent years, a handful of large private equity-owned companies such as Sevita have snapped up hundreds of smaller providers of disability services — often community nonprofits, mom-and-pop businesses and religious organizations — and rolled them into larger corporations.
From 2013 to 2023, private equity firms acquired more than 1,000 disability and elder care providers, according to the report by the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. That’s likely an undercount because they’re generally not required to disclose acquisitions, the report said.
Cash cow
Private equity firms use pooled investments from pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments and wealthy individuals to buy a controlling stake in a company. They seek to maximize its value — often by cutting costs — and then sell it at a profit.
Most of Sevita’s revenue comes from providing disability services. It operates companies in 40 states under various brands, including Mentor Network, NeuroRestorative and REM.
Sevita is currently owned by private equity firms Centerbridge Partners and Vistria Group, which also own Help at Home, a home health company with more than 200 locations across about a dozen states.
Nearly all of Sevita’s revenue comes from Medicaid, according to a February 2025 report from S&P Global.
Through Medicaid and Medicare, the government pays for most services for people with intellectual or developmental disabilities. The two programs cover services such as group homes, adult day programs, in-home care, and physical and occupational therapy.
“Sevita has been owned by private equity firms for over a decade now, and has been under investigation and scrutiny at the federal and state level for basically that entire time,” O’Grady said.
In 2022, Iowa fined a NeuroRestorative group home $10,500 after a resident was left unattended in a liquor store and drank three-quarters of a bottle of vodka. The same year, Massachusetts temporarily removed Sevita’s license to operate group homes after regulators reported inadequate staff training and supervision, and a “myriad of issues that were uncovered onsite,” according to a Massachusetts Department of Developmental Services report.
The federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has fined a NeuroRestorative facility in Utah four times since 2022. A February 2024 inspection report by the agency found the facility “failed to prevent abuse, neglect … and exploitation” of residents.
Last year, Florida fined another Sevita brand, Florida Mentor, for improper use of restraints. More issues have been documented in Sevita-owned locations in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Meanwhile, Sevita’s owners, Centerbridge and Vistria, have collected nearly half a billion dollars since 2019 by loading Sevita and Help at Home with debt in order to pay dividends to investors, according to Moody’s, a financial services company.
Similar financial maneuvering contributed to the recent collapse of Steward Health Care, a private equity-owned hospital system that once had more than 30 hospitals nationwide. Steward has become a cautionary tale about the harm that profit-driven private equity firms can do to a state’s health system.
“Before Steward Health Care ultimately collapsed, executives spent years hiding their financial information from state regulators, putting patients and our health care system at risk,” Massachusetts Democratic House Speaker Ron Mariano said in a statement earlier this year announcing a new state law that beefs up reporting and financial requirements for private investors.
“That’s why ensuring that our institutions are equipped to monitor the health care landscape, and to guard against trends and transactions that drive up costs without improving patient outcomes, is so important.”
David vs. Goliath
After two residents of a New Jersey group home died from choking on food in 2017, attorney Cory Bernstein became interested in private equity’s involvement in disability services. The residents had been living in homes operated by AdvoServ, a company then owned by the private equity firm Wellspring Capital Management. The state had cited AdvoServ more times than any other operator in New Jersey for abuse, neglect and unsafe conditions.
AdvoServ later ceased operations in 2019 after multiple state agencies, including in New Jersey, Florida and Maryland, launched investigations.










States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.


– Cory Bernstein, staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network


But even when state regulators are doing all they can to protect people with disabilities from substandard care, they’re limited in how much they can hold a company accountable, Bernstein told Stateline.
“It’s state-level oversight on a national entity with not much [help] coming from the federal side,” said Bernstein, who is now a staff attorney at the National Disability Rights Network, a membership organization of federally mandated state disability advocacy programs.
“States just don’t really have the resources or tools to do what needs to be done.”
A regulatory agency in Georgia might shut down all the group homes owned by a certain company, for example, but those regulators can’t do anything about the company’s abuses in, say, Montana. With branches in multiple states, a company is better able to withstand sanctions or even a loss of license in one state, he said.
“[States] are not set up to go up against a national operator with billions of dollars in resources in a regulatory or oversight battle,” Bernstein said.
Further complicating things for state regulators and for consumers is that a large services company such as Sevita might operate under multiple brand names, even in one state. It can be hard to parse out who owns a sanctioned business. Multiple brand names can also obscure a company’s monopoly on a particular regional market.
When Florida regulators reached a settlement agreement with Sevita’s NeuroRestorative last year, the state dismissed its proposed license revocation. O’Grady believes one reason the state chose to settle is the difficulty of finding alternative facilities to relocate the residents who would have been displaced from the 13 locations the company operated around the state.
“Because of that dearth of alternatives and the impotence of the state to act more fully, this company will continue to be allowed to operate,” she said.
Further complicating oversight: Large companies often operate various services that are overseen by different agencies. Group homes might be regulated under the state’s Medicaid program, while facilities that provide more intensive care might come under federal Medicare oversight.
There could be “two completely different oversight systems for facilities serving the same population in the same state with the same name,” Bernstein said.
State solutions
Some states have moved to address problems with private equity involvement in health care by passing tighter restrictions on mergers and acquisitions of health care companies.
In Rhode Island, where private equity companies’ mismanagement of health care providers threatened the future of local hospitals, a robust oversight law allowed the state attorney general to impose conditions to protect the hospitals’ finances.
More states are following suit. In 2023 alone, 24 states enacted laws related to health system consolidation and competition, while this year at least half a dozen have considered legislation to check private equity-fueled health care mergers.

It’s a statistic the Delta’s U.S. Representative Bennie Thompson used to emphasize the difficulties people in his district face to a crowd of a few dozen people gathered in the Mound Bayou Delta Health Center parking lot late Wednesday morning.
In a recorded video, he talked about the particular risks this health care gap has on older adults, like a higher chance of developing Alzheimer’s disease. 
“We know that too many seniors are going without the care they need,” he said. 
The crowd he and eight others spoke to was gathered to celebrate a multimillion dollar step toward addressing that problem. The Delta Health Center — in collaboration with Greenville’s Delta Health System hospital, Mississippi State Office of Oral Health and the Bolivar County Council on Aging — received a $5 million grant through the Delta Dental Community Care Foundation’s Senior Oral Health Partnership Program to improve access to dental care for seniors in the area.
Representatives from each of the organizations said they will replace aging equipment at the Mound Bayou dental clinic, hire more oral health staff, develop new transportation options for services and conduct screenings among Delta seniors for tooth disorders. 
It’s the first time Delta Dental’s foundation, the philanthropic arm of the national dental insurance company, has funded a senior oral health partnership outside of California or Washington, D.C.

Robin Boyles, the Delta Health Center’s development officer, said she and her coworkers thought the grant was a long shot when the application first came out.
“Five states were eligible, and they were going to fund one partnership,” she told the crowd. “…Oftentimes I would say ‘uh, no.’ But what we finally decided was, the need is great. Our need is so great here, and we have partnerships”
For instance, Boyles said, there are no dentists in Washington County who serve patients regardless of their ability to pay for care, and many residents there end up seeking oral health care at the Greenville hospital’s emergency department. The partners hope to create ways to transfer these patients to one of the Delta Health Center’s dental clinics with the help of these funds. 
As a general dentist for the center, Dr. Clarke Allen sees these needs on a daily basis. She told Mississippi Today that when elderly patients come into the clinic and she asks them how long it’s been since their last dental appointment, most tell her it’s been more than five years.
Because Medicare, the federal government’s health insurance for adults 65 and over, often doesn’t cover most dental care, Clarke said clinics like hers, which offers lower priced services for underinsured and uninsured patients, need all the resources they can get. She thinks hiring more oral health clinicians with the grant’s funds will be a big help for Delta residents. 
“Our patient base is huge, but we don’t have as many providers to take care of all those patients,” she said.
Clarke said she’s also excited about the ways this grant will help older adults without transportation. The Delta Health Center plans to expand its efforts to bring buses full of dental services to communities throughout the Delta, and the Bolivar County Council on Aging will help provide rides from patients’ homes to the mobile clinics. 
For dental and other health care visits, medical transportation can be difficult to schedule throughout Mississippi. LaShonda McKinney, the council’s executive director, told Mississippi Today that’s why she was grateful the Delta Health Center thought of her organization and Delta residents’ transportation needs when planning out its mobile dental efforts. 
“Even if you park in senior communities, how are they going to get to the mobile units?” she asked. “They have their own transportation, but we have a lot more vehicles, vehicles for individuals who may need wheelchairs or walkers.”

John Fairman, the Delta Health Center’s chief executive officer, told Mississippi Today that since its founding in 1965, his community health center has always prided itself on going beyond checkups and doctors appointments to make sure Delta residents are healthy. 
He says that through addressing people’s needs beyond the walls of the Mound Bayou clinic, this grant continues that same tradition. 
“We’re really excited,” he said. “Delta Dental Foundation is just a godsend.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/21134315/3X0A1179.jpg,,,2025-05-23 07:05:08.707327

(Photo: John Partipilo)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.










School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don't think is sustainable long term.


– Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities





In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
Tennessee legislature puts hundreds of millions toward private-school vouchers

“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Last week, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program. Part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the measure would need a simple majority in the House and the Senate to pass.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Mother’s Day may have just passed, but what hasn’t passed is the growing threat facing mothers like me across the country. While many of us were being celebrated with cards and flowers, lawmakers in Washington were advancing a budget that would devastate the programs that help us survive.
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) recently issued a chilling report: Republican leaders are pushing a federal budget proposal to slash $880 billion from health care, particularly Medicaid, to fund another round of tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. That is not a gift to mothers. That is a gut punch.
As a working mom in Kentucky raising two beautiful daughters, Medicaid has been the difference between surviving and slipping through the cracks. It allows me to access regular checkups, medications, dental appointments, and essential care not just for me, but also for my children. I work two jobs. Neither offers health insurance nor pays a living wage. Without Medicaid, we would have no safety net, no way to stay healthy, and no protection when things go wrong.
I cannot imagine what I would do without Medicaid or SNAP benefits. These supports are not handouts. They are how I keep my family going in a system that too often fails to value mothers like me.
Let’s be clear. The majority in Congress is proposing to roll back the Medicaid expansion that has been a lifeline for millions. Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), only seniors, people with disabilities, children and pregnant women qualified for Medicaid. Low-income working people were left out. The ACA changed that. In Kentucky, expanding Medicaid in 2014 drastically reduced the number of uninsured people, saved rural hospitals from closing, and ensured access to mental health and addiction services during public health emergencies.
Most of those who gained coverage through the expansion were women, especially mothers. After giving birth, Medicaid became even more vital when postpartum coverage was extended, giving new mothers a full year of health care. It also supports preventive care and chronic disease treatment for women of childbearing age, helping create better outcomes for mothers and children.
Ten states still refuse to expand Medicaid, leaving millions uninsured. And instead of encouraging progress, Congress is proposing to strip health care from those of us who need it most.
Despite working two jobs, I still can’t consistently afford groceries without Medicaid and SNAP. Yet Congress is rewarding billionaires with tax cuts while targeting mothers like me for cuts. That’s not justice. That’s betrayal.
Medicaid is the largest source of federal funding in every state. In Kentucky, over 1.5 million people rely on it. Slashing this lifeline would harm families and damage schools, hospitals, clinics and emergency services that depend on Medicaid dollars. Just over the mountains in West Virginia, 516,500 people rely on Medicaid. This includes 49,000 seniors, 196,000 children, and 86,000 people with disabilities. Across Appalachia, one thing is clear: our families depend on these programs for survival.
This is not what the American people voted for. Medicaid has broad support from Democrats, Republicans and independents alike. Most of us know someone who relies on it, whether it’s a mother, a grandparent, a child or a neighbor.
We must protect the programs that value our lives if we value mothers. This isn’t just about policy. It’s about dignity. It’s about survival.
If Congress can afford to give billionaires tax breaks, then it can afford to provide health care to the millions of moms, kids, grandparents and people with disabilities who need it.
Our representatives must protect Medicaid, mothers, and the people who hold this country together daily. Because taking health care away from moms doesn’t save money, it breaks families.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidsign-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 06:02:10.442938

This is the final story in a Lantern series about homelessness in Western Kentucky. Read the earlier articles here.
CENTRAL CITY — Sitting on his bed at the Central Inn on a bitterly cold January day, John Paul Shanks had already handwashed his clothes, after pre-soaking them in Gain detergent, and hung them to dry. Living outdoors in this Western Kentucky town has given him a lot of experience in making do.
“I’m probably one of the only people you’ll see that can just sit there and lay on a piece of concrete with a pillow or nothing and go to bed,” Shanks said. “That hardens you up.”
Gwen Clements is why 41-year-old Shanks, his red beard long and his head shaved, had a motel room that day. Clements also knows about making do. She’s a leader in a loose coalition of the compassionate, working to help her homeless neighbors in a place that offers them few formal resources.
She met Shanks years before when she took a job at the Perdue Farms poultry processing plant in Ohio County around the time of the Great Recession. He was a production line leader. 
It’s unclear to Clements what put Shanks on the path to what she describes as being “chronically homeless.” But as she began seeing him walk the streets she started checking in with him and asking if he needed anything.

On days when she wanted to find Shanks, she would make sure to get up early to drive around town and check a few of his haunts. Outside the Central Inn. Inside the local Wendy’s. On a bench next to a local bank where people driving by gave him money, food and sometimes clothing. 
“The only people that know him are the people who stop and talk to him, people that know him from the past,” Clements said in January.
With deadly cold in the forecast that January week, Clements, through a Facebook group she started in early 2024 focused on homelessness, had urged her neighbors to send her money so that she could put people up in the motel and keep them safe overnight. 
Finding Shanks during severe weather and making sure he had shelter had become a priority for her. 
It was easy for Clements to check Shanks into a motel room for the night. Finding help for his deeper issues is not. Clements said that’s true of other people she helps, some of them grappling with what seem to be untreated mental illness and addiction and living without permanent shelter. 
“People like John Paul, there’s no help for them. You can make all the appointments you want for him. He’s not going to go,” Clements said. “He doesn’t have transportation if he did decide to go.” 
Shanks said he injured his back years ago when on the drive to work the vehicle he was in hit a patch of black ice that “flipped the car.” The nerve pain was so intense, he said, it could take him 30 minutes to dress. In the motel room, he also described grappling with addiction and using prescription opioids, cocaine and methamphetamine. 
According to court records, Shanks has been arrested a number of times. Once he was screaming and throwing rocks from a train track. Shanks told police he hadn’t realized one of the rocks had almost hit a woman. Another time he was arrested for disorderly conduct for allegedly yelling obscenities at a local IGA grocery store. 
In 2022, a Central City police officer and Chief Jason Lindsey found Shanks at a strip mall where Shanks had previously trespassed, according to an incident report. Shanks had allegedly told a minor “he would take him out back and beat his brains out.” Shanks told law enforcement the minor “had said things to him about him being homeless and getting a job.” Shanks was arrested and banned from entering the strip mall property.
Tammy Piper, the director of business development for the city, told the Lantern last year the city had tried to help Shanks multiple times by putting him in a hotel room or offering work. Piper said in one instance, Chief Lindsey drove Shanks to live with family members several counties over and had secured a job for Shanks, only for Shanks to return to the Central City streets.

In the fall of 2024, the city removed the bench next to a local bank where Shanks often sat, sometimes dozing or asking passing drivers for money. The move sparked debate on social media and made television news in Evansville, Indiana. Central City Mayor Tony Armour told the Evansville station the bench was removed because Shanks made people uncomfortable. 
The mayor also said the city has tried to offer Shanks work. Shanks, in the motel room in January, disputed that the city had offered him a job. 
The bench took on larger significance for some, including Clements, who saw its removal as a symbol of apathy and, at times, disregard by local officials and police for people who are unsheltered and struggling.
“That was just a small part of how our homeless are treated in this county and this city,” said Clements. 
Clements said Shanks and other people dealing with homelessness need more than a bench where they can spend their days or even a roof over their heads. She sees a need for mobile mental health services that can meet people where they’re living outside, considering that homelessness can deteriorate mental health. 
“He’s suffered a lot of trauma from being unhoused. I don’t think people understand that,” Clements said about Shanks. “They just want to think that, ‘He’s lazy and a druggie, and he needs to get a job, get off drugs and he’ll be fine.’ It’s much more than that.
“The warming shelters and stuff is the ‘more.’ John Paul needing mobile crisis mental health — that’s part of the ‘more.’ It’s just so much more than the bench being removed,” Clements said.
When Shanks was asked in the motel room if he believed others in Central City cared about people experiencing homelessness, he said: “I think they worry about others. I think there’s just a lot to worry about.”
Clements replied to Shanks: “The problem is too big, and they don’t know how to handle it.” 
More than a bench
Paramount among the needs is more housing and temporary shelter, according to Clements and others in the band of helpers pushing to address homelessness in Muhlenberg County. 
The Muhlenberg County Economic Growth Alliance, the economic development arm for county government, retained an Ohio-based housing research firm in November 2023 to better understand the local housing market. The study found a need for more than 300 additional rental units and more than 700 additional owner-occupied homes through 2029. The report noted the need for affordable rental units would continue because of persistent poverty in the county.

But the path for creating more housing or even temporary shelter remains unclear. 
Kelsey Rolley, who has helped the loose coalition at times through her work at Pennyrile Allied Community Services, said some of the divisions among the community spring from fear of the unknown. She imagines questions from local “higher ups,” such as who else might come into the county to seek shelter if more were available and whether it might attract more crime.  
When Armour, the mayor, raised concerns about a church’s plans to turn the Central Inn into efficiency apartments to help homeless people transition into something more permanent, he worried his community could be “destroyed” by an influx of people drawn by the assistance.
“It’s going to take a village, and until that village can be formed, created and run properly, all of us work together — I feel like it’s just going to keep us stuck,” Rolley said. 
The loose coalition is persisting, though. Clements and others recently visited Somerset to see how a nonprofit shelter and resource hub were started just a couple years ago, and Clements has been considering buildings to potentially start her own version of that nonprofit in Muhlenberg.

An eviction hearing, an urn and a stoop
The way forward to stable housing remains strewn with challenges and struggles for the people who talked about their experiences of being homeless in this series.
 Shanks remained on the concrete stoop of the Central Inn in May, waving at passing cars. He mentioned he needed a shower, a pair of socks and maybe another stay in a motel room. “You gotta appreciate everything about everything,” he said.

Courtney Phillips, who slept outside the Abundant Life Church for weeks, is still piecing together what she wants her life to be. The church has provided her a room to sleep in. At her nursing home job, she’s working long hours and building relationships with residents who deal with mental health disorders including dementia. 
She wants to save money for a car — what she calls a “baby step” toward where she wants to be. She made it to the top of a waiting list for a rapid rehousing program and hopes it will help her find an apartment soon. 
She’s also been carrying on without her dog, Joker, who cuddled with her while she was sleeping outside. Joker died earlier this year; a wooden urn with Joker’s ashes sits in her room at the church, and Joker’s bed is still beside her bed. 
“It’s real different, but he’s still with me,” Phillips said. 
Mallie Luken, who slept in the church parking lot before Clements helped her find housing, was anxious for weeks leading up to a hearing on her possible eviction from the apartment Clements had helped her find.
After police left Luken in her wheelchair outside the Abundant Life Church on a stormy night in September, Clements came to her aid, helping her secure an apartment at the Greenville Housing Authority. But her housing situation was uncertain yet again by this month. 
Luken, 70, was served an eviction notice because of alleged complaints from neighbors about her behavior and inappropriate language that they said was directed at them. Clements, who admits Luken can be her own “worst enemy,” also said the housing authority alleged Luken hadn’t paid rent, something she said wasn’t true. 
The stress of her predicament had Luken exhausted and apprehensive.

“Somehow or another I keep falling through the system,” Luken said weeks before the hearing. 
Earlier in May, in front of a district court judge, Luken with the help of a Kentucky Legal Aid attorney was able to come to an agreement with the housing authority: She can stay in her apartment until another apartment opens up at a housing authority in Beaver Dam, next door in Ohio County where Luken previously lived. 
Clements said Luken has friends near there, potentially a support system. In Muhlenberg County, Clements played a large role in Luken’s support system. Their relationship has grown over the months they’ve been together. 
“I can’t imagine what she’s done for other people,” Luken said in praise of Clements’ generosity. 
Leaving Luken’s apartment earlier this year, Clements told Luken she loved her. 
Out on the sidewalk, Clements, in a voice choked with emotion, said, “I can’t imagine my mother being in that predicament. I just can’t.”

(Mountain Association photo)By any measure, the economy of Eastern Kentucky and the wider Appalachian region is struggling. The collapse of the coal industry, the opioid crisis and the recurring natural disasters have left scars that are slow to heal. Families and individual households trying to make ends meet rely on an array of federal assistance. 
Recently, there have been cuts or threats to these assistance programs, including a proposed total elimination of a vital energy assistance program that supports 6 million low-income households each year across the country. 
The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) is zeroed out in the proposed federal budget for the fiscal year that begins in September 2025. LIHEAP provides life-saving aid to millions of Americans by helping them afford their heating and cooling bills. For many, it is the difference between choosing food or heat, medicine or air conditioning. 
In 2024 alone, the program was utilized more than 219,000 times by Kentucky households. These are small disbursements — a max of $250 per season — that function as safety nets for working families, elderly residents and people with disabilities who are trying to survive on limited incomes in one of the most energy-burdened regions in the country.
Despite this need, the Trump administration’s 2026 budget proposes defunding LIHEAP entirely. Their reasoning is that lower energy prices are on the horizon thanks to a move toward American energy dominance and the America First platform. But here in Kentucky, the future hasn’t arrived yet. Energy bills are still going up, not down.
In some Eastern Kentucky counties, low-income families pay up to 14.5% of their income on utility bills — more than double the 6% threshold that experts define as a “high” energy burden. Rural residents, especially those living in older, less energy-efficient homes, feel this pain the most. Rural areas often pay disproportionately high electricity costs due to utilities charging higher rates, in part due to infrastructure costs utilities incur covering more miles of transmission lines, etc., and in part due to utilities being owned by investors who are guaranteed a certain rate of return on their investment.
And while some cities have access to local programs that might soften the blow of high bills, rural communities often don’t. That’s where LIHEAP comes in. It funds weatherization improvements that make homes more efficient — reducing future energy costs and minimizing the need for repeated emergency assistance. In fiscal year 2023, the program weatherized more than 60,000 homes nationwide and helped prevent countless power disconnections.
The federal government allocated approximately $54 million in LIHEAP funds to Kentucky in fiscal year 2025. To access these funds, individuals must meet certain requirements and provide documentation showing their need for assistance. These requirements are designed to support Kentucky’s most vulnerable residents and some examples include households where someone has a health condition or disability (verified by a doctor’s note), someone is 65 or older, or a child under the age of 6 is present. 
This money is especially important during the extreme summer and winter temperatures Kentucky experiences. Kentucky is one of just 10 states where utility shutoffs due to nonpayment are allowed even during dangerous weather events. Sometimes families are cut off because they owe as little as $6.
Cutting LIHEAP cannot just be a budget decision — this is an issue that needs to consider the survival of our most vulnerable neighbors. Because it’s so critical, the program is housed under the Department of Health and Human Services and has received bipartisan support for nearly 45 years. 
The Trump administration recently acknowledged that Appalachia is at a disadvantage due to loss of coal jobs and the opioid crisis, and because of that, it was  leaving funding for another program in the budget that benefits this area. We argue that many low-income communities across the country face similar systemic challenges that have them needing a little extra help to stay and revitalize these areas of the United States. 
If you have an experience to share about how LIHEAP has impacted you or your community in a time of need, now is the time to share your story.

(Photo: Connect Images) Earlier this month, the North Carolina House of Representatives passed House Bill 519, also known as the “Parents’ Medical Bill of Rights.” As a board certified OBGYN who treats minors, I am deeply concerned about the implications of this bill. This legislation, which aims to revise the laws regarding minors’ consent to medical treatment and parental access to medical records, poses significant risks to the health and wellbeing of patients across the state. 
HB 519 will impede the trust young patients have in their medical providers and therefore undermine the confidentiality of their care. Currently, North Carolina law allows minors to consent to treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), pregnancy, substance abuse, and mental health issues without parental involvement. This provision is crucial for ensuring that young patients feel safe seeking medical help without fear of judgment or repercussions from their parents.   
By mandating parental consent for these sensitive treatments, the bill risks deterring minors from seeking necessary medical care. This could lead to untreated STIs (which can lead to future infertility), unaddressed mental health issues, and unintended pregnancies, all of which have serious long-term consequences for our young North Carolinians’ health and wellbeing. 
The trust between patients and healthcare providers is foundational to effective medical care. Confidentiality is a cornerstone of this trust, particularly for minors who may be navigating complex and sensitive health issues. HB 519 threatens to erode this trust by introducing parental oversight into the patient-provider relationship. Healthcare providers may find themselves in difficult positions, having to balance the legal requirements of HB 519 with our ethical duty to protect patient confidentiality.  
Advocates for HB 519 argue that the exclusion of parental consent in our current laws leaves children to navigate serious medical situations alone.  This perspective completely ignores the role that healthcare providers like myself play in the navigation of these issues. We do not leave our young patients “alone” to navigate their medical decisions, but instead provide thoughtful guidance, including often suggesting the involvement of their parent(s) in their medical care. Unfortunately, for some of my young patients, their medical team members are the only trusted adults in their lives, and if they are required to obtain parental consent to seek treatment, they simply will not do so.  
House Bill 519, while ostensibly aimed at empowering parents, poses significant risks to the health and wellbeing of minors in North Carolina. By undermining confidentiality, creating barriers to mental health and reproductive care, and hindering substance abuse treatment, the bill jeopardizes the autonomy and safety of young patients. As a physician who treats young patients, I urge the lawmakers to reconsider the implications of HB 519 and prioritize the health and rights of minors in our state.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Pregnancy-test-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 06:02:10.442938

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island State Crime Lab Director Dennis Hilliard says he is still struggling to fill three open positions for firearms examiners, nine months after an investigation found discrepancies in testing conducted at the troubled lab.
But the State Crime Laboratory Commission put Hilliard’s job performance under the microscope during a 90-minute closed-door meeting Thursday at the Cranston office of the Rhode Island Attorney General. 
Hilliard, who earns $143,628-a-year as lab director, a position he’s held since 1992, waited in the lobby while four of the five commissioners met in a conference room. 
“Just to let you know, the person they’re going to discuss is me,” Hilliard, 70, told reporters.
The lab in Fogarty Hall on the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) Kingston campus temporarily suspended toolmark testing last August after discrepancies were found in lab results for casings from a Glock pistol seized as evidence in a 2021 Pawtucket murder case. The casings were flagged as matching a different firearm in possession of the Boston Police Department. 
That led to delays in nearly two dozen criminal cases, which underwent re-testing at labs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Hilliard told the commission that all those cases have since been verified.
Commissioners had copies of a report by an assessment team from the ANSI National Accreditation Board, which visited the lab in March. The report found “no issues with the competency of the examiners” who now handle evidence for firearms, trace evidence, and latent prints at the lab. 
But it did find the lab did not conform with 15 of 172 professional standards or 91.3%. Hilliard said the issues were mostly paperwork-related and that staff were working to address them in order to maintain accreditation.
The executive session took up half the commission’s quarterly meeting. Deputy Attorney General Adi Goldstein, who chairs the panel as a designee of the AG’s office, announced that no action was taken following the commission’s return to open session.
Hilliard moved up the lab’s accreditation review two years sooner than required in its standard accreditation cycle after it had to halt how examiners determine if a cartridge or shell is fired from a specific gun last August.
What will it take to exonerate the R.I. State Crime Lab?

The lab in Fogarty Hall on the University of Rhode Island’s (URI) Kingston campus temporarily suspended toolmark testing after casings to a Glock pistol seized as evidence in a 2021 Pawtucket murder case matched a different firearm in possession of the Boston Police Department. The suspension prompted delays in nearly two dozen criminal cases, which underwent re-testing at labs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Hilliard told the commission that all those cases have since been verified.
A report published last October by California-based consultant Ronald Nichols, who formerly worked for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), found there was a lack of diligence and confirmation bias on the part of three forensic examiners who performed toolmark analysis at the state lab. The three firearms examiners have since left the lab. 
Nine months later, Hilliard said it’s been nearly impossible to find replacements. Most experienced examiners, he said, can work as consultants where they can make far more money in a shorter amount of time compared to what they’d receive at URI.
“We’ve got a really limited pool,” Hilliard told the commission. 
Hilliard said only one serious candidate had applied to be a lead examiner position when the position was first up between November and early 2025. That applicant had toured the facility and passed a competency test, but turned down a job offer, saying the salary was too low.
At the time, URI offered a salary range of $70,971 to $107,830 for the lead examiner’s position. The new job listing posted on URI’s website May 16 lists a salary range between $82,082 to $125,379.
No applications have been received as of Thursday, Hilliard told the commission.

Goldstein questioned why the lab has only recently updated the salary range when Hilliard told the commission in January that a pay bump would likely be needed to attract applicants.
Hilliard explained that it took that long for URI to reclassify the job’s pay grade.
“It wasn’t until last Wednesday that I was informed that they would accept, recruit, and update,” he told the commission.
A similar pay update will be required for the position of a standard examiner, which initially had a salary range of $65,980 to $100,314. A technician from Baltimore had been offered a job, but Hilliard said the candidate declined due to family issues. 
He told Rhode Island Current the new salary will likely range between $76,159 and $116,529.
Of the two standard toolmark examiners, Hilliard told the commission one will be filled by an in-house candidate being trained by the ATF. He is expected to begin work early next year, Hilliard told reporters.
In the meantime, new toolmark exams will continue to be handled by two former New York City police examiners from Stria Consulting Group contracted by the lab. 
Any toolmark case still requires final verification by examiners at SCL Forensics in Texas and FoCoSS Forensics in New Hampshire. Additional verification was deemed necessary by the commission to minimize the risk of confirmation bias — the principle that if you know what you’re looking for, you’re more likely to find it. 
But Hilliard said third-party labs have slow turnaround times. He told the commission it often takes six to eight weeks to receive the external verification since the labs handle other cases from their own states as well. Hilliard asked the commission to allow the lab to reduce the number of cases verified out of state. 
Goldstein denied that request, telling Hilliard to come up with a formal proposal for a “statistically valid sample of cases” for the commission to consider at a future meeting.
“Until that is proposed,we proceed with the current process,” she said. 
After the meeting ended, Hilliard said he’s proud of what he’s done for the lab.

The board’s unanimous 7-0 vote directs the Virginia Department of Education (VDOE) to open the state’s compliance pathways in its state administrative code governing special education by removing the requirement for graduate-level coursework earned towards an Early Childhood Special Education (ECSPED) endorsement.
VDOE staff said the need for additional teachers with ECSPED endorsement has been “longstanding,” noting that 7% to 9% of educators have taught outside their endorsed area over the past six years. 
Elementary education Pre-K-6 and special education PreK-12 were the top two critical shortage areas staff identified, which they said showed the necessity of updating compliance standards to make hiring special education teachers easier.
“All we’re asking is to remove the word ‘graduate’ and align it with all of the rest of the special education endorsements and make a pathway that is easier to fill for early childhood education,” said Rob Gilstrap, VDOE assistant superintendent for human capital, at Thursday’s board meeting.
The ECSPED endorsement requires special education teachers to have a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution.
Teachers must have also graduated from an approved teacher preparation program in early childhood special education, completed a college major in early childhood special education or 27 semester graduate hours in early childhood special education.
Virginia schools still struggling to fill critical teaching positions, new report finds

The board was provided two solutions to facilitate the compliance change. One will create an ECSPED add-on endorsement, which will be developed by the Advisory Board on Teacher Education and Licensure in September. The Board of Education will vote on the final details, and the process could take an extended period to complete. 
The second solution is to make a minor revision to the state’s administrative code, which the board said would align licensure regulations for ECSPED endorsement and increase flexibility by removing an arbitrary graduate-level course requirement. This will also allow teachers without a graduate degree to add the endorsement outside of an approved program pathway.
Since the second solution would likely not spark public disagreement, the regulatory changes could be fast tracked and completed after 90 days.
VDOE said the changes could fill at least 70 positions in the future and would put the commonwealth in alignment with all other state special education endorsement requirements.

Warm seawater will likely drive another above-average hurricane season this year, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Thursday.
Forecasters expect between 13 and 19 named tropical storms to form in the Atlantic Ocean between June 1 and November 30.
Six to 10 will become full-blown hurricanes, with three to five eventually becoming major storms.
National Weather Service director Ken Graham said improved forecasting has dramatically cut fatalities from these storms, particularly storm surge projections.
But he warned that things can change quickly and people need to heed warnings and be prepared.
“Every Cat 5 that’s hit this country was a tropical storm or less three days prior. The big ones that hit this country are fast,” Graham said Thursday.
Officials said new forecasting methods and technology are being rolled out this year to better anticipate the rapid intensification of storms.
He also noted that his call for preparation isn’t just for coastal communities.
“When you live 500 miles inland and you really don’t think that you could be impacted like that, right? So it’s hard for people to understand what has never happened before,” Graham said.
Virginia to receive $46 million in federal funds for Helene relief efforts

Last year, during another above-average hurricane season, Hurricane Helene dumped 30 inches of rain on communities hundreds of miles from the coast across the Southeastern United States. The storm was the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina in 2005.
“These storms are a stark reminder about how vital it is to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season now, before the storms begin forming in the Atlantic basin,” said Laura Grimm, NOAA’s acting administrator.
Towns in Western Virginia, North Carolina and other states are still recovering from intense flooding and Graham said they’re exploring better ways to notify people of the threats.
The warnings come as the National Weather Service has faced staffing and budget cuts, measures that some worry could hamper weather monitoring efforts.
Grimm said during Thursday’s announcement that NOAA’s Hurricane Center is fully staffed and the cuts won’t impede monitoring.
“We are really making this a top priority for this administration.”

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)The U.S. House Republican budget bill could spell significant losses for low-income families in Ohio, specifically those in need of food assistance and those on Medicaid.
Advocates for Medicaid and anti-hunger leaders have said reductions and eliminations connected to the two programs would negatively affect Ohioans as a whole, and the state’s economy and spending power as well.
Only one Republican U.S. representative from Ohio voted against the congressional budget bill, passed early Thursday with a vote of 215-214. U.S. Rep. Warren Davidson, posted on X, formerly Twitter, Thursday morning that he supported “many things in the bill,” but that “deficits do matter and this bill grows them now.”
“The only Congress we can control is the one we’re in,” he wrote, alongside a bar graph showing the Congressional Budget Office’s analysis of the bill’s deficit effect. “Consequently, I cannot support this big deficit plan.”
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, stood with the rest of Democrats in voting against the bill, saying in a statement after the vote that the bill is “a cruel and catastrophic budget that rips health care, food and opportunity from Ohioans and millions of other Americans just to bankroll bigger and better tax breaks for billionaires.”
 Medicaid
Beatty’s statement said the bill, which now moves to the U.S. Senate, includes “the largest cut to Medicaid in American history,” at $698 billion, and $267 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) over the next decade.
“In Ohio, that means potentially substantial new costs shifted onto our state, and fewer hospitals, fewer nursing homes, fewer services for our most vulnerable neighbors,” according to Beatty. “It’s not just bad math – it’s moral failure.”
Ohio would see direct impact from the bill in its own state operating budget, currently being drafted by the General Assembly.
The Ohio House’s version of the bill kept a provision proposed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget to eliminate the state’s Medicaid expansion group if the federal government reduced the contribution it makes to the program.
Currently, the federal government pays 90% of the Medicaid funding in Ohio, with the state covering the other 10%.
In the Ohio House’s version of the budget bill, Ohio would eliminate Group VIII — another name for the Medicaid expansion group that covers more than 700,000 Ohioans who live above the income requirements for traditional Medicaid but are still in need of assistance — if the federal government’s share of the funding dips below 90%.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Medicaid advocates and experts have said losing this expansion group would cause Ohio’s uninsured rate to go up, and those dropped from the program to seek self-pay medical options, or skip care all together, causing the health of the state to suffer.
According to Ohio child advocates Groundwork Ohio, nearly 48% of Ohio children younger than six rely on Medicaid for health coverage, and the program covers about 50% of all births in the state.
The Center for Community Solutions found in a recent study that Medicaid covers 2 in 5 children in the state, as well as 1 in 5 working-age adults, and 1 in 10 adults aged 65 and older. The largest group covered in Ohio’s Medicaid program, 53.2% of cases, is families and children.
 SNAP funding
The national Food Research & Action Center said the cuts would represent a nearly 30% reduction in SNAP funding, and would increase each state’s share of spending for the food assistance.
“The bottom line is this bill would end up costing America,” wrote Crystal FitzSimons, president of FRAC, in a statement. “Rural communities would be disproportionately impacted. We would see higher rates of hunger and poverty, increased health care costs, reduced academic outcomes, less productivity and an economy that will be hit hard.”
The Congressional Budget Office said the cuts, particularly to Medicaid and SNAP, would create a 2% decrease in household income nationwide in 2027 for the 10% of Americans in the lowest income brackets, going to to 4% by 2033. Households in the highest income brackets, however, could see raises.
The loss of SNAP funding, along with Medicaid, would reduce access to services that “are vital for everyday Ohioans in every Congressional district,” according to Joree Novotny, executive director of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.
Novotny said the current proposal would shift nearly $500 million in SNAP costs per year onto the state of Ohio.
“That’s about the same as all the state general revenue spent to operate the entire Ohio Department of Job and Family Services each year,” Novotny said.
The food banks and other anti-hunger advocates are already asking the state to support bipartisan legislation that would create supplemental benefits for SNAP participants in Ohio.
Ohio House Bill 178, which has received two hearings the Ohio House Community Revitalization Committee, would require the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services to provide “supplemental benefits to households receiving (SNAP) benefits if the household includes a member who is 60 years of age or older and receives a monthly SNAP benefit that is less than $50.
The supplements would cost the state $12.5 million in fiscal year 2026, and $21.4 million in 2027, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.
In supporting the bill, Hope Lane-Gavin, director of nutrition policy and programs for the state association of food banks said the average SNAP benefit in Ohio is $171 per month per person, or less than $6 per person per day.
The federal minimum SNAP benefit is $23 per month, according to Lane-Gavin. There are about 70,000 households with adults 60 or older as the head of them in which the household receives less than $50 per month.
“Access to SNAP benefits can reduce food insecurity, increase medication adherence and contribute to health care savings,” she told the committee.
If SNAP funding changes drastically, food banks will not be able to fill the gap, even as they served more than 230 million meals in 2024, according to Novotny. The language in the budget would force state governments including Ohio’s to “make impossible choices.”
“This cost shift wouldn’t just hurt families, it would impact local grocery stores, farmers and food suppliers, threatening jobs and access to fresh food in communities across Ohio,” Novotny said.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Michigan lawmakers are again aiming to boost state environmental cleanup standards and force polluting industries to rehabilitate brownfield sites. “Polluter pay” legislation, facing broad opposition from Republicans, failed last year but Democrats said they are engaging with industry stakeholders to craft laws that will target the worst sites and offenders.
Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin and Rep. Jason Morgan, of Ann Arbor, said they intend to rework bills that ensure companies and utilities pay for cleanups and open their records for public review. The legislation, which they plan to reintroduce in June, would also allow legal recourse for residents who suspect they have been harmed by the pollution.
The measure passed the state Senate last year but was lost amid a tumultuous and early end to the Michigan legislature’s lame duck session in December.
“We’ve migrated from ‘Let’s make this law that holds polluters to account,’ to ‘How can we focus on the most egregious cases,’” Irwin said. “How can we work around the edges of the law so as not to fundamentally change its approach, but nonetheless get better results?
“The idea is to require better cleanups of contaminated land and discourage companies from leaving a mess in the first place. I still expect universal opposition from polluters. Industry isn’t going to support more stringent standards no matter how reasonable, because it costs them money.”
The lawmakers are part of a working group that includes the Michigan Manufacturing Association, the Michigan Chemistry Council and some manufacturers. They said they want industries and state regulators to collaborate in the pollution assessment process, and they envision a negotiation process with some tough compromises.
It is likely that some sites will never meet residential standards, Irwin said.
“That gives us more flexibility to address those standards where they make sense,” Irwin said. “Some properties might continue to be designated for industrial use. Auto plants and other large industrial sites are the ones that may not be fully cleaned up (to residential standards).”
First introduced in 2023, Michigan Senate bills 605–611 are far different from laws recently passed in Vermont and New York, which are also often described as “polluter pays” measures. The Vermont and New York bills are modeled after the federal Superfund law, and would essentially tax big oil companies for their historic greenhouse gas emissions.
In Michigan, lawmakers are seeking accountability from businesses and industries that for years have left toxins in the ground or in the water.
 Testing Toxic Sites

Michigan has tens of thousands of toxic sites, including many one-time commercial enterprises, that will likely fall within the proposal’s reach. The former Gelman Sciences Inc. site in Ann Arbor, which manufactured medical filters and related products for the pharmaceutical and microelectronic industries, is a prime example.
The chemical solvent known as 1,4-dioxane, a potential carcinogen, was used in production and has been found in local groundwater and nearby wells. The state and Washtenaw County has been overseeing remediation activities at the site for over 30 years. The federal Environmental Protection Agency has recommended the site to the National Superfund Priorities List.
Irwin said troubled sites will be evaluated and tested, with soil and water samples, for a range of toxins. “Is the site near a residential area, or is it located downtown?” Irwin said. “The goal is to take this case by case, and allow flexibility for sites that are in different locations.”
Progress Michigan, an advocacy organization, said its polls show over 90 percent of the public support laws that could save taxpayers from huge remediation costs. Dave Dempsey, senior advisor at For Love of Water, a nonprofit advocacy group focused on the Great Lakes Basin, said the proposed legislation is an attempt at fairness.
The Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy “estimates it will cost $13 billion for all these cleanups,” Dempsey said. “It could take two generations to do this, or until the end of the century. Now we just have these old sites discharging pollution into rivers and lakes.” Dempsey’s organization also wants to prevent an increase in abandoned toxic sites.
Taxpayers are currently footing the bill for so-called “orphan sites,” locations where owners are unclear or unidentified. Under current law, developers who clean up unclaimed brownfields receive tax increment financing, Irwin said.
 The Biggest Culprits

Sean McBrearty, director of the nonprofit Michigan Clean Water Action, said he wonders if any polluter pay effort can succeed when corporations are often the biggest culprits. McBrearty pointed to DTE Energy, which has faced legal action over its coal-fired power plants and other facilities.
“There are industrial accidents that haven’t been cleaned up because it’s cheaper to lobby the legislature than clean up contaminated sites,” said McBrearty, whose organization has worked with Irwin’s latest version of legislation. 
Irwin acknowledged that his bill will again face tough political realities. “We worry about a ‘pay-to-play’ environment where companies will use payments to stop an investigation,” Irwin said. “Now that the Michigan House is Republican, that adds more of a challenge.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/landfill-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Last time Drew Cline visited family in his hometown of Hickory, North Carolina, he went to his favorite barbecue joint in a downtown area that had been struggling to keep businesses afloat in recent years.
“I always take a walk around downtown to see how it’s changed,” he said. “And there would always be vacant storefronts. Until last time I went and we did our stroll around downtown, and not a single storefront was vacant. And there were people walking around with beer, and I asked, what’s going on?”
Cline learned from shop owners that the area had become designated a “social district” where people were allowed to purchase alcohol at bars and restaurants and take it with them outside the bar within this social district. He said before the district was created, the closure of mills and competition from shopping malls and development along a nearby state highway had hurt businesses’ ability to stay afloat downtown.
“Now, Hickory won’t attribute 100% of its revival to the social district, but they do contribute a pretty large portion of it,” he said. “And so it’s working.”
Cline, who now lives in Bedford and works as the executive director at a conservative think tank called the Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, pitched the idea to state Rep. Bill Boyd, a Merrimack Republican. Boyd said he used North Carolina’s legislation on social districts as a model to create New Hampshire’s House Bill 467, but also saw successful social district programs in Michigan, Georgia, and other states. Cline said officials he spoke with in North Carolina said they hadn’t seen increases in public drunkenness or crime.
“Not even trash,” Cline said. “Which is kind of surprising, but I think that’s part of the planning for these downtowns, is that you do plan for more trash receptacles, more recycling bins.”
Last week, the New Hampshire Senate approved HB 467, which now heads to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. The bill would allow New Hampshire towns and cities to opt into the program and establish social districts within their borders. The districts would have to be approved by a city council or other municipal body, or during a town meeting, and plans would be submitted to the liquor commission. The bill lays out operational guidelines, including the containers designated for alcohol, signage with information and rules, and time limits set at the discretion of towns and cities.
The bill also has backing from the New Hampshire Municipal Association. Brodie Deshaies, the association’s legislative advocate, described the bill as “a great private-public partnership” that towns and cities have been asking for.
The bill is one of several that lawmakers are moving through the State House in an attempt to loosen restrictions on bars in the Granite State.
House Bill 81, a bipartisan proposal to allow patrons to bring alcohol into the restroom at a bar or restaurant, is also headed to Ayotte’s desk. State law currently prohibits people from bringing alcoholic beverages into “foyers, hallways, kitchens, restrooms, or other areas not approved for service by the commission.”
Supporters of the bill, which was sponsored by Bethlehem Democratic Rep. Jared Sullivan, characterize it as an effort to reduce the risk of date rape drugs being placed in drinks. Rep. Erica Layon, a Derry Republican, said during a hearing last month that lawmakers had heard about a woman who left her drink on a table while using the restroom because a sign said it was illegal to take it with her. While she was gone, Layon said, the woman’s drink was drugged.
“She was out at a bar, had one drink, and then woke up in a hotel room the next morning after being raped,” Layon said. “Hopefully, you share the view that it is more important to empower people to protect themselves from unwanted assaults than it is to micromanage how they manage their drinks.”
Henry Veileux, on behalf of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, said people within the industry were opposed to the bill because of potential for underage drinking and overconsumption. He added that bartenders can hold on to a patron’s drink while they use the restroom.
Another bill proposed this session takes aim at an old rule for establishments.
New Hampshire has long prohibited bars from selling liquor without also selling food, though there’s a series of exceptions that the Legislature has carved out for hotels, airport bars, and other establishments over the years. House Bill 276, sponsored by Claremont Republican Rep. Wayne Hemingway, sought to change that and create a new liquor license — “a tavern license” — in the state that allows bars to sell hard liquor, beer, and wine without serving food. However, that bill was tabled by the state Senate last week, which means senators didn’t kill it entirely but they’ve decided against approving it for now.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BarleyHouse-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Key things have changed since CT last exceeded the spending cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/ct-spending-cap-2007/,To say Connecticut's government is better prepared to handle a spending cap exception now than it was in 2007 is an understatement.,"Gov. Ned Lamont frustrated fiscal conservatives and progressives alike this week when he agreed to legally exceed Connecticut’s constitutional spending cap for the first time since 2007.
Republican legislators and others on the political right slammed the fiscally moderate governor, calling his action the first step down a path that would return Connecticut to the 2010s, an era marked by several state tax hikes.
But many of Lamont’s fellow Democrats and other liberals say the relief he approved was akin to sharing a few crumbs from a lavish table. The spending cap deal offered a tiny amount of temporary flexibility, allowing General Fund spending to increase by 1% extra — and only in the next budget. After that, the spending cap, which keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation, falls back in place. 
“This ‘emergency’ means that Gov. Lamont can no longer call himself a strong believer in the spending cap,” said Carol Platt Liebau, president of the Yankee Institute, a conservative policy group based in Hartford. “Is our leadership really telling us that not one single dollar can be cut from a state budget of $55.7 billion” proposed by the Appropriations Committee?
Meanwhile, progressives add, education, health care, social services, municipal aid and other core programs that have been slipping for years — or decades — will enjoy modest increases in some cases or lose ground in others.
“We refused to really deal with the future,” said Sen. Gary Winfield, a New Haven Democrat and a member of the Appropriations Committee. “I think, in fact, we’ve been completely irresponsible in this respect.”
CT finances are much healthier now than during last cap exception
To say state government is better prepared to handle a spending cap exception now than it was in 2007 is an understatement.
The first line of defense against any recession, the rainy day fund, is in far better shape. 
Connecticut entered the 2007-08 fiscal year with a nearly $1.4 billion in reserve, equal to about 8.5% of the General Fund, according to state budget records. It currently holds more than $4.1 billion or 18%.
Former Gov. M. Jodi Rell’s spending cap exception came in June 2007 as government prepared to close the fiscal year with a $269 million surplus equal to almost 2% of the budget. Lamont expects to wrap 2024-25 with $2.4 billion unspent, or 10%.
At first glance, the pension systems for state employees and municipal teachers almost two decades ago were in similar shape as the current ones. Analysts estimated Connecticut had enough assets to cover 62% of pension obligations to state retirees and 63% to teachers entering the 2007-08 fiscal year, compared to 56% and 62%, respectively, now.
But the state counted on an average annual return of 8.5% on its pension investments back then, very aggressive assumptions that inflated the funds’ values by billions of dollars. Connecticut has since lowered those expectations to 6.9% and crafted plans to retire pension debt more gradually by around 2050.
And Lamont and the General Assembly have made $8.6 billion in supplemental pension payments since 2020 using surplus dollars, on top of the more than $3 billion the state must contribute annually. Connecticut reduced pension debt faster than did any other state in 2022, analysts from The Pew Charitable Trusts reported earlier this year.
Unlike how it handles pensions, the state still doesn’t save the full amount needed to cover health care benefits retired to state employees. And by not doing so, it effectively shifts millions in costs, plus interest, onto future generations.
House Republicans chastised Lamont and majority Democrats last month for shorting this contractual obligation by $228 million in their respective budget proposals for the next two fiscal years. State Comptroller Sean Scanlon, a Democrat and former legislator, said this week he still hopes to mitigate that as he negotiates with the state’s Medicare Advantage insurance carrier.
But Connecticut didn’t pre-save anything to cover this benefit in 2007, nor would it require state employees to set aside anything else until 2009.
Further, concessions agreements with unions in 2011 and 2017 would expand those employee contributions, require the state to begin saving annually for retiree health care, and scale back program and pension benefits for future hires.
Lamont draws sharp response from conservatives
The Lamont administration recently pledged that the next state budget would not deviate from responsible fiscal principles that have been the governor’s hallmark since taking office in 2019.
“Our fiscal house has been rebuilt to weather an economic downturn,” said Jeffrey Beckham, Lamont’s budget director and secretary of the Office of Policy and Management. “Now is not the time to tear it down.”
Beckham added that the next two-year budget “must ensure that state spending is sustainable and will not lead to future tax increases or service cuts.”
Not everyone, though, shares the administration’s confidence.
“Get your pocketbooks, your wallets ready,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield said earlier this week, predicting Lamont’s cap exception would be the first step toward eventual fiscal chaos. “You’re going to give over more of your money [to] the state of Connecticut.”
Sen. Heather Somers of Groton, ranking GOP senator on the Appropriations Committee, said, “We have a governor who has literally folded like a lawn chair over this.”
Lamont, who told business leaders in mid-January that the spending cap was “sacrosanct,” has invalidated his fiscal credentials, according to the Yankee Institute.
Liebau noted that the $55.2 billion budget Lamont proposed for the upcoming biennium also maneuvered around the spending cap in other ways. The plan would shift $300 million outside the formal budget — and cap rules — to fund early childhood development. It also would borrow $60 million for a municipal grant to cover road repaving and winter snow removal. Borrowing and debt service payments also are outside the spending cap system.
“Connecticut’s residents and businesses can’t afford an increased tax burden,” Liebau added, “but after this, more taxes are what they should expect. This is no way to run a lemonade stand, much less a state.”
Rell launched big new investments. Lamont, not so much
Lamont also faces criticism, of a different kind, from progressive groups and many Democrats in the legislature’s majority.
The emergency he declared allowed legislators to spend $284 million more this fiscal year than the cap allowed, chiefly to cover a shortfall in the Medicaid program and ensure that health clinics, nonprofit social service agencies and other providers who treat the poor would be paid on time.
But Lamont could have used his declaration to also increase allowable spending in each of the next two fiscal years to grow by the same $284 million, plus roughly another 5% or $14 million.
He opted not to do so.
Instead, the administration pledged to allow legislators to carry about $255 million to $260 million of this fiscal year’s surplus into the coming biennial, giving them modest, temporary spending cap flexibility.
These carry-forward dollars originally were appropriated in this fiscal year, so spending them in either of the next two won’t count against cap limits in the coming biennium. But once those surplus dollars are spent, any extra spending cap room is gone.
Democrats already are making plans in the new budget they’re negotiating with Lamont to scale back planned increases in Medicaid rates and special education aid to K-12 schools. 
By early Thursday evening, Lamont still hadn’t announced a deal with SEIU 1199NE, which set a Tuesday strike deadline for about 6,400 workers serving 51 nursing homes and nearly 200 group homes. Union members work for private employers whose chief funding source is Medicaid payments, meaning the prospects of a strike hinge on state budget negotiations.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, predicted the private nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored social services, which already lose hundreds of millions annually because state payments haven’t matched inflation for years, will be disappointed with the new budget.
The reason, he said, is that the $255 million to $260 million one-time surplus transfer Lamont will allow in the next two-year budget is nowhere close to sufficient, or sustainable enough, to support the major investments many legislators insist are necessary.
Rell, however, launched two huge new investments in 2007 by allowing $690 million in over-cap spending in the first year of a biennial budget. Adjusted for inflation, that represents almost $1.1 billion in 2025 currency.
And Rell ordered that $690 million spending cap exception to continue in perpetuity. Based on cap rules, that extra spending capacity also increased annually, usually between 2% and 4%, to keep pace with growing household income or inflation.
Rell, a Republican, agreed with a Democratic-controlled legislature that this ongoing infusion of cash was needed to provide one of the largest increases in local education funding in state history, a $261 million boost over two years, which represents more than $400 million now after adjusting for inflation.
Officials in 2007 also ordered a $323 million annual increase in Medicaid payments to providers that treat the poor.
That investment, worth almost $500 million now, is the last across-the-board Medicaid rate hike the legislature has approved.
 A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states.
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest of West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee, joined other Democratic leaders in January calling for a $300 million annual investment in Medicaid by 2028-29, starting with a $75 million jump next fiscal year.
Gilchrest said she’s disappointed that legislators will settle for a more modest increase, not only because many poor patients no longer can find doctors willing to accept additional Medicaid patients but because of the huge piles of cash Connecticut holds.
Besides this year’s projected $2.4 billion surplus, which equals 10% of the General Fund, analysts project budget caps will capture at least about $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
Connecticut has funneled $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017 to build reserves and scale back pension debt, a furious pace that far outstrips any similar effort in modern history. But those unfunded pension obligations, which topped $35 billion entering this year, still aren’t projected to be retired until about 2050. 
Gilchrest and many other Democrats say health care, education and other programs can’t keep sacrificing this much money to debt reduction much longer, let alone for two more decades.
“We have not solved the spending cap issue because our budget is still not in a good place,” she added. “We are ignoring decades of underfunding for Medicaid. … I think members are looking to make a significant investment in our state this year, and we’re tired of hearing the governor say there’s not enough money when we know there is.”
Winfield and others say Connecticut has overcompensated for fiscal mistakes of prior decades and is saving excessively now at the expense of communities, schools, health care and vulnerable residents.
While Lamont points with pride to the large surpluses achieved during his tenure, critics say these weren’t inessential funds but rather were leeched from core programs that have been dangerously undermined.
“What we have done is break a promise to people by not talking about these [surplus] overages,” Winfield said. 
Emily Byrne, executive director of Connecticut Voices for Children, said the officials here cannot ignore the spending cap’s dysfunction, given the impending huge cuts to Medicaid and other federal assistance.
“When decisions from Washington, D.C., are increasing chaos and inflation, Connecticut has an opportunity to make life easier and more affordable for residents,” Byrne said. “But this requires bold action. At a time when families are struggling to put food on the table and pay for housing and health care costs, the spending cap shouldn’t be sacrosanct.”
Rell’s cap exception preceded a huge CT tax hike
Others say Rell and the 2007 General Assembly were irresponsible.
The governor originally proposed a state income tax hike to help pay for her education aid initiative but withdrew it that same year under pressure from her fellow Republicans in the legislature.
Aggressive spending wasn’t the only problem the state faced. But that, coupled with the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s, brought state finances crumbling down.
By June 2009, legislators had emptied state reserves, ordered a nearly $875 million tax hike and ran up nearly $1 billion in operating debt.
The bleeding didn’t stop there.
Democrat Dannel P. Malloy inherited a budget deficit of more than 18% when he became become governor in January 2011 and approved a tax hike estimated at more than $1.8 billion a year. Four years later, in 2015, they ordered another $670 million in tax increases while canceling or deferring about $225 million in previously approved tax cuts that hadn’t taken effect yet.
Lamont often urges legislators to remember Connecticut’s past mistakes. He says sustainable budgeting enabled them to two years ago to deliver the state’s first income tax rate cut since the mid-1990s, which saves middle-class households about $300 per year.
“At the core of Connecticut’s economic turnaround is predictability and affordability, after years in which difficult economic conditions combined with challenging budgets didn’t allow for much of either,” Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s communications director, said Thursday. “The governor is committed to ensuring that our spending and revenue remain sustainable and in sync, without creating the need to raise taxes in the future.”
Ritter, who brokered this year’s spending cap compromise with Lamont, also insists on sustainable budgeting.
But the speaker added that those who say programs are strained and investments are needed also aren’t wrong. Still, Connecticut pledged in its contracts with state bondholders not to broadly alter the spending cap or other fiscal controls before July 1, 2028, though more modest adjustments can be made.
“The spending cap is tough,” Ritter said, adding it’s uncertain whether the state can avoid more exceptions or other cap workarounds for three more years. “At some point, we’re going to have to make a decision.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Jodi-Rell-CT-Public-3-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

But they said they will face an uphill battle in order for the governor to consider their petition.
“We’re putting our heads together now to figure out what is the best way to make a change here in Rankin County,” said the Rev. Ricky Sutton, of Mount Carmel Ministries in Pearl. Sutton said Gaines “doesn’t represent the people, and we don’t really need someone in office like that.”
At a May 3 breakfast meeting, Gaines told a crowd of 100 people that the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department’s lawyer, Jason Dare, “beat the pants off those guys – the dopers, the people that raped and doped your daughters.” Two days earlier, Dare had announced the department and county would pay $2.5 million to settle the civil rights case brought by the two men tortured by Rankin “Goon Squad” deputies.
Addressing the outrage following his remarks, Gaines said his comments “were not aimed at anyone personally,” and that he “did not name any individuals.”
The petition effort also follows supervisors’ approval in April and rescission this month of an unpopular zoning ordinance that would have restricted the placement of mobile homes and required rural residents to seek a planning commission’s consent for add-ons to their property, among other changes. 
The Rev. Ava Harvey, of Pilgrim’s Rest Missionary Baptist Church in Brandon, described the ordinance as an “overreach,” but said Gaines’ comments “pulled the scab off” as county residents seek to heal from the reign of the “Goon Squad.” 
Harvey said the group of 30 has hired a lawyer to comb through state law and advise them on the “tedious” petition process.
While the removal of most elected county officials, including sheriffs, requires the signatures of 30% of all registered voters in the county, there’s a higher bar – 51% of registered voters in a district – to remove a county supervisor, justice court judge or constable.
There are 20,958 registered voters in Rankin County’s fourth district, which means that a petition for Gaines’ removal would need 10,689 signatures, more than the number of voters who participated in the last supervisors’ election in that district.. In 2023, 9,965 voters cast ballots in the supervisor election for District 4 – and Gaines won with more than 75% of the vote. 
“For whatever reason,” said Korbin Felder, a Justice Fellow at the Center for Constitutional Rights, “those three positions within all county governance are carved out from it.”
Fifty-one percent of voters from the district the supervisor represents “is an incredibly high bar,” Felder said. 
The law requires the petition to be submitted on a specific size and type of paper, and each page must be notarized to show that the signatures were collected within 60 days.
“You can tell it’s written by people who are already in office, and they don’t want anybody to remove them,” Harvey said.
Once the signatures are collected and verified by the county registrar, the petition must be submitted to the election commissioner’s clerk. The governor must then consider and count the verified signatures, and if they meet the 51% bar, the supervisor in question would be served notice to show cause as to why a removal election ought not to be held. The governor would then convene a “removal council” headed by the county’s senior chancery judge to determine whether there is a substantial basis for a removal election. If they determine that there is, a removal election would then be conducted. Only after a successful removal election would the governor declare the supervisor’s office vacant, and appoint a temporary replacement. 
“It’s a long process that seems to be meant to disincentivize citizens from using this power,” Felder said.
But the citizens working on the petition expressed a commitment to try and push for a successful petition despite these challenges. 
In addition to door-knocking, Harvey said, the group is considering establishing drop-in stations where registered voters in the district can sign the petition at certain times.
Laura Faulker, a Rankin County activist, said that even if the petition fails, she hopes the effort will raise awareness about the importance of holding local elected officials like Gaines accountable.
“I thought that he stood behind what people voted him in for, to make a change for the good, not to speak down on victims,” Faulkner said.
Sutton expressed fear that his grandsons could be stopped by deputies one night, and stereotyped like Jenkins and Parker were, “just because they wear dreads or maybe earrings,” he said. “Until we change this mentality, I think we’re going to continue to have problems in Rankin County, and I just refuse to go back.”
Though Rankin deputies appear to have targeted people based on suspected drug use, not race — most of their accusers were white — their tactics were reminiscent of the Jim Crow era, when sheriffs and their deputies harassed and beat Black Southerners and civil rights activists.
“It’s really not just a Black and white thing,” Sutton said. “This is a right and wrong thing.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/15104139/IMG_0496.jpg,,,2025-05-23 06:02:10.442938

North Carolina hardly needs any more wake-up calls about the devastating impacts of climate change, but a new, must-see PBS/NPR documentary provides another powerful reminder on the subject of dealing with the extreme weather that climate change is spawning.
The documentary is entitled “Hurricane Helene’s Deadly Warning,” and in it, NPR’s Laura Sullivan exposes a wasteful and vicious cycle that has come to dominate how our state and nation deal with natural disasters. It’s one in which the federal government spends more than $50 billion every year to help communities recover from disasters, but that frequently includes properties that have already flooded repeatedly.
This cycle is now on full display in western North Carolina where politicians and the construction industry are resisting common sense rules that would govern how new buildings are sited and constructed.
The bottom line: “Hurricane Helene’s Deadly Warning,” should be required viewing and listening for all elected leaders and average Americans. Look for it online at PBS or NPR.

Revised data released Thursday show the situation’s even worse than that.
While 191 closings were originally reported for 2024, the pharmacy board on Thursday revised that number 13% upward, to 215. 
“This included 19 independent, 14 small chain (2-11 stores), and 182 large chain pharmacies (12+ stores),” the board said in a written statement. “Board of Pharmacy licensing data also shows 35 closings in 2025, including five hospital outpatient, 17 independent, six small chain, and seven large chain pharmacies. Further, revised figures show the number of retail pharmacies declining in Ohio from a high of 2,218 in 2015 to 1,799 in 2024, a reduction of 19 percent.”
To healthy suburbanites, the loss of pharmacies might not seem pressing.
But for those lacking good transportation and medical access, the neighborhood pharmacist is more than a place to get medicine. It’s also an opportunity to consult with a medical professional about chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. 
The loss of isolated pharmacies creates deserts, and they’re growing. In Meigs County in Southeastern Ohio, for example, nearly 40% of the census tracts are part of what the pharmacy board terms pharmacy deserts.

“Pharmacies are essential for maintaining the health and safety of our citizens,” Ohio Board of Pharmacy Executive Director Steven W. Schierholt said in a written statement Thursday afternoon. “We hope that this data can provide much needed insight to improve access to pharmacy services throughout Ohio.”
Independent and small-chain pharmacies have for years complained that the practices of huge health conglomerates that own pharmacy middlemen, big health insurers and their own pharmacy operations are driving them out of business. In January, the Federal Trade Commission released an interim report saying that the conglomerates’ practices appeared to show that the small pharmacies have a valid point.
The board of pharmacy website says that 331 independent and 180 small-chain pharmacies have closed in Ohio since 2012, for a total of 511. Over the same period, 544 large-chain pharmacies have closed, but the pattern has been starkly different. 
Closures of independent and small-chain pharmacies have stayed within a 30-store range each year since 2012. From 2012 through 2023, a total of 355 large-chain pharmacies closed. Then in 2024, a whopping 182 more did.
The vast majority of those are owned by Rite Aid, which has twice declared bankruptcy and closed hundreds of stores in Ohio and Michigan. 
Also, Walgreens was in the process of closing thousands of its stores in March when it sold itself to a private-equity firm. Many more closures are expected — especially in already-underserved areas.
At the time, Dave Burke, a former state senator who is now executive director of the Ohio Pharmacists Association, said things have gotten so bad that Congress has no choice but to take dramatic action.
“Probably one of the best things that happened in pharmacy was Walgreens saying, ‘We just can’t take it anymore,’” he said. “I think we’re at a point of inflection. It’s slow-moving, but I think we’re there. If I were (part of the private equity group) I would probably buy Walgreens as well because we are at rock bottom. If this goes any lower, I don’t know where people get their prescriptions. We have a health crisis at that point.”

(Getty Images)Treatment for substance use disorders is a vital service that is critical for the health and well-being of our state. However, as the state considers budget proposals, important and effective mechanisms that fund treatment for substance use disorders have been targeted as a way to meet other budgetary needs. Important services such as outpatient treatment, partial hospitalization, and residential treatment could be at risk of becoming a casualty of the state’s budget. 
How could this happen? To understand this, it is important to first understand how treatment for substance use disorders is funded in New Hampshire.
Much of New Hampshire’s substance use disorder treatment has been funded by the Alcohol Abuse, Prevention, and Treatment Fund (better known as the “Alcohol Fund”) and the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. The Alcohol Fund was created in law in 2000, with the intent of dedicating 5% of gross profits of state liquor sales toward substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery programs and services. The Opioid Abatement Trust Fund started in 2020 and utilizes money gained from legal settlements with drug companies to fund the treatment of opioid use disorder. These funding mechanisms were meant to be sustainable and ensure that these life-saving treatments would be available for any Granite Staters who need it.
While Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s budget proposal includes full funding for the Alcohol Fund, it also proposes to utilize money from the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund to pay for police overtime and drug enforcement operations in the North Country. The House of Representatives, on the other hand, proposes to utilize money from the Alcohol Fund in other areas of the budget and then backfill this money using the Opioid Abatement Trust Fund. 
While both proposals do maintain funding for the Alcohol Fund, each could have devastating consequences. Under both proposals, access to care for those seeking treatment for substance use disorders in New Hampshire is jeopardized. 
In shifting these funding sources, both budget options propose to take dedicated funds from the Opioid Abatement Fund. Regardless of how the state proposes to divert these funds, this would dramatically change the programs and services available here in New Hampshire for treatment of other substance use disorders, such as alcohol use disorder or stimulant use disorders. From 2019-2022, nearly a third of drug overdose deaths were not related to opioids. Thus, defunding the treatment of other substance use disorders could lead to more lives lost to the potentially fatal consequences of untreated substance use disorders. 
Treatment for substance use disorders amounts to more than dollars and cents — there is a real human cost too. The New Hampshire Drug Overdose Fatality Review Commission reports that from 2019-2022, 1,572 people in New Hampshire died due to drug overdose. Of these people, 1,402 (about 90%) either had no evidence of substance use disorder treatment or were not currently receiving treatment. Those that were in treatment at the time of their death comprised fewer than 10% of those who died. This serves as a stark reminder that treatment works, and treatment saves lives.

There is overlap with the bills. Both pieces of legislation would regulate online gambling through the Ohio Casino Control Commission and internet gambling would start by March 31. 
Nearly all of the tax proceeds from internet gambling would go to the state’s general revenue fund and 1% would go to the Problem Gambling Fund. Both bills only allow an Ohio casino or racino to be licensed as an internet gambling operator. Someone would have to be at least 21 and physically in Ohio to participate in internet gambling. 
The lawmakers behind these bills say Ohioans are already participating illegally in online gambling.  
“It is important to highlight that online gambling is already occurring in the state of Ohio,” Manning said during his sponsor testimony last week in the Senate Select Committee on Gaming. “It is difficult to quantify an exact number, but it is clear there is significant illegal online gambling going on in the state, as there was illegal sports betting before it was legalized.”
Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia all have legalized online gambling. 
Senate Bill 197 
The 700-page bill would authorize three types of online gambling — internet gambling, iLottery, and online betting on horse racing. 
The bill levies a 36% tax on an operator’s internet gambling receipts. There would be a $50 million initial fee and a $5 million renewal fee for Ohio casinos and racinos. Manning predicts this could generate at least $500 million per year for Ohio. 
S.B. 197 would move all Ohio gambling regulations under the Ohio Casino Control Commission. This would nix the State Racing Commission and the Casino Control Commission would take over their responsibilities. 
Ohio Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, questioned the horse racing aspect of the bill.
“I don’t think the Casino Control Commissioner knows anything about how to regulate horse racing,” he said. 
In response, Ryan Soultz, vice president of governmental affairs for Boyd Gaming Corporation, said other states have found a way to have one regulatory body that oversees both. 
Trevor Hayes, vice president of government relations for Caesars Digital, supports the bill.   
“Our experience shows that regulated iGaming provides a significant new source of state tax revenue, provides consumers with a strictly regulated and fair gaming option, and protects vulnerable populations,” he said this week to the Senate Select Committee on Gaming. 
House Bill 298
When compared to the senate bill, H.B. 298 is smaller in scope. It would not allow online Ohio Lottery games nor would it legalize online betting on horse racing. 
“This bill would authorize Ohio to take the next logical step in generating state revenue by authorizing internet gambling in the state of Ohio,” Stewart said this week to the House Finance Committee. “It’s reasonable to take the next logical step, technological step, and allow Ohioans to play these games online, as well as in person.” 
The bill would impose a 28% tax on internet gambling receipts, which is the same as Michigan. 
Stewart and John estimate this could general between $400-$800 million a year in revenue. 
“There’s a lot of things that we want to do in the state of Ohio that require increased revenues,” John said. “This is one way that we can go about expanding the consumer base of players who prefer an online setting.”
Democratic lawmakers raised concerns in committee that this could lead to more people under 21 participating illegally in online gambling.
“If we can bring regulations to this market, then it is my feeling that we will be able to help, hopefully, curb the underage participation,”  John said. 
There are more than 250,000 problem gamblers in Ohio and 1 in 5 problem gamblers attempt suicide, said Ohio state Rep. Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati. This data is from the 2022 Ohio Gambling Survey.
“Where is the line?” Isaacsohn asked. “At what point do we say this isn’t worth it anymore, that it’s not worth the additional revenue that could fund a tax cut or a stadium or whatever else it goes towards.”
John said regulating online gaming could help put measures in place to help people “before they get to the point of making a decision that they can’t return from.”

(Photo by Joe Zimmermann/Maryland Department of Natural Resources)Blue crab abundance in the Chesapeake Bay this year was at its second-lowest level since winter dredge surveys began in 1990, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
But the department is holding strong on the current harvest regulations, said Mandy Bromilow, blue crab program manager at the department.
“We’re still OK,” Bromilow said. “It’s not ideal, but it’s not something where we’re super concerned.”
That’s partly because the low levels did not fall below a key threshold of 72.5 million spawning-age female crabs. At 108 million, this year’s figure was below the department’s target of 196 million, but it didn’t hit rock bottom.
Scientists at DNR say that a harsh winter may be to blame, with cold snaps capable of killing off crabs bedding down for the season. The numbers of male, female and juvenile crabs all declined in 2025’s survey, conducted from December through March. The total figure was 238 million crabs — compared to 317 million crabs the year before.
But the department is also awaiting the results from a fuller assessment of the blue crab stock, due out next spring, that promises to reshape the way the beloved crustacean is managed throughout the Chesapeake. It will be the first major stock assessment for the species since 2011.
The assessment doesn’t involve any additional surveys out on the water, but rather an in-depth review of existing data, with the goal of determining not only the overall health of the population, but the reasons for its fluctuations.
Chesapeake Bay oyster population stays strong, but budget cuts sow concern

Scientists already know that the blue crabs are highly sensitive to factors like water temperature, and they only live for a few years, so the population can experience “boom and bust” cycles. But lately, the “busts” seem to keep coming, with six straight years of a below-average population of juvenile crabs. The lowest total population recorded by the survey since 1990 was just a few years ago, in 2022.
“Layered on top of those natural annual fluctuations, there are some additional somewhat unclear or mysterious factors that many hypothesize are influencing the blue crab population,” said Allison Colden, Maryland executive director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
Could it be the high population of invasive — and hungry — blue catfish gobbling up young crabs? Could it be water pollution depressing the growth of underwater grasses — a critical shelter protecting crabs from predators? Or might it be a question of climate change harming blue crabs by altering their ecosystem?
“We know the temperatures are increasing. We know that the timing of different algae blooms and other important cycles within the Chesapeake Bay is changing,” Colden said. “The relative impact of each one of those factors is something we hope that Maryland and Virginia will be able to investigate and address through the upcoming stock assessment.”
Bromilow noted that Maryland has taken action in response to the declining trend. For example, in 2022, when the population reached its nadir, the department set the first-ever bushel limits for male crabs, shifting a management strategy that had focused on females. The department has kept the limits in place since then. But the population hasn’t responded accordingly. The number of adult male crabs fell from 46 million in 2024 to 26 million in 2025 — a record low.
“The changes that we’re making — we’re not really seeing a response, and so it seems likely that there’s something else going on, like the environmental factors,” Bromilow said.
The stock assessment will bring in scientific literature, computer modeling, and years worth of winter dredge data, and it could yield a changed paradigm for blue crab management in the bay, including for male crabs, Bromilow said. The assessment is produced by scientists from institutions such as the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science, as well as natural resources departments such as Maryland’s.

“The threshold or target could change, or we could learn that maybe males are more important than we thought previously, and there needs to be maybe a male reference point,” Bromilow said. “But we don’t know that just yet.”
In a news release, the Bay Foundation called the 2025 numbers “distressing” and called for Maryland to maintain bushel limits for male crabs, and increase protection for female crabs, “including reducing the importation of egg bearing ‘sponge’ crabs from Virginia.”
“Reducing harvest overall — and managing conservatively until we have the stock assessment — is probably a good idea, considering the trends we’ve been seeing over the past five to six years,” Colden said.
The Bay Foundation is calling on Virginia to decrease its harvest, and “consider additional protections for males,” because of the historically low density this year, which fell below 2022’s figure of 26 million. The foundation also renewed its calls for the federal government to maintain funding for clean water initiatives at agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, citing their benefits for blue crabs.
Rob Newberry, a waterman and chairman of the Delmarva Fisheries Association, said Thursday that he wasn’t surprised by the bad results this year, given the tough winter, with temperatures that quickly plummeted and stayed cold, shocking crabs buried in the mud.
East Coast fishery managers remain vigilant over status of Atlantic striped bass

“All the sudden the water [temperature] drops. Well, they’re dormant, and they can’t bury any deeper,” Newberry said. “They get clobbered.”
Brian Nesspor, a Rock Hall crabber known by the nickname “Beefalo” or “Beef,” said he’s expecting an “average” year for the blue crab harvest. He’s optimistic about the number of young crabs, in part because he’s heard good news from fellow watermen who target clams on the bay bottom.
They’ve seen more little crabs on their conveyor belts than crabbers see in their crab pots, which have a bigger mesh that allows small crabs to escape, Nesspor said.
“The report has been from them that it’s a very good banner crop of small crabs,” Nesspor, who is a member of Maryland’s Tidal Fisheries Advisory Commission.
Nesspor has doubts about the baywide winter dredge survey. He argues that the sites selected for the survey each year may fail to capture the changing behavior of wintering blue crabs.
Each year, the surveyors randomly select 1,500 sites in the bay with water deeper than 5 feet for the survey, which DNR conducts alongside the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, according to its website. Nesspor has suggested that the department add one extra site per county suggested by watermen, based on the conditions they observe in the estuary. But he said he has been turned down.
“The crabs are bedding farther north. They’re in shallower water,” Nesspor said. “Everything is changing in the bay. Mother Nature is way ahead of us.”
Newberry shares the skepticism about the methodology.
“It’s not like counting sheep in a field,” he said. “There’s a little bit of a difficult problem here: They’re underwater, and you’re not.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Blue-crab-2024-winter-survey-scaled-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

(Photo by Troy Bennett / Maine Morning Star)About a decade ago, a Topsham-area school district became concerned about how often staff members physically restrained students who were acting out and put them in seclusion rooms, especially the district’s 500 or so special education students. 
Those tactics are only supposed to be used in emergencies under state law, but at the time, Maine School Administrative District (MSAD) 75 recorded 176 restraints and 152 seclusions on just 15 students, according to district-level data shared with Maine Morning Star. Staff were routinely scratched and bruised in the process, said Amy Hall, the district’s special education director.


May 21: Restraint and seclusion are only supposed to be used on students in emergency situations. Accounts from families and educators show how districts’ interpretation of state law vary widely and how traumatic the experiences can be.
May 22: State data reveals only a fraction of Maine’s schools and districts are consistently reporting incidents of restraint and seclusion in violation of state law. Even with the underreporting, Maine schools are relying on these practices thousands of times per year.
May 23: How one district worked with researchers to change its approach to student behavior and significantly reduced the use of restraint and seclusion

“We started to get very concerned about the level of staff injuries, student injuries, and just the level of crisis we were dealing with in our schools,” Hall said. 
So in 2018, the district decided to pursue an alternative. Today, because staff members now view student behavioral issues as a problem to prevent and solve, rather than an infraction to punish — and because of a significant investment in training to execute that shift in mindset — the 2,350-student district’s use of restraint and seclusion is down to the single digits: two restraints and seven seclusions in the 2022-23 school year.
The Maine Department of Education is touting that success story in the hope that more districts will sign onto MSAD 75’s approach and rely less on restraint and seclusion — when a staff member temporarily immobilizes a student and places them alone in a room until they calm down. Research has shown that the tactics “are not effective in altering a student’s behavior and that the experience of being restrained and secluded can be traumatizing and cause lasting effects for students,” according to the Maine DOE website. The state and some school districts have worked to reduce their use for years due to staff and student injuries.
The model MSAD 75 turned to was developed by a Maine-based nonprofit, Lives in the Balance, that works nationally and has been adopted by a handful of other districts — including the much larger Fairfax Public Schools in Virginia — to dramatically reduce their use of restraint and seclusion.
But despite that model’s success, it has not been widely adopted across Maine, according to Ben Jones, director of the organization’s legal and policy initiatives. Although Lives in the Balance has offered free technical assistance to districts since 2022 through a state Department of Education partnership, Jones said only two districts have followed up on the offer. 
Sarah Wilkinson, an assistant professor of special education at the University of Southern Maine who recently co-authored a report on student behavior, said the state is failing to provide adequate assistance to districts to make sure these tools can be implemented properly. 
“Any one of these programs would decrease the behavioral crises, and then need for seclusion or restraint. But part of the issue there is that the state doesn’t really have the infrastructure to support implementation,” Wilkinson said. 
In response to questions about state support, Chloe Teboe, a spokesperson for Maine DOE, said the department provides resources such as monthly office hours, one-on-one consultations, mentoring and regular training, available for districts that want them.  
“What works in Falmouth isn’t going to work in Machias or Fort Kent, and that’s where folks at the district level need support to implement these approaches in a way that works for their population,” Wilkinson said.
Since 2021, Maine has limited the circumstances under which school staff can restrain and seclude students through a change in state law that aimed to nudge districts away from their frequent use. But recent complaints of worsening student behavior since the pandemic led to an effort to loosen those restrictions, which disability rights advocates fear could result in a spike. 
The Topsham-area district, MSAD 75, is seeing that same increase in extreme behavior among younger students, Hall said, but relaxing the law on restraint and seclusion is not the answer. 
“The mental health needs of our population of students have increased, while restraints and seclusions have dramatically decreased,” she said. 
Instead, Hall advocates for educators to rethink how they view behavior. Most kids will do well in school if they can. Problems with behavior often signal a response to an underlying problem that educators need to uncover and address, she said.
“If a kid is not doing well, then we need to shift the way that we’re working with that student,” Hall said. “Once we get to a restraint or in a seclusion, you’re way too late.”
Changing how schools think about student behavior
The founder of Lives in the Balance, Ross Greene, a child clinical psychologist and former Harvard Medical School faculty member, came up with the model based on a mindset shift that MSAD 75 adopted.
Greene’s approach helps schools address what he calls “concerning behaviors” without resorting to punitive measures, based on the idea that when children struggle with frustration, refuse to follow instructions, or can’t keep up academically or socially, their response is to act out.
“I get it, those behaviors are dangerous and scary and disruptive, but they’re communicating the exact same thing — they’re having difficulty meeting a particular expectation,” he said. 
Rather than respond with punishment or continue to demand compliance, educators can work with the child to identify and address the underlying problems. By temporarily adjusting expectations and focusing on solving problems, educators can prevent behavioral issues from escalating and build students’ skills so they can meet expectations in the future, Greene said.
“The problem is that a lot of adults, not just in schools, see a kid who’s having difficulty meeting an expectation as being noncompliant, and what they do is they shoot for compliance,” he said.
Greene’s Collaborative and Proactive Solutions model has been studied in students with significant behavioral challenges, including nonverbal students and students with oppositional defiant disorder, and those studies have found the model leads to notable improvements.
One district that’s advocating to loosen the state’s restraint and seclusion law, MSAD 11 in Gardiner, said it considered Greene’s model but worries that the approach is not enough to address increased reports of aggressive student behavior.
“Given that we’ve almost never experienced the type of dysregulation we’re seeing in very early learners, I am not confident that only going down the proactive pathway is a solution to the current context and climate that we are in,” said Angela Hardy, the district’s director of curriculum and instruction. 
In the upcoming school year, Hardy said the district will try to implement some strategies that worked for MSAD 75 and that Greene advocates for, such as designing a learning environment that helps prevent incidents. 
Classroom design as prevention
A special education teacher at the time, Samantha Lapointe started thinking that restraints and seclusions were no longer an option when MSAD 75 first made the change, even though the law permits their use in emergencies. 
“It’s hard to imagine how you would do business without those tools, until you commit to thinking about not having them,” said Lapointe, who is now the district’s elementary special education coordinator. “That leads to a lot of thinking about what to do instead — and that leads you into new territory, right around what new skillsets need to be stronger, what prevention strategies need to be stronger.”
Classroom design is one element of prevention, Lapointe said. The idea is to minimize any danger in case a student acts out — and reduce the need for staff to physically intervene.
She started working with students on the floor, then brought in a sofa. When the school got new furniture, she requested two heavy, communal tables instead of individual desks that students could easily move or overturn. The tables also had to be low to the ground so students climbing atop them would not be in danger. And Lapointe hung all the posters high enough so elementary students couldn’t rip them off the walls. Staff also locked the closet that stored toys and activities.
“I’ve still had kids climb on tables, and I’ve had to ask myself, how dangerous is this really?” she said. “Is it an extreme, imminent risk of harm if they fall? You should be constantly weighing out what really constitutes danger to the extent that you would need to go hands-on.”
The other piece was training ed techs — aides who often work one-on-one with students — in the new approach. 
“Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand,” Lapointe said. “The way you talk to kids matters a lot.”










Adults spend a lot of time directing and correcting, and they need to spend time asking questions, seeking to understand. The way you talk to kids matters a lot.


– Samantha Lapointe, MSAD 75 elementary special education coordinator


If a student tries to leave the classroom, for example, instead of stopping them, staff can start a conversation by asking them where they’re going, what they need to leave for and what their plan is after leaving, she said. Meanwhile, she also trained her staff to ask themselves: “What can I tolerate? Why can’t they leave the classroom? What’s the worst that’s going to happen?” 
“The level of thinking and intentional decision-making needs to be very high, and that’s one thing also that I train my staff in: intentionality,” Lapointe said. “You must ask yourself, before you say anything, before you do anything: What is it you’re going to say or do and why? What outcome are you hoping to get?”
That’s the kind of training Maine teachers are asking for and largely not receiving, said Wilkinson with the University of Southern Maine.
“Teachers or ed techs will report, ‘We’ve been safety-care trained, we’ve had de-escalation training’ … all of these things that really only happen when a behavior gets to a certain point,” Wilkinson said. “That means that the behavior has to get to that point before they have the skills to deal with it. Teachers are not reporting that they’re confident with all of the things you would do before the behavior escalates.”
Even in the Topsham-area district, the training in Collaborative and Proactive Solutions isn’t complete. Lapointe said it’s now a priority to expand beyond special education to general education classroom teachers and higher grades.
A new approach
The Topsham-area district combines Greene’s model with Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports, or PBIS — a research-based model used in schools across the country that’s built around positive reinforcement of good behavior and gradually increasing levels of intervention and consequences for kids who misbehave. 
This is how the combination of the two models could look.
In the library, the expectation for all students is that they keep their voices low and read, Hall said. PBIS lays out a system to reinforce positive behavior, often through small rewards, and address infractions. But Greene’s approach would come into play if a student can’t keep quiet in the library, she said.
It may be that the child can’t focus, keep still, has sensory issues, or is too stimulated in that setting. Instead of punishing the child, teachers try to problem solve: They might offer them headphones, move their reading time to a quiet classroom, or even allow the child to leave the library, Hall said.
Moving away from demanding compliance from students helps educators understand and work with them to solve the issue underlying the behavior, instead of an outburst or aggression stemming from it, she said.
“Instead of just asking them to do the same thing over again and sustain in an environment that they can’t, you try to figure out what’s behind the behavior,” Hall said. “We still have rewards, and kids still have consequences, but the consequences just aren’t, ‘We’re going to put you in a seclusion room.’ Because that’s not a consequence, that’s a crisis response.”

(Photo by WEWS.)An Ohio bill would restrict government entities from discussing election information during the 30 days before the election. This would prohibit school districts from acknowledging their levies while early voting occurs.
Public school districts in Ohio have been facing challenges.
“We had a lot of levies that went down,” retired teacher Will Vickery said. “As a result, we’re seeing rifts of teachers, we’re seeing ending of programs, we’re seeing sports cut, we’re seeing busing change and only offered to kindergarten through 4th grade.”
Voter education is an important step in passing school levies, Vickery added. But he is worried about a new House bill that would limit communication ahead of elections.
“They have 11 other months of the year to provide information to their citizens,” state Rep. Adam Mathews, R-Lebanon, said.
Mathews and state Rep. Tex Fischer, R-Boardman, introduced H.B. 264, which would prohibit government entities from referring to — even without saying how to vote — a levy, bond issue, or candidate during early voting, the 30 days before an election.
“Making sure that their taxpayer dollars are used for the governing of their entities rather than influencing elections,” Mathews continued.
Current law already bans public jurisdictions from taking partisan stances on issues. This would extend that provision to now prohibit the agency from providing information, explanation, or viewing.
The following would be prohibited from being sent by a government entity in the 30 days before the election: a notice, placard, advertisement, brochure, flyer, direct mailer, newsletter, electronic message, internet article or advertisement, or other form of general publication that communicates information about the plans, policies, and operations of a state agency, political subdivision, or public official to members of the public. This doesn’t include individual correspondence with a constituent.
Some candidates, if they already hold a public office, could send excessive mailers to keep their name top of mind, he added. State lawmakers already have this prohibition.
“Mail will go out and say ‘Look at how great our local jurisdiction is doing;’ it does not say vote, it does not say re-elect, it does not say any of those things,” the legislator said. “But it definitely leaves a positive impression on whoever is receiving that mail, and we want to make sure that there are clean lines.”
Since 2018, Parma City Schools has had its levies fail 7 times, including earlier this month. Superintendent Charles Smialek said that under this bill, he would not be able to email their families to acknowledge the existence of a levy or even address school finance.
“We know that we can’t campaign, but we should absolutely be allowed to inform,” Smialek said. “At some point, it’s infringing upon freedom of speech.”
Mathews denied this, saying that candidates or campaigns would be able to use personal money.
“You can still obviously campaign as long as you do it on your own time with your own money,” he said. “They had other months to discuss their financials.”
There are some exceptions to the bill. If a school district website already has an explainer on what the levy is ahead of the 30-day blackout period, they don’t need to take it down.
As far as how the boards of elections would handle this bill, Mathews responded that it would allow for some communication deemed “incredibly timely.” However, nonpartisan Case Western Reserve University elections law professor Atiba Ellis couldn’t find this in the legislation.
“I know of no evidence of a problem that would require such a sweeping rule that has the potential to restrict government entities from performing their due tasks,” Ellis said.
The secretary of state’s office would still be allowed to conduct “voter education programs” even when the incumbent appears on the ballot, according to the bill.
“This over-inclusion problem can’t necessarily be solved by the exemption that was written,” Ellis said.
According to Mathews, Ohio Sec. of State Frank LaRose has been sent the language.
“Our team is currently reviewing the legislation and will continue to monitor and have conversations with legislative members as the bill progresses through the legislative process,” LaRose’s spokesperson Ben Kindel said.
Ellis also brought up freedom of speech concerns, which Vickery echoed.
“You got to be able to keep the people informed, and it’s their right to know,” the retired teacher said. “If they’re going to vote no, fine, vote no. But understand the potential consequences.”

[…]","The columnist's son, Baxter, runs across a field in New Hampshire in September 2013. He just graduated from middle school this week. (Clay Wirestone/Kansas Reflector) My eighth grader graduated from middle school on Wednesday, and I’m not sure how I feel about it.
You raise a child, care for them for years as they can barely speak or take care of themselves, and then they go and grow up. Our son now looms over my husband. He’s nearly my height. And he shows disturbing signs of independent thought.
That’s a joke, of course. Still, sitting in a packed gymnasium proved unexpectedly emotional. I was watching my child grow up, along with more than 200 of his peers.
I watched for others who couldn’t be there. My mother died 14 years ago this June, three months after our son was born. She was so excited to see pictures, to chat via videoconference. At the time, we lived in New Hampshire, while she lived in Kansas. She was never able to meet her grandson in person. And she was never able to tell me how quickly the time passes from late elementary school to the end of middle school — how in the space of three or four years, a little kid transforms into a towering teen.
I wish she could be there. But like much that we wish for ourselves and our loved ones and our lives, that’s not possible. My brother and sister were there, though, and they supported and congratulated their nephew after the ceremony.
We take life’s moments as they come, enjoy what we can, and move forward.
 
Grief and strength
Scanning social media, a message stood out. Paraphrased, the meme stated that grief encompasses more than sadness after someone passes away. We grieve when we lose something, and that needn’t be a life. We can grieve friendships, careers, politics, the passage of time.
I have felt so much grief over the past couple of years, grief that at times threatens to overwhelm me.
I have grieved watching state politics, as LGBTQ+ Kansans were ruthlessly targeted by lawmakers. I have grieved as institutions once thought unassailable, impervious to tampering, shuddered in the face of dime-store authoritarianism. I have grieved as I realized that I’m no longer the twentysomething who bounced right back from setbacks and disappointments. I have grieved watching others around me mourn the loss of a society they thought they understood.
At one time, I believed that age strengthened you. That as the years pass, you grow stronger and better equipped to face the world. I’m not sure that’s true. If anything, in recent days I’ve felt more vulnerable, more fearful, more uncertain.
All that mourning makes celebration difficult. My son heads to high school in a profoundly unsettled time, one in which politics and technology and social upheaval pose existential threats. I want to protect him. I want to vanquish these griefs, for his generation if not for my own.
Yet as I just write, that’s not possible. We live how we live and we have what we have. We can try our best — I can try my best — and the world around us still falls short.
Others have departed recently, others whose perspective and wisdom I would have valued. My former colleague at the University Daily Kansan, Andy Obermueller, would have offered dry and cynical takes. My former bosses and friends at the Concord Monitor in New Hampshire, Mike Pride and Mark Travis, would have drawn on their journalistic wisdom. My high school history teacher, Robert Nellis, would have cited battles from World War II.
The world would better and stronger if all these men were still in it.
 
Love and life
But I can’t leave this column in a pit of despair. My mother didn’t raise me that way.
We still live in a nation of wealth and opportunity. We still live in a state packed with caring, creative people of all ages. We can still make changes for the better, even if they do only a fraction of what we imagine.
I don’t know what the future brings. I do know, however, the love I feel for my son and family. I know how much love my mother, gone these many years, felt for us. Love may not make the world go round. It may not solve societal problems. But our lives don’t amount to much without it.
Despite my grief these past years, I’ve also found incredible joy. My husband and child help with that, of course. So do the multitudes of Kansas Reflector readers who have attended our town halls, sent along email messages of support and opened our newsletters every morning. So does the recognition that we all of us share the gift of existence, forming another link on the great chain of human life from the far past to the distant future.
An small, ceramic urn of my mother’s ashes sits on a bookcase in our living room. When I told my son that I was going to write about his graduation, and that I was sad his grandmother couldn’t be there, he replied immediately.
“She could have been there,” he said. “You just needed to carry her in.”
I chuckled, but of course he was right. I could have. I just wasn’t looking at the situation the right way.
Amid whatever mourning and grief we carry right now, let’s find a way to celebrate milestones while remembering those who brought us here. And may that whole ball of emotion, bound together by love, bounce us into whatever future comes.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio continues to rank terribly in nearly every way possible, according to the latest state rankings from the U.S. News & World Report.
The Buckeye State slid two more spots in the report’s latest rankings of the 50 states, moving from No. 36 in the 2023 report to No. 38 in the latest iteration.
In addition to ranking No. 38 overall, Ohio also ranks No. 41 in natural environment, No. 41 in higher education, No. 39 in economy, No. 34 in health care, No. 30 in crime and corrections, No. 30 in education overall, No. 30 in infrastructure, and No. 25 in fiscal stability.
On only one metric, opportunity, does Ohio crack the top half of states, at No. 17.
The U.S. News & World Report has been ranking the states since 2017, and Ohio has bounced around the bottom states in America that entire time.
In 2017, we were No. 35. In 2018, we dropped to No. 40. The year of 2019 saw us roaring back to No. 39. After no rankings in 2020, we came in at No. 36 in 2021 and climbed mightily to No. 34 by 2023 before dropping back down to No. 36 last year and now No. 38 this year.
Before anyone starts howling with indignation about how horribly unfair and biased the U.S. News & World Report must be, I’ll note that the No. 1 ranked state for three years running is Utah — not exactly a bastion of crunchy liberal thinking.
So no, these aren’t politicized rankings: Ohio’s elected leaders fully earned this pathetic spot for our state via their poisonous politics and terrible policies and priorities.
Ohio politicians don’t need to worry though. Ohio voters seem determined to give them all endless free passes to do whatever they want no matter how atrocious the outcomes or rampant the corruption.
I assume their cushy careers will all be fine no matter how terribly Ohio does by every available metric, as long as they put the right party label next to their name on the ballot given whatever their geographic location. Actions don’t matter. Outcomes don’t matter. Rampant corruption doesn’t matter. Only partisan politics matters. Right?
Let’s take a look at some of those outcomes.
On the issue of crime, for corrections outcomes, Ohio ranks No. 46. On public safety, No. 22. Our incarceration and juvenile incarceration rates are both above the national average, but the violent crime rate is below the national average.
On the economy, we rank No. 30 for business environment, No. 43 for employment, and No. 36 for growth. Our venture capital investment, migration from other states, and job growth numbers all fall below the national average.
In education, our pre-K-12 ranks No. 15, while higher education ranks No. 41. Our student debt at graduation is higher than the national average, but so is our high school graduation rate and math scores.
Back in 2010, Ohio was ranked by Education Week as having the 5th best public school system in the nation. We’ve fallen far, and state lawmakers are looking at abandoning the Fair School Funding Plan, so who knows what that will do. School districts are already struggling mightily, with Akron for instance looking at $44 million worth of cuts. Being No. 15 in K-12 right now isn’t a point of pride or reason for optimism.
On fiscal stability, Ohio’s long-term outlook ranks No. 16, most likely because we have around $3.7 billion sitting in our rainy day fund. The short-term outlook isn’t so hot though, ranking No. 40 among the states, with our liquidity still well below the national average.
Health care is all pretty terrible for Ohio. We rank No. 40 in public health, No. 36 in health care access, and No. 28 in health care quality. Access to health care is set to take an enormous tumble if President Trump and Republicans in Congress pass the enormous Medicaid cuts they want.
More than 1 in 4 Ohioans rely on Medicaid – including 40% of children, 20% of working-age adults, and 10% of seniors. Hundreds of thousands of Ohioans stand to lose their health insurance under the Trump Republican cuts. Right now about 8.4% of Ohioans don’t have health insurance. That number is poised to skyrocket under the Trump plan. Again though, please rest assured, in case you were worried, the wealthy and well-connected will continue to do fabulously well.
In infrastructure, at No. 30 overall, Ohio ranks No. 15 in transportation, but comes in at No. 30 for internet access, and No. 32 for energy.
On natural environment, we rank No. 24 on air and water quality, but No. 45 for pollution.
As far as opportunity, Ohio is affordable, ranking No. 16. However, things get worse when it comes to equality, ranking No. 21. They fall off a cliff when it comes to economic opportunity, ranking at No. 38.
These rankings don’t capture some other things of note. For instance, 1.8 million Ohioans are food insecure. That’s out of a population of 11.88 million, which means more than 15% of our population is regularly going hungry. Data from Feeding America shows 1 in 5 Ohio children live in homes that are food insecure. Ohio is also among the top eight states for worst infant mortality.
Taken all-in-all, while there might not be much opportunity to improve your lot in Ohio, at least it’s a vaguely affordable place to stagnate in poverty.
We might have a lot of infant deaths, low incomes, hungry children and families, a lack of health care access, poor public health outcomes, horrible pollution, pathetic corrections, a bad employment situation, a bad energy situation, dim prospects for growth, worsening higher education, and disinvestment from public schools, but at least we have… middling prospects for long-term fiscal stability.
Congratulations, Ohio. We’re No. 38. We’re No. 38.

(Photo courtesy U.S. Fire Administration)Almost three months after the Federal Emergency Management Agency abruptly canceled classes at the National Fire Academy, saying it would only support mission-critical functions, someone at FEMA apparently decided that fire training is critical to the agency’s mission.
FEMA announced Thursday that classes would resume June 2 at its “national schoolhouses”: the National Fire Academy and the National Disaster and Emergency Management University, both in Emmitsburg, and the Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama.
Classes at all three had been canceled abruptly and without explanation in an email on March 7, a Friday, that said programs were suspended effective immediately and that the cancellations would remain in place indefinitely.
But in Thursday’s announcement, FEMA and the U.S. Fire Administration said they had “determined certain courses provide effective training to enhance national readiness for state, local, tribal and territorial emergency managers, first responders and local leaders. FEMA’s principles for emergency management assert that disasters are best managed when they’re federally supported, state managed and locally executed.”

More than 60 members of Congress — including every Democrat in the Maryland delegation — wrote to the head of FEMA and to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem on March 17, demanding to know why the center had been closed and when they would reopen. They never got an answer to their letter, but Thursday’s reopening announcement said the closing ordered as part of the work of billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Service.
The shutdown was in response to a Feb. 26 executive order from President Donald Trump on “Implementing the President’s ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative, to ensure alignment with the Administration’s priority of good use of taxpayer funds.” It came in the early, heady days of DOGE, when grants and payments were suspended and programs put on ice, before courts stepped in and started slowing or reversing DOGE actions.
Even though they never got an answer to their letter, Maryland lawmakers welcomed the news Thursday that the fire academy would soon be back in business.
“I am happy to share that programming will be resuming immediately for dedicated fire fighters and first responders from around the nation,” said Rep. April McClain Delaney (D-6th). “The rash decision to close the academy wasted valuable resources and undermined our communities’ safety, resilience, and response efforts. ”
McClain Delaney, whose district include the academy, called the original closure “senseless.” That was echoed by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in a joint statement on the reopening.
“The Trump Administration’s decision to abruptly cancel these classes made no sense – and what’s more, it risked significant harm to our communities and those who protect them,” Van Hollen’s statement said. “While the good work done by the men and women [of the] National Fire Academy never should have been halted, I’m glad to see the Administration has heeded our calls to lift this senseless ban.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/firefighters-24.3000x2000-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-23 05:01:41.776169

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
States and cities eye stronger protections for gig economy workers

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
Oregon bill would implement protections for Uber, Lyft drivers

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

Wes Moore (D) will allow a handful of bills to become law without his signature rather than issue vetoes. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)A bill meant to regulate so-called “earned wage access” loans for the first time in Maryland will become law without the governor’s signature and over the objections of a coalition that strongly opposed it.
House Bill 1294 is one of a handful of bills that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will allow to become law without his signature, including a measure to clarify provisions of a clean-energy building standard and other to increase oversight of the Department of Information Technology. Moore cited beneficial elements for each bill, but also pointed to provisions that were potentially troublesome, leading him to withhold his signature.
The bills are the last gasp of a month in which the governor signed almost 800 bills from the 2025 General Assembly into law and they come a week after he announced vetoes of 23 measures, including his controversial veto of a bill to create a commission to study possible reparations. Lawmakers are expected to override that veto, if not others.
In Maryland, there is no pocket veto for the governor, who must veto a bill to reject it. Of the left-over bills, the most contentious may have been HB1294, which aims to regulate “earned wage access” programs that advance workers money they have earned but have not yet received, then requires them to pay it back with interest.
Critics say the bill as drafted exempts app-based lenders from state laws that “prohibit lending that is discriminatory, is deceptive, or carries extremely high interest rates.” The Center for Responsible Lending said in a statement that the new law makes it easier for Marylanders to be sucked into “financial quicksand” because of payday loan apps.
“The bill becoming law but without the governor’s signature is indicative of serious, widespread concerns about these payday loan apps, including from the governor’s administration,” said Whitney Barkley, deputy director of state policy and senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending.
Moore to veto reparations bill, one of a list of measures he will reject

The center was part of a coalition of more than three dozen advocates, including the NAACP Maryland State Conference, that had urged Moore to veto the bill.
Earned wage access programs typically come in two versions – one offered by employers to their employees and another offered by private companies directly to workers. The loan is typically paid back through automatic deductions, usually with a fee or “tip.”
Opponents said the tips are finance charges. Often those charges exceed 300% interest, higher than the state’s 33% limit. They said the new law “removes the best defense against predatory lending” in Maryland.
In a letter explaining his decision, the governor said early access to earned wages can “provide a tangible benefit to workers” with unexpected expenses such as flat tires, medical copays and veterinarian bills.
While he commended lawmakers, including House Economic Matters Chair Del. C.T. Wilson (D-Charles), for “advancing a path on regulating these products,” Moore also acknowledged concerns with the bill.
Roughly 345,000 residents used wage access apps more than 11 million times between 2019 and 2024, in transactions totaling about $108 million. Nearly one in four accessed the service every two weeks, “suggesting habitual use,” Moore wrote. About half pay “expedited fees.”
Those who default on the loans tend to be 65 or older, earning less than $50,000 a year and users tend to live “in the lowest income communities in the state,” Moore wrote, adding that “protections are warranted.”
He called for a cap on amounts that can be borrowed from a single or multiple lenders, and said the law should not exempt lenders from existing commercial financial protection laws. Finally, soliciting a tip for a loan “is inappropriate,” Moore wrote.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The governor also took a pass on House Bill 49, which would help clarify key provisions of the Building Energy Performance Standards. Some building owners could receive credits, including for generating renewable energy on-site.
The bill was requested by the Department of the Environment, Moore withheld his signature over changes made by the legislature. In a letter explaining his decision, Moore cited “constrained (budget) resources” and “significant operational challenges” for the department, which must implement the law.
“And overall, this bill, as amended by the General Assembly, undermines the Department’s regulatory flexibility to meet the climate goals set out in the Climate Solutions Now Act,” Moore wrote.
The bill, as requested by the department, was intended to provide flexibility to building owners who must comply with electrification requirements and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. Failure to do so will result in fees — some as much as $600,000 for poor performing buildings — levied by the Maryland Department of the Environment.
But lawmakers amended the bill to exempt hospitals and some manufacturing facilities. Also exempted are emissions associated with steam sterilization and back-up generators at medical facilities, nursing homes and laboratories.

Moore said he is also “concerned with the study requirement included in the bill,” which calls on the department to analyze other potential changes to the BEPS program. The governor said the amended bill “introduces uncertainty into an already complex regulatory effort … It is not clear that the expectations of this study can be met by the department, given the fiscal constraints and timeline challenges the law has put in place.”
Moore will also allow House Bill 738 and Senate Bill 705 to become law without his signature.
The identical bills — sponsored by Del. Anne Kaiser (D-Montgomery) and Sens. Sens. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery) and Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) — aim to refocus the Department of Information Technology on major projects and ensure compliance with auditors’ recommendations.
The law imposes new oversight and reporting requirements on a department who has come under fire from lawmakers and the Office of Legislative Audits. One top lawmaker characterized the agency as a money pit.
A key part of the bill expands and defines the responsibilities of the department secretary on oversight of major IT projects, and it bars the department from contracting for IT services or products that are not consistent with its master plan. The law also requires the department secretary to meet quarterly with the chief information officer of agencies or departments with planned or ongoing IT projects.
It also sets up an expert panel to advise the legislature on IT issues and requires the Senate Budget and Taxation and House Health and Government Operations committees to convene a work group to evaluate the bill and other potential changes. The work group will determine if other actions are needed to resolve issues raised by the auditor.
Moore, in a three-page letter, said he agreed that changes needed to be made to how major information technology projects are overseen. But while the bills are “well-intended,” he said “many of its provisions recycle ineffective policies from the past, mirror reforms that are already underway or are overly prescriptive.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_0377-newsletter-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-23 04:02:36.456339

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) will travel to El Salvador on Friday in hopes of checking in on one of his constituents, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the undocumented immigrant who has been held by authorities there since mid-March at the direction of the Trump administration.
Ivey’s spokesperson, Ramon Korionoff, said Thursday evening that the congressman is scheduled to meet with individuals from human rights and other nongovernmental organizations and that he hopes to meet with Salvadoran Vice President Felix Ulloa  to discuss Abrego Garcia’s case. Ulloa and Ivey met more than two years ago, Korionoff said.
“It’s a fluid situation because it’s a weekend, so we’re trying to get all these appointments. A lot of them are happening on Monday,” Korionoff said. “We’re trying to use all avenues, both diplomatically and with volunteer organizations to secure the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia.”
He said Ivey will be accompanied on the trip by labor union representatives — Abrego Garcia was an apprentice sheet metal worker in a local union when he was arrested March 12 by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, has been shielded from deportation since 2019, when a U.S. immigration judge said that sending him back to El Salvador could put his life at risk from the gangs there that caused him to flee the country in the first place. He was living in Beltsville with his wife, who is a U.S. citizen, and their child when he was detained on March 12 by ICE agents while driving with his 5-year-old son.
The ICE agents told him only that his “status had changed,” according to court filings. Those documents said Abrego Garcia’s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, “was called and instructed to appear at their location within ten minutes to get her five-year old son, A.A.V.; otherwise, the ICE officers threatened that the child would be handed over to Child Protective Services.”

Three days later, on March 15, Abrego Garcia was placed on one of three deportation flights to El Salvador, where President Nayib Bukele had agreed to house U.S. deportees at his country’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in exchange for millions in payments from the U.S.
ICE and Justice Department officials later admitted in separate court filings that Abrego Garcia’s deportation to CECOT was an “administrative error” under the 2019 court order protecting him. But they insist Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, even though he and his supporters deny it and he has never been charged criminally. At an April meeting in the White House between Bukele and President Donald Trump, both presidents claimed they did not have the authority to ask the other to release Abrego Garcia.
Attorneys for Abrego Garcia, meanwhile, claim he was denied his due process rights and courts have largely agreed. That includes the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the Trump administration in April to “facilitate” the return of Abrego Garcia.
While he has been moved out of CECOT to a less-restrictive prison, however, he remains in custody in El Salvador. His attorneys, and lower court judges, have accused government officials of dragging their feet in efforts to return Abrego Garcia.
At a hearing last Friday before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, attorneys for the government argued that they could not provide some information about Abrego Garcia’s case because it is protected by the “state secrets” privilege — a claim Xinis appeared skeptical of.
Department of Justice attorney Jonathan D. Guynn said during that hearing at the federal courthouse in Greenbelt that the Trump administration is complying with court orders in the case. But even if Abrego Garcia was brought back tomorrow, he said, the government would seek to hold him or deport him again.
“He’ll never walk free in the United States,” Guynn said.
One of the attorneys for Abrego Garcia, Andrew J. Rossman, said at the hearing it’s “deeply disturbing” that administration officials, including the president, have made public statements that contradict court orders directing the government to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.
Prior to the hearing, Ivey joined Abrego Garcia’s family and other supporters outside the federal courthouse in Greenbelt.
Ivey is not the first U.S. politician traveling to El Salvador on Abrego Garcia’s behalf.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) spent several days in El Salvador in April, seeking to meet with Abrego Garcia and Bukele. He was brushed off until the last day, when Van Hollen got to meet Abrego Garcia in a stage-managed meeting in a hotel lobby.
Van Hollen’s trip was almost immediately by a trip by four Democratic House members who traveled on their own after they failed to persuade the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee to schedule an official committee trip to investigate Abrego Garcia’s case.
Korionoff said Ivey’s trip this weekend is another opportunity to keep “the spotlight on this issue.”
“It’s important to the constituents that the congressmen highlight this situation and assure the American people that we’re not going to give up on this guy, just like we won’t give up on anybody else who hasn’t had their due process rights,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/img_4879-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-23 04:02:36.456339
,California,2025-05-23 07:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s high living costs and high poverty sharpen its  economic divide,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/05/california-living-costs-poverty/,"California went from being a state with high economic mobility and opportunity to a society starkly separated by wealth, income and race.","Forty years ago, I wrote a series of 14 articles for the Sacramento Bee describing major economic, social, cultural and political trends coursing through California as the 20th century was drawing to a close.
One theme of the series, which later became a book, was the transformation of California from a state with high economic and social mobility to one of relatively rigid classes defined by ethnicity, education, incomes and wealth.
I quoted two researchers, Leon Bouvier and Philip Martin, who had projected California’s future as “the possible emerging of a two-tier economy with Asians and non-Hispanic whites competing for high-status positions while Hispanics and blacks struggle to get the low-paying service jobs.”
Unfortunately their analysis turned out to be quite accurate.
California has the nation’s highest rate of poverty as defined by the Census Bureau when it includes the cost of living in its calculations — 18.9% in 2023, or more than 7 million people.
Additional research by the Public Policy Institute of California revealed that 31.1% of Californians were living in or near poverty in 2023;  more than half  that group is Latino and another 13.6% is Black.
Furthermore, the poverty rate among undocumented immigrants was 29.6%. And, unsurprisingly, Californians without high school diplomas were almost four times more likely than college-educated Californians to be poor. 
High poverty rates underscore the fact that Californians’ costs for housing, utilities, fuel and other necessities of life are among the nation’s highest. In some high-cost counties, California’s housing department considers adults making more than $100,000 a year to be poor in terms of qualifying for housing assistance.
Being poor from an income standpoint has another aspect that hasn’t gotten as much attention — the even starker stratification of Californians by wealth.
There’s a logical connection between the two. Low family income and high living costs make it more difficult to buy a home, contribute to retirement accounts and otherwise acquire what’s known as generational wealth — assets that can grow and be passed down to heirs.
The Public Policy Institute of California also has delved into that aspect of Californians’ personal finances.
“Wealth creation is of particular concern in California, where high costs of living, high poverty rates, and a shortage of housing all exacerbate the challenges of building up assets,” PPIC researchers Tess Thorman and Shannon McConville write in their new study. “But while Californians keenly feel the barriers to building wealth, many have only a broad sense that the experience is shared, and relatively little research has explored this important component of economic well-being in the state.”
While overall, Californians’ net worths (assets minus debts) are about 50% higher than those of other states, thanks in part to California’s high housing values, low wealth is concentrated in Latino and Black households, corresponding to lower levels of education.
“Homeownership rates and equity are low among Latino households, driven largely by their younger age profile and lower education levels,” the study found. “In contrast, Black/other homeownership rates are low even after we account for factors like age, income, and education levels.
“While three in four households owe some money on unsecured debts (those without collateral), like credit cards, student loans, and/or medical bills,” the report continues, “older households are less likely than others to hold any unsecured debt, as are white, Asian, and immigrant households. Latino households are more likely to carry credit card debt and Black/other and Latino households are more likely to carry education-related debt than white and Asian households.”
So there it is, another confirmation that California has, indeed, become a highly stratified society — the perhaps unchangeable reality of a state whose political leadership still insists that it is a model for the world.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/011723-LA-Homelessness-Inequality-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-23 04:02:36.456339

Loudermilk was the featured speaker for a weekly breakfast meeting series for local conservatives.
But Loudermilk says he has no plans to take part in a traditional town hall meeting with constituents.
“We don’t right now,” he said in the IHOP parking lot. “I’m out in the community continuously doing things like this meeting. The town halls we’re doing have been pretty open. So we just haven’t had any of those old traditional town halls because they have not been productive. It’s usually just a chance for people to come in and take over and scream and holler and so we found it more productive to do more smaller venues such as what I’m doing here.”
Some of Loudermilk’s Georgia Congressional colleagues have first-hand experience with disruptive town hall participants. A tense Roswell town hall for Republican Congressman Rich McCormick of Suwanee helped spur GOP leadership to call on members to tamp down in-person town halls.
Last month, Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene of Rome went ahead with plans for an Acworth town hall, which turned Jerry Springer-esque when multiple protesters were dragged out, shocked with a Taser and arrested.
Georgia’s Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock faced hecklers at a recent Atlanta town hall, who shouted over him for several minutes in opposition of the senator’s vote to sell weapons for Israel to use in Gaza, and fellow Georgia Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff faced civil but tense questioning from fired federal workers who questioned his commitment to fighting for them. Similar scenes have played out across the country.
Still, it would be hard to characterize the IHOP get-together as “pretty open.” It was not advertised and an organizer refused to open the meeting to a reporter.
In an email to invitees, the organizer, who did not respond to a request to comment, described the breakfasts as “a shelter in the midst of the storm, a sanctuary, a place of refuge where political points are often fine-tuned, where opposing views are often shared by those elected and candidates alike. We lift high the banner of ethical behavior and encourage building a good reputation upon merit.”
“When, ‘It’s time to begin,’ freewheeling conversations gives way to ‘updates,’ from Elected and Appointed Officials, Candidates, Lobbyists, Special Groups and Committees, Political Parties, eventually: everyone who wants to share with positive input. So, if you are a positive thinking, politically motivated conservative and looking for a place of encouragement come join us!” the email continues.

Earlier this month, Cherokee County Democrats held a mock town hall featuring a cardboard cutout of Waldo, the hard-to-find world traveler from the Where’s Waldo books, with Loudermilk’s face.
Waleska resident Genevieve Hutchings said she’s been trying to get in touch with Loudermilk for months and wants him to host a public town hall.
“That’s divisive for our county and for our country, if that’s his stance, that he’s only going to meet the people that agree with him,” she said. “And how could he possibly govern in a way that’s going to be helpful to all of those constituents if he doesn’t hear from all of them?”
Hutchings was one of a few dozen protesters in downtown Woodstock on a rainy weekend as part of the progressive Indivisible movement, which has hosted larger protests outside Loudermilk’s office.
Further down the road, Woodstock resident John Thomas held a one-man counterprotest, holding up a sign with the Trump-Vance logo atop a pair of garden gnomes.

Thomas said he expects to see members of Congress host town halls as well.
“America was founded on, you know, stump speeches and people standing out there and taking questions and answering questions from all sides. And how else can we, Democrats, Republicans, Independents alike, get a message out and get people to understand our side of the debate, unless we’re out there talking to both sides of the aisle?”
The Recorder reached out to the offices of each of Georgia’s 14 members of Congress about recent or future town halls. Representatives for Greene, and Democrats Nikema Williams of Atlanta and Hank Johnson of Lithonia responded.
Greene’s office cited her recent Acworth town hall and said she hosts multiple such events per year. Williams’ staff sent a list of recent public events, including a traditional town hall in March and other smaller-scale meetings with constituents. Johnson’s office said the Congressman has been hosting regular in-person and streamed events, with the next public town hall scheduled for May 28 in Lawrenceville.
“These are your bosses”
With most of Georgia’s congressional districts safe for either party, politicians are unlikely to face a real threat from the other side, said University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock. That means there’s no real incentive for most politicians to face the heat from constituents on the opposite political wavelength.
“I think that would be their assessment, that there’s nothing to be gained from it, that the people who would show up and protest are not going to vote for them under any circumstance,” he said. “Therefore, they figure that their credentials are good for the kinds of voters who would show up in a Republican primary – if they were to get primaried, and certainly incumbents often are not, or at least don’t draw serious opponents. So I don’t think they’re going to be worried about the fact that there may be some media story saying, ‘why aren’t they holding town halls?’”
Democratic members of Congress dealt with the same dynamic when President Barack Obama was in the White House, said Kennesaw State University political science professor and former Cobb County GOP Chair Jason Shepherd.
“This has been kind of going on for a few years now, and Democrats saw this with Obamacare back in 2010 with Democrat members of Congress being shouted down,” he said. “Now we see it with Republicans, and it makes it impossible for actual constituents, because let’s face it, a lot of times the people who show up to town halls and disrupt things don’t even live in the district, can’t even vote for the member of Congress.”
Shepherd said it makes sense for politicians to try to avoid shouty town halls or to replace them with streamed events with pre-screened questions, but doing so is anti-democratic.
“This is part of our democracy,” he said. “You’re not only going up in front of voters every two or six years, but these are your bosses. These are the people whose taxes pay your paycheck.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative committee on Thursday advanced the governor’s two appointees to the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, but just one secured the committee’s support before heading to the full Legislature.
The roughly three-hour confirmation hearing and 15-minute executive session to consider and vote on the appointments came just 48 hours after the defeat of Legislative Bill 677 to provide additional guardrails to the commission. That bill sought to aid implementation of the voter-approved laws and delay a July 1 deadline for rules and regulations to be in place.

Gov. Jim Pillen, who opposed the ballot measures legalizing and regulating medical cannabis, appointed Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, and Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, prevention director at Heartland Family Service in Omaha, to the commission.
The General Affairs Committee voted 5-2, with one member “present, not voting,” to recommend Oldenburg but tied 4-4 on favorably advancing Mueting.
Under legislative rules, all gubernatorial appointments reach the full Legislature anyway. Committees can recommend to approve or reject an appointment, or lawmakers can make no recommendation, which happens in the event of a tie. 
Either appointee would need 25 votes to be confirmed to a six-year term. They would join the members of the Liquor Control Commission, whom voters also placed on the Medical Cannabis Commission: Bruce Bailey of Lincoln, Harry Hoch Jr. of Omaha and Kim Lowe of Kearney. Liquor commissioners, too, are appointees of the governor. Hoch’s term ends Saturday.
Appointee backgrounds
Mueting said her role as a prevention specialist for 24 years has been to prevent people from having problems with alcohol and other substances. She said she has looked at medical cannabis from a “360-degree view,” and as a self-described “solutions-focused” person, she said she views the Nebraska medical laws as helping patients with “debilitating” health conditions.
“Helping to guide the rulemaking process around the needs of the people it’s intended to serve is my goal,” Mueting said. “There’s nothing about that goal that says we need to sacrifice public health and safety to attain it.”

Mueting has a psychology and health promotion management degree from Hastings College and has a master’s degree in kinesiology from Kansas State University.
Oldenburg said she is “not a prohibitionist” of cannabis but is “pro-research.” She said cannabis has “a place in pain management” for certain ailments that cause suffering.
“Nebraska needs to seize the opportunity to be slow and deliberate in the manner in which we determine how best to designate appropriate conditions for medical cannabis and regulate those entities that will dispense medical cannabis in our state,” Oldenburg said. “I look forward to working with various parties to ensure that we in the State of Nebraska get this right.”
Oldenburg graduated from the University of Dallas with a degree in biochemistry and chemistry before getting her medical degree from Creighton University. She has been an anesthesiologist for 18 years, first in Colorado and returning to Nebraska in 2017 with her family. 
Part of the move, she said, was because of how the “evolution” of medicinal to recreational marijuana went in Colorado. She said there weren’t many medical regulations at the start.
Pillen has described the women as “experienced, well-qualified individuals” who would ensure strong regulations “to the letter of the law the people of Nebraska enacted.” He and other LB 677 opponents, such as State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, say the commission can meet its July 1 deadline.
Oldenburg declined to talk with the Nebraska Examiner prior to the Thursday hearing. Mueting did not respond to repeated requests for comment before or after the hearing.
Committee member ties
Of the appointees, Oldenburg said she was encouraged to apply by Storm, a member of the General Affairs Committee, who called and asked if she had considered the position.
Mueting listed Storm as a personal reference on her application to the governor. Under legislative questioning, Mueting at first said she didn’t know “exactly how the governor got my name” before clarifying she applied. She said she didn’t know appointments would go before the General Affairs Committee, just that full legislative approval was needed in the end.
During the closed-door executive session, which is open to reporters, Storm defended the appointees and said they showed up for a hostile and intimidating environment.

State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue spoke for the first time to criticize what he viewed as a conflict of interest. Storm said the application process was public and flipped the question on Rountree and other committee members for not reaching out to possible applicants, too.
In addition to Mueting and Oldenburg, Pillen interviewed Erin Bone, a prevention specialist in North Platte. The governor did not interview a fourth applicant: Ogallala City Manager Kevin Wilkins, according to records shared with the Examiner.
Mueting and Oldenburg are registered Republicans. Bone is a registered Democrat. Wilkins is a registered nonpartisan.
During Tuesday’s debate on LB 677, Storm acknowledged he had talked with Mueting but said he hadn’t talked about the bill with Mueting. 
Mueting, when she testified against LB 677 in March, answered questions from Storm about what she’d like to see from medical cannabis in Nebraska. Her answer included limiting allowable forms of cannabis (not smoking or vaping), limiting qualifying conditions and placing restrictions on tetrahydrocannabidiol potency, serving size or servings per package in cannabis products.
Mueting was “neutral” on a Storm bill, LB 483, to reduce the allowable possession down to 300 milligrams, 0.21% of what voters approved, and only allow pills or tinctures for the medicine.
Need for neutrality?
Much of Thursday’s hearing focused on opposition to the appointments because Oldenburg and Mueting have both consistently opposed the legislative proposals that long-time medical cannabis advocates in Nebraska have supported in the Legislature.
Oldenburg testified against proposals in 2018, 2019 and 2021, while Mueting opposed legislation in 2019, 2021, 2023 and 2025.
‘Absolute failure’: Medical cannabis regulatory bill stalls in Nebraska Legislature

After more than a decade of legislative attempts, advocates succeeded last fall by ballot measure at legalizing up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation. “Exclusive” regulatory authority is vested in the Medical Cannabis Commission, per voter directive.
Crista Eggers, executive director of Nebraskans for Medical Marijuana, which led the campaign, said the appointments seemed like a “calculated act” by Pillen. She said lawmakers have an “ethical responsibility” to approve individuals committed to the program’s success, “not its obstruction.”
“I don’t think an arsonist should be in charge of the fire department,” Eggers testified.
Cavanaugh asked whether that meant Eggers should be appointed. She said, “Absolutely not.”
“I do not believe that this commission should be made up of anyone that has spent time, energy, in their personal or professional capacity, being opposed or supportive to this,” Eggers said.
‘Derail, stall and sabotage’
Shelly Gillen of Bellevue, testifying on behalf of her 23-year-old son Will, said that for people “enamored” with requiring U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval first — as has been the consistent policy for Mueting’s Heartland Family Service — Gillen said those people should ask what FDA-approved meds have done to Will Gillen, making him “an innocent, unintentional addict.”
“We were told by a neurologist that weaning him off one of his meds would be similar to weaning off someone on heroin. FDA-approved meds landed him in the hospital for two weeks in complete somnolence that made him develop pneumonia and silent aspiration on his own saliva,” Gillen testified.

The Gillens were among the first families to consistently fight for medical cannabis, back to 2015 legislation from former State Sen. Sue Crawford of Bellevue. Mueting supported that bill.
Gillen said there was “no doubt in my mind” that the appointees would “do everything they can to derail, stall and sabotage access to medical cannabis for as many patients as possible.”
Angelica Marsaglia of Lincoln, who would benefit from medical cannabis, opposed both appointees and noted Mueting is part of an organization in part to help addicts. Marsaglia urged senators to see patients and “please hear us.”
“We are not addicts. We are medical patients,” Marsaglia said. “We just want access to a plant, a plant that grows freely and only the government has made illegal.”
Law enforcement angle
Maggie Ballard and Mary O’Neill, both of Heartland Family Service, defended Mueting, as did Sarpy County Sheriff Greg London.
London attested to Mueting’s character and integrity and said she’s “perfect” for the appointment because she understands the importance of rules and regulations. London was one of 53 sheriffs to join Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers in opposition to LB 677.
The AG’s Office has vowed to sue the Medical Cannabis Commission if it begins licensing medical cannabis dispensaries, which could begin by Oct. 1 under the laws. 
Advisement to law enforcement is still a “work in progress” when it comes to medical cannabis, London said, and he argued no one has a medical cannabis recommendation card yet.

Cavanaugh said some people do have a card, to which London asked how many.
“I’ve met at least one,” Cavanaugh said.
“Oh. Congratulations,” London responded.
Keith County Attorney Randy Fair, in his personal capacity, said that while both appointees may be very good people, he said appointees should be neutral-minded individuals who can support good regulations.
Fair said that cops will do the same thing they do now during traffic stops: Pull people over now if they smell marijuana for probable cause, search vehicles and issue arrests or tickets if people have more than 5 ounces of marijuana, or not if someone has a recommendation.
“We don’t try to arrest tons of people for that because, quite frankly, it would be a waste of resources,” Fair said. “I do think that a lot of these concerns are blown over.”
It would be Fair’s “ethical duty,” he said, not to prosecute someone unless they have actually violated the laws of Nebraska.
‘One of the biggest hearts’
Ballard said she’s served on Heartland Family Service’s prevention team with Mueting for 11 of Ballard’s 13 years with the organization. When learning that there might have been an overflow room because of widespread opposition, Ballard said, “Honestly, that hurts my heart.”
  State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue, center, talks with State Sens. Danielle Conrad and George Dungan, both of Lincoln. April 10, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
While Mueting and Ballard have different backgrounds and don’t see eye-to-eye on everything, Ballard added, Mueting “has one of the biggest hearts of anyone I’ve ever met.”
“I just can’t think of anyone better than her to serve on this commission, because she will do a very good job of balancing public health and public safety against people who need help with their debilitating conditions,” Ballard said.
Ballard and Mueting said voters have spoken, despite the Heartland Family Service position. Ballard said her coworker’s job would be to oversee and “try to do things as well as possible and not to just bang her head against the wall saying, ‘No, we can’t do this here.’”
“That’s not practical, and it’s not in Lorelle’s nature either,” Ballard continued.
Nothing in the law requires “debilitating” conditions, Cavanaugh noted. Any health care practitioner, including out-of-state, can recommend cannabis if they feel a patient could benefit.
‘I don’t have the power’
While no one spoke in favor of Oldenburg’s appointment, multiple senators said after the hearing that they were impressed with her credentials. State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney, who opposed Mueting but supported Oldenburg, said there were some unfair shots taken at Oldenburg whose skill set he highlighted. He did not specify his reservations on Mueting’s appointment.

State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County said he was “very impressed” by Mueting’s 24 years in the prevention field and that she was qualified for the role.
Mueting said she didn’t view her appointment as trying to “squash” the law, “because I don’t have the power to do that.” 
“My goal is not to make this harder for people,” Mueting said. “My goal is to put some rules around the substance as we were given in statute.”
Oldenburg noted that in residency, she was taught to never be afraid of prescribing opioids for patients’ pain, but that’s changed. She added that Nebraska can learn from other states in the interest of health, safety and well-being for a better program.
Multiple opponents of the appointees, including Angela Cornett of Norfolk, a nurse, said patients were tired of waiting, including for new research. Cornett said her mom was one of dozens of advocates who died waiting for possible relief over the past decade.
Oldenburg stayed for the whole hearing, but Mueting left after her invited witnesses testified. State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue said she had a previously scheduled appointment.
‘Obligation to protect society’
Cavanaugh grilled both appointees over what they view as the commission’s role, such as whether commissioners should list qualifying conditions, limit permissible forms of using cannabis, restrict how many dispensaries can be licensed and more.

Mueting and Oldenburg, noting they are “one of five” on the commission, said they didn’t know and weren’t attorneys. They said they would seek guidance as a team, though both said they opposed smoking as a form of using cannabis.
“I’m a law-abiding citizen of the State of Nebraska, and I have to follow the will of the people, and I have to follow the statutes,” Oldenburg said.
Andersen, who also opposed LB 677, criticized Cavanaugh’s line of questioning about Mueting’s personal views on medical cannabis and compared it to asking a public defender whether a client is guilty.
“They’re going to do a job and defend the person,” Andersen said.
“That’s a really good analogy,” Mueting responded.
Storm said that at the end of the day, he and others want to help Nebraskans in the right way.
“If cannabis can help people with ailments, we should do that, very much should do that,” Storm said. “But we have an obligation to protect society, and we can’t let this get out of control.”

All touted a message that immigrants and refugees were good for the state’s economy, workforce and growth. And as passing cars honked and gave thumbs up, the speakers proclaimed their words from a stage.
It was an intentionally blatant show of support, said Itzel Lopez of the Latino Economic Development Council, which helped Omaha Together One Community (OTOC) organize the event at la Plaza de la Raza on South 24th Street.
“We want to draw attention that, yes, it’s safe,” said Lopez. “That there are people in our community who truly care about the well being of immigrants in our state.”
Lopez, speaking to the crowd, admitted that she can’t help but worry herself about the fallout of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration policies. Though she has grown up in Omaha, has seen success in business, she is a DACA recipient without permanent legal status who finds herself “preoccupied with simply feeling safe.”
Reach congressional delegation
OTOC leader Denise Bowyer said the diverse speaking lineup representing business, labor, agriculture, faith and community groups was intended to push back against negative messages and restrictive policies initiated at the national level. She said the group wants their message to reach Nebraska’s congressional delegation and urged people to get louder and more active.
James Krenz, senior program director for the International Council for Refugees and Immigrants, said admissions for refugees are effectively suspended. He said the Trump administration views refugees as “a threat rather than a part of shared humanity.”

“What we see today is not normal,” he said, adding that quiet acceptance “allows injustices to persist.”
The rally was similar in spirit to one on the steps of the State Capitol in September, which drew more than 60 Nebraska organizations to announce a unified resolve to change state and federal policies to be more welcoming to immigrants and refugees.
Over the past four months, said Bowyer, people’s lives nationally and in Nebraska have been upended by executive orders, non-renewals of Temporary Protective Status and revocations of parole processes for people who entered the country with permission. OTOC is a religious-based network formed three decades ago to advocate for social justice issues.
Crack down 
Trump, who campaigned on the promise to crack down on immigration, has said he is enforcing national laws and that mass deportations and strict border security protect Americans and the country’s economic and social structures.

Anne Wurth, senior attorney at the Center for Immigrant and Refugee Advancement, said challenges representing newcomers have compounded in the last few months. While Nebraska has not seen the large-scale enforcement raids of the past, or high-profile arrests as some other states, Wurth said foreign-born Nebraskans should know their rights and be “aware.”
From what her organization has seen across the state, Wurth said, immigration agents have focused on “stated enforcement priorities” — targeting people with prior removal orders and past criminal convictions.
She said her office has information that federal agents from the Department of Homeland Security ostensibly have been conducting “wellness checks” on young people who entered the U.S. as unaccompanied minors and were released to Nebraska sponsors.
No one to her knowledge has been detained, said Wurth. “But under this administration, those things can change.”

Heath Mello, president of the Greater Omaha Chamber, said his members hear daily from employers who are struggling to fill jobs. He said the business group believes immigration reform must be part of the state’s workforce solution.
“Smart, constructive immigration policy is not just the right thing to do — it’s good economics,” Mello said.
Sue Martin, president of the Nebraska AFL-CIO, said that without immigrants, America’s workforce would shrink, meaning decreased tax revenue.
John Hansen, president of the Nebraska Farmers Union, said Nebraska’s largest single industry, agriculture, struggles with workforce issues. He named pork producers, dairy producers, poultry producers, beef feedlots, seedcorn companies and the meatpacking industry and said all are dependent on immigrant labor.
Other speakers included Mustafa Babak, cofounder of the Afghan American Foundation, the Rev. Debra McKnight, founding pastor of Urban Abbey and Dawn Essink of OTOC.
Lina Traslaviña Stover, executive director of the statewide Heartland Workers Center, said immigrant communities help Nebraska thrive.
“We are growing the food, building the homes, running big and small businesses, caring for families and keeping Nebraska moving forward.”

There is, however, a great deal of artifice.  
The book’s very authorship is a sham, according to its ghost writer Tony Schwartz, and Howard Kaminsky, the publisher, both of whom claim Trump played no role in the writing. 
In reality, Trump’s “art” of making deals amounts to bullying, intimidating, suing, extorting, bribing and lying to get what he wants, even though he most often fails.  
For instance, Trump says, “Deals work best when each side gets something it wants from the other.” (The Art of the Deal) But to gain leverage, Trump first makes threats or files lawsuits or imposes unfair penalties on his competitor; then he offers to withdraw the threat or penalty to get what he wants.  Sounds a lot like extortion, or like the quid pro quo he offered President Volodymyr Zelensky during his “perfect call,” when Trump withheld Congressionally approved military aid to Ukraine unless Zelensky agreed, as a “favor,” to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and his son.
Likewise, in Trump’s second term, he prefaced “deals” with Canada and Mexico with the imposition of tariffs; or in the cases of Greenland and Panama, with threats of military force. 
In addition to threats and extortion, Trump also deals in lies and manipulation. “The final key to the way I promote is bravado. I play to people’s fantasies. People may not always think big themselves, but they can still get very excited by those who do. That’s why a little hyperbole never hurts.”
On the contrary, when a U.S. president plays with the faith of millions of voters like an unscrupulous used car salesman selling a “lemon” to a trusting customer, he’s inflicting suffering on an entire nation to further inflate his own ego and personal wealth. Indeed, rather than solving the problems he hyperbolically promised, he has only exacerbated them.  
Consider this campaign whopper: “When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on Day One.” By slapping tariffs on other nations, he expected the world to fall at his feet and bend to his will.  Or as he graphically bragged, “I’m telling you, these countries are calling us up, kissing my a–.” They are dying to make a deal, ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal.  I’ll do anything, sir!” 
[Note: whenever Trump quotes someone addressing him as “sir,” it’s a tell-tale sign he’s made up the entire encounter.] 
Then he compounded the lie, falsely claiming, “I’ve made 200 deals,” on tariffs.  First, there are only 195 countries in the world.  Second, it turns out Trump had made precisely no deals at that point.  In fact, he admitted that rather than negotiating deals, he was simply dictating terms: “We’re going to put very fair numbers down, and we’re going to say, here’s what this country, what we want. And congratulations, we have a deal.”
In other words, he’s made demands, not deals. 
Indeed, when he finally announced a so-called “deal” with a specific nation, the United Kingdom, it amounted to no deal at all.  The 10% tariff imposed on the UK before the deal remains at 10% after the deal, with further details to be negotiated.  But according to chief economist at RSM, Joe Bruseulas, “A trade agreement where the details are still being negotiated is not an agreement.” 
Trump’s economic dealings with China amount to more brags and bluff.  The President would have us believe that he imposed stratospheric tariffs on China based upon his alleged study of Chinese culture and thought. “I’ve read hundreds of books about China over the decades. I know the Chinese. I’ve made a lot of money with the Chinese. I understand the Chinese mind.”  
I assume this is more of his “truthful hyperbole” because it strains credibility that the man who can’t read security briefings has read hundreds of books on anything, much less China. And far from knowing the Chinese mind, he can’t even remember that China never blinked in the face of tariffs during his first administration.  Meanwhile his latest so-called “agreement” with China to reduce reciprocal tariffs returns the trade war to “square one.”
​But all of Trump’s deal-making bluff and bluster has cost American consumers more at the cash register, reduced investors’ life savings, and thrown a wrench of uncertainty into the complex machinery of the world economy.  Further, it has alienated our allies, and undermined our nation’s reputation, security, and status in the world.  [I will save for another day the cost of another of his hyperbolic promises: to “end the war in Ukraine “on day one.”]
Suffice it to say, that Trump’s “truthful hyperbole” amounts to the substance of Trump’s persona, character, and leadership. It is a euphemism for the lies he tells the American public. The truth is that Trump’s deal making, like the man, is more artifice than artful.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP-trump-art-of-deal.jpg,,,2025-05-23 01:00:22.340300
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 04:01:39+00:00,CT Mirror,Incentivizing CT’s air travel a better way,Tony Sheridan and Michael Shea,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/incentivizing-air-travel-a-better-way-tony/,Let the CT's dormant aviation fuel user fee go back into effect.,"The state legislature has rightly shown interest in taking steps to ensure that our state’s airports are well-served by a broad mix of airlines that meet the needs of our state’s leisure and business travelers. 
Air travel facilitates economic development, connecting our corporate community with business opportunities across the country and globe, and it provides easy access for tourists who wish to partake in our beautiful state. The Connecticut Airport Authority (CAA) airport system alone generates nearly $4 billion in total impact to the Connecticut economy, including support for over 25,000 jobs.
The question at hand is how to best nurture the vital aviation industry. 
Some airlines, led primarily by one of the state’s newest ultra-low-cost carriers, have lobbied aggressively for the elimination of the state’s aviation fuel user fee. Arguing that such a fee inhibits route growth, this lobbying effort resulted in the suspension of the state’s aviation fuel user fee for a period of two years with a scheduled return in July 2025 at a roughly 50% reduced rate (saving the airlines millions of dollars compared to the pre-2023 tax rate). 
As we approach the introduction of that reduced rate this July, some airlines and other interested parties are advocating to either permanently eliminate the fee or shift its proceeds to other entities. 
Here’s why that is short-sighted:
1) The aviation fuel user fee supports the operation and capital development of the CAA’s five general aviation (GA) airports. 
The CAA’s GA system operates at a deficit, as is common for GA systems across the country, but is maintained due to the significant economic impact that its facilities produce for the community. These airports (Danielson, Groton-New London, Hartford-Brainard, Waterbury-Oxford, and Windham) generate $409 million annually in total economic output, support 2,500 jobs, and generate over $15 million of state and local taxes. 
These GA airports support military operations, state emergency services, flight schools, business flights, recreational travel, and many other businesses. Commercial service airports generate adequate revenues that self-fund their own operations, and they therefore should not require subsidization from this revenue stream. 
If the aviation fuel user fee is eliminated or if the fee’s proceeds are diverted away from the CAA’s GA system, these airports will suffer from deteriorated infrastructure and the likely loss of services.
2) Connecticut is already a low-cost state for the airlines, as Bradley International has maintained an extremely competitive rate structure. 
Airlines use a standardized metric, cost per enplanement (CPE), to compare their costs at different airports. BDL’s CPE has been lower than other major airports in the region for the last eight fiscal years. In FY24, if BDL had adopted the rate structures in place at TF Green in Providence or Boston-Logan airports, the airlines would have paid the CAA an additional $3.3 million or $43.6 million, respectively. As a result of the CAA’s cost-consciousness, impressive airline growth has followed – including pre-2023 with the higher aviation fuel fee rate.
3) Connecticut compares favorably to the tax structures in place in other states. 
Some states, like Massachusetts, allow municipalities the ability to levy a 5% tax on aviation fuel. Ten states have lower “state aviation fuel fees,” but apply the state sales and use tax to aviation fuel sales. Some states impose separate environmental/inspection fees and taxes on aviation fuel. Connecticut allows none of these.
4) Arguments about the impact of a $0.15/gallon fee on airfares are overstated. 
In an analysis of the fuel burn for the longest-haul service of the state’s new budget airlines (Bradley International to San Juan Puerto Rico), the CAA found that the fee impact would equate to $2.73/seat. And that is an extreme example. Shorter-haul services would naturally result in less fuel burn and lower fee impacts.
There is, however, a more effective way to incentivize growth in Connecticut.
Airline incentivization should be targeted and limited, not broad and perpetual. Eliminating the aviation fuel user fee, at the expense of the GA airports, incentivizes all routes regardless of whether they meet a strategic need. The CAA incentivizes air carriers that launch service to unserved destinations via fee waivers and marketing assistance for a limited period of time to encourage BDL route network growth and help the airline build public awareness in a brand-new market.
The state has also wisely selected targeted destinations for incentives in the past, including Aer Lingus’ service to Dublin and, more recently, service to Montego Bay, Jamaica. These routes served strategic purposes, reestablishing nonstop transatlantic service and providing connectivity for the state’s large, proud Jamaican-American population.
We can and should do what it takes to promote the growth of passenger air travel in the state for the sake of our residents and corporate community alike. But we can achieve that growth through targeted incentives that are limited in duration and do not damage other critical components of our state’s economy.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-23 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT’s health commissioners should support overdose prevention centers,Katherine Hill et al,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/23/urging-connecticuts-health-commissioners-to-support-overdose-prevention-centers-katherine/,"While our coalition deeply appreciates the many current efforts championed by both the DPH and the DMHAS, Connecticut continues to lose too many lives to preventable overdose.","As the opioid overdose crisis continues to harm people across Connecticut, there is an urgent need to take bold action.
One of the most promising solutions, supported by decades of evidence, is the  establishment of overdose prevention centers . These centers save lives and provide comprehensive support to people who use drugs.
Senate Bill 1285, An Act Establishing an Overdose Prevention Center Pilot Program, was recently absorbed into Senate Bill 7, An Act Concerning Protections For Access To Health Care And The Equitable Delivery Of Health Care Services In The State. In summary, the legislation proposes the opening of four overdose prevention centers across our state.
Despite the profound potential of overdose prevention centers to save lives, both Commissioner Manisha Juthani of the Department of Public Health (DPH) and Commissioner Nancy Navarretta of the Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services (DMHAS) have hesitated to fully endorse this critical bill. The Statewide Harm Reduction Partnership believes it was disconcerting to see the lack of full support from key public health leaders.
Overdose prevention centers offer a wide range of services, including access to naloxone, drug checking, syringe exchange, wound care, and crucially, the prevention of overdoses themselves. Overdose prevention centers are also a key public health tool by providing wraparound services such as HIV prevention and treatment, mental health care, and connections to social supports.


Commissioner Juthani of DPH has professed a commitment to revitalizing public health in our state,particularly in addressing the opioid crisis. In her testimony, she importantly acknowledged at least one of the many benefits of overdose prevention centers, stating that the DPH “understands the policy interest for an overdose prevention center, as they create safer environments for people to use drugs, especially for higher-risk populations.” 
Despite this, she did not extend her full support or address the DPH’s responsibility to lead in this space. As a physician and public health leader, Juthani’s expertise is invaluable, and her full endorsement could significantly impact the success of Senate Bill 7. 
Similarly, Commissioner Navarretta of DMHAS, upon accepting the position as Commissioner, affirmed a commitment to supporting “those affected by the opioid epidemic by providing holistic, comprehensive, and effective services and supports that foster dignity, respect, and self-sufficiency in those we serve.” 
In her recent testimony, she astutely acknowledged “the important role harm reduction can play in an individual’s recovery journey.” However, her testimony also fell short of endorsing overdose prevention centers, instead pointing to the SafeSpot system as a harm reduction tool. While SafeSpot is indeed valuable, it cannot replace the comprehensive support offered by overdose prevention centers, nor can it serve some high risk populations effectively (e.g., unhoused or low income folks without access to phones, rural populations without service, etc.). 
As both the leader of addiction services in our state and as a clinical psychologist specializing in addiction and behavioral health, Commissioner Navaretta is uniquely positioned to advocate for evidence-based solutions to address the overdose crisis.
So, why were both Commissioners not supporting Senate Bill 1285, now merged into Senate Bill 7? Their testimonies discussed concerns about the legality of overdose prevention centers under federal law, citing the need for changes in federal statutes (i.e., 21 U.S. Code § 856) or a clear interpretation from the Department of Justice. However, Scott Burris, a leading legal scholar in public health law, has clarified that arguments claiming overdose prevention centers violate 21 U.S. Code § 856 are a matter of political opinion rather than legal certainty. While there is uncertainty in the federal landscape, this underscores why states must take the lead. 
Since the last time an overdose prevention center legislation was introduced in Connecticut, more than 2,000 residents have lost their lives. We cannot afford to wait any longer.
Our Statewide Harm Reduction Partnership has sent letters to both the commissioners of DPH and DMHAS, outlining the life-saving potential of overdose prevention centers and urging their full support for Senate Bill 1285, now Senate Bill 7. To date, no responses have been received from either office. 
While we certainly understand the implications supporting overdose prevention centers might have in this current political landscape, the silence from both commissioners is nonetheless concerning. We remain hopeful that a lack of response to our letter does not suggest a reluctance to engage with or support innovative approaches to addressing the overdose crisis. We stand firm in the belief that both commissioners are uniquely positioned to advocate for overdose prevention centers as evidence-based solutions that can address the overdose crisis.
While our coalition deeply appreciates the many current efforts championed by both the DPH and the DMHAS, Connecticut continues to lose too many lives to preventable overdose. Connecticut needs courageous leadership to address the overdose epidemic effectively. We urge Commissioners Juthani and Navarretta to reconsider their positions and fully support the establishment of overdose prevention centers. The evidence is clear: overdose prevention centers save lives and provide the dignity and support that individuals affected by the opioid crisis desperately need.
In the upcoming legislative vote on Senate Bill 7, we call on public health leaders, including Commissioners Juthani and Navarretta, to step up and support this essential initiative. The health and safety of our communities depend on it.

The Connecticut House of Representatives on Thursday night overwhelmingly approved a bill to overhaul the state’s towing law, making it harder to tow vehicles from private property and easier for drivers to retrieve their vehicles after a tow.
After weeks of negotiations and just a few minutes of debate on the House floor, lawmakers said they came to a compromise with the towing industry. Two bills have been merged to include massive reforms to towing procedures from private property and rate increases for highway tows that typically follow car accidents.
“This bill is a result of months of collaboration and has the blessings of consumer protection advocates, towers themselves, municipal leaders, police chiefs, property owners,” said Transportation Committee co-chair Rep. Aimee Berger-Girvalo, D-Ridgefield, as she introduced the bill Thursday night. 
The bill had support from both sides of the political aisle and was approved 126 to 21.
“We all, many months ago, heard a lot about towing,” said Transportation Committee ranking member Rep. Kathy Kennedy, R-Milford. “Towing was all in the news, and all different things were happening. We are so far from that. Finally, I think we’ve put forward a good, solid bill.”
House Bill 7162 overhauls the state’s 100-year-old towing statutes and comes in response to an investigation by the Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that showed how state towing laws have come to favor tow companies at the expense of drivers. 
The news organizations found that Connecticut’s state law allowing the sale process to begin in 15 days is one of the shortest windows in the nation and has particularly impacted people with low incomes. Reporters also spoke with people who said the tower required them to pay in cash or wouldn’t allow them to get personal belongings out of their vehicle. Many couldn’t afford to get their towed vehicles back and lost transportation or jobs because of it.

The bill that passed the House Thursday night takes several steps to make it easier for people to get their towed vehicles back and requires towing companies to take more time and increase documentation during the sale process. 
It requires tow companies to accept credit cards and doesn’t allow them to tow vehicles quickly just because of an expired parking permit or registration. Vehicles can’t be towed from private property without notice unless they’re blocking traffic, fire hydrants or parked in an accessible space.
Under the bill, towing companies can still start the sales process for vehicles worth $1,500 or less after 15 days, but would now have to provide the owner with a chance to claim the vehicle. The DMV would be required to check whether the driver issued any complaints about the tow before approving the sale, and the tower would have to send the notice ahead of the sale to the registered owner and lienholders via certified mail, with receipts of delivery.
The actual sale couldn’t go through until 30 days after the tow.
“The hope is that they’re exhausting all efforts to have the vehicle returned to the rightful owner before a sale is able to proceed,” said Transportation Committee co-chair Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, in an interview before the vote.
A spokesperson for the DMV could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday night. 
The bill would also establish a working group to study the best way to handle proceeds from the sales of towed vehicles. State law currently requires that towing companies hold profits in escrow for a year in case the vehicle owner claims them, then remit that money to the state, but CT Mirror and ProPublica found the DMV never set up a system for that process to occur.
The DMV would also have to work with the state’s attorney general to develop a consumer bill of rights on towing.
If companies are towing vehicles, they also have to be available to allow people to get their vehicles or personal property. In a story published earlier this month, CT Mirror and ProPublica reported that tow truck companies often hold onto people’s belongings to pressure them into paying their towing fees. 
Under the new law, drivers would be allowed to retrieve their belongings from the vehicle, even if they don’t pay the towing fees.

“This is not your fault, but it is your problem,” Sen. Jonathon Acosta, a Central Falls Democrat, told Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) officials at a legislative hearing Thursday. “It’s our problem.”
The discrepancy was driven by the data, or lack thereof, on low-income and multilingual learner students in the state. Both populations factor in the statewide education funding formula that determines aid to local school districts. 
The Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) generates enrollment numbers in March and October, using data provided by school districts. Typically, the governor’s budget office uses the March data when preparing the education funding formula around August, ahead of the release of the governor’s budget the following January. 
But this time round, McKee’s office used the October 2024 data collected by RIDE, which showed declining enrollment overall, and therefore fewer students in poverty. The new March numbers, according to RIDE, showed things swinging in the opposite direction, with more English learners and students living in poverty than accounted for in the fiscal 2026 budget McKee submitted months ago.
“The October data hasn’t been great the last few years,” Mark Dunham, the education department’s finance director, told senators. “And then 2025 was the first year that October was used.”
The discrepancy includes roughly $12 million in basic education aid and another $12 million tied to the Student Success Factor, a weight in the state’s school funding formula that gives additional support to districts with many students living in poverty.
For fiscal year 2025, the state began using October enrollment figures instead, and RIDE reported a total enrollment of 136,000 students, while the governor’s budget used 134,000 for the number of students statewide. The March 2025 update later corrected the count to 135,600 — revealing a roughly 1,000-student gap between RIDE’s projection and the updated total. 
“OK, so the numbers in October were incomplete for your assessment, we [now] believe the numbers in March are complete,” said committee chair and Middletown Democratic Sen. Lou DiPalma. “I’m trying to understand how we have a new set of data here. How do we believe what we have that this is correct? How do I know that the 39 cities and towns that provide the data are still not incomplete?”
“It looks to us that they did not completely update their poverty numbers,” Dunham said of local school districts who had to submit data.
The state currently uses food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) enrollment to calculate student poverty, applying a 1.6 multiplier to estimate the real total need. RIDE has also considered matching students through Medicaid, but the state has not yet fully incorporated it into the formula. 
“An overwhelming number of states in the country use Medicaid match as their proxy for poverty,” Dunham said, then described what that approach could mean to the state budget. “At the time we suggested it, it was about a $20 million number. Now, with all the new data we have, the enrollment updates, it’s a $40 million number.”
Victor Morente, a RIDE spokesperson, said in an email Thursday, that RIDE updates the data twice a year as part of its own preparation for submitting a budget request to the governor.
“At this time, research is ongoing to determine if there is an actual under identification,” Morente said.
Legislation in 2022 changed how students are counted, Morente said, which may have resulted in the undercount. 
“We were probably under-counting the number of students in poverty in certain districts,” Office of Management and Budget Director Brian Daniels told lawmakers. “And the broader way of fixing it…is changing your student success factor based on the wealth of each individual community.”
“But if you do that … are you setting 40% [aid] as the floor, or is that the starting point?…It gets very complicated, because in that case, you have winners and losers. So I think this is a longer term issue. We do need to fix this.”
Daniels said the budget office will be submitting a budget amendment which reflects the changes in enrollment from March.
Dunham said states like Massachusetts and Connecticut are facing similar data collection issues when it comes to low-income students. 
“I think we’d have to really rebuild the whole formula to be the same as Massachusetts, because I think the core [funding amount] is a lot less, or at least less, than ours,” Dunham said. “But we do wonder. We do understand that there are different levels of poverty that we should be able to address.”
Dunham ended his comments on a resigned note: “Even if we match all the kids exactly, we still are probably going to undercount a lot of the kids that are eligible for different reasons.”
DiPalma shrugged.
“Until we change the system, that’s what it is,” he said.

A vote is now planned for Tuesday.","At their regular Thursday morning press briefing, House Democratic leadership appeared confident about passage of the most significant housing legislation to come before the Connecticut legislature in years.
But by Thursday night, the vote on the bill had stalled under threats of a filibuster and a split Democratic party. Lawmakers said an altered version is likely to come up for a vote on Tuesday.
In its latest publicly released draft, House Bill 5002 is an ambitious omnibus measure that tackles zoning, transit-oriented development, parking policy and homelessness. After closed-door negotiations that stretched across most of the day Thursday, it’s not clear what will remain in the bill.
“I try to remind everyone this is somewhat of a normal part of the process in which there are fits, starts, restarts, amendments made, but I think eventually we are going to get there with this housing bill,” said Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, on Thursday evening.
Rojas said he had worked to compromise with Republicans on several key issues and that it came down to not having enough time in the day for the long debate.
Thursday morning, he focused on the compromises already made on the bill. It was the first time in several legislative sessions he had said the progress on Connecticut’s lack of housing wasn’t “painfully incremental.”
“I’m proud of what’s in here,” said Rojas on Thursday morning. “It’s been informed by conversations with a lot of people. I took the time to meet with a number of our Republican colleagues over the course of the session. I’m not suggesting that they’re endorsing the bill, that they’re voting for the bill. It seems unlikely that they will, but I have taken a lot of time to talk to people.”
“His bill is going to be grounded in experience and good public policy, and he probably is as good at that as anybody out of the 187 legislators,” said Speaker of the House Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
Republicans slammed the bill Thursday, saying it would be bad for businesses and communities and contained “major flaws.” They planned to debate it for 10 to 12 hours, Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said. The threat points to the power of the minority party later in the legislative session to talk until time runs out and a bill is dead.
But that opposition was expected.
Less expected among advocates and some members of the General Assembly was the level of pushback from moderates and some urban lawmakers within the Democratic party concerned about changes to parking policy, the conversion of commercial lots to residential and a requirement that every town plan and zone for a set number of units of affordable housing.
“We didn’t expect 100% of Democrats to vote for this bill,” Rojas said. “Their support or lack thereof was not the primary motivation for a delay in the vote.”
Candelora said he expected at least 20 Democrats to vote against the bill Thursday night, which would have left the majority party with a tight but passable margin. Much of the negotiation centered around how long debate would last.
“Large companies like GE and Lego move their headquarters out of our state, being replaced by Amazon warehouse workers,” Candelora said. “It is no longer affordable for those individuals to be able to live here in the state of Connecticut. So we certainly do have an affordability issue. But I think we’ve got to look more broadly at what are the policies that they are passing that are only causing us to have economic loss.”

Some lawmakers also took issue with the way the bill was drafted — as an omnibus bill containing more than a dozen concepts from at least three different committees. It’s a strategic decision typically used to limit debate. The idea is that it’s easier to do one long debate on a big bill rather than several long debates on small bills.
But frustrations about the process rose across both parties in the Capitol on Thursday, people close to the conversations said.
“It’s an insult to everything we do here,” said Rep. Doug Dubitsky, R-Chaplin. Dubitsky planned to introduce several amendments to the bill, he said, which likely would have lengthened debate.
The parking policy changes sparked consternation among Democrats and Republicans on Thursday. The bill would have limited towns’ ability to mandate the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for certain types of new developments.
As it stands, parking requirements vary widely from town to town. Some spaces are determined by the square footage or seating capacity. It’s also different based on the type of development. For example, In New London, bowling alleys must have three spaces per lane. In Wethersfield, it’s five per lane and one per employee. Meanwhile, in Westport, there must be one space per 180 square feet.
The cost of building parking adds significantly to the cost of housing, and land use advocates have said it means large swaths of downtowns are taken up by parking lots instead of businesses, housing or green space.
But opponents said they feared it would mean people have to walk several blocks from their cars to their homes, that it would dilute local control and didn’t take safety into account.
“I don’t know how else you slice and dice that. You can cook it any way you want, but it’s a mandate, and it’s a grab at local control,” said Planning and Development Committee ranking member Rep. Joe Zullo, R-East Haven.
Members also argued over the details of a bill known as “Towns Take the Lead,” which would consider regional housing supply, need and wealth to determine the number of units of affordable housing that each town would be required to plan and zone for. These plans would have to be included in the 8-30j affordable housing plans that each town submits to the state every five years.
Advocates say that the policy aims to increase affordable housing supply while cutting down on segregation. It’s similar to a “fair share” policy proposed in past legislative sessions.
The conversion of commercial property into “middle housing,” or housing with up to nine units, was also a sticking point. The bill would have required that towns allow that type of conversion without a special hearing before the planning and zoning commission. 
Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester, has advocated for this policy since he joined the legislature in 2022, saying it would help address the housing crisis and use up office space that’s been empty since the pandemic.
But opponents said it ignored individual towns’ needs.
“It’s a total upending of zoning,” Candelora said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025_0522_SR_Session_123-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 22:01:30.737704

(Photo by Hollis Europe and Jacob Barbaro/NOAA Fisheries)Conservation groups and a Tribal government have sued to overturn a permit that allows a mining company to build a road and expand an airstrip at a site important to endangered whales.
At issue is the permit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers granted in September to Contango ORE Inc. for construction work at the Johnson Tract mining prospect on the west side of Cook Inlet.
The site is along the Johnson River and near Tuxedni Bay, a place where Cook Inlet belugas gather in winter to feed.
The lawsuit alleges that the Corps failed to properly consider impacts of the development on the endangered belugas, including the impacts of aircraft and vessel noise. The complaint also says the Corps failed to properly analyze the anticipated acid rock drainage and other sources of water pollution. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Anchorage, alleges violations of the federal Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act and National Environmental Policy Act.
The plaintiffs are Cook Inletkeeper, the Chickaloon Village Traditional Council, the Center for Biological Diversity and a Soldotna resident, Anna-Maria Mueller.
Satchel Pondolfino, clean water lead with Cook Inletkeeper, said in a statement that the Corps failed to assess the effect on the belugas in the inlet, which is named Tikahtnu in Dena’ina.
“The Johnson River supports an ecosystem rich with salmon, herring, wolves, wolverines and iconic Alaskan brown bears, which are becoming scarcer as Tikahtnu becomes more industrialized,” Pondolfino said. “What’s at risk is one of the most ecologically rich corners of Tikahtnu and the Army Corps has a duty to carefully scrutinize all implications of this permit.”
A spokesperson for the Corps’ Alaska district office declined to comment on the lawsuit, citing policies concerning pending litigation.
Cook Inlet belugas are highly sensitive to noise and depend on calls and songs to communicate and navigate. Tuxedni Bay is a refuge for them because it currently lacks the industrial noise widespread in other parts of the inlet, according to scientists.
Last year, Cook Inletkeeper and the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned the National Marine Fisheries Service to create a protective zone around Tuxedni Bay, limiting traffic and human activities there to keep noise levels low. That petition has not been granted.
The Johnson Tract, comprising about 21,000 acres, is within the borders of Lake Clark National Park but owned by Cook Inlet Region Inc., an Alaska Native corporation. CIRI acquired the inholding through a trade enabled by a 1976 federal law, the Cook Inlet Land Exchange. For decades, the corporation has been considering options for mining development at the site.
In 2019, CIRI leased the site to Vancouver-based HighGold Mining Inc., which conducted some exploration. Fairbanks-based Contango bought HighGold last year, and with that acquisition, the company took over Johnson Tract exploration operations.
Contango is also a part owner of the Manh Choh mine near Tetlin in eastern Interior Alaska, is developing the Lucky Shot mine in the Hatcher Pass area of the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and has other projects in early exploration stages.
The Johnson Tract holds gold, silver, copper, zinc and lead. Contango estimates that the Johnson Tract property holds over 1 million gold equivalent ounces, an industry measurement that combines different types of precious metals. Initial capital costs to develop the mine are estimated at $214 million, and once built, the mine would operate for at least seven years, according to a technical report the company released earlier this month.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


A preliminary budget request from President Donald Trump takes aim at a satellite program with a 50-year history whose data is housed just northeast of Sioux Falls, at a facility employing hundreds of people.
Trump’s discretionary budget request for NASA would cut $1.1 billion in funding for Earth observation programs, including what the request describes as cuts to the “gold-plated, two billion dollar Landsat Next” mission. The cut amounts to roughly half of the space agency’s budget for Earth observation, which includes money for Landsat design.
Landsat Next is planned as the next generation of Landsat, whose nine iterations have created the longest continuously collected Earth observation record in history. The first satellite launched in 1972.

NASA builds and launches Landsat satellites. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) operates them and curates the data collected by them.
The USGS Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center near Sioux Falls has housed Landsat data since 1973, in addition to millions of images from other satellites and modern and historical aerial imagery, all of which is accessible at no cost to users. Landsat’s free data is used to calibrate data from commercial satellites, contributing to what the USGS calculated last fall as a $25.6 billion return on public investment since the agency began freely sharing data in 2008.
The most recent satellite in the series, Landsat 9, entered low-earth orbit in 2021. Between that satellite and its near-identical predecessor, Landsat 8, the system gathers new imagery data of the entire Earth’s surface — as well as imagery from spectral bands like infrared that are invisible to the naked eye and measurements of Earth surface temperatures — every eight days.
  Powerful storms containing heavy rains caused major flooding to areas in the east central portion of the United States in early April 2025. Some communities in Kentucky saw more than 15 inches of rain, according to the National Weather Service. In the days following April 7 — the day Landsat 8 captured this imagery over a portion of the affected area — the Kentucky and Ohio rivers were forecast to reach historic levels and crest in dozens of locations. (Courtesy USGS Landsat program)
Landsat Next was set to launch around 2030, with improvements in resolution and speedier repeat image collection.
Trump’s budget request would “restructure” the Landsat Next mission “while NASA studies more affordable ways to maintain the continuity of Landsat imagery, which is used by natural resource managers, States, and industry.”
The request also calls for the elimination of $562 million in USGS funding. The change “eliminates programs that provide grants to universities, duplicate other Federal research programs and focus on social agendas (e.g., climate change) to instead focus on achieving dominance in energy and critical minerals,” Trump’s budget request says.
The cut to USGS amounts to about a third of its $1.6 billion budget.
The budget request is separate from the federal government’s efforts under Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to pare down the federal workforce.
Probationary employees across multiple federal agencies were first dismissed in February, but many returned to the federal payroll and placed on paid administrative leave after legal challenges.
It’s unclear how those moves to reduce the federal workforce have impacted the EROS Center.
Around 600 government employees and contractors work at the center, according to the latest figures posted on the USGS website, but the site including that figure hasn’t changed since March 2023.
Emails from South Dakota Searchlight to USGS press contacts at EROS and in regional and national offices on the number of employees who’ve departed since Jan. 25 went unanswered.
Searchlight also asked about the potential impact of the USGS budget cut proposal to EROS science programs, and about how changes to the Landsat program could affect EROS.
A NASA spokesperson told South Dakota Searchlight that the agency would be in a better position to respond “once we receive the President’s full budget request in the coming weeks.”
U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, pointed out that presidential budget requests are “aspirational” and “rarely implemented as written.”
“Dusty will continue to be supportive of Landsat’s efforts in Congress,” said a Johnson spokesperson.
The NASA budget has not emerged as a discussion point in budget reconciliation talks underway in Washington, D.C., on Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill.”
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, sounded similar notes in his response to questions about Landsat.
“The president’s discretionary budget is just that — discretionary. It outlines the president’s priorities and wish lists, but it will ultimately be our job in Congress to set the budget and appropriate federal dollars,” Rounds said in an emailed statement.
Representatives for Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota did not return emails requesting comment on Landsat and EROS.
Republican South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden told Searchlight during a visit to Sioux Falls recently that he hadn’t heard about requested cuts to the satellite program or to the USGS.
Even so, Rhoden said he trusts that an open relationship with the Trump administration on South Dakota’s priorities will help preserve them through budget negotiations.

“They give you some wiggle room as far as what your priorities are, and so I’m kind of optimistic that they are tempering some of those decisions with common sense,” Rhoden said.
Trump’s actions have had at least one public impact on EROS, though not an operational one.
EROS is home to a supercomputer whose processing power is shared across multiple arms of the Department of Interior. The system came to EROS with the name Denali, named after the tallest peak in the U.S.
Like the Alaska mountain after which the computer was named, the Denali system at EROS was renamed “McKinley” after the issuance of a Trump executive order.
Denali has long been the mountain’s name among Alaska’s Indigenous Athabascans, but the federal government embraced the name given to it by a prospector for about 100 years. The prospector called it “Mount McKinley,” after then-presidential candidate William McKinley.
President Barack Obama renamed it Denali in 2015, matching the name the surrounding national park had taken nearly 40 years earlier.
The order does not mention the USGS or supercomputers, but rather instructs the Department of Interior to “update the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) to reflect the renaming and reinstatement of Mount McKinley.”
The EROS supercomputer’s name was changed based on the order, however.
“Pursuant to President Trump’s Executive Order No. 14172, ‘Restoring Names that Honor American Greatness,’ this supercomputer has been renamed to McKinley,” a poster in the EROS visitor area now reads.

(Getty Images Creative)Food and nutrition cuts in the reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday would cost Wisconsin taxpayers at least $314 million if they are signed into law, a state health official said Thursday.
  Bill Hanna, Wisconsin Medicaid director
A requirement for the state to pick up some of the costs of the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, a provision penalizing the state for errors in distributing benefits, expanded work requirements for recipients and the elimination of a nutrition education program will all contribute to that cost, said Bill Hanna, Medicaid director at the Department of Health Services (DHS) in a briefing for reporters Thursday afternoon.
The SNAP program is known as FoodShare in Wisconsin and administered by DHS.
SNAP currently includes a work requirement for adults ages 18 to 54 without children to receive benefits. The legislation would raise the upper age to 65 and add the requirement to adults with children who are 7 or older.
Wisconsin has an employment and training program to help FoodShare recipients meet the existing work requirement. With the increase in people who would have to meet the requirement, “We estimate that would cost another $44 million a year,” Hanna said.
Currently the federal government funds 100% of the food benefits under SNAP. The new bill requires states to pick up a portion of the cost, which is tied to a state’s error rate, Hanna said. Errors include the payment of more benefits than a person qualifies for or the payment of fewer benefits than they qualify for.
“When errors are identified, we correct them, meaning if there was an overpayment to a member, that is recouped on future benefits, or if there’s an underpayment, we fix that and back pay those payments,” Hanna said.
Wisconsin’s error rate is low enough to require the state to submit only a 5% match for SNAP funds under the House Republican proposal, he said. But another change — which would allow zero tolerance even for errors that in the past have not counted against state programs — would boost the state’s required match to 15%.
DHS estimates based on the proposed new requirements the state would have to pay about $207 million a year in benefit costs, he said. If the state is able to reduce its error rate to qualify for the 5% match, it would still need to pay $69 million a year.
A higher state share of administrative costs in the bill would add $51 million to the state’s costs for SNAP, Hanna said.
The state would also lose the $12 million it receives for SNAP-Ed, a program that provides education to SNAP participants on healthier food choices.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner).LINCOLN — A “public safety” package on Thursday cleared a second lawmaking hurdle and retains what has been the most controversial element — lowering the minimum age at which a youth can be detained from 13 to 11.
Before Legislative Bill 530 passed on a 35-9 vote, however, lawmakers approved smaller juvenile-justice related changes to address some concerns of certain lawmakers and nonprofits, said State Sen. Carolyn Bosn, chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee.
Among modifications was a requirement that all temporary and alternative placement options be exhausted before a child age 11 or 12 would be detained in a facility, which critics say causes lasting trauma.
‘Super predator’ flag
Removed as a reason a youth could be detained was “harm to self” language. “We didn’t want to create an illusion that we were detaining youth who might be going through a mental health crisis,” said Bosn.
  State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha. (Courtesy of Nebraska Unicameral Information Office)
Also changed was the name of a new designation a court could bestow on certain youth offenders. Omaha State Sen. Ashlei Spivey had taken issue with the earlier proposed “high-risk juvenile probationer” category, comparing it to a “super predator” flag that would disproportionately harm youths of color. Amended language now refers to those youths as “comprehensive supervision probationers.”
In the end, Spivey was among nine “no” votes, joining State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North Omaha, who was unsuccessful in garnering support for additional changes. For example, he wanted to limit which law enforcement levels are to receive a monthly list of “comprehensive supervision probationers” generated by the Office of Probation Administration.
McKinney proposed that the list be provided only to high-ranking officers, not those below the rank of captain. He said his concern was the “rogue” law enforcement officers who can misuse such information to “provoke” or unfairly target youths. He said that happens disproportionately in his district.
McKinney noted during Thursday’s debate that a teen was dead after being shot by a Douglas County sheriff’s deputy that morning. The investigation is ongoing.
“I’m trying to make sure more lives don’t get lost,” McKinney said.
Good will, heartburn
Bosn said that no one likely would be completely satisfied with the juvenile justice parts of the public safety package, but she called the results so far a “showing of good will.”

Spivey said that while some parts still give her “heartburn,” she appreciated the process to try to reach a compromise on parts opponents said were overly punitive.
Bosn, a former prosecutor, views the overall package as promoting public safety while also better re-directing juveniles who have veered into trouble.
LB 530 includes an underlying bill introduced by State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha which aims to increase fines for speeding violations and to change the law to help “vulnerable road users.”
Segments of at least nine bills were folded into the megabill before the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee moved it to the floor for full debate. Lawmakers advanced it 33-0 in the first round and now, after approval Thursday, it moves to final reading.
Megabill parts
Other components folded into the package:
LB 6, introduced by Bosn and aimed at fentanyl poisoning, calls for enhanced penalties when the person using the controlled substance dies or sustains serious injury.
LB 44, by McKinney, allows individuals to file for post-conviction relief up until the age of 21 if the conviction occurred as a minor.
LB 124, by State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue, would match a drunken driver’s penalty for motor vehicle homicide of an unborn child to the penalty that drunken driver would get for motor vehicle homicide.
LB 395, by State Sen. Barry DeKay of Niobrara, would allow police access to a sealed juvenile record when someone applies for a concealed handgun permit.
LB 404, by State Sen. Robert Hallstrom of Syracuse, authorizes courts to extend a term of probation upon a joint application from the probation officer and the person on probation.
LB 600, by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, authorizes the Department of Transportation to temporarily reduce speed limits on highways under specific conditions such as adverse weather or traffic congestion.
LB 684, by State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln, was essentially gutted and replaced by a series of juvenile justice measures, including the lowering of the age at which a youth could be detained in a facility. That element, which sparked criticism from many during a public hearing, was originally part of a bill by Ralston State Sen. Merv Riepe.
Bosn said the Judiciary Committee sees the measures as ways to “improve accountability for juveniles and transparency for law enforcement.” Spivey said the detainment measures were among the package’s most concerning, and that prevention and rehabilitation services are more effective when dealing with young people whose brains are still developing.

Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, speaks in favor of House Bill 62 on Friday, May 16, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Legislature is on pace to raise the state’s age of sexual consent to 18 next year, after the state House voted 39-0 to approve House Bill 101 on Monday.
The bill now goes to the state Senate, which is expected to take it up in January, when lawmakers convene for the second year of the 34th Alaska State Legislature.
The bill comes from Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, who said on Monday that it represents a way to fight rape and child sexual assault.
Under current law, it is legal for an adult to have sex in Alaska with a 16-year-old or 17-year-old who consents. If that child is assaulted, Gray said, they must prove that they did not consent.
“This makes prosecutions of these cases of sexual assault and sex trafficking more difficult, especially if the young person had seen the perpetrator on multiple occasions, or if alcohol and drugs were involved,” Gray said. 
The bill has a significant exception: “For teens 13 to 15 years old, they can consent to sex with someone up to four years older than them. Sixteen- and 17-year-olds can consent to sex with someone up to six years older than them,” he said.
That exemption came at the suggestion of domestic violence shelters, sexual assault experts and homeless shelters, who were concerned that without the close-in-age exemption, they would deter teens from seeking help.
Additional clauses in the bill criminalize the sending of explicit images of 16-year-olds and 17-year-olds. 
“It is my hope that this bill will prevent the strategic targeting of 16- and 17-year-olds by predators,” Gray said.
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer, also spoke in support of the bill.
“This bill reminds us that those who are under 18 are still children,” she said. “They’re vulnerable youth. They are figuring out who they are in the world. … Raising the age of consent to 18  makes it easier for law enforcement to say, ‘We’re going to help you.’ It puts the onus on the offender instead of on the victim. That child victim no longer would have to prove that what  happened to them was not consensual.”
Vance and Gray unsuccessfully attempted last year to change the age of consent, but the proposal ran into technical problems and the session ended before those could be resolved.
HB 101’s passage came three years after the Legislature voted to limit child marriage by banning marriages involving Alaskans younger than 16. Because sex is permitted between married partners of any age, that effectively raised the state’s age of consent to 16.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday signed a bill born out of the backlash against his administration’s plan last summer to build golf courses, hotels, and pickleball courts at nine state parks.
The Legislature unanimously approved HB 209, which prohibits construction of specified sporting facilities and public lodgings in state parks, such as golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball courts, and ball fields.
Southeast Republican Rep. John Snyder pitched the proposal following backlash and protests from Republicans and Democrats alike, who opposed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection’s leaked plan to build such facilities.
While state officials dropped the plan, DeSantis tried to distance himself from it. He also told reporters during a press conference on May 7 that he would sign the bill. The governor’s office announced his approval of the bill among a list of 17 bills DeSantis signed Thursday.
“What began as the so-called ‘Great Outdoors Initiative’ to develop our parks has ended in a landmark law ensuring they are protected forever. This achievement is nothing short of historic,” Florida’s chapter of the Sierra Club posted on Facebook.
The new law requires the state to announce public hearings regarding projects in state parks 30 days in advance. The department had scheduled meetings to gather public feedback on the same date and time across the nine state parks, prompting further outrage and causing the postponement of those meetings.

(Photo by Getty Images, logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A female corrections officer fired for an alleged romantic relationship with an inmate has been awarded unemployment benefits.
State records indicate Azucena D. Valenzuela was employed as a corrections officer at the Fort Dodge Correctional Facility for three years before she was fired by the Iowa Department of Corrections in March 2025 for a having a relationship with an inmate.
According to the records, two of Valenzuela’s superiors approached her last October about a rumor that she was being enlisted to smuggle items into a correctional facility for a specific inmate. Valenzuela denied any knowledge of such activity, but her superiors allegedly told her that her interactions with the inmate in question were concerning.
On Dec. 22, 2024, the department placed Valenzuela on administrative leave while it investigated an alleged improper relationship between her and the inmate. The investigation looked into reports of Valenzuela talking with the inmate on the phone, talking with the inmate for extended periods during work hours, and what the department characterized as the two looking at each other in an “inappropriate” manner.
The department alleged that video footage showed Valenzuela talking with the inmate for extended periods on multiple occasions between Oct. 8, 2024. and Dec. 22, 2024, including six occasions in which they were captured on video while Valenzuela was working.
The department also claimed that during an encounter on Nov. 21, 2024, Valenzuela took the inmate’s iPad-style device and input the number of a “burner phone” she had purchased. However, at Valenzuela’s subsequent hearing on her application for unemployment benefits, the Department of Corrections provided “no evidence of any information put into the device at or around the time” Valenzuela handled it, Administrative Law Judge Blair Bennett observed.
The Department of Corrections also alleged the inmate had called Valenzuela’s phone on multiple occasions, expressing his affection for her and wanting to be with her. The person on the other end of the phone made similar comments. The department claimed multiple people said they believe it was Valenzuela on the receiving end of those calls, but it provided no such testimony from those individuals.
The department, Bennett later concluded, had conducted an extensive investigation and had determined that allegations of staff sexual misconduct were founded. Bennett noted that the corrections department had chosen not to offer any testimony from the witnesses it claimed to rely on in deciding to fire Valenzuela, nor did it provide her with any copies of phone recordings.
The department, Bennett found, “chose not to produce any witnesses to the alleged incidents, and did not produce anything that would credibly establish (Valenzuela) as being involved in phone calls with the inmate.” As such, she ruled, Valenzuela was qualified to receive unemployment benefits.
It’s not the first time the Department of Corrections has chosen to provide no direct evidence at hearings alleging workplace misconduct. In 2023, for example, the Fort Dodge facility fired corrections officer Robert W. Goodner for allegedly providing some unspecified form of “contraband” to inmates.
At Goodner’s hearing for unemployment benefits, none of the financial and phone records the department had subpoenaed — which would likely reveal the full scope of any alleged sales and the precise nature of any contraband — were offered into evidence. In addition, none of the DOC employees directly involved in the investigation testified at the hearing. As a result, Goodner was awarded unemployment benefits.
Asked then why the DOC didn’t present any records at Goodner’s hearing, Fort Dodge Correctional Facility Deputy Warden Don Harris said it was unclear what information the DOC should be sharing with others.
“I don’t know, since that’s part of an investigation for criminal prosecution, that the information should be put out there for anyone else,” Harris told the Iowa Capital Dispatch.



Iowans investigated for workplace porn, ‘sexual noises’ and Google Chat
Other Iowans recently fired for alleged misconduct include:
— Thomas E. Patterson, who in April was fired from the Iowa Department of Corrections’ Mt.  Pleasant Correctional Facility. Patterson had worked for the DOC as a full-time corrections officer since May 1999. State records indicate that while DOC policy restricted employees’ personal use of the internet, the agency’s employees regularly used Google Chat to communicate with each other at work. Throughout Patterson’s employment, he allegedly used Google Chat to discuss with colleagues subjects that were not work related.
On Dec. 2, 2024, the DOC began an investigation into Patterson’s internet usage and downloaded and reviewed more than 4,000 pages of Google Chat conversations between Patterson, his supervisor and his coworkers that dated back to 2023. As part of that process, the department also compiled all of the comments the claimant had made that the employer deemed objectionable, such as comments that were critical of management or which expressed frustration with staff or the workplace.
On April 2, 2025, the Mt. Pleasant Correctional Facility fired Patterson due to alleged violations of the employer’s information technology policy. He was awarded unemployment benefits, with the judge noting that Patterson’s Google Chat conversations had included his own supervisor, which provided the facility’s management with “immediate knowledge” of any misconduct. Despite that knowledge, the judge noted, Patterson wasn’t fired until April 2025.
— Ricky Lichtenberger, who was fired in February from Per Mar Security where he had worked since October 2023. According to the company, Lichtenberger was working in the security office of a hospital when a female EMT walked in and found Lichtenberger watching a sexually explicit video on his phone. The EMT later reported the video was playing loudly and she heard references to a woman’s anatomy and to certain sexual positions. When a manager asked Lichtenberger about the incident, he allegedly replied that it may have happened as described and that he “might have forgotten (he) was at work.”
Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson ruled Lichtenberger was ineligible for unemployment benefits and ordered that he repay $2,227 already collected. The video content, she ruled, “had nothing to do with his work as a security officer and (Lichtenberger’s) decision to not just watch the video but play its sound at full volume created, at minimum, an uncomfortable work environment for his coworkers and all others entering the security office.”
— Allison Austin, who in April was fired by the University of Iowa where she worked as a clerk.  According to state records, Austin was accused of making “sexual noises” during a quarterly, department-wide Zoom meeting that she attended by computer. Austin told the Iowa Capital Dispatch she doesn’t recall whether she had her computer’s camera activated during the meeting, but said that at some point during the session she had inadvertently activated her microphone. She said she believes she may have made some innocuous comments she didn’t intend her colleagues to hear, but which two human resources officials later claimed were noises of a sexual nature.
“You think these people in HR are there to protect you, but they’re accusing you having sex on a team meeting,” Austin told the Capital Dispatch. “I was mortified.”
Austin was fired not for her conduct during the meeting, but for discussing with her co-workers the university’s investigation of that conduct. She was denied unemployment benefits. Austin said she intends to appeal that ruling.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IWD-UNEMPLOYMENT-ART.jpg,,,2025-05-22 20:03:52.355717

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) Thursday afternoon to protest what they say is his lack of accountability, absence from public events since taking office, and his position on the federal budget bill.
“We are here to tell our representatives that we are watching them. Their votes have real consequences for real people; it’s costing lives. They think they can just cast their votes and be done, give all these tax cuts to the rich, and put blood on their hands,” Zahna Woodson, 31, from Caring Across Generations said. “This affects real people, this affects real lives, and it is detrimental to us. We have things to say, and they should come and face us.”
The protest was scheduled for noon, when demonstrators began arriving with signs criticizing the Trump administration and Rep. Barrett, while expressing support for Medicare and Medicaid services.

“We were hopeful that we could get Tom to vote no on this federal budget bill. We knew it was going to be hard, but we wanted our voices to be heard. Now, we’re shaming him for constantly voting against his constituents’ needs,” said Cecilia Garcia-Linz, 50, a member of the Sierra Club.
On Thursday morning, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives approved the sweeping tax-cut bill dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” by Donald Trump, sending it to the U.S. Senate.
Absent Tom Barrett, 7th District town hall meeting lets constituents express concerns, frustrations

In an “X” post, Rep. Barrett announced he voted yes, stating he did so to “deliver for hard-working families across mid-Michigan. Promises made. Promises kept.”
“We have thousands of supporters across the state of Michigan, and we will be impacted by this terrible budget bill. Seniors, veterans, and those who rely on Medicaid, like I did as a child and I do for mine, were able to survive and escape poverty because of these social services,” Garcia-Linz remarked.
The demonstration continued with various speakers emphasizing the defense of social services including Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare, which are currently considered under threat by the approval of the federal budget bill.
“I don’t know how many of you here are on Medicaid, but Medicaid and Medicare save lives,” said Judy Suess, 65, finishing her speech, followed by applause.

As the speeches came to an end, some protesters began chanting and waving their signs at passing drivers and pedestrians, with a few honking their horns in support of the cause.
Kimberly Smith, 65, a senior resident from Dewitt, was chanting and waving her sign passionately to the passing drivers until the end of the demonstration, and she explained her concern about these possible social service cuts.
“Social Security came about to bring seniors who have retired out of poverty years and years ago. Set to fund itself, and it does, and it was working just fine. Medicaid and Medicare help our seniors, our disabled, and those who need it, to keep them alive with the medical care they cannot have,” Smith said.
After about an hour, approximately 15 protesters headed to the office of U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) at the Federal building in Lansing to demonstrate after they learned through an email from the Sierra Club about her vote in favor of legislation repealing California’s EPA waiver. 
  Protesters gathered outside Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s (D-Holly) office on May 22, 2025 | Photo by Erick Diaz Veliz
In an email, members of the Sierra Club criticized Slotkin’s position.
“This standard has been one of the most powerful tools in reducing harmful air pollution, protecting our health, and fighting climate change in the United States. Trying to take away this authority is not only legally questionable, it would also have serious consequences for our health, our environment, and our economy,” the email stated.
In a press release, Slotkin emphasized her commitment to Michigan workers, noting that they live in the world’s auto capital and rely heavily on the automotive industry. She added that, as other states are beginning to reverse course on the policy, Michigan should consider doing the same.
“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035. Michigan is the auto capital of the world, and as Michigan’s U.S. Senator, I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry,” Slotkin stated.
The protesters then returned to Barrett’s office, where they ended the demonstration without incident.

“These new majors reflect both student demand and workforce trends in Iowa and across the nation,” said college President Scott Stokes in a news release. “They give our students more targeted opportunities to begin their educational journey locally while ensuring a clear and cost-effective route to a bachelor’s degree.”
The transfer degrees cover areas of study in agriculture business, agronomy, animal science, communication, English, political science and social work, according to the release. Each of the degrees were formed in agreement with the University of Iowa, University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University and will count for the first two years of a bachelor’s degree.
With the new additions to its academic offerings, the community college now offers more than 20 transfer degrees, the release stated, ranging from math to education, fine arts and more.
These degree programs were developed to make the transfer process from community college to university easier, with the assurance that their credits will seamlessly transfer, according to the release.
“Whether students are aiming for a career in agriculture, education, communication, or social services, these Transfer Majors give them a solid foundation,” said Beth Elman, executive director of marketing, in the release. “This expansion supports our mission of providing accessible, high-quality education that prepares students for lifelong success.”

Bob Ferguson at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle on Thursday, May 22, 2025. (Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Washington leaders are warning that at least 194,000 people in the state stand to lose Medicaid coverage under a Republican-backed budget bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday.
Only eight other states could potentially have more residents lose their health insurance from Medicaid than Washington, according to estimates released by Democrats on Congress’ Joint Economic Committee. 
Washington would also lose about $2 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next four years, Gov. Bob Ferguson said at a press conference Thursday at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. He said “no rainy-day reserve fund is going to backfill that.”
But he stopped short of saying the proposed cuts would necessitate a special legislative session since many of the bill’s provisions wouldn’t go into effect immediately.
The cuts also threaten the livelihood of the state’s nursing homes and rural hospitals, officials said.
“Hospitals will close in Washington state, in rural parts of our state and urban parts of our state,” Ferguson said. “Take that to the bank. That’s going to happen. Nursing homes in our state will close.”
In light of this, about two dozen Washington state Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, pleaded with the 12-member congressional delegation to avoid cuts that would imperil the state’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health. 
“We urge you to protect Medicaid,” they wrote in a letter sent Wednesday. “We can’t afford to lose local health care resources, and our rural communities will not be able to ride out the economic shockwaves that are sure to follow if this program is significantly cut.” 
The letter marked a departure from Republican lawmakers’ tact on federal policy maneuvering, as they’ve largely remained mum on the potential Medicaid cuts and numerous other hot-button topics since President Donald Trump took office in January.
Massive bill
The legislation that Republicans in Congress are forging ahead with is sprawling in scope. It would extend tax cuts approved in 2017 during Trump’s first term, pump more money toward border security, rework energy permitting and restructure college aid, among other changes.
To cut spending in line with their desired tax breaks, House Republicans propose reductions between $600 billion to $700 billion over 10 years to Medicaid, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. The program, which is run jointly by the federal government and states, provides health care for people who are poor or disabled. Roughly a quarter of Washington residents are covered by Medicaid.
The bill squeaked through the House by a single vote, with only Republicans in support. The two GOP representatives in Washington’s delegation, Dan Newhouse, of Sunnyside, and Michael Baumgartner, of Spokane, voted for it. 
Newhouse and Baumgartner’s red districts have the highest proportion of Medicaid enrollees in Washington. 
In a statement, Newhouse defended his vote, saying Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” would implement “real, common-sense reforms to strengthen the integrity of Medicaid, protecting the program for low-income families, seniors, and those with disabilities.” 
One of the key changes the bill proposes is a requirement that certain Medicaid recipients prove they are working to qualify for coverage.
Specifically, the proposal would require childless adults without disabilities to work, volunteer or attend school for 80 hours per month, with some exceptions. Work requirements would go into effect by the end of 2026, up from the initial 2029 meant to give states time to prepare.
Of Washington adults on Medicaid, 70% are working, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF.
Democrats have universally decried the legislation, framing it as an attempt by Republicans to pay for tax cuts that will deliver outsized benefits to wealthier taxpayers, while undermining safety net programs for lower-income Americans.
“This legislation is a betrayal of Republicans’ promise to lower costs for everyday families,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Medina. “It will rip health coverage away from millions of families while increasing groceries, utilities, and health care bills.”
The bill would also punish states like Washington that offer Medicaid-style coverage to immigrants without legal status. Enrollment in Washington’s program for immigrants is capped, and it is funded using only state money.
For states that offer programs like this, House Republicans want to decrease how much the federal government would pay to cover enrollees who qualify for Medicaid under expanded eligibility stemming from the 2010 Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Hundreds of thousands of Washington adults got Apple Health coverage under that expansion.
Over the next decade, this could shift to the state $10 billion in costs the federal government previously covered, according to KFF.
The legislation still needs to pass the U.S. Senate before reaching the president’s desk.
By way of background
Washington receives over $13 billion in federal funding for Medicaid, according to fiscal year 2023 data from the state Office of Financial Management. The state chips in another $8 billion, one of the largest categories of spending in its operating budget.
As of last month, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children, according to the state Health Care Authority, which oversees the program.
Jen Chong Jewell’s son, Gabriel, is one of them. The Everett 14-year-old has developmental disabilities and has used Medicaid to cover surgeries, therapies and medical equipment. 
“I love my son, and I hate that he, along with so many others, are being swept into this narrative about the need to, quote ‘eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,’” Chong Jewell told reporters.
Also looming is the expiration of expanded tax credits for the Affordable Care Act that allowed more people to purchase insurance. That change and others to the federal health care law could cost another 79,000 residents in Washington their coverage, according to the congressional analysis. 
Nationwide, this would bring the total to 13.7 million people with lost coverage by 2034.
The bill also would stop coverage for gender-affirming care for transgender people and reproductive care through Planned Parenthood. Washington state Senate Majority Leader Jamie Pedersen, D-Seattle, was among more than 500 legislators across the country who called on congressional leadership this week to preserve Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood services.

(Getty Images)A Republican plan to cut hundreds of millions of dollars from food assistance and health care programs for low income Americans to make way for tax cuts would have “devastating” results in West Virginia, advocates and providers say. 
The U.S. House of Representatives early Thursday passed a budget bill that analysts say would cut Medicaid by at least $716 billion — the largest in the program’s history — and cause roughly 15 million people to lose their health care coverage over the next few years. 
The bill, which has yet to be approved by the U.S. Senate, would also cut the Supplemental Food Nutrition Program by $300 billion through 2034 and push a portion of the cost of the program to the states to backfill. 
Both West Virginia Reps. Riley Moore and Carol Miller, R-W.Va., voted in support of the bill, which narrowly passed with a 215 to 214 vote.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the bill breaks a lot of promises made by Congress and President Donald Trump.
“It does, in fact, enact deep cuts to Medicaid and SNAP that will result in eligible people losing those benefits. It will raise grocery prices and health care costs for tens of thousands of West Virginia families,” she said. “And despite all that, it still increases the deficit, and that’s because it extends huge windfall tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthiest households in America.”
“Overall, this package just feels like a really bad deal for West Virginians,” she said. 
In West Virginia more than 500,000 people rely on Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for their health coverage.
The bill adds work reporting requirements, primarily for the expansion population — those that are on the program as a result of the Affordable Care Act expanding coverage to low-income households, Allen said. It also requires more frequent renewals, where participants are revaluated for eligibility in the program. 
The work reporting requirements and the more frequent determinations would result in an estimated 50,000 West Virginians being kicked off the health programs, despite continuing to qualify for coverage, she said. 
“The vast majority of West Virginians on Medicaid are either already working or likely would meet an exemption because they’re doing caregiving, they’re in school, they’re disabled,” Allen said. “But just because what we’ve seen in other states who have tried this is that overwhelmingly, people who do qualify get kicked off because the new requirements are confusing, burdensome and difficult to follow.”
The bill also adds co-pays up to $35 per Medicaid service and reduces retroactive eligibility from 90 days to one month, which would lead to hospitals in the states absorbing more uncompensated care, Allen said. 
The changes are estimated to cost West Virginia about $200 million per year in federal health care money that go to the state’s hospitals and providers, Allen said. 
“We know hospitals will see less revenue, and instead they’ll see more of a need for uncompensated care,” Allen said. The loss of revenue will result in an estimated loss of 2,000 to 3,000 health care jobs in the state, she said.
Laura Jones, executive director of Milan Puskar Health Right, a free and charitable clinic in Morgantown, said the Medicaid cuts would have a “profoundly negative effect” on the communities the clinic serves.
“We will have, once again, many people who lack health insurance,” Jones said. “And while there are six free clinics in the state in somewhat strategic locations, there are many areas of the state where options for people without insurance are limited or nonexistent.
“People will resort back to using the emergency room for primary care, which is by far the most expensive way to provide care,” she said. “Wait times at emergency departments will increase, and hospitals will be overwhelmed with uncompensated care yet again.”
Jones’ comments came during a virtual press conference about the Medicaid cuts Thursday hosted by the health care advocacy organization Protect Our Care. The group urged West Virginia Republicans Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice to vote against the cuts when the Senate considers the legislation. 
“Medicaid is a lifeline for West Virginia families, seniors, people with disabilities, low income adults and children,” Lynette Maselli, state director of Protect Our Care, said during the press conference. “Today, nearly one in three West Virginians rely on Medicaid for their health care. Cuts to the program mean fewer doctor visits, fewer life saving prescriptions, and more families forced to choose between paying rent and affording care for providers. It means more uncompensated care, lower reimbursements, job losses and potentially even closures of medical centers.” 
The bill does not extend tax credits put in place under the Biden Administration that have helped approximately 50,000 West Virginians pay for their health care on the health insurance marketplace established by the Affordable Care Act. The tax credits are set to expire at the end of the year. Allen said the tax credits expiring is likely to mean 15,000 state residents will lose their health care because plans are no longer affordable. 
“I think West Virginia would be among the state’s most impacted, because we have the highest health care prices in the country,” she said. “So those subsidies have made a huge difference in helping make prices more affordable.”
States would pick up some costs of the SNAP food assistance program 
The federal government has historically covered the entire cost of SNAP benefits, which help approximately 277,000 or one in six West Virginia residents get access to food. The state splits the cost of administering the program with the federal government.
Under the bill that passed the House Thursday, the federal government would shift between 5 to 25% of the cost of SNAP benefits to state governments beginning in 2028. The amount a state pays would depend on its payment error rate. 
West Virginia would pay up at least $28 million and up to about $141 million, depending on the error rate, according to an analysis from the Center on Budget Policies and Priorities. 
“[$141 million is] more than West Virginia spends on child care, CPS workers and the Promise Scholarship combined,” Allen said. “There’s not a lot of flexibility in the state budget right now as we’ve seen. That almost certainly means state lawmakers would have to raise taxes, raise revenue or cut SNAP or other things that are currently being paid for through the state budget.”
In addition to shifting the costs to the states, the proposal would expand a current work requirement for SNAP recipients. With some exceptions, able-bodied people up to age 54 who receive food benefits are required to work 80 hours a month or face a time limit on receiving SNAP assistance. Under the bill, those work requirements would be required through age 64. Parents of children age 7 and above, with some exceptions, would be subject to the work requirement. 
An estimated 80,000 West Virginia residents become subject to the work requirements or live in household with someone who does, Allen said. 
Amy Wolfe, executive director of the Charleston soup kitchen Manna Meal, said the cuts to food assistance would be devastating to the people her program serves. Wolfe estimates that at least 80% of Manna Meal clients get SNAP benefits. Her program helps families fill in the gaps that the SNAP program does not cover, she said. 
“Millions of families could lose access to healthy foods that literally we need,” she said. “These are the foods that we need to thrive, and we’re going to cut that? I mean, we’re talking children, seniors, people with disabilities, people without stable access to health care because of the Medicaid cuts — all of our local economies will be affected.”
The bill also eliminates funding to SNAP-Ed, the educational arm of the SNAP program. In West Virginia, SNAP Ed supports the West Virginia University Extension program. Kristin McCartney,  public health specialist and director of the SNAP education programs with WVU Extension, said the cuts would decimate staffing for the extension service, which currently has 40 staff educators in addition to administrative staff. 
“There would probably only be enough funding for potentially, like half of that,” she told West Virginia Watch. 
The West Virginia Democratic Party condemned Moore and Miller’s support for the bill, calling the legislation “a massive tax giveaway to the ultra-wealthy that slashes essential services for working families across West Virginia.”
In the statement, party vice chair Teresa Toriseva called the bill “a disaster for West Virginians and a betrayal of the very people Moore and Miller were elected to represent.”

Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to stop the bill from progressing through the Senate.
The U.S. House narrowly passed the “big, beautiful bill” early Thursday in a 215-214 vote, sending it to the Senate. Measures included in the package include an extension of the 2017 tax law enacted during President Donald Trump’s first term in office, increased spending for border security and defense, and a $4 trillion lift to the country’s debt limit.
It also includes provisions that would make major changes to Medicaid, reducing spending for the health coverage program by $625 billion over 10 years, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. It also shifts some of the costs of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to state governments. CBO analysis found these changes would result in income losses for low-income families across the country, but would increase resources for the highest earners in the U.S. in coming years.

All of Iowa’s current U.S. representatives are Republican, and all voted in favor of the bill Thursday. Three of the four representatives were also involved in the process of passing parts of the budget reconciliation package through committees earlier in May, including the pieces making changes to SNAP and Medicaid.
U.S. Reps. Zach Nunn and Mariannette Miller-Meeks, both Republicans currently representing districts that are considered possible pick-ups for Democrats in the 2026 midterms, have repeatedly defended their support of the bill against criticism from Democrats and others who say the cuts to public assistance programs like Medicaid will hurt Iowans.
Nunn released a statement Thursday saying the bill is a “win for Iowa” by extending tax cuts and providing assistance to farmers and businesses.
“The bill also safeguards key benefit programs for vulnerable Iowans while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,” Nunn said. “It bolsters border security, restores accountability, and invests in American energy dominance — where Iowa is already leading the charge.”
Miller-Meeks similarly praised the bill, saying it will help Iowans who need public assistance by taking steps like “removing illegal immigrants from Medicaid” and preventing future tax hikes.
“As a former small business owner and Army veteran, I know what’s at stake,” Miller-Meeks said in a statement. “This bill protects Iowa families, seniors, and small businesses while strengthening Medicaid for the vulnerable — not for those who can work and choose not to. I’m especially proud that my two bills to improve Medicaid integrity and expand access to pediatric care were included. Today’s vote is a win for Iowa and for every American who believes in work, responsibility, and a government that serves its people, not the other way around.”
In the wake of the bill’s passage, several Iowa organizations opposed to the cuts warned that if the budget reconciliation package becomes law, thousands of Iowans could lose health coverage or struggle to pay for food. Evan Schultz, a Des Moines resident with quadriplegia who works at Central Iowa Center for Independent Living, said in a Fairness for Iowa news release that he relies on Medicaid and SNAP to live independently.
“My Congressman chose tax breaks for billionaires over me,” Schultz said in the news release. “I can’t tell you how sad, scary and disappointing this is. Medicaid and SNAP don’t make anyone rich. They help us get by. They help me live on my own and make sure I have enough to eat. If I get kicked off Medicaid my life will be upside down, but at least I have my family to turn to. For many, their lives will be over.”
Iowa Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, who is running as a Democratic candidate in Iowa’s 3rd District, said Nunn went back on earlier pledges to defend Medicaid and SNAP.
“Zach Nunn is the worst type of politician,” Trone Garriott said in a Thursday statement. “Just last month, Nunn vowed to block any attempt to cut Medicaid or SNAP benefits – but it was just talk. His actions show who he really is: last night he voted to rip away health care and food assistance from Iowans already struggling with the rising cost of living.”
In a news release, Nunn pointed to a provision included in the budget reconciliation bill that he advocated for which prohibits consideration of future funding cuts to SNAP and Medicaid for people under age 19, 65 and older, pregnant women and people with disabilities.
While the measure passed the House, the Senate is expected to make changes to the bill — meaning it will be sent back to the House for another round of consideration before reaching Trump.
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, urged U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst to vote against the budget package as it goes through the Senate during a Thursday news conference hosted by Defend America Action, a group launched earlier in May to oppose Trump administration policies. Wahls spoke alongside Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, who served as administrator of Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) during the Biden administration, about the potential loss of Medicaid coverage for Iowans that could occur if the budget reconciliation bill is passed.
Wahls said the GOP funding plan will “cuts health care funding that 700,000 Iowans rely on.”
“I can tell you exactly what voting for this so-called budget means: It means a $518 million hole blown in our state budget, it means 86,000 Iowans losing their health care and higher costs for hundreds of thousands of Iowa families,” Wahls said. “While the ultra rich are going to get a big, beautiful tax cut, it’s middle class and working Iowans who are going to get stuck with the bill.”
Wahls quoted Ernst speaking during a tele-town hall Monday with U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson, when the senator acknowledged there were “hiccups” involved in some federal funding cuts made through the Department of Government Efficiency.
“I’m not going to say that there’s not a little pain involved with that because we know there is,” Ernst said, the Gazette reported. “But, we are trying to do it in a meaningful manner here in Congress and take into consideration what our Iowans are thinking.”
Wahls said this approach cannot be taken for cuts to Medicaid and SNAP.
“When you cut food assistance school meals for kids and Meals on Wheels for seniors, it’s not ‘a little pain,’ It’s 116,000 Iowans going hungry,” Wahls said. “When my neighbors and constituents can’t see a doctor because you cut their health care, it’s not a little pain, it’s a matter of life or death. Iowa deserves better than politicians who just shrug their shoulders at suffering and dismiss it as ‘a little pain’ while they hand out tax breaks to their billionaire donors.”
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, also Republican, said in a May 14 call with reporters that negotiations are continuing on the bill in the Senate, but that he wants a bill that “is going to be pro-growth and deliver policies that are good for Iowans.”
“We can’t let everything just fall apart, because we’re going to have the biggest tax increase in the history of the country, with the sunsetting of the 2017 tax bill,” Grassley said. “We’ve got to keep it going.”

In her final official appearance before lawmakers, Wyoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Kate Fox defended the process for choosing the state’s judges. But some lawmakers still want changes.
The post As scrutiny of judges grows, lawmakers weigh changes to Wyoming’s selection process appeared first on WyoFile .","For her final official appearance before a legislative committee, Wyoming Supreme Court Chief Justice Kate Fox visited Torrington on May 19 prepared to defend the state’s judiciary system.
Weeks before the meeting, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus had criticized the judiciary in a pair of blog posts. Citing recent court decisions and some judicial nominations, the caucus’ blog post alleged Wyoming’s process for selecting judges was shaped by “political insiders” and “left-wing institutional capture.”
Fox’s rebuttal came from the book of rules governing Wyoming judges. 
“A judge shall not be swayed by public clamor or fear of criticism,” Fox read from the book, drawing from a chapter dealing with questions of external pressures.
“Our job is to follow the laws,” she added. “Not to be subject to the popular will, because what we do is often not popular.” 
The Freedom Caucus’ push for lawmakers to scrutinize the state’s judiciary system comes as President Donald Trump and his allies increasingly clash with, and criticize, federal judges, even calling for their impeachment in some cases. It also comes as the state waits for a momentous decision from the Wyoming Supreme Court on whether legislative attempts to block abortion access are constitutional. 
And for Fox, the scrutiny comes as her time on the bench ends. After 11 years presiding on the state’s high court, the law requires her to step down at age 70. Her last day is May 27. So, in an era where a new guard is changing Wyoming politics, the Joint Judiciary Committee meeting played host to a vivid, if respectful, exchange between the outgoing chief justice and a group of mostly freshmen lawmakers aligned with the Freedom Caucus. 
Those lawmakers questioned Fox as to why Wyoming’s system for nominating judges was, in large part, walled off to public scrutiny, without elections or necessitating Senate approval for appointments.
Some of the changes suggested by lawmakers would open the judiciary to the kind of “political and financial influence” its rules currently guard against, Fox said. 
But the Judiciary Committee decided to consider a significant change to the judge-nominating process at its August meeting in Casper. The committee voted 8-6 to have the Legislative Service Office draft a joint resolution that would ask voters if they wanted the Wyoming Senate to have final approval over the appointment of new state Supreme Court justices.
It was the second of two close votes as Rep. Jayme Lien, R-Casper, sought to find a path for the committee to take up a bill draft, against the wishes of its two chairmen — Sen. Jared Olsen, a Cheyenne Republican and attorney, and Rep. Art Washut, a Casper Republican.
Lien’s first motion, for a bill that would have changed state law without going to voters, failed on a tie vote. That bill would have required Senate confirmation for all new judges, not just supreme court justices. 
The swing vote between the two motions was longtime Sen. Larry Hicks, R-Baggs.

Rep. Laurie Bratten, R-Sheridan, had sought to add days to the Joint Judiciary Committee’s meeting agenda for studying judicial reform — something Freedom Caucus leaders previously indicated to WyoFile they hoped a committee would explore during the time between legislative sessions. Olsen overruled that idea. Lien said she was moving for the joint resolution to ensure the committee scrutinizes the topic. 
“Ultimately, I’d like the entire nominating commission to go away,” she said before a vote on her first motion, “but … we’re not going to get enough time to discuss that.” 
Wyoming selects judges today under what is commonly called the Missouri Plan, where a commission reviews applicants and sends a limited set of choices to the governor for a final pick.
In Wyoming, the Judicial Nominating Commission is composed of seven people. Three are attorneys, elected from within the Wyoming State Bar, and three are non-lawyers who are appointed by the governor. The seventh member, who serves as chairperson and tie breaker, is the chief justice of the Wyoming Supreme Court. 
Fox repeatedly told lawmakers she believed there already was public input in both the selection and retention of judges. In selecting judges, that comes principally because people can weigh in with the governor, who makes the ultimate decision on what candidate to nominate for a bench seat.
When a judgeship opens, the Judicial Nominating Commission fields and reviews applications for the position. 
The names of applicants are not made public. Those names stay confidential for two reasons, Fox said. One is to allow practicing attorneys to apply without signaling to their clients or law firms that they’re pursuing a new job. The other reason, she said, is to insulate the nominees and the process from political pressure. Fox and two nominating commission members previously interviewed by WyoFile described the review of applicants as a study of their merits and judicial temperaments that includes feedback from attorneys and judges. 
Once the commission vets candidates, it sends three nominations to the governor. At that point, the public can weigh in. That’s an option Freedom Caucus lawmakers have exercised in the past, such as when former Republican lawmaker Tim Stubson was among the three nominations in 2023 — Stubson was involved in fundraising and campaign efforts that sought to blunt the Freedom Caucus’ rise in the Legislature. 
Gov. Mark Gordon picked Robert Jarosh for the bench over Stubson. 
Judges also appear on the ballot in Wyoming, Fox noted. Though they’re appointed into office, voters have an opportunity to vote them out every four, six or eight years, depending on the level of court they serve in. State Supreme Court justices only face retention elections every eight years. 
Notably, Fox said she and others in the judiciary would consider publicizing the names of applicants for judgeships while they’re under consideration by the Judicial Nominating Commission. “I think the court would be open to revising that process,” she said. 
But on the whole, Fox questioned lawmakers’ motivation for scrutinizing the state’s third branch of government. 
“I really need to push back on a lot of the basis for this conversation,” Fox said. “What really is the problem? We have some very good judges in Wyoming. So, before we start saying ‘how can we fix it?’ I really want to know what is wrong with it.”
The most recent polling available shows more residents approve of how the state’s judges handle their jobs than disapprove. In polling conducted last September and October by the Wyoming Survey and Analysis Center, only 13% of respondents told the center they disapproved of how judges handle their jobs, while more than 40% of respondents said they approved.

In its blog posts, the Freedom Caucus cited specific court decisions they didn’t like. Chief among them was a Teton County judge’s ruling against the Legislature’s 2023 abortion ban, and a more recent decision by a Natrona County judge to pause a transvaginal ultrasound requirement and stringent regulations lawmakers sought to place on Wyoming’s only abortion clinic, which is in Casper. 
Rep. Tom Kelly, R-Sheridan, told WyoFile he did not believe the Wyoming judiciary system was in need of stringent reforms. But he said a series of politically charged court decisions — in both Wyoming and nationally — drew fresh attention to the way judges are selected in Wyoming, and people found the system opaque.
Publicizing the names of judicial applicants could allow people concerned about the system to better understand who was applying and who wasn’t making the cut, he said. “Anything that government institutions can do to be open and transparent will help bolster faith in our system again,” he said. 
Lien’s proposal for Senate approval of new supreme court justices brings a major practical question with it: With a citizen legislature, the Wyoming Senate is only in session two months a year or less. Several lawmakers in Torrington questioned what would happen if a supreme court seat came open when lawmakers weren’t in Cheyenne.
In the moment, Lien did not have an answer for that question — saying she wanted to order a draft bill so the committee could craft a policy together at its next meeting. 
While Lien only needed a majority of the committee to agree to draft the bill, there is a higher hurdle for the committee to vote to sponsor the bill when the Legislature convenes in 2026. The proposal will need the backing of a majority of the representatives and a majority of the senators on the committee for sponsorship. 
And because next year’s legislative gathering is a budget session, such a bill would need to receive two-thirds support for introduction.

The advocates said in a press conference Thursday the bill is “extremely problematic” to biofuels, farming, energy and Iowa economies.
The bill, House File 639, which passed the Iowa Senate May 12 and is awaiting a signature from Reynolds, would change definitions of a common carrier and increase insurance requirements for pipelines transporting liquid carbon dioxide. It would also set requirements for the Iowa Utilities Commission and expand who can intervene on dockets with the commission.

Advocates and lawmakers in favor of the bill oppose the use of eminent domain by the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline, which would transport captured carbon dioxide from ethanol facilities in Iowa, and neighboring states, to underground storage in North Dakota. 
Monte Shaw, Iowa Renewable Fuel Association’s executive director, said on the call that HF 639 does not protect landowners from eminent domain, but specifically targets carbon capture pipelines. 
“You hear a lot of talk about principles, but what we see are bills that are about preferences,” Shaw said.
Impact to other projects
Mike Jerke, the CEO of Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy, or SIRE, an ethanol facility in Council Bluffs, said the bill would impact his ability to connect to the Tallgrass Trailblazer carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska, even though he has been able to secure 100% voluntary easements for the project.
The project in Nebraska is operated by Tallgrass and converts an existing pipeline owned by the company into a carbon capture pipeline that is projected to be operational at the end of 2025. Jerke said SIRE has plans to start capturing its CO2 by mid 2026, following the construction of the technology. 
Jerke said even though he has no need nor intent to use eminent domain to connect to the pipeline in Nebraska, HF 639 would impact his project. 
HF 639 requires pipeline operators to carry insurance that would cover any loss or injury that occurs from accidental, negligent or intentional discharges from the pipeline. It also requires pipeline operators foot the bill if landowners have increased insurance premiums because of the pipeline. 
“So apparently, we need to go find a product, an insurance product, who will allow us to do something that would be in violation of the very permit that we’re applying for,” Jerke said. 
Jerke said his project, and future projects in the state, are also impacted by the provision in the bill that limits carbon sequestration pipelines to just a single, 25-year term, without an opportunity for renewal. 
“We’re making a significant investment — we have contracts in place for over $45 million to build the equipment on our site to capture and compress the CO2,” Jerke said. “Apparently, this is going to be, if this were to stand or be signed into law, something that we would only be able to operate for 25 years.” 
Shaw no one would built a house or a business on Main Street if they knew in 25 years, they would have to walk away from the project, without the ability to sell it, or renew the permit. 
“This fall, Iowa will no longer be the world’s most profitable place to turn corn into ethanol,” Shaw said. “The moment Tallgrass starts operating and the plants hooked up to Tallgrass in Nebraska can sequester, the premium they will get in the market … will make Nebraska the most profitable place in the world to produce ethanol.” 
Shaw said this will impact Iowa facilities, not just in terms of canceling planned carbon capture expansion, but could also lead to the closure of several plants. 
Vic Miller, a Fayette County farmer and member of Iowa Corn Growers Association, said the bill impacts the “very viability” of corn growers.
Corn farmers are projected to produce nearly 16 billion bushels in yield this year and have around 1.8 billion in carryout, or grain left after demand, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data analyzed by National Corn Growers Association.
“It’s ahead of anything we’ve ever raised,” Miller said. “Once you get above that 2 billion mark in carryout, basis widens, everything just goes south.” 
Corn farmers and the ethanol industry see entry to ultra-low carbon markets, most prominently the sustainable aviation fuel industry, as the best opportunity to expand the market. 


Federal action
Pipeline opponents were worried by language in early drafts of the U.S. House budget reconciliation bill that would have allowed pipeline operators to work around state permitting agencies, and laws like HF 639, and a South Dakota law banning eminent domain for CO2 pipelines.
The language was removed from the bill, which passed the House early Thursday.

Those in support of the bill, including the Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club and the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, have been celebrating the passage of HF 639. 
A press release from Bold Alliance and the Iowa Easement Team said the bill does not fulfill landowners’ primary goal of banning eminent domain for CO2 projects, but does “protect landowners” via the new insurance mandate and impact the Summit project via the change in definition of a common carrier.
“We still have work to do to ensure Iowa bans eminent domain for carbon pipelines,” Jess Mazour with the Sierra Club said in the release. “We will be back in 2026 to fight for a ban …. This will be a leading election issue.” 
The Free Soil Foundation, a citizen group opposing CO2 pipelines, urged Iowans to call the governor’s office and voice support for the bill, which it called “a major step forward in protecting Iowa landowners and preserving constitutionally-protected property rights.”
IRFA has also been urging its members to call the governor, who has not indicated if she will sign the bill or veto it. 
“What would happen if she signs it? I’m not willing to think about that yet,” Shaw said. “I’m only worried about how we can get Iowans to reach out and say, regardless of how you feel about CO2, this bill has really massive negative unintended consequences that will impact all forms of energy, all forms of economic development across the state.”

Jane Raybould of Lincoln. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature will retake a vote on a proposal to slow down voter-approved minimum wage increases – but likely not this session. 
A Democratic-led minority and Republican-led majority in the officially nonpartisan body fought Thursday over whether to allow reconsideration of the vote on Lincoln State Sen. Jane Raybould’s Legislative Bill 258. 
Raybould, whose family owns a grocery store chain that includes Super Saver, is the lone Democrat supporting the slowdown. State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont is the lone Republican opposing the bill.
The rest of the Legislature’s Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive who usually votes with them, argued against ignoring “the will of the people.” They celebrated a brief tactical victory May 14 by forcing a faster vote while one GOP senator was off the floor and missed the vote.
“Hats off to the opponents. Well played and well within the rules, just as this motion … is in order and appropriate,” State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse said. “We’re here today due to a heat of the moment.” 
Raybould’s revived proposal, in its current form, would shrink voter-approved annual wage increases by setting the annual increase at 1.75%. It also would create a youth minimum wage and amend a separate state training wage to limit it to workers aged 16 to 19 at 75% of the state minimum wage later this year, rather than at 75% of the federal wage. Training workers can earn that wage for up to the employee’s first 90 days on the job.
Under the voter-approved law, workers would see larger wage increases. Currently, the state minimum wage is $9 an hour. If lawmakers do nothing, voters will increase that to $15 next year. Then the base wage would increase each year based on a cost of living measurement, a calculation of inflation for the Midwest region from the previous August. 
The same lawmakers who used the rules to force a quicker vote and kill the bill challenged the legitimacy of the motion to reconsider. Speaker John Arch pointed to a reconsideration motion on a bill in 1984 as precedent, allowing State Sen. Beau Ballard of Lincoln to file a reconsideration motion after all.

A reconsideration motion requires a senator on the “prevailing” side to want to change a vote, or the requesting senator must have missed the vote. Ballard voted “no” after realizing Sorrentino had missed the vote. 
“I disagree that this is in order,” Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said. “But even if it is in order, it’s a waste of the people’s time. If not, break, bend the rules in an effort to continue our parade of walking back the people’s votes. It’s kind of an embarrassment for the body.” 
Raybould pushed back on the idea that she was messing with the people’s will, saying she made  “a commitment to follow the rules of this body and not bend the rules, despite what so many might be saying today.”
She previously told reporters that she is uncomfortable with suspending legislative rules to bring back her bill. Raybould and supporters of her measure said her changes would protect small businesses that could not afford to pay more. 
“I am saddened that the debate on previous rounds of debate on this bill became ugly, heated and personal,” Raybould said. “It didn’t have to, and that was a choice as well.” 
Thursday’s push was the latest part of a trend of the GOP-majority Legislature pushing back against a handful of ballot measures passed by Nebraska voters on requiring paid sick leave, raising the minimum wage, repealing school vouchers and legalizing medical marijuana. 
Arch said he didn’t intend to reschedule the bill for a vote for the remainder of the legislative session. He told a reporter that it’s a “matter of fairness,” because he is “just flat out of time.” 
“I’ve got 11 general file priority bills that are not going to be able to make it to the floor,” Arch said. “In fairness to those that have not been able to get on the floor … it’s not appropriate to bring a bill back for a vote, take perhaps another two hours … take time.”
The political dynamics facing the bill could change next year as voters see base wages increase to $15. Raybould’s proposal, if passed next year, would claw back some of the increases that young people would get under the current law, which Raybould acknowledges. 
“Sadly, what I think will happen come [next] January, and I’ve heard through several small businesses that I’ve been in contact with and have emailed me that they probably won’t hire 14- and 15-year olds,” Raybould said. “They’ll just give more hours to those that have been with them … more years.” 
If Raybould decides not to wait, Ballard and Raybould both said they’re still open to amending Raybould’s proposal into his paid sick leave bill. His proposal would weaken a voter-approved paid sick leave framework, using similar arguments to hers. Ballard said he would prefer to keep his bill clean.

Ryan Zinke speaks at a press conference announcing the launch of the bipartisan Public Lands Caucus on May 7, 2025. (Courtesy photo)Calling it his “San Juan Hill,” a reference to a Spanish-American War battle victory by Teddy Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, Montana U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke announced Wednesday he had successfully led a bipartisan charge to remove a provision to sell public lands from the federal budget bill. 
The provision to sell off roughly 450,000 acres of federal land in Utah and Nevada passed out of the House Natural Resources Committee in early May, but met opposition from conservation groups and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
The proposed sale and exchanges of land involved areas near Las Vegas, Reno and St. George, Utah, aimed at allowing for affordable housing developments on Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management Land. 
Zinke, a Republican and former Interior Secretary who formed the new bipartisan Public Lands Caucus the day after the provision was adopted in committee, has been a strong opponent to the sale of federal public land. 
“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a press release on Wednesday. “Public access, sportsmanship, grazing, tourism… our entire Montanan way of life is connected to our public lands.”
The House Rules Committee removed the provision from the budget bill after opposition from several Western Republicans, including Zinke, Rep. Troy Downing, R-Montana, and Public Lands Caucus Vice Chairman Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. 
The opposition to public lands sale threatened to derail President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a sweeping 1,116-page bill that contains the administration’s spending priorities.
With the federal land transfer portion struck from the reconciliation package, Zinke and Downing both endorsed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” which includes extending the Trump Administration’s tax cuts from 2017, increasing funding for the border wall, Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and temporarily eliminates taxes on overtime work and tips. 
The bill could also cut funding from programs such as Medicaid and SNAP benefits, which states may have to fund in order to keep service levels intact. It also includes implementing work requirements for Medicaid within two years and accelerates the phase-out of clean energy tax credits enacted by former President Joe Biden. 
The bill, which passed an initial House vote by a single vote, still faces opposition for its price tag. The Nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates it would add nearly $4 trillion to the nation’s debt.
 Public lands in public hands 

Multiple conservation groups released statements praising the work done by Zinke, and thousands of constituents nationwide, to remove the public lands sale amendment from the bill. 
“Tens of thousands of Montana hunters, anglers, and other outdoor enthusiasts have been flooding the Capitol switchboard, attending weekend rallies, and writing letters and postcards to Congress, asking that the public lands transfer amendment be killed,” said Mike Mershon, board chair and president of the Montana Wildlife Federation, in a statement. .
“Selling our shared public lands to pay for tax cuts for the rich was and is an awful, un-American idea, and we appreciate Rep Zinke’s work to keep it out of the bill. His colleagues never should have considered it in the first place,” Lydia Weiss, senior director for government relations at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement. 
Montana Conservation Voters, Trout Unlimited, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, Outdoor Recreation Roundtable, MeatEater and other groups also released statements. 
The success in appealing to Republican leaders to make the change marked a strong win for the new members of the Public Lands Caucus. 
Downing said in a statement that he was pleased the bill removed the public lands sale, and that it includes keeping the Bull Mountains Mine in Musselshell County operational. 
“Our legislation delivers historic tax cuts, secures our borders, strengthens key programs for future generations, eliminates waste, fraud, and abuse, and sets the country on a path toward fiscal responsibility,” Downing said. “Our work is not done, but Republicans will not rest until this once-in-a-generation legislation is signed by the President.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/831A4227-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

Customers around Illinois will see significantly higher prices on their electric bills next month.

Customers around Illinois will see significantly higher prices on their electric bills next month.

The average residential customer of northern Illinois’ Commonwealth Edison will pay about $10.60 per month more this summer, according to a company statement. Downstate Ameren Illinois customers, meanwhile, can expect an 18% to 22% increase in their monthly bill. Prices will likely decrease in October once winter electric rates go into effect.

Increasing energy prices are causing alarm among some consumer advocates and state policymakers, who worry that the long-term problems underlying the rising costs could lead to even higher prices or rolling blackouts.

Clara Summers, who advocates for consumer-friendly energy policy on behalf of the nonprofit Citizens Utility Board, said the ComEd price increases were for two reasons: increasing demand from data centers and large manufacturing as well as procedural issues slowing down new renewable projects.

CUB officials said the issues underlying Ameren’s increase were similar, while noting that both were due in part to the way grid regulators structure pricing.

The price hikes are a major undercurrent of escalating tensions over a package of energy reforms making its way through Springfield as lawmakers race toward their scheduled May 31 adjournment.

“We’re trying to keep prices low while combating climate change,” Jen Walling, head of the Illinois Environmental Council, told Capitol News Illinois. The IEC has been heavily involved in advocating for parts of the bill.

In December, federal officials at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation — the nonprofit oversight agency for grid operators — designated the grid for central and southern Illinois as “high risk” for not having enough electricity to meet demand on hot days in the summer and cold days in the winter over the next five years. The grid that stretches from central Canada to the Mississippi river delta is the only power grid in the nation to have that designation, with much of its risk stemming from power plants closing.

Illinois’ northern grid, which includes parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. from Illinois to the east coast, faces “elevated” risk. That means extreme weather events are “likely” to cause shortfalls in energy reserves.

The increased demand stems from data centers, increasing adoption of electric heat pumps and the rise of electric vehicles, according to NERC.

David Braun, an executive at the energy technology company Intelligent Generation, said demand on the electric grid is the highest it’s been in the 30 years he’s worked in the energy sector.

“We haven’t seen this in a long time,” Braun told Capitol News Illinois. “So, it’s catching planners by surprise, and it takes a long time to build power plants.”

Shrinking supply

That demand, according to NERC’s December report, is coming at the same time supply is going down — increasing pressure on the grid.

Around the country, fossil fuel plants are closing as states move to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. While Illinois exports energy overall, plant closures elsewhere in the country can affect the price of energy, raising prices for Illinoisans. Grid operators nationwide, meanwhile, face yearslong red tape-induced backlogs on new renewables.

Downstate Illinois’ grid might run out of energy reserves as soon as 2034, per NERC. Northern Illinois’ grid has more reserves but will face decreased levels throughout the next decade. If nothing is done to either reduce demand or increase supply, this means prices could continue to increase or blackouts could become necessary to stabilize the grid.

To address these issues, lawmakers in Springfield are weighing sweeping energy legislation. The bill’s proponents say its provisions to incentivize new developments are the only way to prevent serious problems without walking back the state’s climate goals.

Republican critics contend that the main reason for the legislation is to fix problems with the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act. Gov. JB Pritzker’s marquee climate policy, they say, is a major cause of the supply shortfalls because it requires fossil fuel-burning power plants to shut down by 2045.

Others say provisions aimed at reducing data centers’ energy demands on the grid will hurt businesses in the state.

Lawmakers and advocacy groups are currently reviewing draft language for the bill, which has not been made public. Even with complex procedural maneuvering to avoid long-passed deadlines, lawmakers face a tight turnaround to reach an agreement before the legislative session ends.

The process could have become more complicated, some suggest, after the U.S. House passed a wide-ranging bill early Thursday that could drastically alter federal energy incentives if it becomes law.

Higher prices

Bills for customers of private electric utilities — most notably ComEd and Ameren — will go up in June.

The increase was determined at two recent capacity auctions, which are how grid operators set energy prices for years into the future. High prices at these auctions can indicate low supply relative to demand.

PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for northern Illinois, saw a roughly eight-fold jump in its most recent capacity auction compared to the year prior. Downstate’s energy grid, Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, saw more than a 20-fold year-over-year price jump at its capacity auction in April.

Representatives of the state’s two largest electric utilities stressed that these increases occurred beyond their purview.

“ComEd does not profit from this increase, was not part of the auction, does not supply capacity, and does not retain any proceeds of the capacity charge payments,” ComEd spokesperson John Schoen said in a statement.

An Ameren spokesperson echoed the sentiment, noting that the state requires utilities to pass this type of cost to customers “dollar-for-dollar, without markup.”

The price is lower for ComEd customers than it could have been due to a provision in CEJA, which credits customers when energy generated by nuclear power plants is above a certain level. Consumer watchdogs at CUB estimate that the policy cut the increase for ComEd customers by about 17%. Customers in the Ameren area, which has much less nuclear power, are not eligible for the credit.

Other energy providers

While millions of Illinoisans get their power from ComEd and Ameren, some get their electricity through other means, including alternate retail suppliers, municipal utilities and electric cooperatives. Many of these energy suppliers are not affected directly by the capacity auctions.

Municipal customers in towns like Naperville, St. Charles and Rantoul are largely insulated from the spike, according to Staci Wilson, the head of government affairs for the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency. The IMEA is a private entity that provides electricity to 32 of the 42 municipal electric systems in the state.

IMEA sometimes participates in capacity auctions. But Wilson said the agency tends to secure energy through other means, such as having ownership stakes directly in power plants.

“IMEA member municipalities have rates that are currently lower than private utilities and our ownership model continues to gain value as we transition to a carbon-free future in an affordable and reliable manner,” Wilson said.

But other municipal utility officials, including those at Springfield’s City Water, Light and Power, are less optimistic about future prices.

“Regulations are forcing plant retirement a little too soon,” CWLP spokesperson Amber Sabin said. “And the grid operators that are here, they have resources that they can't connect to the grid. They're waiting, or they don't get financing or ever developed. They have supply chain issues, workforce issues, right? There's a cost to all of that.”

CWLP didn’t participate in the recent MISO auction, although it could have. The utility shut down several coal-fired generators over the past five years but continues to operate one coal-fired power plant on the southeast side of Springfield. That plant will need to shut down permanently at some point in the next two decades under state law.

“In the future, all the costs are going to go up,” Sabin said. “We do expect that capacity auction prices will affect our customers.”

That echoes what some state officials expect as well. Sen. Bill Cunningham, D-Chicago, has worked on energy legislation for years and said that there is “nothing we can do” to reduce prices for this summer as capacity auctions have concluded, but he said lawmakers should do what they can to address the root causes of the spike.

“We think this is going to be the new normal,” Cunningham said.

Legislative moves

Negotiations over energy reforms in Springfield have included lawmakers, the governor’s office, and interest groups including environmentalists, organized labor and business associations. The process is sparking heated debate.

Over the past week, a draft of legislation began circulating among lawmakers and advocates, many of whom discussed portions of the bill with Capitol News Illinois.

“I don’t think, by any stretch, you’ll see a bill the size and scope that CEJA was, that we passed four years ago — certainly won’t see that,” Cunningham, who was involved in the negotiations, said.

Potential provisions deal with incentives for renewable power, energy efficiency regulations, nuclear power, data centers and more.

Environmental groups clashed with business and labor this week over a provision meant to lower the energy burden brought by data centers. That proposal would require large energy consumers to build their own energy generation through renewable sources like wind or solar power or pay the state to do so.

The pitch sparked fierce pushback from business and labor groups, which sent a collective letter to Pritzker, urging him to oppose the specific provision. The letter was co-signed by groups including the AFL-CIO, Climate Jobs Illinois, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association and Constellation Energy — the last of which operates all the state’s commercial nuclear power plants.

The proposal is being pushed by environmentalists, who say they want more accountability from data centers and other large consumers.

“We cannot allow these power-hungry facilities to drive up costs for consumers who are already struggling to pay their bills,” Gina Ramirez, director of Midwest environmental health at the National Resources Defense Council, said at a Wednesday rally.

Other issues are less controversial, largely because they’ve been negotiated for months.

Cunningham, a prominent player in the passage of CEJA, has his own proposal in the current draft: incentives for the energy storage industry. The current draft of that provision closely parallels recommendations made by the Illinois Commerce Commission. That agency was directed by a bill passed earlier this year to study how to handle energy storage projects.

While legislative Republicans have largely been shut out of negotiations over the bill, some of their ideas are being considered.

Sen. Sue Rezin, R-Morris, put out a pitch to ease the pressure on electric demand earlier this year by expanding nuclear energy. She was the architect of a bill two years ago that eased the state’s moratorium on new nuclear power plants, lifting it for next-generation, small generators.

This year, Rezin introduced a bill that would eliminate the remaining state restrictions on new nuclear power plants. Language similar to Rezin’s was included in draft legislation circulated this week.

Rezin, who leads several energy-related groups of lawmakers as part of her involvement at the National Conference of State Legislatures, said all states are facing similar issues around electricity.

“All energy buildout will take years because of the regulatory process,” Rezin said. “That's why it's important now. The state of Illinois needs to send positive messages to companies that are looking to invest in technology — whether it's nuclear or any other kind of energy producing plant — that we are open for business.”

The feds’ ‘big, beautiful bill’

Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday morning passed a bill containing many domestic policy priorities of President Donald Trump that many fear could upend state energy policy.

The bill contains provisions rolling back several clean energy tax incentives. Several key solar company stock prices fell sharply Thursday morning in response, including NextEra Energy, FirstSolar and Enphase Energy among others.

The solar industry has been a key part of Illinois’ renewable energy plans and efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Lesley McCain, the head of the Illinois Solar Energy & Storage Association, said that the bill could “cause solar energy companies of all sizes to cancel projects, and many will be forced to shut their doors.”

Environmentalists were quick to criticize the federal bill, which still requires negotiation and an eventual vote in the U.S. Senate before it can become law.

“It strips funding for climate programs, guts clean energy manufacturing, kills good union jobs, drives energy prices up, and abandons farmers and small business owners,” Walling said in a statement.

Illinois Republicans, meanwhile, expressed optimism that some of the bill’s provisions could help the fossil fuel sector in the state.

“If the federal government is going to help us to, you know, power up coal, power up gas — we want all energy,” Illinois House Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, said at a news conference. “We want solar, we want wind, we want nuke, we want coal. We want all of it.”

Rep. Ryan Spain, R-Peoria, noted that the federal bill should not “be used as an excuse to rush forward” on the energy legislation under consideration in Springfield.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)A man who died at the Milwaukee County Jail earlier this week has been identified as Gabriel Muniz-Jimenez, 33. Records from the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, obtained by Wisconsin Examiner, show that Muniz-Jimenez was pronounced dead Wednesday at 10:56 p.m. He is the second person to die in the jail so far this year. 
On Thursday, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) reported that an unidentified 33-year-old man had died after his cellmate reported to correctional officers that the man “appeared to be unconscious and in medical distress,” Urban Milwaukee reported.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
The sheriff’s office said that the deceased man had been booked into the jail in November on felony methamphetamine possession. Online court records show that Muniz-Jimenez was charged with methamphetamine possession in April 2024 and the court case was filed in July. 
Booking information online shows that Muniz-Jimenez was booked into the jail in late November on methamphetamine charges. Court records showed that Muniz-Jimenez required a Spanish interpreter in court. 
The sheriff’s office announcement this week said officers attempted lifesaving measures including the use of Narcan, which can reverse an opioid overdose. A demographic report from the Medical Examiner’s Office on Muniz-Jimenez labels the cause as undetermined. MCSO has not responded to a request for comment, and the Waukesha County Sheriffs Department, which is investigating the death, declined to identify who died in the jail. The MCSO is a member of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team (MAIT), which handles officer-involved deaths such as shootings and in-custody deaths. 
The Milwaukee County Jail has garnered controversy for deaths in recent years. The 2022 suicide of 21-year-old Brieon Green was the first of six in a 14-month period, and families of people who died have allied with activists to call attention to the deaths. In March, 48-year-old Joseph Boivin died at Froedtert Hospital after being found by a nurse in the middle of a health emergency at the jail. A jail audit detected numerous issues, including use of force and what the auditors called “dangerous suicide watch practices.”  
A recent review by the Texas-based auditor Creative Corrections found that the jail has come into full compliance with 71.2% of the proposed corrective actions, with another 28.8% being in partial compliance. The jail still needs to fund two new suicide watch cells. Jail officials are renovating housing areas and have said they are updating suicide watch policies.

May 22, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson on Thursday afternoon said she has complied in good faith with House Oversight Committee subpoenas that requested the state’s election training manuals, and that their vote on the House floor to hold her in contempt was a political stunt.
Benson, who is one of several candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2026, said in a news conference that if the move resulted in a lawsuit, then she would see the Republican House caucus in court.
“We have repeatedly asked the members of this committee to meet with us over the last several months, but they have refused,” Benson said. “Now my office has released documents to the House Oversight Committee five times. We have turned over more than 3,300 pages of election documents to this committee and to the public on our department’s website. So, if … House Republicans want to go to court over this, we will see them in court.”
Three key Michigan House Republicans, including Michigan House Oversight Committee Chair Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), on Thursday morning held a press conference saying they would request a resolution to hold Benson in contempt for bucking the subpoena request for unredacted election training manuals. DeBoyer claimed that Benson and the department were given an opportunity to meet and discuss why the materials needed to be redacted and some information shielded, but he said the department declined the offer.

In an early response to the threat of a contempt vote, the Department of State told Michigan Advance that it sent DeBoyer and others requesting the documents a letter that indicated they were more than willing to sit down and discuss the matter – but with an independent third-party mediator present. The department also questioned the scope and purpose of the inquiry.
Shortly after the Republican press conference, House session commenced, and one of the first orders of business was to approve House Resolution 117 holding Benson in contempt. The resolution was sponsored by DeBoyer and Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee. Bollin was also present at the Thursday morning press conference, along with House Election Integrity Committee Chair Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin).
Benson held her own news conference on Thursday afternoon, following the House session. 
She said has a sworn duty to protect sensitive election information from falling into the wrong hands, and that included DeBoyer, who was given authority by the House to disseminate the information provided.
The secretary of state said that could very well happen if all that information was handed over without redaction or review. Overall, Benson said that the Republican-led House’s tactics were “no way to govern a state.”
“Every day the House Republicans spend playing political games like this, while the people of Michigan are struggling to pay for housing, pay for child care and pay for their basic needs, is an affront to the people they are elected to serve,” Benson said. “This is government rooted in bullying and chaos, and I’m tired of it. It’s not only ineffective, but it is dangerous, because [Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall] is the same person who chaired a committee meeting with Rudy Giuliani in 2020 to spread lies about the 2020 election.”
Although she believes in oversight and transparency, Benson said truth rules the day and that also meant ensuring the safety and security of the state’s elections.
“You cannot bully me or abuse your authority to get access to information that, if it ends up in the wrong hands, could be used to interfere with the chain of custody of ballots, tamper with election equipment or impersonate a clerk on election day,” Benson said. “The caveat that we need to be clear and careful about is information that could end up in the wrong hands and essentially enable the tampering of election equipment, impersonation of a clerk or harm the chain of custody of ballots.”
Given DeBoyer’s broad authority, Benson said those concerns about security and confidentiality were real and justified.
Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel Jr. in a statement said Hall and his caucus were abusing their power and control of the House to attack their political enemies and push election conspiracy theories.
“Right now, we are seeing yet another gross overstep by MAGA Matt Hall’s House Republican caucus as they put their extremist agenda ahead of the well-being of Michiganders,” Hertel said. “At a moment when Republicans at the federal level are trying to gut Medicaid, it’s deeply concerning that Michigan Republicans are doing absolutely nothing to help Michiganders and are instead wasting time with political attacks.”
Hertel added that the move by DeBoyer and Michigan House Republicans was not about election security, but rather a push to legitimize debunked election theories.
“It’s an embarrassment, and Michiganders deserve better,” Hertel said.

“It looks like ChatGPT, basically, with some Vermont logos on it,” said Josiah Raiche, Vermont’s chief data and AI officer.

Photo by Peter D’Auria/VTDiggerThese days, everything seems to be powered, augmented or enhanced by artificial intelligence: phones, software, movies, etc.Now, add the state of Vermont to that list. For the past few months, all Vermont state employees have had access to a bespoke AI chatbot named — of course — ChatVT.“It doesn’t look that exciting,” Josiah Raiche, Vermont’s chief data and AI officer, said in an interview last month. “It looks like ChatGPT, basically, with some Vermont logos on it.”ChatVT has been available to all Vermont state employees since early 2025. Roughly 300 employees use it each week, Raiche said in April, for a variety of tasks: rewriting text on state websites to be more accessible to the public, coding state software, data processing, drafting and summarizing lengthy reports.In different areas of state government, the bot is trained with different documents: “Based on the teams that you’re in, the tool will have access to policies and background information that’s relevant,” Raiche said. State IT staffers built the bot with technology from OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, but with added privacy protections.“That all happens in a way that OpenAI doesn’t get access to our data,” Raiche said. “All of our data stays in our environment.” The tool costs the state roughly $300 a month in computing expenses.Last month, Raiche gave a reporter a demonstration of the chatbot: He copied and pasted language from a piece of legislation into a text field and told the AI that he runs a state technology division. “What areas of this bill should I focus on?” he asked. “What additional work might this make for my team?”ChatVT responded with a list of potential topics to look at, including “data security and privacy protocols” and “legal and compliance monitoring.”The response looked professionally done and comprehensive — something that Raiche said could be misleading. He gave another example in which he asked the bot to provide a recipe for eggs Benedict, in a bureaucratic style suitable for the Federal Register. It complied with a report of the “components, historical context, preparation methodology, variations, and nutritional data” of the dish.“Like, this looks like good content, but this is useless,” Raiche said. The bot is an example of why the Agency of Digital Services describes Vermont as a pioneer in the use of artificial intelligence in state government. According to Denise Reilly-Hughes, who leads the agency, Vermont was the first in the nation to have a state AI director, and the first to have a state AI council, both of which were created in 2022’s Act 132.Dozens of other states have since followed in Vermont’s footsteps, Reilly-Hughes said. “Vermont has been ahead of the curve,” she said.— Peter D’AuriaIn the knowThe Vermont Senate voted Thursday to scrap its version of this year’s landmark education bill, H.454, and replace it with the version of the legislation that the House passed last month. Following an afternoon of committee hearings on a proposed amendment to the bill, senators were planning to consider changes to it on the floor Thursday evening — though it wasn’t clear when they’d arrive at a final version.In effect, the decision backtracked on weeks of work by the chamber’s education and tax-writing committees. It came less than 48 hours after Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Baruth, D/P-Chittenden Central, conceded to his colleagues within the chamber’s Democratic majority that the Senate-crafted proposal had lost substantial support. “This idea that we will take the House legislation — and we will amend it, make it better — that will require a lot of work on the floor, a lot of work from our committees,” Baruth said on the floor Thursday morning before making the procedural moves that allowed the chamber to tee up the House’s proposed bill, rather than the Senate’s proposal. Even after all that work, Baruth then acknowledged, the legislation still “may not” get enough votes to pass.The Senate only took up H.454 briefly on Thursday morning. During an afternoon session of voting on other bills, Baruth said he hoped to dive into substantial debate on a potential amendment to the House language, offered by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison, on the Senate floor that evening.Read more about the proposed amendment here.— Shaun RobinsonOn the moveGov. Phil Scott signed lawmakers’ state budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year into law Wednesday. The plan lays out $9.01 billion in state spending for the yearlong period starting July 1 — and includes a handful of new measures designed to limit the impacts of potential cuts to the state’s federal funding. Scott, a Republican, was notably complimentary of the House and Senate’s budget bill in a letter to legislators that accompanied his signature. Democratic leadership in both chambers, knowing they almost certainly could not override a budget veto this year, trimmed tens of millions of dollars in proposed “base” spending — money expected to be appropriated year-over-year — from the legislation after Scott insisted on cuts. The governor had proposed an $8.99 billion state budget in January.“I appreciate that this budget makes important affordability investments,” Scott wrote, pointing to lawmakers’ use of about $75 million from the state’s general fund that’s expected to help reduce the property tax bills people pay to support education, among other measures.Read more about the 2026 budget here.— Shaun RobinsonScott also signed two Senate bills into law Wednesday that immigrant rights advocates have said would bolster protections for communities they serve as the Trump administration continues its crackdown of federal immigration laws in Vermont and across the country.The governor approved S.56, which sets up a committee to study whether the state should create a new office coordinating social and economic services for people who have recently arrived in the state from other countries. He also signed S.44, which further restricts how state and local law enforcement agencies can enter into policing agreements with federal immigration enforcement officials, short of getting the governor’s approval to do so.The latter drew fairly rare praise for Scott from the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont, with Falko Schilling, a lobbyist for the organization, calling it “another important step forward in building the state’s firewall against federal overreach” in a statement Wednesday.— Shaun RobinsonVisit our 2025 bill tracker for the latest updates on major legislation we are following. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Final Reading: Meet ChatVT, the state of Vermont’s homemade AI chatbot.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ChatVT-2-05212025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

Khalil […],"Demonstrators gathered across from the Central Louisiana ICE facility in Jena to protest Mahmoud Khalil's detention on Thursday, May 22, 2025. (John Gray/Verite News)JENA – A group of protesters headed Thursday from New Orleans to the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center in LaSalle Parish to demand the release of Mahmoud Khalil. The former Columbia University student and pro-Palestine activist was arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in March and has since been held in detention.
Khalil was in immigration court Thursday for a hearing on a motion from his attorneys to terminate his deportation proceedings and release him. The hearing, which began in the morning, was still ongoing by mid-afternoon.
By early afternoon, hundreds of protesters had gathered in the grass across from the detention facility, chanting, flying Palestinian flags and playing drums. Some members of the group kneeled and prayed on the street.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident who was born in Syria, faces deportation for his involvement with pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia last year. He is one of a number of people the Trump administration has detained over their political activities in the last several months, drawing alarm from free speech activists.
Kristi Dayemo, 29, arrived at First Grace Methodist Church on Canal Street for a bus ride to the ICE facility in Jena, along with other New Orleans residents.
Dayemo said she comes from a service-oriented family and that she has a spirit to help people. Her parents raised her to have a duty to make the world a better place.
“If we allow him to be arrested without a warrant and deported from this country it calls into question all students that aren’t from here, whether or not they’re allowed to have their First Amendment rights,” Dayemo said.

On the way to the facility from New Orleans Thursday morning, organizers handed out snacks and prepared the riders for their day of action. Sabrine Mohamad, a human rights lawyer traveling with the group, spoke to riders on the bus ahead of the arrival to Jena.
“Today is so much bigger than Mahmoud, it’s so much bigger than all of the students that have been kidnapped by ICE. This is really a vital moment in the history of the United States democracy and Palestine,” Mohamad said.
On the way to the facility, organizers handed out snacks and prepared the riders for their day of action. Protesters discussed current events, while removing biometric authentication from their phones and writing loved ones’ phone numbers on their arms in preparation for potential arrests.

  Noor Abdalla, Mahmoud Khalil’s wife, speaks with an organizer Thursday, May 22, 2025. Abdalla and her son were able to meet with Khalil before his hearing.
Once arriving in Jena, the New Orleans protesters joined with another group that had come in from Texas. Organizers disembarked from their buses, prepared their drums and signs and began marching towards the ICE detention center. The group was greeted by facility guards who kept them from setting foot on the property.
Noor Abdalla, Khalid’s wife, came out to the crowd to thank them for their demonstrations, saying that they are keeping Khalil going as he faces deportation. Abdalla had visited with Khalil on Thursday with their newborn son, Deen. It was his first meeting with the boy, who was born while Khalil was in detention.

Both chambers of the Legislature, and the administration, have broadly agreed the state should transition to a new education funding formula and move toward consolidating school districts. But disagreement has developed over the details and the timeline. The Senate changes being considered Thursday in committee hearings — included in an amendment offered by Sen. Ruth Hardy, D-Addison — would stick with the House’s longer four-year timeframe for the transition. The new funding scheme, a foundation formula, would not go into effect until July 1, 2029, and would be contingent on new districts being formed. A foundation formula is the most common type of education funding system across the country. The approach provides districts money based on the number of students in each district and how expensive those students are to teach. Hardy’s amendment would also require a comprehensive study on how those students — such as English learners, special education students and those pursuing career and technical education — should be factored to the funding formula before it could go into effect.Meanwhile, a committee to develop new school district boundary options for consideration by the Legislature next year would largely mirror the group of public education representatives and experts assembled in the House version, though both the House and Senate would also be able to appoint two people, not just one.While the original Senate version contained no class size minimums, the amendment maintains the minimums proposed in the House version, though it adjusts them downward. Calculation of the average class sizes would be based on student populations over three years rather than two, and the state secretary of education would have discretion about whether there would be certain mandates for schools that do not meet those minimums. The House version would have required the department to take those actions.The proposed changes to the House version would increase the number of currently operating independent schools in Vermont that would remain eligible to receive public tuition once new districts are operating. The Hardy amendment would limit eligibility to schools where tuitioned public students made up 40% of the student body during the 2024-25 school year. The House version uses a 51% threshold and a different comparison year, while the earlier Senate version set the boundary at 25%.Hardy presented her amendment to the Senate’s education and finance committees simultaneously Thursday afternoon.“We’re back to starting with the House version of the bill, so it’s deja vu all over again,” she told her colleagues.Kristen Fountain contributed reporting.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Senate looks to House language, rather than its own, on education reform package.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hardy-clarkson-1-20250516-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The U.S. House of Representatives passed their “Big Beautiful Bill” by a vote of 215-214. Every member of the Tennessee Congressional delegation voted yes, with the exception of 9th District U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat. And with that vote, they put thousands of Tennesseans at risk of losing their healthcare and their food benefits.
Cuts to TennCare, our state’s Medicaid program, will hurt vulnerable Tennesseans — people with disabilities, low income pregnant women, the elderly and children — who depend on this program for access to primary care, preventative care, prenatal and postpartum care and skilled nursing care. 
We also face historic cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) program, right as school lets out for the summer — a time when many kids go hungry. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, 57,000 Tennesseans with children stand to lose their SNAP benefits. This means children will get up and go to bed hungry all over our state.
Healthcare workers in Tennessee have been sounding the alarm bells on a number of issues for years now: COVID public health measures and vaccine outreach, threats to reproductive healthcare, and, more recently, the NIH funding cuts and the resulting loss of grant money for medical research. 
Here in Middle Tennessee, one of our biggest employers, Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), has announced $250 million in federal budget cuts and has already begun layoffs as a result of the funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). VUMC received $468 million in 2024 for medical research, the second most in the country according to Axios. Overall, Tennessee universities received $770 million in funding for research from the NIH last year alone.
250k Tennesseans could lose TennCare, private insurance under Congressional spending bill

Statewide, the cuts have also affected the University of Tennessee Health System, Meharry Medical College and St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. 
Meharry Medical College is an historically Black college (HBCU) in Nashville and it helps to fill the gap of underrepresented minorities in the healthcare workforce. In Memphis, St. Jude’s is the hospital where parents can get treatment for their children with cancer and other diseases without fear of medically bankrupting their families. We have only just begun to feel the pain from the loss of the critical NIH funding source for these essential organizations. Eventually, medical research will slow, and breakthrough science, like the work that was done at Vanderbilt to develop the COVID vaccine, will be threatened. 
Now, it’s time for health care workers and advocates to answer the call for healthcare again. We need to press that Code Blue button in Tennessee, gathering our colleagues together to fight the impending federal budget cuts that threaten Medicaid and SNAP. 
Inside the hospital, activating a Code Blue means there is a medical emergency and a patient in need of resuscitation. Here in Tennessee, our healthcare system is in dire straits.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 250,000 Tennesseans will lose their healthcare coverage as a result of Medicaid cuts and other changes to the Affordable Care Act insurance marketplace. This is on top of the already over 635,000 Tennesseans lacking any healthcare coverage in 2023, about 11% of the population in our state. Because of our high uninsured rate, Tennessee has had more rural hospital closures per capita than anywhere else in the country, which has led to maternity care deserts and factors into our dismal maternal mortality rates.
This “Big Beautiful Bill” will have far-reaching consequences for all Tennesseans, not just those who rely on TennCare and SNAP. Hospitals, especially rural ones, run on slim margins and will be at increased risk of closure due to the Medicaid cuts. 
According to Becker’s Hospital review, over 41% of rural hospitals in Tennessee are vulnerable. Rural hospitals in our state closing will inevitably lead to further crowding in the tertiary care hospitals in our big cities. Wait times in emergency departments will go up for everyone. Appointments to see primary care and specialists will be harder to get. 
It couldn’t be any clearer: when one person is denied healthcare access, it affects us all. 
There is a Code Blue in Tennessee. Our patients, neighbors, hospitals and communities need our help. We cannot let heartless politicians pull the plug and flatline our safety net just to give tax cuts to billionaires.  It’s time to gather all hands on deck to save our healthcare system that is teetering on the brink before it’s too far gone to resuscitate.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Republicans are moving forward with legislation to restructure a voter-approved state board that oversees a multi-billion dollar trust after it didn’t immediately allocate $50 million to pay for a new University of Oklahoma hospital, Democrat lawmakers said. 
Democrats said efforts to strip the Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust of its independence follow a dustup between the agency, which oversees a $2 billion public trust, and Republican legislative leaders who became frustrated after the board did not promptly hand over funding to pay for OU’s new pediatric heart hospital. 
House Bill 2783, which heads to Gov. Kevin Stitt’s desk, would allow the TSET board of directors to be removed “at the pleasure” of their appointing authority and would limit them to no more than a seven year term. Currently the seven board members, who decide how to spend the proceeds of Oklahoma’s settlement with the tobacco industry, are appointed to a blanket, staggered seven year term.

While debating the bill in the House on Tuesday, Rep. Meloyde Blancett, D-Tulsa, said the legislation was filed because Republican leadership wasn’t happy that TSET hadn’t funded the heart hospital. 
“What we are doing here is we are using legislative power to extract retaliation,” she said. 
Blancett said the legislation places “undue pressure” on the board and is “antithetical” to how the TSET board was set up when voters added it to the state constitution. 
The seven board members are appointed by the governor, treasurer, state superintendent, attorney general, state auditor and the leaders of the House and Senate. Appointees are required to have experience in health care or programs benefitting children or seniors. No more than four appointees may come from one political party and at least one appointee must come from each congressional district, with no more than two from the same district. 
The bill would not alter who has appointing authority or the other qualification requirements.
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, who voted for the measure, said Thursday TSET is in the process of awarding $150 million in grants, and lawmakers requested a third of that be awarded to help pay for OU’s hospital.
He said there’s been “some frustration” with how the TSET board responded to the request. While he said he’s satisfied with the current condition of TSET, Paxton said sometimes they need to listen to legislative funding needs. 
“One of the things I get concerned about with some of these agencies is that when you separate them too far from the legislative branch, that sometimes they kind of become their own kingdom where they don’t listen to the elected people,” he said.
The Legislature is moving forward with funding $200 million without the grant. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
TSET, established by voters in 2000, oversees the proceeds from Oklahoma’s portion of a multi-state settlement with the tobacco industry. The funds are used to invest in better health outcomes for Oklahomans. 
Thomas Larson, a spokesperson for TSET, said legislators asked the trust to consider funding for the heart center at OU Health. 
“We have a process and will be evaluating all proposals,” he said in an email. “We’ve had wide interest in this grant opportunity, with nearly 300 people attending a webinar about the grant. We will be considering this with all other requests.”
In a second statement, Larson said the application from OU Health for the heart hospital is still pending. He said the grant application period closes June 16 and the funding won’t be awarded until November, so no proposals have been awarded or denied. 
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, said these changes to the TSET board would prevent it from being free of “political manipulation.” 
She said she’s concerned that the TSET board is being rearranged because somebody in political power didn’t like their denial of a grant request. 
Rep. Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, the House budget chair, denied that the bill was being run in retaliation for the OU heart hospital funding and said conversations on making changes to the TSET board have been happening for a “long time.”

“I think the main reason is we just want them to be more accountable to the electorate, the people,” he said. “And we’re trying to make sure they’re held accountable to the voters and the state of Oklahoma. We’re not changing the makeup of the board.” 
Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, said voters in 2020 made it clear they don’t want lawmakers to have greater access to TSET funds when nearly 59% voted against using the trust to pay for Medicaid expansion. 
“They understand that TSET is an asset they don’t want us making rash decisions about,” she said. “This bill, I don’t want it to come across as a simple change, because it will drastically change the independence of this board. … You could have special projects from any of those appointing authorities come forward, and they could get strong armed into making things happen. I’m deeply concerned about what this is going to do.”
But Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, said while TSET is a great program in Oklahoma, sometimes good things need to be “tweaked.”
“There’s always a need to go in and make changes and tweaks here and there, and accountability in government is never a bad thing,” he said. 
The bill passed the House 60-30 and the Senate 36-8.

Standard measles vaccination recommendations include first shots for children at 12 or 15 months and second doses between 4 to 6 years old. Now, children in Lea, Sandoval, Doña Ana and Curry counties can receive a first dose at 6 to 12 months and ultimately receive three doses of the vaccine, NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said during a news conference in Albuquerque.
The reason for the change, she said, is “children under one are most severely affected by measles.”
Three doses is not a universal recommendation, she noted: “but if you’re living in a place with high risk for measles, it’s worth getting.”




Measles is a highly contagious respiratory virus — more so than COVID-19 or influenza — and is spread by contact with an infected person’s coughs or sneezes. Symptoms can take several weeks to develop, and include a fever, headache, cough, red eyes and a spotty red rash that develops on the head and spreads across the body.
People are contagious several days before symptoms appear. Severe complications appear in about one in five cases and can include brain swelling, pneumonia and even death.




The new vaccine recommendation comes as the state reports two additional measles cases in Sandoval County, bringing the total there to four cases. Until recently, cases mostly remained limited to the southern portion of the state, spilling over from the initial outbreak in Gaines County, Texas.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recorded just over 1,000 cases of measles nationwide in the current outbreak. The statewide total of 76 cases marks the largest outbreak of measles in New Mexico in the past four decades, Durham said.
Durham said the department is watching closely for spread from Sandoval into Bernalillo or Santa Fe counties.
“Wherever it is in the state we’re concerned about spread because it is such an infectious virus,” Durham said. “We may look at it county by county, but that isn’t how the disease works.”
Officials had no additional information about the two new Sandoval County cases, and said additional  information will be released Friday.
NMDOH Secretary Gina DeBlassie said in addition to outreach and vaccination measures, the state is also testing for measles in city wastewater, which can help identify spread. Those cities include: Roswell, Santa Fe, Albuquerque Las Cruces, Deming, Rincon and south-central Carlsbad; the recent results are mostly negative, DeBlassie said.
Health care officials emphasized the best protection from measles is vaccination, which is safe and highly effective in curbing spread. Durham said 29,207 vaccines have been issued since Feb. 1, nearly double the vaccination rate over the same time last year.
Increased travel during summer vacation could risk further spread.
“If you are vaccinated and up to date on vaccines, you really are very well-protected,” Durham said. “You don’t need to be scared, you can go travel — but the message is to get vaccinated before you do that.”
More vaccination information
Health officials recommend a 95% vaccination rate to reach herd immunity to prevent further measles spread. Durham said that vaccines given in childhood offer a lifetime of protection.
Officials recommend two doses of the measles vaccine for everyone, except for people who cannot receive the vaccine, such as children who are younger than six months and people who are immunocompromised or pregnant.
For questions regarding the vaccine or potential exposures, Durham urged people to call the NMDOH hotline at 1-833-796-8773. The hotline is staffed by nurses, who can offer information in English and Spanish.
NMDOH opened clinics offering measles vaccinations at no cost, and with no appointment necessary posted on their website.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)All ten Pennsylvania Republicans voted in support of the massive tax and spending bill that passed the U.S. House early Thursday morning, touting the tax relief, border security and support for working families they said it would provide.
Democrats, including seven in the state’s delegation, unanimously opposed it. They decried the budget’s cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, deficit spending and tax cuts for the ultra wealthy, which Rep. Summer Lee (D-12th District) described as dangerous, “undemocratic and unjust.” 
“I voted no. There’s nothing beautiful about a bill that forces families to choose between taking their kids to the doctor or feeding them,” Lee said. “We will continue organizing, pushing, and holding every policymaker accountable until the needs of working people are prioritized over profits.” 
But one moderate Pennsylvania Republican said he would keep working to improve the bill.
“As this process proceeds, I will be working closely with the Senate to make constructive changes to this bill, specifically in the energy, workforce, and health portions of the bill so we can strengthen SNAP and Medicaid solvency for the long-term and ensure access for the most vulnerable that truly need assistance,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) said. “This will be a red-line for me before supporting final passage.”
His office did not respond to the Capital-Star’s request for additional details.
The budget reconciliation, dubbed the “Big, Beautiful Bill” by Republican leaders, passed by a vote of 215-214, with two Republicans, Ohio’s Warren Davidson and Kentucky’s Thomas Massie, opposed. It will now go to the Senate, where Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said House Republicans will work with their Senate counterparts toward a goal of winning approval in the upper chamber and getting the bill to President Donald Trump’s desk by July 4.

Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro said the budget, as it stands, would have a “very real impact” on Pennsylvanians.
“This morning, every single Republican member of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation voted to cut healthcare and food assistance from hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvanians and speed up the closure of dozens of rural hospitals across our Commonwealth – all while increasing our national deficit by $2.3 trillion,” Shapiro said in a statement.
Other Democrats, including Rep. Madeleine Dean (D-4th District), said the deficit would balloon even higher. “Today, House Republicans passed a bill that sacrifices critical programs for millions of everyday Americans to pay for another tax cut for the rich — blowing up the deficit by an estimated $5 trillion in service of the President’s cruel, corrupt purposes,” Dean said in a statement.
Cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would shift $1 billion in food assistance costs to the state, putting benefits for 140,000 people in question. More than 300,000 Pennsylvanians could lose Medicaid benefits, rolling back efforts to reduce the number of uninsured people and increasing the cost of health care for everyone, Shapiro’s statement said. 
And the cuts to Medicaid could hurt 25 rural hospitals across the state that are already financially struggling and rely on the medical assistance program, increasing the likelihood they could close. 
“Any lawmaker in D.C. who thinks the commonwealth can backfill this massive hole they’ve created is wrong – and these cuts will have real life consequences for Pennsylvanians. As this heads to the Senate for a vote, I hope common sense and a concern for the people of Pennsylvania will prevail,” Shapiro said.
Republican members of Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation highlighted the bill’s provisions to advance the Trump administration’s priorities.
“After years of wide-open borders, uncontrolled inflation, and government spending run amok, this budget finally addresses the needs of our community and our country,” Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District) said. 
H.R. 1 would provide $69 billion to complete border barriers, hire more Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, expand deportation capacity and stop drug and human trafficking at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Although it includes deep cuts to Medicaid spending, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office, Republicans including Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District) said the bill would protect the program and ensure tax dollars are used prudently.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“During this process, I fought to protect social safety net programs from the waste, fraud, and abuse that have threatened their long-term solvency. By ensuring states are not using Medicaid dollars on illegal aliens, conducting more frequent eligibility checks, and requiring work for able-bodied recipients … we are securing Medicaid for those who truly need it,” Bresnahan said in a statement.
He noted the Medicaid work requirements exempt children and seniors, pregnant women, students, disabled veterans and those with medical conditions including mental health and substance use disorders.
Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) touted the bill’s benefits for businesses and working families that would help improve the nation’s economy.
“Passing this bill will increase production so supply better meets demand, thereby reducing inflation. And with lower inflation comes lower interest rates, which leads to greater investment and more American production,” he said in a statement.
The legislation would eliminate tax on tips and overtime – among Trump’s populist campaign promises – expand the child tax credit from $2,000, and establish savings accounts for newborns.
It would also extend provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to benefit manufacturers and small businesses by allowing them to write off research and development costs and bonuses and expanding the small business deduction to 23%, Meuser’s office said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/capitolnight2025_0.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

(Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Following the U.S. House of Representatives’ 215-214 vote to approve Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill,” elected officials in Colorado had mixed reactions to the measure and how it will affect the state. 
The 1,116-page tax and spending bill extends President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts for businesses and individuals; reduces funding for Medicaid by $625 billion over 10 years; shifts the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program food aid program to state governments; drastically bolsters border security and defense spending; reworks energy permitting; and restructures federal aid for higher education, among many other provisions. 
A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released late Tuesday showed the package favors the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.
The measure now heads to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

Colorado’s members of the House voted along party lines, with Republicans in support of the bill and Democrats opposed. Republicans have celebrated the measure and said it will save working-class people money, while Democrats denounced it for cutting taxes for the wealthy and stripping Medicaid benefits. 
“This bill will deliver for the American people by securing our borders, extending tax cuts, unleashing American energy, and making our nation stronger than ever before,” U.S. Rep. Jeff Crank, a Colorado Springs Republican, said in a statement. 
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, a Democrat, said the bill is “bad for Colorado, Americans, and the country’s economy.” Before he was elected governor, Polis represented Colorado’s 2nd Congressional District in Congress.
“I’m disappointed to see Republican members of Colorado’s delegation vote to take health care away from Colorado kids, families, and vulnerable people, increasing health care costs on everyone,” Polis said in a statement. “If this bill is so ‘big and beautiful,’ as Republicans boast, then Americans should be asking why it wasn’t voted on in the light of day? The reality is, Americans are being left behind and left in the dark by Republicans in Washington.”
The House vote on the measure came early Thursday after an all-night session.
U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, applauded the bill’s support for additional immigration enforcement resources and said it preserves the long-term viability of Medicaid for those who need it most. 
“This pro-family, pro-America bill isn’t just good policy, it follows through on promises made to working families,” Evans said in a statement. “As a father, Army combat veteran, and former cop, I fight every day to make Colorado a better place to live, work, and raise a family, and that’s exactly what this legislation does.” 










This monstrosity of a bill is so skewed towards the wealthiest Americans that more than 66% of the benefits would go to the top 20 percent of households by income.


– U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette of Denver


U.S. Rep. Brittany Pettersen, a Lakewood Democrat, said families in Colorado have shared their fears with her that the measure will affect their ability to afford health care.
“This bill means kids will go hungry, thousands of people will die without access to health care, and the progress we’ve made in fighting the opioid crisis will be erased,” Pettersen said in a statement. “Hospitals and nursing homes will shutter, and the health care costs for all of us will skyrocket. All to give the wealthiest people in the history of the world more tax giveaways on the backs of the rest of us.”
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Windsor Republican, said the bill is a step toward “implementing the America First mandate voters delivered” in November. A news release from her office celebrating the bill said she fought specifically to implement work requirements for Medicaid and to ensure Medicaid does not cover “transgender surgeries” or abortion care.  
“This critical legislation makes the Trump tax cuts permanent, unleashes American energy production, invests billions in support of our farmers and ranchers by responsibly reforming SNAP benefits, strengthens Medicaid to focus on American citizens who truly need help, and delivers a final net deficit reduction of $1.5 trillion,” Boebert said in a statement.
While Republicans have touted Medicaid work requirements as a tool to ensure the program helps those who need it most, a KFF analysis has found that work requirements “would not have any meaningful impact” on how many recipients are working, and that 92% of adults on Medicaid are either working or would qualify for an exemption. 
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, said the “One Big, Bogus Bill” will lead to millions of people losing access to health care, including 26,760 Denver residents. She said the bill was put together “following hidden negotiations, overnight markups, and the last-minute release of bill text” to keep Americans from learning the contents of the bill. 
“This monstrosity of a bill is so skewed towards the wealthiest Americans that more than 66% of the benefits would go to the top 20 percent of households by income, and people making less than $51,000 a year will actually see their taxes go up,” DeGette said in a statement. “This bill makes life harder for the American people while enriching the top earners in our country.”

(Submitted)TOPEKA — State officials have denied a federal request to disclose personal information of Kansans using the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
On May 6, the Kansas Department for Children and Families received a letter from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that demanded “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all State programs that receive federal funding.” DCF spokeswoman Erin LaRow shared a copy of that letter and other communications in response to an inquiry from Kansas Reflector.
The USDA letter specified that information to be collected for each SNAP applicant or recipient included name, Social Security number, date of birth, personal address and records to calculate the amount of SNAP benefits participants received over time. It was signed by Gina Brand, senior policy advisor for integrity at USDA’s Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services division.
The requested data would cover the time period from Jan. 1, 2020, to the present, the letter said.
DCF’s SNAP data is held by a third-party database administrator, Fidelity Information Services LLC. That company notified DCF on May 9 that a formal request for Kansas SNAP records had been made from USDA and that because of federal guidance, they were required to disclose that information.
“As such, FIS intends to fully cooperate with the USDA in facilitating its request for information, as required by applicable law and the guidance,” wrote Prashant Gupta, FIS senior vice president. He then asked for DCF’s written consent.
DCF stopped the process in a letter dated May 14, sent by Carla Whiteside Hicks, the DCF director of economic and employment services.
“Please be advised that we do not consent to your providing the USDA the requested information at this time,” Whiteside Hicks told FIS. “As you know, our obligation to maintain these records in confidence is paramount and may only be disclosed to the USDA for specific program-related reasons. At this time, we are unsure as to the reason for the USDA’s request. As such, we are unable to consent to your turning the information over.”
Whiteside Hicks also said DCF will be asking the USDA to contact DCF directly in the future. She asked FIS to turn over any information that they may have already provided to the USDA and to also provide DCF with any written communications the company has received from USDA.
LaRow said DCF is reviewing the request from USDA related to the personally identifiable data of Kansans.
“Security of Kansans’ personal information is paramount to the agency, and we are committed to maintaining confidentiality consistent with state and federal law,” she said.

(SDOT photo)Motorized scooters, popularized in culture by companies like Lime, are now a specifically regulated mode of transportation in the state.
Signed into law last week, House Bill 588, brought by Rep. Neil Duram, R-Eureka, defines motor scooters and adds safety regulations for users. Motorized scooters now have the same rights on the roadway as a cyclist or someone riding a moped. The law also includes single-wheels, which essentially are motorized skateboards.
During the bill’s hearing in the House Transportation Committee, Duram, a former member of the Montana Highway Patrol, relayed a story about a kid in his community riding a single wheel on the roadway. To his credit, Duram said, the kid is safe while he rides — but being on the roadway was technically illegal.
“I suspect your community has a kid just about like him,” Duram said. “This really is his transportation.”
Duram said that trying to solve the problem of the single wheels led him to consider motorized scooters, too. The issue was seats — if something didn’t have a seat, it could not be on the road.
The bill solved the legal issue. It also stipulates motorized scooters can’t go faster than 30 mph. Importantly, motorized scooters are distinguished from motorized vehicles — an important difference because it means someone cannot be charged with driving under the influence while operating a scooter.
That does not, however, mean they could not be charged with other offenses. Duram said on the House floor on April 16 in that situation the person could be given a public intoxication charge.
The new law provides another avenue of transportation for those who lose their license.   
“My intention was that they’d be traveling at relatively slow speeds to transport the operator to and from his destination and location without the necessity of him having a driver’s license,” Duram said in the hearing. “This becomes, without a driver’s license, one of your standard forms of transportation.”
Motorized scooters are required to have white headlights, and red lights or reflectors facing behind There’s also stipulations on brakes, requiring a motorized scooter be able to stop from 10 mph within 25 feet.
Scooters are not allowed to be operated by motor on sidewalks or bike paths. Riders must yield to pedestrians when operating the vehicle.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/51615041503_19ef617fd6_k-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 19:08:21.906896

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)Preliminary findings by the Rhode Island Office of the State Fire Marshal suggest the early Tuesday morning fire that seriously damaged the Matunuck Oyster Bar and displaced its 300 workers was accidental.
The investigation into the cause of the blaze continues, but several possible causes have been ruled out, according to a release from the state fire marshal. Commercial cooking equipment was not the direct cause of the fire.
Owner Perry Raso has vowed to rebuild the popular pond-to table seafood restaurant he opened in 2009 on Succotash Road in South Kingstown. Matunuck Oyster Bar employed about 300 workers.
As fire investigation continues, DLT expedites outreach for Matunuck Oyster Bar employees

“I want to focus on getting that building repaired so we can open our doors again,” Raso said in an interview Thursday afternoon. “I haven’t wrapped my head around everything that’s happened. I just know what the goals are, and I’m just trying to take one step at a time.”
Raso lives down the road from the restaurant and received a call around 3:45 a.m. about the fire from a truck driver who was sleeping in his truck in the parking lot. The driver had hauled a delivery of chairs to be received when the restaurant’s workers started arriving by 6 or 7 a.m.
Raso expressed his gratitude for the outpouring of community support since the fire. Restaurants across the state have reached out to connect with staff who are looking for work, he said.  
“Why not? We’ve got the hardest workers in the world,” he said. “I just hope that when we open our doors again we can get a lot of these people back.”
The Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (DLT) “has made themselves so available to us and have really given us so much time and been so responsive,” Raso added.
DLT officials set up at the South Kingstown Recreation Center Thursday morning to assist the restaurant’s staff with unemployment and connecting to job coaches, Raso said.
“They asked for a show of hands this morning who were already signed up and it looked like a good number of them had,” Raso said.
The fire marshal’s office said steps have been taken to “preserve the security and integrity of the fire scene” so that the investigation can continue. Mitigation measures to prevent any contamination to nearby inland waterways have also been taken.

(Courtesy of WDTC)The vast majority of South Dakota’s technical college graduates from the 2023-24 school year secured jobs within six months of graduation, according to the latest state Board of Technical Education report.
Jenna Reis, policy and data analyst with the board, shared the report Thursday during a meeting at Lake Area Technical College in Watertown. She said that among graduates who are employable — not continuing with further education or joining the military — the data show 99% are employed, with 93% employed in a job related to their degree.
“These are strong numbers,” she said. “In fact, you may notice in the chart that we have very few graduates that are either not in the labor market or who are still seeking employment.”
The report evaluates the post-graduation outcomes of students from the state’s four technical colleges who responded to requests for information:

Lake Area Technical College (Watertown): Out of 781 graduates, 768 responded, with 150 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 562 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $27.23.
Mitchell Technical College: Out of 488 graduates, 480 responded, with 52 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 397 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $24.36.
Southeast Technical College (Sioux Falls): Out of 900 graduates, 778 responded, with 84 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 632 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $24.68.
Western Dakota Technical College (Rapid City): Out of 286 graduates, 249 responded, with 39 continuing their education or enlisting in the military, and 200 employed in their field of study with an average hourly pay of $27.48.

Of the 2,275 graduates who responded, 1,961 — 86% — reported living in South Dakota. The average salary of all graduates working in their field of study was about $53,000 per year, according to Reis.
“I think these results show that our graduates are not only finding work and are staying in South Dakota, but they’re contributing to the workforce in their program areas, which is important,” she said.
The report drew data from graduate surveys, faculty outreach and phone surveys conducted six months post-graduation.

Slotkin campaigned on a promise not to allow an electric vehicle mandate.“Today, I voted to prevent California and the states that follow its standard from effectively banning gas-powered cars by 2035,” she wrote in a statement. “I have a special responsibility to stand up for the more than one million Michiganders whose livelihoods depend on the U.S. auto industry.”Debate over choiceCritics said the state regulation was effectively an electric vehicle mandate that robbed consumers of the option to purchase the vehicle of their choice.Because of California’s market share — the state accounts for 11% of cars and trucks sold in the country, according to the California Air Resources Board — and adoption by other states, the Golden State standard had a virtually nationwide effect, they argued.Republicans in the Senate focused on the 2035 deadline to end sales of new gas-powered vehicles, describing it as an electric vehicle mandate.In a video posted to social media, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Barrasso of Wyoming, stood next to Shelley Moore Capito, the West Virginia Republican chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, and touted the vote as a victory for consumer choice.“Republicans have defeated Democrats’ delusional dream of forcing every American to drive an electric vehicle,” Barrasso said. “They wanted to force-feed the entire country things that don’t necessarily work, not practical.”But proponents of the California standards said the Senate was removing choice from state policymakers, despite Republicans’ longtime advocacy for state and local control.Manish Bapna, the president of the advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, blasted the move in a statement that said senators undermined state power.“This vote is an unprecedented and reckless attack on states’ legal authority to address the pollution causing asthma, lung disease and heart conditions,” Bapna said. “After a multi-million dollar lobbying campaign from Big Oil, Republicans readily jettisoned their long-held view that states can best enact measures that reflect the values and interests of their residents.“If other states don’t like California’s approach, they don’t need to follow it,” the statement continued. “But federal lawmakers shouldn’t be intervening to block states from providing cleaner air and a healthier environment.”Procedural fightRepublicans’ use of the Congressional Review Act provoked a backlash from Democrats and environmental allies, who described it as “going nuclear” to tank the chamber’s filibuster rule.The Senate parliamentarian and the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office said the waiver could not be repealed with a CRA resolution, but Senate Republicans opted to use the procedure anyway.“Senate Republicans exposed themselves as fair weather institutionalists. By overriding the parliamentarian — which the chair explicitly noted that the parliamentarian has been overridden — and in order to do the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, Republicans have eroded away at the Senate foundation and undermined this institution they claim to care about,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said after a procedural vote late Wednesday.Republicans defended the move, saying they were responding to an unprecedented case in the chamber. The question of how Senate rules applied to the waiver should be decided by senators themselves, Majority Leader John Thune said.“I believe that when the Senate is facing a novel situation like this one, with disagreement among its members, it is appropriate for the Senate to speak as a body to the question – something the Senate does when questions over application of the rules arise,” he said in a floor speech.Thune, of South Dakota, noted that the Senate resolved a rules question with a floor vote just last year after a Democrat raised a point of order against a Republican’s attempt to fast-track a measure.“Nobody at the time cried nuclear, nobody said the Democrat member was blowing up the Senate – in fact, most members probably don’t even remember the situation, because it was just the Senate doing what the Senate is supposed to do, and that’s voting on how to apply the rules when faced with a new situation.”Uncertainty aboundsCritics of the move attacked the process, the policy and the precedent, saying the Senate undid a half-century of a California-federal government relationship regarding the Clean Air Act that had served all parties well.John Boesel, the president and CEO of clean transportation industry group CALSTART, called the Senate action radical.“This vote upends decades of policy that has successfully resulted in cleaner air and the growth of a robust clean transportation industry,” he said in a statement. “It is a brazen, yet futile, attempt to bring the clean transportation industry to a sudden halt. CALSTART will continue to partner with the states working to fill this gaping void left by today's federal action.”And the unusual use of the Congressional Review Act will likely lead to lawsuits from California and at least some of the states that follow it to “protect their authority,” Balik, of Evergreen Action, said.“But that's going to take some time to play out,” he said. “In the meantime, the whole marketplace has been plunged into unnecessary chaos.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Lawmakers advanced a bill Thursday that would codify a test used by judges to determine whether a disputed rent increase is “unconscionable.”
Supporters of the bill say it is part of the Legislature’s push to make New Jersey more affordable.
“Every New Jersey resident deserves a place to call their own — whether that’s buying a home or renting an apartment — at a price they can afford,” bill sponsor Assemblywoman Yvonne Lopez said in a statement. “Housing policy isn’t just about buildings — it’s about dignity, access, and stability. That’s why we took steps today to improve how we develop, regulate, and expand housing across the state.”
The bill passed in the Assembly 50-26 with four abstentions. A companion bill in the state Senate introduced in March has not yet been scheduled for a hearing in the chamber’s community and urban affairs committee. 
Under the measure, a judge would consider several factors to determine whether a rent increase is too high, including: the amount of the hike; the landlord’s expenses and profitability; other area rents; the length of time since the last increase; the length of tenancy; and the condition of the property. 
The bill says no one factor would deem whether a rent increase is too high, would allow a judge to consider other factors not identified in the measure, and says the judge could weigh “whether the rent increase would shock the conscience of a reasonable person.”
New Jersey has no statewide rent control law but allows local governments to do so.
Assemblyman Brian Bergen (R-Morris) slammed the bill for its “very subjective language” that doesn’t clearly define how much rent increases can be. 
“It puts all the onus on these property owners, and eventually, it’s going to end up in a tremendous amount of litigation,” said Bergen. “Yet another example of you killing business.” 
The bill would require a judge to consider not only other properties’ rents but also federal fair market rent estimates from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which say a one-bedroom apartment in the Hudson County area costs $2,029 per month and a three-bedroom costs $3,218. Around Camden County, they cost $1,512 and $2,468, respectively. According to Apartments.com, the average one-bedroom monthly rent in the state is $2,051 and for a three-bedroom, $3,521.
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Service’s consumer price index reported in April the cost of housing was up in New Jersey nearly 6% over one year.
Most of the bill would go into effect immediately. The bill’s provisions that establish the confidentiality of certain eviction records would take effect six months later.

Leticia Russi-Shareno had earlier pleaded guilty to a wire fraud charge stemming from her theft that led to a $36,000 “out-of-pocket” loss to the union, according to court filings. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ex-union president for Homeland Security workers in Vermont avoids prison in embezzling case .","The Department of Homeland Security office in St. Albans on Nov. 15, 2022. File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerBURLINGTON — A federal judge has handed down a probationary sentence to a New York woman who served as the head of the union representing U.S. Department of Homeland Security workers in Vermont and New York and who admitted embezzling from that union. Leticia Russi-Shareno, 60, pleaded guilty in December to a single count of wire fraud in connection with the theft that resulted in a $36,000 “out-of-pocket” loss to the union, according to court filings. Judge Christina Reiss sentenced Russi-Shareno to three years of probation during a hearing late Thursday afternoon in federal court in Burlington. The judge also required that Russi-Shareno make restitution to the union of $36,000. Reiss, in imposing the probationary sentence, said she took into consideration Russi-Shareno’s lack of a prior criminal record and her early acceptance of responsibility in the case. Russi-Shareno addressed the judge during the hearing, telling her she did not know why she stole the money from the union and she was working through counseling to try to come up with the answers. Russi-Shareno said she didn’t need the money, as her job at that time paid her more than $130,000 a year. “I’m trying to find out myself why I did this,” she told the judge.“I want to apologize to the union, to you and my family for my behavior,” Russi-Shareno said to Reiss.   According to charging documents, the embezzlement took place between August 2019 and December 2020 when Russi-Shareno lived in the Buffalo, New York, area. At that time, court filings stated, Russi-Shareno served as president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2076, the union representing employees of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security who worked in Vermont and upstate New York.The union had a bank account at the Vermont Federal Credit Union in Vermont, according to court records, and in her role as union president Russi-Shareno had check-signing authority and a debit card that allowed her to make purchases. “As part of the embezzlement, Russi-Shareno made many ATM withdrawals from the VFCU account and used those moneys for her personal benefit,” according to the charging document. The charging documents also accused Russi-Shareno of falsifying expense reports and records. Mark Kaplan, Russi-Shareno’s attorney, argued during Thursday’s hearing for a sentence for his client that did not include any prison time. The federal sentencing guideline range in the case was four to 10 months in prison, according to court filings. The guidelines are advisory, but federal judges often take them into consideration when handing down a sentence. Russi-Shareno, Kaplan said, was currently taking part in mental health counseling that would be interrupted if ordered to serve a prison sentence. “In addition,” he defense attorney wrote in a court filing ahead of Thursday’s hearing, “individuals who know Leticia would never have expected her to become involved in embezzlement, considering her reputation and character.” Also, according to Kaplan, Russi-Shareno is “gainfully employed” and does not have a drug or alcohol problem.“Although there is no question that Leticia has been convicted of a serious crime, a period of incarceration would do more harm than good,” Kaplan wrote in his court filing. Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Aliberti, the prosecutor in the case, argued for a prison sentence at the “low end” of the sentencing guideline range. “The Defendant’s fraud is a serious offense,” Aliberti wrote in his sentencing memo filed ahead of Thursday’s hearing. “The case contains aggravating factors such as the amount that was stolen and the defendant’s position of trust.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ex-union president for Homeland Security workers in Vermont avoids prison in embezzling case .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Department-of-Homeland-Security-Vermont-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

Jill WilliamsJust ahead of the summer tourism season, the United States Army Corps of Engineers has announced the closure of lakeside parks, campgrounds and beaches across the southeast, with most in Georgia.
In a statement, the Corps said there are not enough workers to staff the 31 parks across six lakes.
“This decision comes after careful consideration of the safety and security of all visitors,” the statement says. “The well-being of our community is our top priority, and the current staffing levels do not allow us to maintain the necessary safety measures within our parks. This includes essential services such as park supervision, maintenance, and safety monitoring that ensure a secure and enjoyable environment for all visitors. We will be continually assessing and reassessing closures throughout the summer.”
Lake Lanier in northeast Georgia was set to see the most closures with 20 set to close, according to the release, but Republican Congressman Rich McCormick said fewer sites will be shuttered.
McCormick, whose district includes part of Lake Lanier, said he spoke with the Corps and the closures will be more limited than originally announced.
“I pushed hard for a better solution, and they listened,” he said. “All boat ramps will remain open, and only 11 recreation sites will close temporarily, not the 21 originally planned.”
Corps employees, like many federal workers, have faced layoffs and buyouts in an effort from the administration of President Donald Trump to shrink the government. Georgia Democrats like Sen. Sen. Raphael Warnock pointed their fingers at Trump and Elon Musk as the culprits for potential missed summer fun.
“After public outcry from myself and countless Georgians, we prevented more than half of the announced park closures from going into effect,” he said, referring to the Lanier closures. “This is welcome news for Georgia families looking forward to enjoying summer days by the lake. But because of this administration’s reckless cuts, parks are still slated to be indefinitely closed. We must continue to speak out: Enough is enough with these reckless cuts, Georgia families deserve better.”
Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff also criticized the closures.
“The White House must take immediate action to reopen these beautiful parks at Lake Lanier for Georgia families. This is a direct and predictable result of the Administration’s reckless and chaotic mismanagement.”
Ossoff, who is up for re-election next year, is under pressure from his party to be seen as opposing Trump and supporting fired federal workers.
The Corps pledged to reassess closures during the summer. See their announcement for a list of affected parks.
It’s not yet clear which sites will close and which will remain open after the revision. Lake Lanier has 76 recreational areas, including 37 Corps-operated parks and campgrounds, according to the Corps.
In addition to the spots at Lake Lanier, two are set to close at Lake Allatoona in Cherokee and Bartow counties, a day use area and a campground. Three sites are set to close at Walter F. George Lake and Lake George W. Andrews along the Georgia-Alabama border, and the announcement also includes a public shoreline area in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System, which runs through Georgia.
Army Corps of Engineer employees are mostly civilians, and part of their mission is to maintain dams and waterways. All of Georgia’s major lakes are man made, with many created and maintained by the Corps.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Reaction in Kentucky to the “big beautiful bill” Republicans in the U.S. House passed early Thursday ranged from alarm to applause.
The bill, which passed by a single vote and now heads to the Senate, would make deep cuts to Medicaid, the federal-state program that pays for almost 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. 
Democrats and health advocates say the cuts could result in Kentuckians losing access to medical care in a state already grappling with poor health. 
Republicans, in general, say the bill wisely reins in Medicaid spending by returning the program’s focus to the people it was created  to serve in 1965.  Democrats in Congress expanded Medicaid in 2010, opening eligibility to low-income adults without disabilities in an effort to reduce the number of uninsured.
Hard choices face Kentucky Republican tasked with recommending Medicaid cuts

Despite the Medicaid cuts, the bill, endorsed by President Donald Trump, would enlarge the federal deficit, drawing objections from a few Republicans — prominent among them Kentucky’s U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of Vanceburg.
Massie was one of only two Republicans to vote against the bill which renews tax cuts enacted during Trump’s first term.
The Congressional Budget Office projects the bills would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years as the tax cuts and new spending exceed its reductions in federal expenditures.
In a floor speech, Massie called the budget bill a “ticking debt bomb” and said, to applause,“if something is beautiful, you don’t do it after midnight.” 
The measure  squeaked through the House on a 215-214 vote early Thursday morning after a night of negotiations.
It would reduce spending on Medicaid by $625 billion over 10 years and result in  7.6 million people going uninsured, according to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
‘It’s wrong, it’s cruel,’ says Democrat Beshear
During his weekly press conference, Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said the bill would “lead to more Kentuckians not being able to see a doctor, not having health care coverage, less revenue to support our rural hospitals and health systems, and it’s going to leave more of our kids and seniors going hungry.”

The bill shifts to state governments some of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which provides food to low-income Americans. Melissa McDonald, executive director of Feeding Kentucky which represents the state’s food bank, says the plan would increase hunger in Kentucky. 
Beshear also warned of “people losing their ability to go see a doctor.” 
“It’s wrong, it’s cruel,” Beshear said, adding that “those that will lose their health care coverage and food assistance” will pay for lawmakers’ choices. 
Doug Hogan, the government relations director in Kentucky for the American Cancer Society and the Cancer Action Network, told the Lantern that a “significant” number of cancer patients rely on Medicaid and that the program “is crucial for prevention, detection, treatment and survival of cancer.” 
“Cuts have consequences, and we don’t want cancer patients caught in (the) middle of those consequences. Medicaid provides access to health coverage, which is one of the best predictors of whether or not a person survives cancer,” he said. “The proposed cuts in Medicaid could interrupt a person’s cancer care, or stop it altogether, and others would lose access to regular cancer screenings and prevention, which would have a devastating impact on cancer patients and their families.” 
Politicians: ‘Golden Age’ versus ‘course for the iceberg’ 
In Massie’s 90-second floor speech opposing the budget bill, he compared it to the sinking of the Titanic, saying “we’re putting coal in the boiler and setting a course for the iceberg.” 
“This bill dramatically increases deficits in the near term, but promises our government will be fiscally responsible five years from now,” he said. “Where have we heard that before? How do you bind a future Congress to these promises? This bill is a debt bomb ticking. Congress can do funny math, fantasy math, if it wants, but bond investors don’t.”

Kentucky’s other Republicans in the House supported the bill.
U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers — who represents a district where 44% of residents are enrolled in Medicaid,  one of the nation’s highest rates — said he didn’t take his vote in favor of the bill “lightly” and that it’s “a comprehensive, responsible plan for the decade ahead and beyond.” 
“We must get rid of the waste, fraud and abuse, and it is our duty to secure this program, as well as SNAP benefits, for the American people in greatest need,” Rogers said in a statement. 
A new Congressional Budget Office analysis released Tuesday showed the House package tilted toward the wealthy, projecting it would decrease resources for low-income families over the next decade while increasing resources for top earners.
Rogers, R-Somerset, touted the bill’s tax cuts, especially ending the income tax on tips and overtime wages, and said “it secures Medicaid for Eastern Kentuckians living below the poverty rate by removing 1.4 million illegal immigrants from the program, along with 1.2 million ineligible recipients.”

U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, who is seeking the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to succeed Mitch McConnell, also praised the “massive tax cut for families, workers, seniors, and small businesses” in a statement. 
“Our bill also provides unprecedented resources for the border patrol to seal the border once and for all. We are on the doorstep of the Golden Age for America,” Barr of Lexington said. “It’s time to send this bill to President Trump’s desk.”
Andy Westberry, spokesperson for the Republican Party of Kentucky, said the House passage ensures “Medicaid will remain strong and focused on the Americans it was always meant to serve.” 
“The House passage of The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act marks a major victory for working-class Kentuckians and their families,” Westberry said. “The fear-mongering, misinformation, and over-the-top pearl-clutching being peddled by Gov. Andy Beshear and other Kentucky Democrats is nothing more than a desperate attempt to prey on the fears of Kentucky families.”

Meanwhile, Colmon Elridge, the chair of the Kentucky Democratic Party (KDP), called the bill “harmful.” 
“Rural hospitals will close, children and veterans will lose critical care and thousands of Kentucky families will struggle to put food on the table,” Elridge said. “Kentucky Republicans have betrayed the people they took an oath to serve. Kentuckians, and Americans, deserve better.” 
‘An untenable choice’
The measure now moves to the U.S. Senate. 
During a Thursday afternoon press conference, health and policy advocates called on  the Senate to “reverse these grievous and extreme cuts,” as Dustin Pugel, the policy director for the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, put it. 
Pugel estimates the legislation could result in 345,000 Kentuckians losing Medicaid coverage. The program in its current state covers about 1.5 million Kentucky residents.
“This House proposal would not just eliminate coverage, but could also eliminate jobs, especially in rural areas, and it would damage our progress in tackling severe problems like addiction and even cost lives in the long run,” Pugel said. 
Melissa Mather, a spokesperson for Family Health Centers of Louisville, said more than half of the 40,000 people served at her location in 2024 had Medicaid, a third of whom were children. Medicaid, she said, “keeps our doors open.” 
Mather also expressed concern that Kentucky could revert to pre-expansion realities, when some had to choose between health care or food. 
“Do we want Kentuckians to have to choose between buying groceries or their medicines?” Mather said. “Because I think that’s an untenable choice we’re asking people to make.” 
A plea to the Senate: ‘Change course’

Sarah Hill of Lexington, who joined Pugel and Mather during the Thursday press conference, credits the 2010 Medicaid expansion with helping her during a “particular low point” in her life. 
“I was unemployed and spent about a year sitting in an armchair in my mom’s house in Eastern Kentucky trying to figure out how to move forward when I couldn’t complete the most basic tasks like brushing my teeth or taking a shower,” said Hill, who said she’s struggled with mental health since the age of 14. 
After Kentucky chose to open Medicaid to low-income adults without disabilities, she applied — “a Herculean effort on my part” — and was able to access medications she needed to stabilize and get a job, she said. 
“If the proposed work requirements and regular check-ins were implemented when I had needed this assistance, I wouldn’t have received it,” Hill said. “I could not have done the paperwork needed to sign up, and then I could not have handled the stress of continually recertifying my need.” 
Dr. Edward Miller, the division director of maternal fetal medicine and high risk obstetrics at the University of Louisville and UofL Health, pointed out Kentucky’s poor health statistics: the state is one of the worst places in the country to have a baby, for example. 
  Dr. Edward Miller
“We have some of the highest rates of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, in the country, and most notably, we have one of the highest detection rates of new cancers in the country,” Miller, also on the health policy call, said. “Now, what is decreasing access going to do? Well, you don’t have to be a doctor, you don’t have to be a researcher, to know that decreasing access to those at the most risk is only going to make us plummet further down those rankings.” 
Hill, the former Medicaid participant, and others pleaded with senators to pull back on the proposed cuts. 
“Our senators have a choice to change course on this, and I fear that if we do not choose to change course, we are going to be throwing away our workforce,” said Hill. “We are going to be throwing away rural people, and we are going to be throwing away the potential of thousands of Kentuckians, just like myself. I ardently hope that we are able to change course, change the discourse around these things, because being sick one time doesn’t mean you have to be sick forever.”

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Thursday sent Gov. Kevin Stitt the state’s budget bill for next fiscal year setting the framework for nearly $12.6 billion in spending.
House Bill 2766, dubbed the “general appropriations bill,” outlines a budget deal struck by Republican leaders that keeps most agencies flat, but contains some increases for the fiscal year that starts July 1.
Stitt is expected to sign the measure. 
He and legislative leaders last week announced a budget agreement and a plan to cut the state’s top income tax bracket by 0.25%. It would reduce the state’s top income tax rate to 4.5% and create a path toward eliminating it. 
The 55-page budget measure passed by a vote of 27-19, only two more votes than required in the Senate.
Several Republicans joined Democrats voting against the measure.
“When it comes down to it, the challenge I see is a budget with mixed up priorities,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City.
The budget doesn’t contain enough money for education, health care, or the low income, but contains “special giveaways,” she said.
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Chuck Hall, R-Perry, defended the spending priorities in the budget, calling it a “compromise.”
“This is not a perfect budget,” he said. “No budget is. There are things in this budget that I don’t like. There’s things in this budget that I like very much.”
The budget contains funding increases for education, roads, voting system upgrades, a trooper academy and rapid DNA testing, Hall said.
It also provides $200 million to build a new pediatric heart hospital and $250 million for improvements to the veterinary school at Oklahoma State University, Hall said.
“We were once on the top for veterinary schools, and we will be there again,” he said.
It leaves $3.5 billion in savings, Hall said.
“We’re prioritizing core services like education, mental health, public safety and infrastructure, while maintaining strong fiscal discipline,” said Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle.

(Provided/Holcombe, Fair and Lane)A 2,700-acre piece of land in Jasper County is slated to become South Carolina’s first new state forest in more than two decades.
The Nature Conservancy bought the property, known as Chelsea Plantation, last week for $32 million. Originally nearly 6,000 acres, parts of the property had already been sold to groups looking to develop it into homes.

That decision, which would involve annexing the property into nearby Ridgeland, is still pending. But it put the rest of the land at imminent risk of development, according to the conservation nonprofit.
“Chelsea’s fate was one of this region’s major tipping points for the future of its wildlife habitat, historical character and water quality,” executive director Dale Threatt-Taylor said in a statement. “Developing Chelsea would have ushered in a new era of expansion in an already fast-growing region. We weren’t willing to leave it to chance.”
After placing the land under a conservation easement, which will guarantee that it remains protected regardless of who buys it, the conservation group plans to sell the land to the state Forestry Commission.
From there, following a series of state-level approvals, the land is expected to open to the public as a state forest. The timeline for approvals is still up in the air, Katy McWilliams, director of land protection for the nonprofit’s South Carolina office, told the SC Daily Gazette on Thursday.
The last time that happened was in 2004, when the Forestry Commission acquired 12,000-acre Wee Tee State Forest in Williamsburg and Georgetown counties.
With help from conservation groups, including The Nature Conservancy, the commission added more than 6,000 acres to the Wee Tee forest in 2023, but a new state forest hasn’t opened since, said spokesman Doug Wood.
The state’s five protected forests are funded through sales of timber sustainably harvested on the properties, according to the commission’s website. Each offers recreational activities, such as hunting, fishing, boating and hiking.

Conserving forests is one of the commission’s goals, and it is “making the greatest strides toward that end in decades,” State Forester Scott Phillips said in a statement.
“The prospect of adding Chelsea Plantation and other properties to our state forest system in the near future not only ensures these forested landscapes’ protection from development, but also their effective management for multiple uses, and hence their sustainability,” Phillips said.
Several more properties could be coming the commission’s way in the next few years, Wood said. Conservation groups are working with the commission to work out the details.
The Chelsea Plantation will be the first state forest in the state’s southern corner.
“This would give them the option to have something in that part of the state,” McWilliams said.
The Nature Conservancy has been eyeing the Chelsea Plantation since it first went on the market in 2019, McWilliams said. At the time, the nonprofit wasn’t prepared to jump into action and pay the $30 million price tag, she said.
In the years since, the nonprofit saw the loss as a missed opportunity. So, when a big chunk of the land came on the market, the group realized it had a second chance, McWilliams said.
“We were really excited to take a crack at it again and get a chance to protect Chelsea,” McWilliams said.
The land runs alongside more than 7 miles along the Hazzard Creek, which connects to the Broad River and is part of the Port Royal Sound watershed, and the tide floods and drains salt marshes on parts of the property.

That means the area is of “tremendous value for the watershed,” McWilliams said.
Longleaf pine, which has become a priority for conservationists as forests dwindle in size, grow on the property. On a recent visit, McWilliams spotted a dolphin swimming in the river and a bald eagle flying overhead, she said.
“It has many features that are very wonderful,” McWilliams said.
The Chelsea Plantation will join a network of protected properties in the area, spanning from the ACE Basin, one of the largest undeveloped swaths of land on the Atlantic coast, and the Savannah River.
Among those projects were a 7,300-acre plantation that became part of the Coosawhatchie Wildlife Management Area, which opened in September, and the 4,400-acre Gregorie Neck property, which The Nature Conservancy plans to split into six pieces and sell to private owners with the requirement they keep it mostly natural.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/1481C6A2-3F79-4CFA-8DCD-7A7FF505DF5Aremote68040a512e638d1f91801e15776918fa0476b637-1-original-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612
,DC,2025-05-22 21:40:29+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,RFK Jr.’s ‘Make America Healthy Again’ report stresses emphasis on children’s well-being,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jrs-make-america-healthy-again-report-stresses-emphasis-childrens-well-being,,"WASHINGTON — The Make America Healthy Again commission, created earlier this year by President Donald Trump, released its first report Thursday, calling on the administration and lawmakers to improve the well-being of the country’s children.The 73-page report was published just after Trump and several Cabinet secretaries held an event highlighting their concerns with four areas — nutrition, physical activity, environmental factors and “overmedicalization.”“Over the next 80 days, the commission will build on its work in this report to develop a road map to bold and transformative public health reforms for our consideration,” Trump said.Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said the report and the administration’s approach to childhood health issues is that “there is no difference between good economic policy, good environmental policy and good public health policy and good industrial policy. We can have all of them.”U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said that everyone knows American farming interests need to be at the center of the Make America Healthy Again, or MAHA, agenda.“We have the most robust, the safest, the best agriculture system in the world,” Rollins said.Mainstream farm groups, however, were not happy. ""Farmers are identified as ‘critical partners,’ yet were excluded from development of the report, despite many requests for a seat at the table,"" American Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall wrote in a statement.‘Corporatization and consolidation’ in food systemThe numerous ways that American agriculture and the food people choose to eat have evolved received considerable attention in the report.“Our agricultural system has historically focused on abundance and affordability. The progress we have made is largely thanks to the hard work of American farmers, ranchers, and food scientists,” it states. “However, the rise of (ultra processed food) has corresponded with a pattern of corporatization and consolidation in our food system. Today’s diet-related chronic disease crisis, demand a closer examination of this pattern and its broader impact.”The report mentions pesticides numerous times, but doesn’t call for them to be banned outright.“Some studies have raised concerns about possible links between some of these products and adverse health outcomes, especially in children, but human studies are limited,” the report says. “For example, a selection of research studies on a herbicide (glyphosate) have noted a range of possible health effects, ranging from reproductive and developmental disorders as well as cancers, liver inflammation and metabolic disturbances.”Kennedy testified during a U.S. Senate committee hearing earlier this week that based on drafts of the report he had seen, “there is not a single word in them that should worry the American farmer.”His comments came during an exchange with Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who specifically asked him about glyphosate, a commonly used herbicide, that she referred to as “one of the most thoroughly studied products of its kind.”“We're talking about more than 1,500 studies and 50-plus years of review by the EPA and other leading global health authorities that have affirmed its safety when used as directed,"" Hyde-Smith said. ""Have you been able to review thousands of studies and decades of scientific review in a matter of months?""Kennedy responded during that Tuesday hearing that her “information about the report is just simply wrong.”Sleep, stress, social mediaThe report combines recommendations that have long been supported by research, like exercising regularly and eating a well-balanced diet, with proposals that aren’t fully supported by science.It notes that “physical activity, encompassing moderate-to-vigorous exercise, aerobic fitness, and reduced sedentary time, is critical for child health and well being.“However, American youth have seen a steady decline in activity and cardiorespiratory fitness over decades, contributing to rising obesity, diabetes, mental health disorders, and cardiometabolic risks.”The report calls out children who are unable to get enough sleep and chronic stress as health challenges, in addition to the prevalence of social media.“The near-ubiquitous presence of social media in the lives of American adolescents, with up to 95% of teens regularly using at least one or more of these platforms—is increasingly correlated with a concerning rise in mental health challenges, particularly among younger users,” the report says. “With the vast majority of teenagers engaging with these platforms, understanding the nuanced consequences and mental health impacts of social media on their developing well-being is of critical public health importance.”No mention of gun violenceThe report didn’t include any mention of gun violence, a leading cause of death in American children and teenagers, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, analysis from the nonpartisan health research organization KFF and a report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions.“The United States has by far the highest rate of child and teen firearm mortality among peer nations. In no other similarly large, wealthy country are firearms in the top four causes of death for children and teens, let alone the number one cause,” KFF’s analysis states. “U.S. states with the most gun laws have lower rates of child and teen firearm deaths than states with few gun laws. But, even states with the lowest child and teen firearm deaths have rates much higher than what peer countries experience.”The Johns Hopkins report notes that the gun death rate in children between the ages of 1 and 17 has “increased by 106 percent since 2013 and (has) been the leading cause of death among this group since 2020.”In 2022, there were 2,526 gun deaths in that age range, for an average of seven a day, according to the report.The KFF analysis shows other leading causes of childhood death include motor vehicles, cancer, suffocation, congenital anomalies, poisoning and drowning. Farm Bureau, Corn Growers criticalFarm groups were dubious about the report’s conclusions.The American Farm Bureau’s Duvall said it was ""deeply troubling for the White House to endorse a report that sows seeds of doubt and fear about our food system and farming practices, then attempts to celebrate farmers and the critical role they play in producing the safest food supply in the world.""""The report also expresses a desire to ensure farmers continue to thrive, but undermining confidence in our food system directly contradicts that noble goal,” said Duvall. “The report spotlights outlier studies and presents unproven theories that feed a false narrative and only then does it acknowledge a mountain of evidence about the safety of our food system.""Iowa Corn Growers Association Chair Jolene Riessen said the “misinformation surrounding crop protection tools is incredibly upsetting because if there's one thing all farmers have in common, it's that we care about raising safe, healthy, and affordable food that nourishes families around the world.“Agriculture is a science, and we have spent years testing and researching pesticides, like glyphosate, to reaffirm that they are a safe and vital tool farmers rely on to feed and fuel the world.”Others said the report was lacking. Lori Ann Burd, the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health director, wrote in a statement the “report’s acknowledgement of pesticides’ risks to our children’s health is a small step forward,” before rebuking Trump administration officials for not going further.“The grassroots movement of millions of Americans who trusted Trump with their votes won’t forget that RFK Jr. was cowed by the powerful industrial farming forces determined to make sure there are no U.S. restrictions on harmful pesticides like atrazine, which is banned in 60 nations,” Burd wrote. “Instead of protecting our kids, we use over 70 million pounds of atrazine each year on the corn and sugarcane crops that are making Americans sick. The fight to ban atrazine will continue.”",,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612
,Mississippi Today,2025-05-22 21:31:28+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Amid peace initiative, Jackson fires violence prevention director",Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/05/22/amid-peace-initiative-jackson-fires-violence-prevention-director/,"The trauma recovery specialist had spoken to the mayor’s electoral opponent at a festival to celebrate south Jackson, Coleman alleged in an email to other city officials.","Weeks before the city could conclude its “100 Days of Peace” initiative, Jackson ousted the director of its Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery.
Keisha Coleman had led the less than 3-year-old office, a key piece of outgoing Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba’s efforts to tamp down on crime, since January 2023. 
She was by Lumumba’s side earlier this year when he announced, weeks before losing reelection, that the office had awarded $150,000 to community-based organizations working to prevent violence. The press conference marked the beginning of 100 Days of Peace, also known as 100 Days of Action, an initiative that was to feature events like town halls, trainings and listening sessions and conclude with a sneaker ball to celebrate the Jacksonians working to reduce violence. 
But if an event required funding, it did not happen, Coleman said, and she’s doubtful it will. Just a few months later, on May 7, Coleman said she received her termination letter from Lumumba’s chief of staff, Safiya Omari.
The alleged stated reason? The trauma recovery specialist had spoken to the mayor’s electoral opponent at a festival to celebrate south Jackson, Coleman wrote in an email to other city officials obtained by Mississippi Today.

“The termination, verbally framed as a ‘loyalty’ issue, follows repeated attempts to hold the administration accountable for gross misuse of public funds and nepotism that jeopardized critical community safety programs,” Coleman wrote. 
In an interview, Omari said she could not discuss personnel matters but called Coleman’s allegations “false and misleading.” The chief of staff also said she could not discuss how the allegations are misleading, “because then that would involve me talking about her.”
Coleman alleged in a pointed May 7 email to city council members that over her time as director, Omari and the mayor’s executive assistant, Tiffany Murray, blocked her efforts to get the new office up and running by stymying Coleman’s ability to spend city funds. She wrote that they prevented her from using empty office space to host workshops and slowwalked the distribution of city funding meant to create a youth engagement center. 
“OVPTR’s mission—to reduce violence and trauma in Jackson—has been crippled by Dr. Omari’s actions,” Coleman alleged. 
The office was launched in 2023 with a $700,000 grant from the National League of Cities, a nonprofit. Despite being the office’s director, Coleman wrote that the mayor’s office did not grant her access to spend city funds until the beginning of this year, making it difficult to execute events. 
“Most of the work was done from my personal funds and people in the community who supported the work,” Coleman wrote. 
Reached at her office line, Murray said she did not have any comment at this time.
Coleman told Mississippi Today that she doesn’t want the termination to overshadow the office’s work. On June 3, Jackson will hold a General Election for mayor, in which Democratic nominee and longtime state senator John Horhn is the expected winner.
“I do want to keep a good standing in the community in the event that John Horhn does come in and I want to advocate for that office,” she said. “I don’t want to diminish what’s going on there and the importance of that work.”
Payne told Mississippi Today that while it had not been long since Coleman left the city, several applicants had already interviewed for the position. 
“Her staff is still working, and they’re still doing what they need to do,” Payne said. 
But in the email, Coleman alleged that she had recently put one of her two subordinates — Omari’s son, Kuwasi Omari — on a performance improvement plan for “chronic tardiness, absenteeism, incompetence to the role, and failure to complete tasks or submit weekly reports.” Coleman also alleged Omari used her position by “withholding staff hires in order to hire her son.”
Kuwasi Omari, listed online as the office’s community outreach specialist, did not return Mississippi Today’s messages. His 45-day improvement plan was set to end on May 8, Coleman wrote, but the city fired her on May 7.
Responding to this allegation, Omari, whose other son works as a community services coordinator in the city’s department of human and cultural services, said that Kuwasi Omari is responsible for a program the office is running that works with boys at Lanier High School, which involves plans for a community clean-up.
“Let me just say this: It was certainly her right as his director to do that, but contextually I will say that the only real work that has taken place in the office,” Omari said before pausing. “Okay, no, I won’t say that.”    
The office will be without a director until at least July 1, when a new mayor comes in, after the city council instituted a hiring freeze Tuesday. Omari said this means that events like the sneaker ball probably won’t happen. 
“Having an idea and making statements doesn’t mean that the work to make those things happen has taken place,” Omari said. 
The council’s decision to freeze hiring came after WLBT reported the city had hired Lumumba’s former election opponent-turned-campaign supporter in the 2025 Democratic primary, David Archie, a former county supervisor, as a staff assistant to the mayor. 
The city also recently brought on Tariq Abdul-Tawwab, a former employee of the third party manager over the city’s water utility, JXN Water, which reportedly fired him in 2023, as a deputy director in the city’s public works department. He was recently described as a director at one JXN Water’s staunchest critics, the nonprofit People’s Advocacy Institute founded by the mayor’s sister and where Abdul-Tawwab’s wife works.
The Office of Violence Prevention and Trauma Recovery was established as an office under the mayor’s executive branch. In response to a recent public records request, the City Clerk told Mississippi Today that the city does not have an overall organizational chart, but provided several departmental organization charts.
The mayor’s office was not among them.
One of the violence prevention office’s goals is to quantify the impact of violence prevention work in Jackson through data. In the press conference earlier this year, Lumumba cited data showing that efforts by local organizations, including credible messenger groups, have ushered in long periods without violence in some of the most troubled areas of the city.
“I don’t have access to that data, as you know Keisha is no longer with us,” Omari said, “so we’re trying to figure out how we’re gonna move forward with the data that has come in, as well as a lot of the data I’m sure is coming directly from JPD, and everybody has access to that.”   
Coleman had told Mississippi Today earlier this year that her office was developing a public-facing data dashboard making it easier to examine crime trends and patterns in the city. 
The office’s work has been supported by local advocacy organizations, and Horhn previously told Mississippi Today that he did not have plans to close the office. 
But under the current administration, Coleman wrote her efforts were not receiving adequate support. 
In one example, she alleged that she had repeatedly asked to use empty office space in a city building on North State Street to host events like youth workshops. But in front of the mayor, Omari and Murray told her “no,” Coleman alleged, because that space was going to become Lumumba’s second office.
“This directly denies community of service, support, and resources that would assist in the goal of the OVPTR,” Coleman wrote. “As of today, the space has yet to be used.” 
The $50,000 grants that Lumumba announced earlier this year, the first transfers from the office to outside organizations, represent some of its largest expenditures, according to public records obtained by Mississippi Today. As of March, the office had reported spending nearly $430,000 since its inception, the bulk of it categorized under wages and benefits and the credible messenger grants. Coleman alleged that part of the money was used to pay Murray’s salary, “despite providing no operational support.”
The records show it has spent $1,200 on office supplies, $12,000 on travel and nearly $4,000 on data processing equipment, though if the office has conducted crime stats analysis to inform evidenced-based approaches to violence interruption, it has not publicized any such reports.
Coleman urged in her email that the office has remaining sources of funds that are at risk: A little over $200,000 the city council allocated to the office for a youth engagement center, and about $270,000 left from the National League of Cities. 
“This is not an attempt to smear this administration,” Coleman wrote in the email. “This is me being proactive because there is over $470,000 of funds out there that someone will have to answer for and I will NOT be thrown under the bus because I’m no longer there to speak for myself.” 
Omari said the youth engagement center will open sometime this summer at the currently defunct Mary C. Jones Center that is being rehabilitated with funds from the facilities department. The $202,000, Omari added, will be used for programming. 
“I know when I looked a couple months ago, the money hadn’t even been set up in our budget,” Omari said. 
The city did provide Coleman with one bit of support, she wrote. But it was apparently fleeting. 
“Outside of the one time in March 2024 (that) Tiffany gave me a realm (sic) of copy paper, I’ve purchased, on my own, copy paper, office supplies, flyers, rack cards, brochures, etc. just to have an operational office,” Coleman wrote.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/30143727/Denim-Day-3.jpg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

Grant Blankenship/GPBThe Public Service Commission’s mission statement says that it is supposed to ensure that Georgians have safe, reliable, and reasonably priced electricity. To be honest, natural (methane) gas and coal and any combustion fuel are neither safe nor reasonable cost. Methane gas is not actually natural, it is a fossil fuel just as coal and oil are fossil fuels. There is an entire scientific article in the prestigious medical journal, the New England Journal of Medicine, titled “The False Promise of Natural Gas.” This scientific article describes many of the health harms caused by natural methane gas, from production to pipelines to end use in power plants or homes. These health harms include exposure to carcinogens, air and water pollution, earthquakes, pipeline and other facility explosions, and climate change.
We know that both coal and methane gas power plants produce many kinds of air pollution, including fine particles (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and volatile organic compounds or VOCs. Some of these pollutants are precursors for ozone, which is created every day from a chemical reaction in the air between air pollution and sunlight. In addition, there are contaminants in both coal and natural gas that affect our health. Coal contaminants include many heavy metals, including lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others. Natural (methane) gas has benzene and other cyclic aromatics. All of these kinds of pollution and contaminants harm our health and damage our economy.
In the U.S., PM2.5 from fossil fuels causes 13% of all deaths, and NO2 from burning fossil fuels causes 1.6% of all deaths. Ozone causes even more deaths, and is known to cause as much progression of emphysema as smoking a pack of cigarettes every day. Ozone also triggers asthma and COPD exacerbations. In the Southeast, all of the kinds of air pollution made by coal and gas power plants put people in the hospital.
Recently, we have learned that PM2.5 damages children’s IQ, from exposure during the prenatal period through the childhood years. We know that children exposed to air pollution are more likely to have mental health problems too, either within a few days of a PM2.5 spike or even eight years after exposure to NO2 or PM2.5. We know that the kinds of air pollution that coal and methane gas power plants produce will trigger asthma attacks and can cause children to develop asthma. And we have learned that giving air filters to pregnant women who live in polluted cities improves their children’s IQ 4 years AFTER the children are born.
In California, when coal plants closed, the rate of preterm births for those who lived near the coal plants went down by over 25%.
Here in Georgia, more than two-thirds of our rivers and large lakes are contaminated with mercury to the point that the Department of Natural Resources has to publish guidelines every year about which fish need to have limited consumption, because the fish are contaminated with mercury. The vast majority of that mercury came from coal-fired power plants.
These are some of the reasons that it is clear that both coal and natural gas are not safe sources of fuel. The PSC needs to be true to its mission, and encourage safer sources of electricity production.
In addition, even though Lazard’s Levelized Cost of Energy (an energy cost analysis) shows that methane combined cycle and utility scale solar with storage appear to be in the same price range, this ignores the economic harms of reduced crop yields, work absences, and lower work productivity caused by fossil fuels, and also the enormous health costs of all the health damage from both coal and methane. Therefore it is also clear that both methane and coal are not reasonably priced, the stated costs are artificially low because they don’t include the enormous economic and health damages. It is massive cost-shifting, and Georgia residents are paying with increased taxes, increased health insurance premiums, and with our own lives.
However, it’s not all doom and gloom. There is a good solution: we can have abundant affordable electricity without all the health and economic damages. It sounds like pie-in-the-sky, but it’s true. Solar with storage is in the same price range as methane gas combined cycle, and wind with storage is less expensive. And both are quicker to build than a new gas turbine power plant. The PSC should require Georgia Power to have much more solar with storage and much less health-damaging methane and coal.
And just this week, news came out that Georgia Power will be asking to recover costs from Hurricane Helene next year. Many scientists have shown that Hurricane Helene was more damaging and carried more moisture because of climate change. Yet, while Georgia Power is asking to recover costs of damages from a climate change enhanced hurricane, they are at the same time asking to build new natural gas power plants that will make climate change worse. It doesn’t make sense, especially when we know that for about the same cost they could build solar with storage and stop making climate change worse.
Georgia has abundant sunshine that is more direct than in much of the United States. It is an abundant natural resource we can easily use without hurting people’s health or hurting our crop yields. Georgia power has abundant opportunity for utility scale solar with storage, which is the safest and most reasonable cost form of electricity that there is.
The bottom line is this: air pollution is so bad for our health and economy, that you don’t have to care about climate to want clean energy. Solar is one of Georgia’s most abundant natural resources. The PSC should be true to its mission and require Georgia Power to use more solar and wind energy with storage so that we have safe, affordable, and reliable energy.

(Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current)Former Henderson Police Chief Hollie Chadwick, who announced Thursday she’s running against Mayor Michelle Romero in the 2026 election, said she’s not seeking retribution after being terminated earlier this year by newly-minted City Manager Stephanie Garcia-Vause. 
“I don’t have that in my heart, nor can anybody afford that, especially in the community or the employees of City of Henderson,” Chadwick said when queried about her motivation. “I’m doing this with thoughtfulness, and I care about this community, and I want to do things positive (sic).” 
The Current was first to report in February that Chadwick would be given an option by Garcia-Vause to resign or be terminated. Chadwick later said she learned of Garcia-Vause’s ultimatum from news media. 
In recent months, she says, she’s been contacted by city employees and community members who asked her to challenge Romero, who was elected mayor in 2022 after serving one term on the city council. Before being elected to the council, Romero ran the city’s redevelopment agency. 
“While my tenure as police chief unfortunately became political and did not end the way I had hoped. I know I did nothing wrong,” Chadwick said.
After 20 years on the force, Chadwick was named to the top law enforcement spot in 2023, becoming the third chief named in six years. 
She was criticized for bucking recommendations to terminate suspended officers who covered up a colleague’s 2021 DUI according to an internal investigation, and reinstated the officers after a long probe. 
In 2024, the city police supervisors’ union filed a complaint with the Nevada Employee Management Relations Board, alleging Chadwick denied overtime resulting from union leave provisions in Nevada law and the city’s collective bargaining agreement. She was dropped from the complaint after her termination in March. The complaint has yet to be resolved. 
Garcia-Vause told news media Chadwick was not terminated for cause but because their management styles were not aligned. 
On Thursday, Chadwick called for transparency and accountability from current officials, but declined to elaborate.
“We need strong, steady leadership that listens to residents, acts with accountability and transparency and prioritizes people over politics and special interests,” Chadwick said.
Asked whether she was referring to Romero’s consulting company, in which the mayor represents applicants who often have business before the council, Chadwick declined to say. 
“That’s something you’d have to ask her,” she said. 
Romero did not respond to requests for comment on Chadwick’s challenge.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/C77948AB-764B-4103-A340-388DFC41773A-e1747949050984-1024x770.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

Danielle Conrad of Lincoln. Aug. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature, at least for now, has blanketly rejected four line-item budget vetoes Thursday from Gov. Jim Pillen and questioned whether his objections were constitutionally submitted and whether the vetoes count.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista announced that the Legislature was not in receipt of the actual line-itemed bills — Legislative Bills 261 and 264 — by the end-of-day Wednesday. Under the Nebraska Constitution, if the Legislature is in session, vetoes must be filed with the Clerk of the Legislature within five days, excluding Sunday.
If the Legislature is out of session when the bills are returned, vetoed bills are filed with the Nebraska Secretary of State’s Office.
Pillen announces $14.5 million in vetoes from Nebraska budget, 83% of it from Supreme Court

The Legislature did not receive the line-item objections until Thursday morning, hours after the midnight deadline and a half-day after the bills had been delivered to the Secretary of State’s Office on Wednesday. However, because the Legislature has not adjourned for the year, lawmakers argue the Clerk’s Office was still the proper destination. Both offices are in the Nebraska State Capitol.
“As such, we don’t believe that we can accept these vetoes,” Arch said.
Speaking with reporters, Arch said that to his knowledge, nothing like this has happened before and that the Legislature will be gathering facts on the situation. Multiple senators said the Governor’s Office could sue the Legislature to try and enforce the vetoes. Arch said he didn’t know if that would happen but hopes it won’t.
“I’m hoping that in our discussions, we can resolve the issue,” Arch said. “But on the plain reading of the Constitution, we have concerns.”
The Governor’s Office had no immediate comment.
‘Not a problem with the budget’
The 2025-27 budget bills have faced continued twists and turns accelerated by a major projected budget shortfall of at least $630 million by the time the budget bills passed last week. Hundreds of millions of dollars were moved around to fill the hole, including $147 million from the state’s “rainy day” cash reserve fund.
Pillen’s vetoes sought to reduce state spending by $14.5 million, $12 million of which was cut from the allotment to the Nebraska Supreme Court, which court leaders said could be detrimental to various services.
  State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, said the budget-writing process has been stressful but that he was “pleased” with ending at a balanced budget. Of Pillen’s vetoes, he said he agreed “the Constitution was not followed.”
“What happened with the delivery of the vetoes is not a problem with the budget,” Clements said.
Now in his ninth year on the committee, and in his final two-year budget, Clements said he enjoys numbers and that it is “a real relief” to have reached the end.
Multiple Appropriations Committee members were joyful at the conclusion, with some grinning ear to ear, hugging one another and pumping their fists in the air after Arch announced the conclusion. Up until that moment, lawmakers and lobbyists were abuzz that, for seemingly the first time, vetoes might have been stopped without a vote of the Legislature.
Veto overrides take at least 30 votes and often feature intense gubernatorial pressure, often behind the scenes, to flip votes on legislation that often first passes with more than 30 votes.
‘Upholding the Constitution’
State Sen. Terrell McKinney of Omaha, who will seek to override a veto of LB 287, a bill trying to crack down on bedbugs in Omaha and give the Omaha City Council additional oversight of the Omaha Housing Authority, took a different view.
“I wish the veto for LB 287 was invalid too, but overall it’s karma,” McKinney said.
  State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, a new face on the Appropriations Committee this year, said she feels the Governor’s Office would try to make the vetoes stick anyway. She said the drama would end up in front of the people of Nebraska.
“I told everybody this morning, ‘Let’s just descend into the chaos.’ And they took me literally,” Cavanaugh told the Nebraska Examiner.
She continued: “I mean, process matters, the Constitution matters. We’re upholding the Constitution, which is our job, and that’s pretty much it.”

Despite a waitlist of thousands of Vermonters, the Vermont State Housing Authority says it won’t be able to issue new vouchers for now and will aim to trim about 489 vouchers from its existing rolls through attrition. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s largest provider of Section 8 housing subsidies will stop issuing new vouchers.","A “for rent” sign on Barre Street in Montpelier on Thursday, May 23, 2024. Photo by Natalie Williams/VTDiggerThis story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.Facing a reduction in federal funding, the Vermont State Housing Authority will stop issuing new rental assistance vouchers to low-income households on its lengthy waitlist, and has begun rescinding vouchers from about 50 Vermonters currently searching for an apartment to use them.“We have a plan to curtail our spending and to protect families that are receiving rental assistance,” said Kathleen Berk, executive director of the Vermont State Housing Authority, the state’s largest administrator of the federal Section 8 program. The housing authority faces a roughly $1 million funding reduction for the remainder of 2025, Berk said, which came as something of a surprise earlier this month. That funding gap is the result of a budget cut to a specific voucher program that serves disabled individuals, along with the lack of an annual inflation increase to keep up with rising rents, which Berk said had historically been included in yearly appropriations for rental assistance. That means VSHA’s $39 million annual budget for vouchers won’t go as far. The funding loss means the housing authority must trim about 489 vouchers from its rolls, Berk indicated. That’s about 12% of the 3,897 vouchers the housing authority currently administers. Because future funding is generally tied to past spending, Berk fears this year’s reduction in vouchers could lead to a “downward spiral” in the number of Vermonters getting rental aid in years to come.As Vermont sees housing prices escalate and homelessness increase, federal housing vouchers play a key role in sustaining housing for low-income people who can’t afford market-rate rents. Voucher recipients pay a third of their income toward rent; a local agency administering the federal program pays for the rest.The need is great. At 3,379 applicants, the state housing authority’s waitlist for vouchers nearly matches the number of households who currently have them. The waitlist has been closed since late January, when the housing authority first anticipated federal cuts. READ MORE
The housing authority does not plan to take away vouchers from people who currently have them, Berk emphasized. Instead, it hopes to reduce its load primarily through attrition – by not giving out new vouchers when someone retires one. It is taking a few additional steps to hasten that process, as outlined in a memo to community partners sent out on Wednesday. The authority will stop taking referrals for special rental assistance programs for veterans, young people exiting the foster care system, and families at risk of separation because of their lack of housing. It will also pause an initiative that allows people who live in homes where a subsidy is attached to take their voucher and move elsewhere after a year. (The housing authority does plan to keep moving new tenants into these subsidized units when they become vacant).That move struck Jess Horner, program director at John Graham Housing and Services in Addison County, as particularly alarming. John Graham has 18 of these subsidy-attached apartments, which they often rent to people who are “hard to house,” she said. The organization offers wraparound support to help these renters become successful, and then the tenants can take their housing subsidy and move elsewhere.Cutting off their ability to move their voucher creates a bottleneck, Horner said.“These units are going to be occupied by the folks who are in them now until voluntary exit, death, or eviction,” she said. “Which means that there aren’t any opportunities for other people to try their hand at an affordable unit.” Some of the state housing authority’s cost-cutting measures mirror moves taken by the Burlington Housing Authority in January, after HUD first signalled a possible funding reduction. BHA acted proactively, suspending vouchers from some 70 households looking for housing and taking a staunch stance against allowing rule-breakers second chances.Now, the Burlington Housing Authority – the state’s second largest, behind VSHA – is not making additional policy changes, according to executive director Steven Murray.“I’m patting myself on the back, because we got a lot of heat for what we did,” Murray said.Berk said she does not wish the state housing authority had taken action sooner. In the past, she has secured special funding from HUD to help fill shortfalls when voucher costs have increased unexpectedly – something she might pursue again, she said.But given that the Trump administration has signalled its desire to essentially end the Section 8 program as it currently exists – cutting federal rental aid by about 40% and diverting that money to states to spend as they see fit – she isn’t sure she ought to trust the past.“There are unprecedented times,” Berk said. “To what extent prior experience helps is questionable – but we’ll continue to fall back on that.” Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s largest provider of Section 8 housing subsidies will stop issuing new vouchers.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/For-Rent-Housing-Montpelier-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-22 18:09:56.454612

(Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson sat out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump Administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: the Trump Administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump Administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.



Arkansas state aid update
On Thursday, Sanders announced that the state will cover up to 35% of county and local governments’ cleanup and rebuilding costs resulting from the March storms.
State emergency management staff will coordinate with the respective local governments using preliminary damage estimates previously submitted to FEMA.
Once projects are complete, county and local governments will have to submit expense documentation, which the Arkansas Division of Emergency Management will review and inspect, the press release said.

 Cave City pushes forward

Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump Administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
  Cave City, Ark. Mayor Jonas Anderson motions toward a storm-damaged home. Cave City could be on the hook for roughly $300,000 in damages. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.

 

 
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”
 FEMA politics

Over the past two years, the Biden Administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump Administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.

In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.

John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: the federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for President Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
  Cave City’s welcome sign rests against a building. It was damaged along with much of the town after a twister ripped through Northeast Arkansas in March. (Photo: Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis, Mo. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing…they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota State Superintendent of Public Instruction Kirsten Baesler is one step closer to joining the U.S. Department of Education.
Her nomination to be the next assistant secretary of elementary and secondary education will advance to the full Senate after members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee voted 12-11, along party lines, on Thursday to approve her nomination, according to a news release from the state Department of Public Instruction.
“I am grateful for the Senate HELP Committee’s vote and honored for the opportunity to support our nation’s students, families, and teachers,” Baesler said in a statement. “If confirmed by the Senate, I am committed to working closely with my colleagues for continued progress in serving students effectively.” 
According to the department, Baesler plans to resign as state superintendent upon her full Senate confirmation. Gov. Kelly Armstrong would then appoint Baesler’s successor who will serve through the 2026 election. That election will decide who will lead the Department of Public Instruction for the final two years of Baesler’s term, which expires in 2028.
Baesler, a native of Flasher, was first elected state superintendent in 2012 and has won reelection to the position three times, most recently defeating Jason Heitkamp in 2024 with 57% of the vote.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday reversed a lower court’s dismissal of the attorney general’s lawsuit against the state prisons board for violating the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act.
The ruling, written by Associate Justice Rhonda Wood for the six-member majority, sends the case back to Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox for adjudication.
Attorney General Tim Griffin filed the lawsuit on Dec. 15, 2023, alleging the Arkansas Board of Corrections violated the FOIA when it entered executive session during a pair of public meetings and improperly hired an outside attorney. Griffin also said the board failed to properly respond to a public records request from his office. 
Arkansas attorney general to appeal rulings in Board of Corrections disputes

Fox gave Griffin 30 days to work with the corrections board on an agreement with an outside attorney to represent it. Fox dismissed the case without prejudice in January 2024, ruling Griffin’s office failed to make an effort to initiate the statutory procedure that allows special counsel to represent state officials and entities.
Griffin moved to vacate the circuit court’s order, arguing his office could not certify special counsel until the board asked for legal representation, according to Thursday’s order from the state Supreme Court. 
The attorney general typically represents state entities, but according to Thursday’s order, Griffin argued his duty to represent the state corrections board depended on the board certifying its need for legal representation. 
“He is correct,” Wood wrote, noting that the attorney general has no duty to represent state agencies until a certified request for services is made. 
“[Griffin’s appeal] argues that the circuit court dismissed the action for his failure to accomplish what he legally did not have sole authority to do,” the order states. “In response, the Board contends the circuit court had authority to dismiss the action under Arkansas Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b). Because we find the circuit court abused its discretion, we reverse and remand.” 
Special Justice Bud Cummins joined the decision, while Associate Justice Nicholas Bronni did not participate. The governor appointed Cummins, a former U.S. attorney, to replace Bronni, who recused himself from the case in January. Bronni served as the state’s solicitor general in Griffin’s office before Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders appointed him to the high court in December.

Associate Justice Shawn Womack dissented. In his dissent, Womack writes that even though the circuit court was right to dismiss Griffin’s lawsuit, the dismissal should have been with prejudice and because of sovereign immunity, a legal doctrine that the state cannot be sued in its own courts. The case should be reversed and dismissed, said Womack, who regularly cites sovereign immunity in court decisions.  
“Obviously, in most situations when the State brings a lawsuit, sovereign immunity is not implicated because the lawsuit does not make the State a defendant,” he wrote. “But in those rare instances when the State is both the plaintiff and the defendant—as it is here—sovereign immunity applies, and the underlying lawsuit is barred.”
In a social media post, Griffin praised the high court’s decision, which allows his suit to continue.
“I sued the Board of Corrections to defend our Freedom of Information Act. I am thankful for today’s Arkansas Supreme Court decision, which will allow that lawsuit to go forward,” Griffin wrote. “I take defending the FOIA seriously, and I will not tolerate those who violate it.”  
The lawsuit is part of a dispute between the corrections board and the executive branch that started in late 2023 over who has ultimate authority over the state’s prison system. 
The board’s refusal in November 2024 to approve a request to increase prison capacity by 500 beds prompted public criticism from Griffin and Sanders. The board responded by hiring an outside attorney the following month to represent it in employment matters. 
The board voted 3-2 to hire Abtin Mehdizadegan, a labor and employment lawyer with the Little Rock firm of Hall Booth Smith. The vote came with almost no discussion after a 45-minute closed-door session.
Griffin quickly questioned the board’s authority to hire outside counsel without obtaining his office’s consent, citing state law that says the attorney general’s office represents state officials and entities.

Detachment.Major General J Peter Hronek, the Adjutant General of Montana’s National Guard, will retire on June 7, following a 40-year military career. 
Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte on Tuesday announced the leadership change at the Department of Military Affairs, and the appointment of Col. Trenton J. Gibson as the new adjutant general for the state, the highest ranking state military officer.
“I’m grateful to General Hronek for his service to the State of Montana. Under his leadership, the men and women of the Montana National Guard have had a true public servant guiding them and their efforts,” Gianforte said in a press release. “From helping Montanans recover from disasters to recruiting Montanans to serve their country as a member of the Guard, General Hronek has served Montana with steadfast dedication. I wish him great success as he embarks on this next chapter of his life.”

Gianforte appointed Hronek in December 2020 following a stint serving in Washington D.C.
Hronek began his military career as a pilot in 1985 and has been with the Montana National Guard since 1986. He served three combat tours in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. 
“I have been honored to lead the outstanding soldiers, airmen, and Department of Military Affairs professionals. I am so proud to see them empowered and ready to serve at the next level. They have enhanced their missions and brought on new capabilities to our nation and state. As a result of our efforts, the Montana National Guard is in a better position than ever before to recruit and retain our members,” Hronek said in a press release. 
Following Hronek’s retirement next month, Gibson will take over as the leader of Montana’s military force. 
Gibson, according to the state’s press release, began his military career with the Montana National Guard in 1995 and currently commands the 1889th Montana Army National Guard Regional Support Group in Butte. He also has served as director for the Montana National Guard Youth Challenge Academy since 2018. 
“I thank Major General Hronek for his honorable service to our state and nation and his steadfast leadership of the Montana National Guard. I appreciate Governor Gianforte offering me the honor and privilege of serving in this capacity,” Colonel Gibson said. “The Montana National Guard and the Department of Military Affairs are home to exceptional professionals, and I have been blessed to serve in both organizations for over 25 years. I also thank my family for their support and sacrifice as I step into this critical role.”
The Montana National Guard comprises 2,290 soldiers stationed in 16 different communities across Montana. 
Montana’s National Guard has been in the news recently after three Army National Guard members were cited for criminal trespassing after allegedly landing a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter on private property near the Crazy Mountains. 
The Big Timber Pioneer first reported on the incident, in which the guardsmen collected elk antlers and a skeletonized head with antlers, according to the Sweet Grass County sheriff’s office. 
The Montana National Guard said the troops had been on a training flight from Billings to Helena, and turned over the antlers to the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks. 
One of the three guardsman charged with misdemeanor trespassing is also a Montana Highway Patrol trooper. 
In a statement about the alleged incident last week, Hronek said an internal investigation was underway. 
“If true, this behavior does not align with the values of the Montana National Guard. Misuse of military equipment erodes the trust we strive to uphold with the people of Montana,” Hronek said. “Every member of the Montana National Guard is expected to uphold the highest standards of integrity, responsibility, and respect for the law.”
A spokesperson for the governor’s office said Hronek’s retirement is “in no way related to the current events of the department.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/491475940_1105423758069113_7249906776461344536_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

Senate Bill 1405, the product of mounting legislative grievances and frustrations with the State Elections Enforcement Commission, sped to passage with little debate, as happened Tuesday night in the Senate.
The difference was a bare majority of House Democrats present and voting who rejected the four-caucus deal signed off by their leaders, House Speaker Matt Ritter of Hartford and House Majority Leader Jason Rojas of East Hartford.
The House voted 92-46 to pass the bill, with 11 Democrats and two Republicans missing the vote. All the votes against were cast by Democrats. The Senate vote was 34 to 1, with one Democratic dissenter.
Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, who helped negotiate the bill as co-chair of the Government Oversight Committee, and Ritter both said the revolt among Democrats was provoked by making the appointment of the commission’s executive director subject to lawmakers’ approval.

“That was the poison pill for our folks,” Dathan said.
Ritter and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, were willing to strike that provision, but the Senate leaders were adamant it remain in the bill. 
“We were made well aware of that,” Ritter said.
Unless the bill is vetoed, the five-member elections commission, known as SEEC, will nominate an executive director, but the choice will be subject to three layers of approval by legislators: the Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee and the House and Senate.
Dathan said she had proposed a compromise: the commission’s choice of an executive director be required to appear before the legislature’s Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee for an informational public hearing but not subjected to a vote.
Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, said his caucus insisted on a legislative vote. 
Until amended Tuesday night, the bill also would have made all declaratory rulings and written guidance by SEEC subject to review and approval of lawmakers. The revised version gives lawmakers an opportunity to review and comment but not reject.
Other provisions of the bill were intended to streamline fundraising, especially for candidates who participate in the state’s voluntary Citizens’ Election Program, which imposes spending limits in return for public financing of campaigns. To qualify, candidates must raise threshold amounts that vary by office.
Lawmakers complain that the commission was slow to approve public grants in 2004, often delaying approval over small inconsistencies in reports. The commission also audits half of all campaigns, chosen at random, a burden on volunteer campaign treasurers.
“It frustrates everyone,” Rep. Roland Lemar, D-New Haven, said after the vote.
But he still voted against the bill, alarmed at making SEEC’s director subject to legislative approval.
“Your regulator should be independent of the regulated,” he said.
Rep. Michael Demicco, D-Farmington, made a similar comment during the floor debate, noting the concerns raised by the League of Women Voters, Common Cause and others about the perceived and actual loss of independence by a commission created as a post-Watergate reform.
“I’m looking at testimony that was submitted when this bill went to public hearing. And it’s very troubling, some of the testimony that I’m reading,” Demicco said.
No one replied.
He was the only lawmaker in either chamber to speak against the bill during debates.
“I wanted to raise those concerns and hopefully my colleagues become concerned as well,” he said after the vote.
It was unclear whether the unexpected opposition in the House will prompt a closer review of the measure by Gov. Ned Lamont, whose priorities in the last weeks of the legislative session have been negotiating a budget and avoiding a nursing home strike.
“The governor hasn’t made a decision as to whether he will sign SB 1405. We will review the bill more closely when it reaches his desk,” said Rob Blanchard,  a spokesman.
The Citizens’ Election Program was created in 2005 as an anti-corruption measure and an effort to create a level playing field on fundraising. It is used by the majority of lawmakers, despite the frustrations in dealing with SEEC.
In the brief floor debate, Dathan emphasized the less controversial aspects of the bill, primarily the provisions dealing with fundraising and disclosure requirements.
“It modernizes a 20-year-old program,” Dathan said. “Like everything we do in our state, we look at where it’s been successful, where things need to be updated. It ensures continued transparency in our government, and really does the objective of keeping our election program transparent.”
Dathan and Ritter said the issue of legislative confirmation could be revisited by future legislators.
“I certainly hope that it does not become political in confirming the SEEC person,” Ritter said. “I hope it is not the Democrats in power want a Democrat and the Republicans in power want a Republican. I hope we continue to find good nonpartisan people.”
“If we get something wrong and in a couple years we regret it, we can relook at it,” Ritter said. “I don’t think the confirmation process bothers me all that much.”

(Photo courtesy of New Mexico Aging Services)Public comment closes Friday on New Mexico’s aging department’s long-term plan, which outlines goals to address the state’s growing senior population and their needs.
The Aging and Long-Term Services Department opened public comment in April for its draft plan, which includes three overarching goals: administering home and community programs to help seniors age in place and support caregivers; responding to social determinants of health such as food and housing insecurity, access to services and social support; and reducing instances of abuse, neglect and exploitation while preserving the autonomy of seniors.
The public comment period included a survey in which participants were asked to rank how they would prioritize the three goals, how well the plan addresses their needs and how successful they believe the plan will be, along with an opportunity to provide suggestions for improving the proposed plan.
“We have received meaningful feedback from across the state—including organizations, direct service providers, senior participants, and community members—and it’s clear that New Mexicans care deeply about how we support our aging population,” ALTSD Deputy Cabinet Secretary Angelina Flores-Montoya told Source NM in a written statement.
She said the department will incorporate the feedback into the final plan, “which will influence our work now and in the years to come.”
The draft plan was informed by a needs assessment conducted by the Center for Applied Research and Analysis at the University of New Mexico’s Institute for Social Research. The department contracted with the center in fiscal year 2023 and released a report in September 2024 identifying six key findings and six recommendations. 
Researchers gathered information from focus groups in five New Mexico communities, as well as surveys completed by service providers throughout the state. U.S. Census data and other state collected data were also used.
Findings included: New Mexico’s aging population has “grown significantly,” as have metrics of vulnerability such as poverty and disability; older adults and service providers describe service deserts without access to transportation and medical supportive services; providers note lack of funding, personnel and training are “critical barriers;” and rural and urban areas differ in vulnerabilities.
The report suggested the aging department expand services to meet growing needs; plan for a growing aging population and expanded service requirements; improve public outreach; address workforce shortages; complete a statewide services inventory; and implement a statewide consumer survey. These findings are reflected in the current draft plan, which members of the public have had a chance to comment on. 
According to the draft, the plan is set to go into effect in October 2024.

But today, that independence is under serious threat.
On Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which includes sweeping cuts to Medicaid. For many in North Dakota, these cuts aren’t abstract figures. They mean losing access to critical services that make daily life possible, like bathing, commuting to work, or attending community programs, robbing them of their place within the community.
This threat to Medicaid is more than a fiscal issue. It’s a rollback of decades of hard-won progress. In 1980, six North Dakota families partnered with The Arc to challenge the inhumane conditions at Grafton State School and San Haven State Hospital. That lawsuit led to the closure of San Haven, reduced the population at Grafton, and shifted our state toward more humane, community-based care. Now, that legacy is in danger of being erased.
In addition to deep funding cuts, the legislation introduces policy changes that restrict access to care in multiple ways:

Work requirements: The mandatory Medicaid work requirements start date has been moved to Dec. 31, 2026. Although people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are technically exempt, real-life implementation often fails to protect them. Many individuals with disabilities and their family caregivers get caught in confusing eligibility rules, risking wrongful loss of coverage.
Increased costs: States can now charge Medicaid recipients up to $35 per service. Annual out-of-pocket costs could shoot up even for those near the poverty line, making necessary care unaffordable for many.
Frequent eligibility checks: Medicaid eligibility will be reviewed every six months instead of annually. For people with limited access to technology or help navigating paperwork, this change drastically increases the risk of losing coverage due to missed notices or simple errors.
Limits on provider taxes: New federal restrictions on provider taxes limit how states fund their Medicaid programs. This could reduce available dollars for crucial services, including supported employment, in-home care, and day programs. These services allow individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities to live and thrive in their communities.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint precisely how many North Dakotans with intellectual and developmental disabilities will be affected, the overall impact is clear: Medicaid is the backbone of their support system. Even if some individuals are exempt from specific requirements, the broader funding cuts and program restrictions will limit access, increase delays, and force many to go without the help they need.
Families are already facing long waitlists and strained service systems. These cuts will only make things worse. When services disappear, people don’t just “fall through the cracks”; they face real, lasting harm.
Consider one individual with intellectual and developmental disabilities who’s waited months for a supported employment slot. Without a job coach, they remain unemployed, despite being ready and eager to work. Medicaid cuts push that opportunity further out of reach for them and hundreds of others like them.
And the alternative? Institutional care may sound like a backup plan, but it isolates people, limits opportunities, and costs the public far more. Supporting people in their communities is the right and the fiscally responsible choice.
At The Arc, we believe people with disabilities deserve the supports they need to live full, meaningful lives. But today, families and providers are navigating a maze of shifting rules, disappearing services, and uncertain futures. The confusion alone makes it harder to get help when needed most.
To pursue this direction is to court the resurgence of systems we consciously moved beyond. Our collective experience, however, and the resources now at our disposal, equip us to forge substantive improvements rather than reenact previous failings.
North Dakotans of all abilities deserve more than just survival. They deserve a future built on dignity, inclusion, and respect.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaid-scaled-2-1536x1024-1-1024x6831745922858-1.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

Kelly Ayotte signed two anti-sanctuary city bills into law in New Hampshire on Thursday, fulfilling a campaign promise she and several of her Republican colleagues in the Legislature made during the fall.
“There will be no sanctuary cities in New Hampshire,” Ayotte said. “Period. End of story.”
The bills — House Bill 511 and Senate Bill 62 — seek to prevent so-called sanctuary cities, or localities that have laws hindering local law enforcement from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement or federal immigration laws. When it goes into effect in January, HB 511 will require New Hampshire municipalities to comply with ICE immigration detainers “if safe to do so,” prohibit policies ignoring federal immigration-related directives and authorities, and forbid local law enforcement from investigating whether someone in their custody is a citizen, unless that person in under investigation for violating New Hampshire law. SB 62, which also goes into effect in January (though it creates legal definitions that become law in July), will take away state or local governments’ authority to prohibit their affiliated law enforcement entities from entering into voluntary agreements with ICE.
Speaking to reporters at the bill signing ceremony, Ayotte invoked comparisons to neighboring Massachusetts. Bay State Gov. Maura Healey has denied that her state is a sanctuary state but the Center for Immigration Studies includes it in their list of 13 sanctuary states.
“This is something we ran on to make sure that New Hampshire would not go the way of Massachusetts,” she said, “and their billion-dollar illegal immigration crisis.”
Ayotte also boasted that New Hampshire is “the safest state in the nation” and said “we’re going to continue to be that and this is a big step forward.” U.S. News and World Report ranked New Hampshire No. 1 among all states for public safety. It ranked reported sanctuary states Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Connecticut in the top 10 as well.
Ayotte’s fellow conservatives praised her at the ceremony for tackling the right’s priorities.
“I look at the governor and I think, wow,” state Sen. Bill Gannon, a Sandown Republican, said. “She made promises. She kept them. She did that with bail reform. Check. Sanctuary city bills today. Check.”
Rep. Joe Sweeney, a Salem Republican and House Majority Leader, who has been aggressive in pushing for legislation addressing undocumented immigration said: “We are sending a clear message to the state of New Hampshire today that if you’re in this nation illegally, you are not welcome in the state of New Hampshire.”
This comes amid a controversial immigration agenda for the federal government led by President Donald Trump. That includes a slew of deportations and detainments of student activists protesting Israel’s war in Gaza, a group of Venezuelan migrants sent to a notoriously brutal El Salvador prison, and Europeans, including a Nashua German-American man and a number of tourists, being detained for weeks.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AyotteSigningMay222025-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

May 21. Photo by Greta Solsaa/VTDiggerTwo affordable housing developers broke ground Wednesday on 30 permanently affordable housing units on a long-vacant industrial site near the downtown of Rutland City.The three-story, energy-efficient housing project known as Maplewood Commons includes six units designated for people with housing challenges and three accessible units. Residents will have access to green spaces, an outdoor play space, a patio and a community room.Rutland City Mayor Mike Doenges said the 30 units, built by Cornerstone Housing Partners and Evernorth, are part of 220 permitted housing units now in the works toward his goal of 1,000 new units in the city by 2028. Mary Cohen, executive director of the recently merged Cornerstone Housing Partners, said at the groundbreaking that the project might seem like a “drop in the bucket” but is an important step forward in addressing the city’s housing needs. The project was expedited with help from the Rutland City Mayor’s Office to locate the project in a “neighborhood designated area.” That helped avoid some regulatory requirements of Act 250, a state law for land use and development review, Cohen said. Maura Collins, executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, said the agency helped the partners secure funds for the project because of the “clear vision” articulated by the city’s leadership and the community’s significant need for housing.“We were really impressed by the location of this property and how it was going to improve the neighborhood by taking down the buildings that were there and replacing them with beautiful, high-quality housing that could serve the Rutland community,” Collins said in an interview. A partnership with the Rutland Housing Authority will provide rental assistance through 10 housing vouchers to those exiting or at risk of homelessness, she said. That means “this property is going to help folks who need it the most,” Collins said.The project has come to fruition through a variety of private and public state and federal funds, totaling $14.6 million.Evernorth President Nancy Owens said at the event that the groundbreaking is an “important milestone” because it invests in strengthening a neighborhood near downtown Rutland. But, she said, the fate of funding for other affordable projects down the line is unknown as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President Donald Trump works to dismantle some programs. The federal department has faced staffing cuts and funding freezes, including the withholding of $60 million in affordable housing and community development contracts through the department in recent months, according to reporting by the Associated Press. She noted the Maplewoods Commons project included $5.6 million of federal funding allocated from the American Rescue Plan Act State Fiscal Recovery Fund and National Housing Trust Funds. That money was administered through the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.“Some of the threats that we’re seeing in Washington around the budget process” are “very tangible to the people and communities of Vermont,” Owens said. The development partners in Rutland and around the state will search to secure new financial resources to allay the potential loss of federal funds, she added.Collins said at the groundbreaking event that there was a “little glimmer of good news coming out of D.C. this week.” The Vermont delegation’s advocacy to expand Low Income Housing Tax Credits has gained traction and is included in the current iteration of the budget reconciliation bill, she said. These tax credits, which developers sell to private investors to obtain funding, “are the largest source of funding to create affordable rental housing,” Collins said in an interview. Federal Tax Credit Equity funding provided by Evernorth through private banks and administered through the Vermont Housing Finance Agency comprised $6.6 million, the bulk of funding for the Maplewoods Commons project.Affordable housing projects are typically sourced through a patchwork of funds, Collins said. The loss of federal funding sources, including federal American Rescue Plan stimulus money the state budgeted toward housing during the Covid-19 pandemic, makes the financial landscape for affordable housing in Vermont uncertain, she said. “If Vermont got an increase in tax credits, it means that we could have more resources to create more affordable housing,” Collins said in an interview. “At the same time, the federal government is slashing HUD’s budget, and there’s less state money for housing, and so I don’t really know what the impact will be.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  30 new affordable housing units underway in Rutland City as federal funding causes uncertainty.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/maplewood-commons.jpg,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 20:42:42+00:00,CT Mirror,"As House passes ‘big beautiful bill,’ CT delegation joins opposition",Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/22/trump-big-beautiful-bill-ct-lawmakers/,"The bill, designed to carry out Trump’s agenda on taxes, immigration and energy, could have several implications for Connecticut.","Connecticut’s congressional delegation joined other Democrats Thursday in uniform opposition to House Republicans’ “big beautiful bill” designed to carry out President Donald J. Trump’s agenda on taxes, immigration and energy. 
Republicans had been divided on the best strategy to get the bill passed for weeks and were in nonstop negotiations up until the bill’s passage. Last week, committees held marathon markups, with some lasting over 24 hours. In the final stretch, Trump came to Capitol Hill Wednesday to pressure remaining moderate and conservative holdouts.
After an all-night session, the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” narrowly passed, 215-214, just before 7 a.m. Thursday. The bill’s name came from Trump, who wanted Congress to pass a wide array of priorities all at once instead of breaking them up into separate packages. Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., touted sticking with the swift timeline of passing the bill out of the House before Memorial Day weekend.
“The reason we did that was not because out of pride of authorship or because we were trying to raise some banner. We did it because we need to get this relief to the American people as soon as possible,” Johnson said during a press conference after the bill passed. “President Trump made these promises on the campaign trail, and we did as well. The time table’s important. The sooner they feel that relief, the better.”
The legislation, among many other things, extends the tax cuts passed in 2017 during Trump’s first term. Those expire at the end of the year if they’re not renewed. As the bill stands, some of the relief would be immediate but temporary, while some of the spending cuts and proposed work requirements would kick in a few years later.
Democrats, meanwhile, are fiercely opposed to the legislation, arguing it would benefit wealthier Americans and big businesses at the expense of safety net programs that would see significant cuts. They also point out that it would add to the national debt.
“While you slept, Republicans robbed you,” U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, said in a statement. “In the dead of night, House Republicans passed legislation that hands over a trillion dollars in tax cuts to billionaires and the biggest corporations while gutting the very programs that help everyday Americans survive.”
The reconciliation bill could also have a significant impact on states and their own budgets as the federal government seeks to shift more costs over to them. If enacted, Connecticut could be on the hook for the first time ever in helping to cover the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.
That has Connecticut preparing for what’s to come, with the possibility of wide-ranging cuts to federal funding as well as new cost-sharing plans in the tax bill.
“Congress should be working on a budget that strengthens our nation and lowers costs, but instead, the bill passed by House Republicans overnight does the exact opposite — it explodes the national debt and imposes deep cuts to Medicaid and food assistance that will devastate millions of Americans, including thousands of Connecticut families,” Gov. Ned Lamont said in a statement Thursday.
All of these provisions, however, are subject to change as the bill makes its way to the upper chamber. Senators will go through their own process to see what can remain in the bill and can tweak it through an all-night amendments process. The House and Senate would need to work out any differences that emerge and pass it again. The party wants to get it to Trump for his signature by the July 4 holiday.
Republicans are leaning on a process known as budget reconciliation to avoid the 60-vote threshold normally required to advance legislation in the Senate. This will allow them to bypass a filibuster and pass a bill without needing support from Democrats. Both of Connecticut’s senators, Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, are opposed.
“I encouraged our Senate colleagues to think of this as a one-team effort as we have and to modify this as little as possible, because it’ll make it easier for us to get it over the line ultimately and finished and get it to the president’s desk by July 4, and that’s a big thing,” Johnson said.
A look inside the bill
On the tax front, the legislation extends the expiring tax cuts for individuals and businesses and adds in a number of Trump’s campaign promises. That includes no taxes on tips, overtime and interest on some auto loans. But those exemptions would only last until 2028, which coincides with the end of his second term.
Seniors who are 65 and older with low to middle incomes will be able to make an additional $4,000 deduction. And the bill would create new savings accounts for children — called a “Trump Account” — with a one-time infusion of $1,000 from the federal government.
One of the biggest sticking points during negotiations was over raising the cap on deductions for state and local taxes, otherwise known as SALT. Blue-state Republicans were pushing for bigger concessions on SALT because of its effect on high cost-of-living states like Connecticut, New York and California.
While Connecticut Democrats aren’t supportive of the GOP bill, they have pushed to lift the cap in the past. Under the 2017 Trump tax law, SALT deductions were capped at $10,000 for filers who itemize deductions.
The original offer increased the cap to $30,000. When Trump came to Capitol Hill, he told moderate Republicans to take the deal, arguing that SALT benefits Democratic-led states. But they were able to negotiate new terms: a $40,000 cap for married couples, which would get phased out for those making over $500,000. Both caps would increase by 1% through 2033.
In 2022, Connecticut taxpayers had the highest average SALT deduction, around $9,100, just under the current $10,000 cap, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That year, over 11% of the state’s returns claimed SALT, one of the highest rates in the U.S.
The $2,000 maximum federal child tax credit is also set to expire at the end of the year without any action. Under this bill, it would get a modest boost, albeit temporary.
Through 2028, it would increase to $2,500. After that, it would go back down to $2,000 and be indexed for inflation. 
Democrats like DeLauro have pushed for the restoration of the expanded child tax credit included in the 2021 pandemic relief bill, which has since expired. That enhancement increased the rebate up to $3,600 per child under age 6 and $3,000 per child between 6 to 18 and was fully refundable.
Critics of the GOP bill say it disadvantages the lowest-income families who don’t owe federal taxes and can’t claim the full credit. The proposal also requires parents who file taxes jointly to both have Social Security numbers.
The legislation would also give a significant bump in spending for defense and border security. That includes more money for the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as well as new border patrol agents and workers at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The bill also includes a $1,000 fee for migrants applying to seek asylum.
And on energy policy, the bill would end clean energy-related tax breaks that would be in place for years through former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included credits for electric vehicles and energy-efficient home appliances.
Bill could overhaul Medicaid, SNAP
To pay for the legislation, Republicans have proposed generating billions of dollars in savings by making steep cuts to programs like Medicaid and SNAP.
Republicans say they are seeking changes to these programs to root out waste, fraud and abuse and ensure that those who need it are covered. But Democrats and advocates of these programs are raising concerns that an overhaul could leave out vulnerable individuals and families who rely on the programs.
Changes to Medicaid have been the biggest obstacle, in terms of both policy and politics, throughout the negotiations of this bill and the requirement to cut $880 billion from a number of programs.
The bill would require 80 hours of work, volunteer or educational requirements a month for certain enrollees and freeze the hospital tax, a mechanism that enables states to increase the amount of Medicaid funding they receive from the federal government.
Medicaid, known as HUSKY in Connecticut, covers about 1 million people, or about 25% of the state’s population, according to the Department of Social Services. The state’s Office of Policy and Management projects Connecticut will spend a total of $11.6 billion on Medicaid this fiscal year. The federal government contributed roughly $6.9 billion, or 59%, of that funding.
“In eastern Connecticut, I’ve heard directly from hospitals, nursing homes, and community health centers about the real-life impacts of this bill’s cuts to Medicaid,” U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd, said in a statement. “Non-partisan budget analysts determined that 13 million Americans will lose their health coverage. Locally, thousands of people in Connecticut’s 2nd District will become uninsured, which will hurt our hospitals and primary health networks, too.”
The GOP measure would also significantly restructure SNAP and place a new financial commitment on states. The federal government has always fully covered benefits and shares the administrative costs of running the program equally with each state. Under the new proposal, Congress would institute a cost-sharing program with states and increase state contributions for administrative expenses to 75%.
The new expectations that states may need to start covering benefits in 2028 could place a new burden on Connecticut’s finances and state budget. State officials don’t yet know how exactly that might affect the administration of the program but anticipate that a “redesign” is inevitable if the state cannot cover the costs, according to state Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves.
In Connecticut, nearly 400,000 people, or 1 in 9 state residents, got those benefits in 2024, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. More than half of the recipients in the state are in families with children. That same year, Connecticut received a total of $885 million in SNAP benefits.
The GOP plan would also impose stronger work requirements for certain able-bodied adults without dependents. For older adults, it would raise the age limit from 54 to 64. The same would also apply to adults with children age 7 or older. They would be required to work or participate in related training for at least 80 hours a month.
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, estimated that if Connecticut takes on the cost of covering 10% of the state’s SNAP benefits, it would need to spend $89 million. But that percentage would likely be higher based on an analysis from the GOP-led House Agriculture Committee. Based on 2023 error rate data, the committee estimates Connecticut’s cost-share would be 20%.
“It pushes enormous costs onto already financially strapped state governments, forcing them into impossible choices between cutting essential services like public safety and education, raising taxes, or most likely, slashing food benefits for their residents,” said Hayes, who is ranking member of the Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition, Foreign Agriculture, and Horticulture.
“As Connecticut food banks, already struggling to meet the current demand that saw them distribute an estimated 46 million meals last year, have made clear,” she continued, “any reduction in food assistance, especially with persistently higher grocery prices, will lead to more families facing hunger. They simply lack the resources to fill the gap created by these federal cuts.”

But that is likely where the effort will end given that Democrats control the Michigan Senate and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s steadfast support for the LGBTQ+ community.
The House voted to advance House Bill 4066 and House Bill 4469, sponsored by Rep. Jason Woolford (R-Howell) and Rep. Rylee Linting (R-Wyandotte), respectively. 
HB 4066 passed 58-46, with all Republican members of the House voting in favor of the bill. HB 4469 passed 59-45, with Democratic Rep. Amos O’Neal (D-Saginaw) jumping sides to join Republicans in advancing the legislation.

The bills would collectively ban transgender girls from joining interscholastic girls’ sports and would protect schools from legal liability for excluding transgender girls, as well as amend the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to greenlight the move in statute.
Multiple Republicans rose to support the package, including controversial Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford). He claimed there was a commonsense motive for the bill, alleging without evidence that there were “B-team boys sports players” who “jump over to the A-team girls team” and were disrupting the fabric of school sports in Michigan. His wife was a soccer player throughout her collegiate career, and he said she helped “counsel” him on his vote for the bill.
While the Michigan High School Athletic Association has a policy allowing transgender girls to play sports on girls teams on a case by case basis with a waiver, association officials say very few high school students inquire about or utilize it. The MHSAA previously told lawmakers there are typically two inquiries each year out of about 180,000 athletes.

Additionally, Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Qunicy) said that the bills mirror the conservative religious belief that men are men and women are women, basing that belief on the tenets of the Christian Bible. She also said that girls would have no way to reasonably compete if “biological men” were allowed to be included in girls’ sports, and that it was a matter of women’s civil rights.
Several Democrats rose to speak against the bills, including Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), a former teacher and girls and boys cross country coach, who said these bills stand to ostracize a community that is already subject to bullying and increased risk of youth suicide.
Koleszar said he recently visited the high school he taught in, and was able to speak with a coach there. The representative was asked if the House was still considering its ban on transgender inclusion in school sports. When he told the coach that it was likely coming up for a vote this week, the coach told Koleszar that his colleagues should “stop wasting your time and do things that actually help us.”
“I can’t agree more,” Koleszar said. “Multiple studies have shown us that the transgender community is at a dramatically increased risk of suicide. This legislation will further isolate and ostracize a group of children and adolescents that are at an already increased risk of suicide. Make no mistake, this legislation and the rhetoric that surrounds it could get somebody killed.”
Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) said the bills move the state backward, and questioned the civil rights aspect of the bills considering they aimed to dismantle the civil rights of an entire community.
“These bills tell the children of our state that some can have civil rights, but not all,” Rheingans said.
Equality Michigan decried the vote in a news release, which condemned House Republicans and highlighted the fact that O’Neal voted in favor of the ELCRA rewrite.
“Kids shouldn’t have to worry about opposing team’s coaches, fans, or politicians requiring them to prove their gender just because they look tall, have short hair or broad shoulders, or because they have a good serve,” said Erin Knott, executive director of Equality Michigan, in a statement. “The MHSAA has already said there are zero trans girls with waivers to compete in winter and spring sports right now. But that isn’t stopping 59 Michigan Representatives from playing dangerous political games that hurt Michigan families.”
Knott said her organization was calling on the Legislature to take up commonsense legislation that supports the safety and well-being of all Michiganders – like providing funds for free school meals, protections against gun violence and tax credits for working parents – instead of subjecting young athletes to gender inspections.
“[The bills] will now head to the Michigan Senate, but they are unlikely to pass,” Knott said. “In the meantime, EQMI will continue to advocate for the rights of transgender students and their families in our state. Full stop.”

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)A federal court hearing held Thursday to determine the fate of Florida’s strict new law on ballot initiatives veered into culinary criticism as an attorney compared the measure to “sausage.”
 Attorneys for the DeSantis administration insisted that sausage is edible while those on the other side called it “rancid.”
Florida legislators passed the law after citizens’ initiatives to allow abortion and recreational pot nearly passed last November. Critics contend that the new law — with all of its restrictions on groups and who can collect signatures — will make it nearly impossible for outside organizations to ever place an initiative on the ballot in the future.
Groups have challenged the new law — which was a top priority for Gov. Ron DeSantis — on grounds that it violates their rights to free speech and due process.
During the hearing, Chief U.S. District Judge Mark Walker listened to about three hours of testimony on Florida Decides Healthcare’s and Smart & Safe Florida’s request that he block certain provisions of the law while the legal challenge moves ahead — including a requirement that sponsors turn in completed petitions within 10 days after the voter signs the petition, as well as stepped up fines and criminal penalties.
Walker, who posed pointed questions to both sides, asked everyone to “please be patient,” as he considers his ruling.
Florida Decides is behind a campaign to put a Medicaid expansion on the ballot in November 2026. Smart & Safe Florida is behind a renewed initiative to make recreational marijuana legal for adults in Florida. 
Both groups need to collect and certify 880,000 voter signatures before Feb. 1 of next year to make the November 2026 ballot.

Tallahassee attorney Glenn Burhans Jr. said that, prior to the new law taking effect, Smart & Safe Florida was collecting 78,000 signatures per week. Since the law took effect, he said, the group is collecting between 12,000 and 15,000 signatures per week.
He said that 1,100 petition circulators who were out in the field have been “lost” due to the law with its felony penalties.
“That places the ability to get this on the ballot in peril,” he said.
Burhans noted that the law not only condenses the time to submit a petition, it doesn’t allow for the period to be extended to account for office closures or holidays — the Legislature, he noted, rejected such extensions. That means petition collectors could have as little as seven days to turn in the forms, he said. 
Burhans used the coming Memorial Day Weekend as an example, noting that supervisors of elections offices will be closed from May 24-27. If Smart& Safe Florida collected 1,700 signatures on May 16 but didn’t deliver them before an office closed, it could face fines of upward of $255,000 ($85,000 a day times three days).
“Your honor, that’s real life. That’s impact,” he said. 
Tallahassee attorney Mohammad Jazil, representing Secretary of State Cord Byrd, said that the timeline was condensed from 30 days to 10 days to give the supervisors of elections more time to review the petitions and sniff out fraudulent forms.  
The state intends to keep language in its rules and regulations that would allow sponsors to deliver petitions outside the 10-day time frame for holidays and office closures, Jazil said.
Is the sausage edible or rancid?
Walker pressed Jazil on some points, such as what constitutes personal identifying information that must be placed on the petitions. Jazil defended HB 1205 and at one point noted that legislation being made was like watching sausage get made — a famously distasteful process. Jazil joked that this sausage, HB 1205, was edible.
“Sometimes the sausage aren’t real tasty, that’s why we have challenges here,” Walker replied.
In his rebuttal, Burhans said the law bans supervisors from reviewing ballots between July 1 and September 1. That, he said, doesn’t give supervisors more time, but instead creates a 90-day log jam. 
Additionally, Burhans stressed that HB 1205 specifically removed language from statute allowing for extensions for holidays and office closures. Agencies cannot promulgate rules contrary to law, he said.
“The sausage is not only bad, it’s rancid and filled with maggots,” Burhans said.
Mitch Emerson, executive director of Florida Decides Healthcare, told reporters following the hearing that he was optimistic.
“We had the opportunity to make it very clear why this law is unconstitutional and un-American. This isn’t just about one campaign. It’s about protecting every Floridian’s right,” he said. Blocking the law, he continued, would return the state to the existing rules that petition gathers have relied on for years.
 “This means giving people back the ability to organize, gather signatures, and bring issues directly to the ballot without fear, confusion.”

File photos by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe Vermont Supreme Court is weighing in on a rare case in which one elected statewide office holder filed a lawsuit against another.State Auditor Doug Hoffer, a Democrat/Progressive, filed a lawsuit against Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark, a Democrat, and her office more than a year ago.In the legal action, Hoffer contended that the Attorney General’s Office had failed to provide him with legal opinions that he sought while the Auditor’s Office was conducting an audit related to the city of Burlington. The attorney general’s office is statutorily required to provide legal advice to public officials.Hoffer also requested that the judge permit him to hire an outside attorney for the lawsuit. Clark had challenged Hoffer’s claims, and was granted dismissal of Hoffer’s lawsuit in Chittenden County Superior civil court in Burlington where it was first filed. Hoffer later refiled the case in Washington County Superior civil court in Montpelier where it was again dismissed. In the case brought in Washington County, Judge Timothy Tomasi also denied a request by Hoffer that the state pay more than $100,000 in attorney fees racked up by his lawyer in both cases, Matthew Byrne, and Byrne’s firm, Gravel & Shea. Hoffer appealed the matters to the Vermont Supreme Court, prompting a hearing Wednesday where attorneys for both offices presented competing arguments. “Right now, the office of the auditor cannot do its job,” Byrne said as he began his arguments to the justices.READ MORE
“The attorney general has said that it will no longer respond to any request for legal advice from the auditor,” Byrne added. “The attorney general has also taken the position that the auditor cannot challenge that position in court. Those decisions cannot stand.” Byrne pointed to state law, which states that “the Attorney General shall advise the elective and appointive State officers on questions of law relating to their official duties and shall furnish a written opinion on such matters, when so requested.” “The language of the statute is ‘shall’ and it is mandatory, so the AG has no discretion about whether to issue an opinion,” Byrne argued.The dispute arose when Hoffer’s office sought legal opinions from the attorney general’s office on three questions related to an audit of a Burlington tax increment financing project, also known as a TIF.The attorney general’s office, Bryne told the justices, “has conceded that it has not answered the first two questions.”Justice Karen Carroll then interjected.“She explained why she wasn’t answering the questions — because other groups in Vermont are the ones that make those decisions about that TIF issue,” Carroll said to Byrne, asking him, “Isn’t that advice to the auditor?”Byrne replied that the response from the attorney general’s office still did not answer two of the three questions for which the auditor’s office requested legal advice.“The statute says that they shall answer the questions of law and shall furnish a written opinion on such matters,” Byrne said.Justice Nancy Waples then replied to Byrne that the attorney general appeared to have referred the auditor’s office to other state entities on the two other questions. “Under the statute the attorney general has to advise or give advice,” Waples said to Byrne. “Doesn’t mean you have to like it, right? And maybe that’s the issue here.”Jonathan Rose, a lawyer in the attorney general’s office, said during his argument that it was an “unusual case” but not necessarily a complex one.The attorney general’s office did respond to three questions from the auditor’s office, he said. For two of the questions, though, staff referred the auditor’s office to administrative state agencies responsible for implementing TIF law. Rose said, in response to a question from Waples, that there were checks on the attorney general when it came to whether the office was meeting its statutory requirements.“We have two elected officials. If we allowed one elected official to sue the other one every time the first one thought the second one wasn’t doing their job properly, that wouldn’t be a very efficient recipe for government,” Rose said.“The second point is that the attorney general is not without constraints in this situation,” he added. “The first, as I mentioned, is political. If the attorney general is not doing her job, she’ll presumably be held accountable for that through the political process.”Rose also disputed the allegation that the attorney general would no longer provide legal advice to the auditor’s office.  “The attorney general’s response was limited to policy issues which fall under the rationale that those issues should be more appropriately addressed at the administrative agency responsible for them,” Rose said. “The attorney general never said she would stop providing legal advice to the auditor.”The high court took the arguments under advisement and is expected to issue written rulings in the coming weeks.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont Supreme Court hears legal spat between state auditor and Vermont attorney general .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Doug-Hoffer-Charity-Clark-1024x762.png,,,2025-05-22 17:09:36.944096

SPRINGFIELD — A bill creating an interdisciplinary commission to study the interplay between animals, the environment and infectious disease within the Illinois Department of Public Health passed the House unanimously Wednesday.

Senate Bill 291 aims to establish the One Health Commission to aid in communication and collaboration between the state’s physicians, veterinarians, scientific professionals and state agencies on the topics of public health and safety, particularly when it comes to diseases that originate or mutate in animals.

“I think it gives us an advantage so that we have a little bit to be prepared, hopefully there will never be another COVID or another avian flu, but it does give us kind of a leg up in how to plan and how to prepare for that,” bill sponsor Sen. Julie Morrison, D-Lake Forest, told Capitol News Illinois after the bill passed.

The bill’s passage comes after federal action in 2021 and 2023 instructed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to create One Health framework in collaboration with other federal agencies. In February, the CDC launched the National One Health Framework in an effort to protect the people, animals and environment across America from zoonotic diseases, which are viruses or bacteria passed from animals to humans.

Although the term “one health” has been used by scientists since the 1800s, the CDC says it only gained public traction in the 20th century and even more so after the COVID-19 pandemic. Current attention on the issue comes amid concerns about the avian flu, which the IDPH director deemed not an “active risk” in February.

“A One Health approach is important because approximately 60% of known infectious diseases in humans and 75% of emerging infectious diseases originate from animals,” the bill language reads. “Animals can serve as early warning indicators of potential public health threats, and robust agricultural and environmental health systems are integral to public health preparedness and response efforts.”

Two other states have enacted One Health frameworks. After a 2021 Congressional report, New Jersey created a One Health Task Force, and after a 2023 Congressional act, the state of Washington started a One Health Needs Assessment Report.

Some of the issues these One Health frameworks deal with include “zoonotic diseases, neglected tropical diseases, vector-borne diseases, antimicrobial resistance, food safety and food security, environmental contamination,” according to the CDC.

SB291 tasks the One Health Commission with providing feedback and support to state agencies and local governments on zoonotic disease outbreaks in both humans and animals. Also, the bill directs the commission to develop and integrate new reductions of hazards to humans, animals and the environment into current public health strategies.

It will also improve health surveillance tools used by multiple agencies and organizations, as well as provide further education to public health and agricultural health professionals who prescribe antibiotics, including recommending the use of antibiotic alternatives.

Currently, Morrison said agencies and organizations lack the proper communication between their fields that is needed to tackle public health threats. SB291 aims to increase those communications by bringing public health experts together.

One Health Commission members will include the IDPH director, the president of the University of Illinois, the directors of six other state agencies, and the director of Commerce and Economic Opportunity, who will be an advisory, non-voting member. Others on the commission will include two licensed veterinarians, two licensed physicians – one of which must have expertise in infectious diseases surveillance – and four academic experts appointed by the director of IDPH.

Commission members would be unpaid.

Why veterinarians?

“Veterinarians are not just people who take care of dogs,” Morrison said. “We purchase the beef that veterinarians treat and care for. I mean, it's even things like hormones, its antibiotics, it's things that go into the animal population that we then end up consuming one way or the other.”

The commission will provide the General Assembly and governor with a report by Jan.  1, 2028. Among other things, the report will include an assessment of One Health surveillance and response systems as well as policy recommendations to increase public health and safety in the state.

And although the original bill language labeled the congregation of state officials and experts as a “task force,” the bill sponsor changed the language to a “commission” after the House committee hearing in March.

“You know, a task force is usually really short, and it has a report to the General Assembly and then it goes away,” Morrison said. “I think this speaks to a more permanent organization that's going to be put in place.”

SB291 now awaits the governor’s approval to become law after passing both chambers without opposition.

Utility and interconnection officials have cited power-hungry data centers as a major cause of growing demand for electricity. (Photo by George Frey/Getty Images)A Senate panel approved another series of bills meant to reduce the impact of electricity prices that are set to soar on June 1.
The bills, which cleared the Senate Environment and Energy Committee in divided votes Thursday, would raise data centers’ share of electricity costs, boost construction of energy storage, and create an automatic approval process for residential solar projects, among other things.
Environmental groups hailed the data center legislation, which would create a separate rate-setting process within the Board of Public Utilities for data centers with maximum monthly demands of at least 100 megawatts, forcing them to pay for increases in energy costs as a result of data center load.
“This bill would not only provide an incentive for data centers to drive consumption down, but it would also protect ratepayers from shouldering the unfair burden of the cost,” said Jay Weisbond, a policy assistant for the New Jersey League of Conservation Voters.
It would also require rates for data centers to include cost recoveries for transmission or distribution infrastructure needed for their operation. The separate rate-setting process contemplated in the bill would take effect one year after its passage.
Utility and interconnection officials have cited power-hungry data centers as a major cause of the growing demand for electricity.
Electricity prices are spiking as demand that had been largely level for decades surges, and New Jersey’s in-state generation has faced stumbles as offshore wind projects set to deliver thousands of megawatts fail or are blocked by federal regulatory authorities.
Republicans have blamed Gov. Phil Murphy’s wind-heavy renewable energy agenda and the shuttering of existing fossil plants for auction-driven price spikes set to arrive June 1, while Democrats have sought to lay the increases at the feat of PJM Interconnection, the grid operator for New Jersey and 12 other states. Assembly Democrats are particularly anxious about rising utility bills, as all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot this year (Democrats hold a majority in the chamber).
Separate legislation would require quarterly reporting on data centers’ energy and water usage.
Business groups opposed both bills, warning they would push data centers into other states, including those on the same grid as New Jersey,
“We can’t entice data centers to locate in New Jersey if we’re going to continually be putting roadblocks in the way or making it more expensive or problematic to develop here in New Jersey,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
Murphy and legislators have sought to encourage AI development in New Jersey, including through tax credits, hailing it in July 2024 as a “transformative industry that will change lives and grow our economy.”
The state would be better served by boosting electricity supply than by targeting large energy users, Cantor said, adding that manufacturing plants and even hospitals could run similar loads.
Though some suggested expansions, witnesses were broadly supportive of a bill requiring the Board of Public Utilities to procure and incent large-scale energy storage projects, which store energy produced at times of low demand to ease strains on production when demand is high.
Storage projects could start operating in the short term and would more quickly affect prices than other types of generation, they said.
“It doesn’t have to wait in line for PJM Interconnection, which we know takes years. It can be interconnected locally. It can be permitted locally, so it’s the fastest way to build,” said Lyle Rawlings, CEO of Advanced Solar Projects Inc. “These projects, we’re not talking about 2029 or 2030, we’re talking about 2026 that these can be brought online.”
Separate legislation would require the Department of Community Affairs to create an online permitting platform to algorithmically approve residential solar projects. Municipalities could use the platform or set up their own automated solar approval system.
Supporters saw it as another method of quickly standing up new energy supply.
“Local solar can be a critical tool in meeting our energy needs, but only if we need it. While large-scale solar projects are important, they are often facing multi-year delays in the PJM interconnection queue. Local solar, on the other hand, can be rapidly deployed,” said Elowyn Corby, mid-Atlantic regional director of the Vote Solar Action Fund.

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.

“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.

New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.

In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.

Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”

In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-22 19:47:31+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge blocks Trump’s orders to dismantle the Education Department and fire employees,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/22/trump-dismantle-education-department-judge/,A federal judge blocked Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Education Department and ordered it to reinstate employees who were fired.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Thursday blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order to dismantle the Education Department and ordered the agency to reinstate employees who were fired in mass layoffs. The administration said it would challenge the ruling.
U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston granted a preliminary injunction stopping the Trump administration from carrying out plans announced in March that sought to work toward Trump’s goal to shut down the department. It marks a setback to one of the Republican president’s campaign promises.
The ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits that said Trump’s plan amounted to an illegal closure of the Education Department.
One suit was filed by the Somerville and Easthampton school districts in Massachusetts along with the American Federation of Teachers and other education groups. The other suit was filed by a coalition of 21 Democratic attorneys general.
The suits argued that layoffs left the department unable to carry out responsibilities required by Congress, including duties to support special education, distribute financial aid and enforce civil rights laws.
In his order, Joun said the plaintiffs painted a “stark picture of the irreparable harm that will result from financial uncertainty and delay, impeded access to vital knowledge on which students and educators rely, and loss of essential services for America’s most vulnerable student populations.”
Layoffs of that scale, he added, “will likely cripple the Department. The idea that Defendants’ actions are merely a ‘reorganization’ is plainly not true.”
Hours later, the Trump administration appealed the ruling.
“Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” spokesperson Madi Biedermann said in a statement.
Joun ordered the Education Department to reinstate federal workers who were terminated as part of the March 11 layoff announcement.
That announcement led to the firing of about 1,300 people. Some Education Department employees have left through buyout offers and the termination of probationary employees, which combined with the layoffs have reduced the staff to roughly half the 4,100 the department had when Trump took office.
“Today’s order means that the Trump administration’s disastrous mass firings of career civil servants are blocked while this wildly disruptive and unlawful agency action is litigated,” said Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, which represents plaintiffs in the Somerville case.
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, called the decision “a first step to reverse this war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity.”
The administration has said the layoffs are aimed at efficiency, not a department shutdown. Trump has called for the closure of the agency but recognizes it must be carried out by Congress, the government said.
The administration said restructuring the agency “may impact certain services until the reorganization is finished” but it’s committed to fulfilling its statutory requirements.

(Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)The chief justice of the Nevada Supreme Court on Thursday announced plans to pursue the creation of a dedicated business court, saying a resolution currently under consideration by the state legislature is not necessary.
Chief Justice Douglas Herndon intends to file a petition next month with the Nevada Supreme Court to approve the creation of a Commission to Study the Adjudication of Business Law, according to a media release. That commission will work out specific details, like how judges will be selected for the business court.
The expectation is that the dedicated business court will be operational “within a year.”
Why some think Nevada should challenge Delaware as premier destination for corporate lawsuits

Herndon’s announcement comes on the heels of Assembly Joint Resolution 8, a proposal to amend the Nevada State Constitution to establish a dedicated business court. That resolution passed the full Assembly last month and needs to pass the full Senate by Friday or be declared dead. Then, AJR8 would have to pass the 2027 Legislature before appearing before voters in the 2028 general election for final approval.
Herndon in a statement said the court has been “closely following” legislative discussions on AJR8.
“I’m confident that within our own court system we can enhance our existing approach to business law cases and create a dedicated court where district court judges hear only business cases and do it without any additional fiscal impact on the state,” he said. “In addition, we can address the timeliness and efficiency of judicial review of business cases, eliminate the need to amend the constitution and the uncertainty associated with waiting years to see if the resolution gets approved.”

(Photo by Chris McGrath/Getty Images)A federal judge has denied Florida’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit against a 2021 law punishing social media platforms for alleged censorship of conservatives.
U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle of the Northern District of Florida issued an order Thursday denying the state’s motions to toss the suit brought by two trade associations representing social media giants and to compel those companies to turn over information about their internal policies.
The order came weeks after Hinkle held a hearing in Tallahassee in which he said he’s still perplexed about what the Legislature meant to accomplish by trying to limit social media content moderation. Hinkle wrote that neither the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit nor the U.S. Supreme Court had questioned the plaintiffs’ standing to sue Florida.
NetChoice and co-plaintiff Computer & Communications Industry Association (CCIA) argue that the law violates the First Amendment and is unconstitutionally vague. The two groups represent a number of the biggest social media companies, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Reddit, Apple, and Pinterest.
“Once again, a judge has confirmed the importance of the First Amendment, rejecting Florida’s attempts to evade review of its unconstitutional statute,” wrote Stephanie Joyce, director of CCIA’s Litigation Center, in a press release Thursday. “This law tries to force websites to speak as the state commands, which strikes at the heart of free discourse and democracy. We now move forward with demonstrating why this law must be struck down.”
Hinkle is revisiting the case after the country’s highest court punted it back to the Eleventh Circuit because the justices found that the appellate court had not conducted a proper analysis of the groups’ First Amendment challenges, which in turn sent the case back to Hinkle.
Trump’s banishment
The law the Legislature passed following then-former President Donald Trump’s banishment from social media platforms after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol prohibits deplatforming any candidate for statewide political office. Additionally, SB 7072 granted the Florida Election Commission authority to fine platforms with gross revenues of more than $100 million or more than 100 million monthly users $250,000 per day for banning statewide candidates and $25,000 per day for candidates for other offices.
In his order Thursday, Hinkle wrote that provisions in the law, such as one banning platforms from placing candidates’ posts or posts about them in a less prominent position, would give candidates a statutory right to flood users’ feeds.
“The defendants have not attempted to explain what these provisions really mean or how they would be applied. Nor have the defendants offered any theory under which a state can preclude this kind of curating without violating the First Amendment,” Hinkle wrote.
Still, Hinkle, who originally issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the law, leaned toward a belief that provisions of the law are unconstitutional as applied to some of the companies rather than considering the law unconstitutional on its face. He used that reasoning to deny the state’s motion to force the plaintiffs to turn over more information about specific companies.
“The plaintiffs’ facial challenge to SB 7072, and perhaps even to its various provisions viewed in isolation, is likely to fail — and the disputed discovery, if allowed, would almost surely make no difference,” Hinkle wrote.

(Photo by Getty Images) A Scott County man has reached an out-of-court settlement with the former employer he accused of firing him for wearing Christian-themed T-shirts to work in response to the company’s endorsement of Pride Month.
In June 2024, Cosby “Corey” Cunningham sued Eaton Corp., a global power management company with a Davenport office, in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, alleging violations of his civil rights.
Cunningham, a self-described born-again, church-going Christian, was hired by Eaton in 2019 as a quality manager with responsibilities for product development related to military and aerospace activity.

According to his lawsuit, Eaton initiated a “Pride Month ceremony” on June 2, 2023, by raising a pride flag in front of its main building and encouraging employees to wear specific colors in support of the effort. Management also sent out emails to the staff offering pride-themed T-shirts for workers to purchase, the lawsuit claims.
That day, Cunningham alleges, he began wearing T-shirts at work that displayed or referred to Bible verses. According to the lawsuit, he did this to “express his sincerely held religious belief in Jesus Christ and the Bible.”
One shirt read, “Pride goes before destruction, an arrogant spirit before a fall. Proverbs 16:18.” Another shirt read, “Taking back the rainbow. Genesis 9:13.” A third read, “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. James 4:6.”
Over the next eight weeks, Eaton managers allegedly held a series of meetings with Cunningham to express their concern that his actions were perceived by others as inflammatory and that they might violate company policy.
According to the lawsuit, management refused Cunningham’s requests for a religious accommodation to wear the T-shirts, threatened him with dismissal, and sent him home on at least two occasions for refusing to stop wearing the shirts. On Aug. 23, 2023, the company fired Cunningham, the lawsuit alleges.
In his lawsuit, Cunningham stated that he believes “homosexual conduct is sinful” and that he had been called upon to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others. Doing so, he claimed, required him to share with others even those biblical teachings that are offensive to those who don’t share such beliefs.
In its response to those claims, lawyers for the Eaton Corp. argued Cunningham was not entitled to any damages because any actions taken by the company against him “were legitimate and non-discriminatory and non-retaliatory,” and were based on legitimate business reasons.
In his lawsuit, Cunningham was represented by Robert Anderson of Atlantic, an attorney for the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative organization that said it works to promote religious freedom and parental rights. The Southern Poverty Law Center has characterized the Pacific Justice Institute as “an anti-LGBT hate group” whose founder has “compared legalized gay marriage to Hitler and the Nazis’ ascent in Germany.”
Anderson said Thursday he’s not at liberty to comment on the specifics of the settlement that was reached last month. Attorneys for the Eaton Corp. did not respond immediately to requests for comment on the matter.

As President Trump seeks to fast-track uranium mines in the Southwest, experts said a robust state review processwill stand in the way. (Photo by Jack Delano via Library of Congress website)Recent federal activity suggests the Trump administration has two long-stalled uranium mines near New Mexico’s Mount Taylor on its radar.
Earlier this month, a federal infrastructure agency included Roca Honda and La Jara Mesa uranium mines on a new list of 20 projects nationally that advance “the President’s directive to take immediate action to facilitate domestic production of America’s vast mineral resources,” according to a statement from the council.
Then last week, the U.S. Interior Department announced that a proposed uranium mine in Utah would be subject to only a 14-day federal review period, shortening what is commonly a years-long process.
Source New Mexico spoke with state officials, outside experts and longtime anti-uranium advocates about what defense New Mexico will have against the federal government’s efforts to restart uranium mining here for the first time in 50 years. While experts said hard-fought cultural protections are unlikely to present much of an obstacle, they expressed confidence that state regulations will hold up against federal encroachment.

“I think that the realities weigh against the administration’s ignorant and uninformed policies that suggest to the public that these kinds of projects will happen overnight,” said Christopher Shuey, a public health researcher closely monitoring uranium developments here. “They won’t.”
 Holding the line

Private companies have sought to develop the La Jara Mesa and Roca Honda mines for more than a decade, though interest heated up with Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production. Soon after, Cibola National Forest leaders named both mines priority projects, and then uranium company Energy Fuels then struck a controversial deal with the Navajo Nation that would allow it to transport ore from Roca Honda across the reservation. Meanwhile, Laramide Resources indicated on its state permitting application a desire to expedite the next step of its La Jara Mesa project.
DJ Ennis, program manager for the state’s Mining Act Reclamation Program, confirmed to Source NM there’s been a “renewed interest” from uranium mining companies seeking to break ground in New Mexico.
But even if the federal government tries to fast-track mining here, Ennis said the state will take its time and fully review both mine proposals, which it is empowered to do under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act, and in lieu of a federal law.
Trump administration expedites permitting for Utah uranium mine to a two-week process

“The feds are going to do what the feds are going to do,” Ennis told Source. “It does affect us, in that it would be good if the state and the feds were on the same pace and page of permitting. But if that is not the case, the default then becomes the state’s permitting process, and we have a robust permitting process.”
At the federal level, new uranium mines are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which Trump’s recent orders have accelerated. But that has no bearing on the state’s ongoing review, Ennis said.
If it came down to it, Ennis said, the state could issue daily fines and potentially even deploy state police officers to stop uranium extraction at the Roca Honda or La Jara Mesa sites if the companies did so without a state permit.
So if Trump were to order a truncated federal review of the La Jara Mesa mine like he did the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah last week, and then the Forest Service issued a rushed environmental impact statement that selected its preferred alternative of extracting uranium, and then company proceeded to break ground, the state would step in and stop it, Ennis said.
“I’m not sure what that looks like, if it involves state police to enforce the order or courts,” Ennis said. “But it is a state law that we are enforcing.”
Eric Jantz, attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, said the state’s permit review should offer the public some reassurance that nothing will happen immediately. He also suggested that his organization would consider suing if the federal government sought to fast-track New Mexico uranium mines.
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

“I suspect that if the Forest Service either ignores its obligations under NEPA because of this executive order or its own regulations, that litigation will probably ensue,” he said.
That’s because, Jantz said, he sees little basis for an “energy emergency” that Trump claims is the reason to fast-track the mines.
“If there’s one thing to impart, it’s that this whole notion of premising expedited environmental reviews on some sort of emergency is preposterous,” he said. “No emergency exists, and there’s no reason why the usual environmental reviews can’t continue.”


 What will TCP designation mean?

While experts and observers expressed confidence in the state’s capacity to hold off a federal push to expedite mining, they said it remains unclear whether efforts by local Indigenous tribes and pueblos to protect Mount Taylor as a cultural and religious site will add another layer of protection.
In 2007, as several mining companies moved forward with plans to extract uranium from the Mount Taylor area, five tribes made the unusual step of sharing stories about their ancestral and spiritual connections to the mountain. 
That rare disclosure of tribal creation myths marked an early milestone in a multi-year battle to create a 400,000-acre Traditional Cultural Property, drawing a line around Mount Taylor recognized by the state of New Mexico. Among other things, the designation aimed to give Indigenous people a voice in opposing uranium or other mining interests. After mining companies sued in 2009, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the designation should stay intact.
Since then, the  pueblos have maintained opposition, with the All Pueblo Council of Governors in December issuing a resolution to state regulators that “Mount Taylor, known by various traditional names is a sacred landscape, central to the cultural identity, traditional practices, and religious activities of numerous Pueblos and other tribal nations.”
Even though the Navajo Nation agreed to let uranium eventually be transported from Roca Honda across the reservation, it has also long opposed any new mines in the Mount Taylor area, Stephen Etsitty, the Navajo Environmental Protection Agency director, said recently.
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Designation of Mount Taylor as a traditional cultural property has yet to emerge as an issue in the state permitting process, Ennis said. The designation requires federal and state parties to consult with tribes, but a collision awaits between private mining interests and cultural protections, Ennis said.
“The intersection of those two is a difficult question to answer,” he said. “I don’t know that we’ll know until we get to the end of the process.”
Shuey, who has advocated against the mines since 2009 as a researcher with the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the recent federal fast-tracking prompted him and colleagues to review what the TCP designation actually meant for protecting Mount Taylor.
“We’ve been asking this question for the last several weeks,” he said. “My understanding is that the impact of the TCP would be more of a, ‘Pay attention to this site from the standpoint of cultural resources, and make provisions to mitigate any types of impact to cultural resources’ type of thing.”
Even without an outright ban on mining or around the TCP, Shuey said, he expects greenlighting the mines to take years, during which time opponents will watchdog the process.
“A lot of these folks have lived through the 80 years of the uranium legacy. They’ve learned across generations of the impacts of mining,” he said. “And so I think there’s a lot of not only institutional memory but institutional knowhow of evaluating mining proposals and offering intelligent and compelling comments and testimonies.”
He likes their odds against a Trump administration that seems to “not be particularly interested in understanding or knowing the impacts of mining,” he said, but instead has a “weird, visceral notion that we just need more of these minerals for a variety of purposes, and we’re going to go get them.”

May 21, 2025 | ScreenshotMichigan’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Wednesday evening that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives’ budget bill – which passed Thursday morning – would have disastrous consequences for 2.6 million Michiganders.
The dire message came during a virtual press call organized by the Democratic Governors Association on Wednesday. Whitmer was joined by Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
The call was meant to highlight the potentially damaging effects of making deep cuts to Medicaid, which has been a part of ongoing negotiations among Republican appropriators in the U.S. House of Representatives. Each member of Michigan’s Republican congressional delegation voted for the bill, while the Democratic members of the delegation voted against it.
Whitmer said that among the 2.6 million Michiganders who could lose access to their coverage if the cuts go through, nearly one million were children.

“They’re our neighbors. They’re people who are battling cancer, veterans who served our country, who are disabled, the family next door, and the GOP is rushing to terminate Medicaid coverage for millions of Americans as fast as possible,” Whitmer said. “They don’t want us to see all that is contained in that bill, and blasting through these cuts is going to hurt those who can least afford care, and won’t do anything to lower our health care costs. In fact, they’ll rise for everyone.”
Whitmer said the Republican U.S. House budget currently in the works would make some of the largest cuts to Medicaid in the country’s history. She added that the cuts would cause providers to close their doors, a potential lack of available rural health care and a reduction in the quality of medical service in Michigan – on top of the possibility of terminated coverage for children and post-partum women.
“Make no mistake, families in Michigan and all across the country are going to feel the effects of this bill in our day-to-day lives,” Whitmer said. “I’m talking to Michiganders every day. I’m hearing their stories. … We should be working across the aisle to make health care better and easier to afford, kind of like we’ve done here in Michigan.”
Whitmer touted the bipartisan effort to enact the Healthy Michigan Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act, which expanded Medicaid to more than a million people. Last year, the state also codified portions of the Affordable Care Act into Michigan.
“We wanted to protect Michiganders with pre-existing conditions and let kids stay on their parents’ insurance until they’re 26, and we wanted to guarantee essential services and insurance plans,” she said.
If Republicans in Congress truly wanted to see improvements in health costs and help for more families to get coverage, Whitmer said she was all for it and was willing to work with them. But that’s not what the budget bill does, she noted.
“It does the opposite,” Whitmer said. “Families in my state and all across the country are going to pay the price for it, and that’s why we’re together, united, fighting for the people in our country and our ability to get health care.”
Whitmer was asked about U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Township), one of the front runners on the Michigan Republican side of the 2026 gubernatorial race to replace her. James voted to move the bill out of committee and voted for the bill on Thursday. The congressman has been steadfast in his belief that the bill and its cuts to Medicaid would help reduce fraud, waste and abuse.
Michigan’s governor was asked if voters from her state were willing to accept that argument.
Whitmer said that she worked with Republican former Gov. Rick Snyder to expand the state’s Medicaid program when she was the Michigan Senate minority leader before running for governor herself. She said Snyder, a self-professed “nerd” for details, understood the math involved and what it meant to have access to these types of programs.
“It motivated him to work across the aisle. Almost a million people in Michigan got health care because of that work,” Whitmer said. “It is shocking to me that we are in this moment where if there was one [Republican] congressperson with a backbone from each of our four states, they could single handedly stop this from happening by working together.”
In that vein, she called on James to stand up to his caucus and be a hero.
“He says he wants my job. Well, you know what? I guarantee he doesn’t want it if he’s throwing 700,000 people off of health care in the state, running hospitals into the ground,” Whitmer said. “He could be a hero here. … Michiganders expect and want leaders who are going to put their interests first. And so this talking point about fraud, we’re all against fraud; 100 percent of us are against fraud, and we know there’s always more ways that we can help find some savings and make government work better. But that’s not what this bill is all about. This bill is about terminating healthcare for Americans in order to pay for a tax break for the ultra wealthy.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-21-at-4.53.42 PM-1024x666.png,,,2025-05-22 16:06:46.390412

Phil Scott speaks during his weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, May 14. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerMONTPELIER — Vermont Gov. Phil Scott signed lawmakers’ state budget proposal for the 2026 fiscal year into law Wednesday. The plan lays out $9.01 billion in state spending for the yearlong period starting July 1 — and includes a handful of new measures designed to limit the impacts of potential cuts to the state’s federal funding. Scott, a Republican, was notably complimentary of the House and Senate’s budget bill in a letter to legislators that accompanied his signature. Democratic leadership in both chambers, knowing they almost certainly could not override a budget veto this year, trimmed tens of millions of dollars in proposed “base” spending — money expected to be appropriated year-over-year — from the legislation after Scott insisted on cuts. The governor had proposed an $8.99 billion state budget in January.“I appreciate that this budget makes important affordability investments,” Scott wrote, pointing to lawmakers’ use of about $75 million from the state’s general fund that’s expected to help reduce the property tax bills people pay to support education. Scott also complimented how lawmakers set aside about $13 million in the budget to offset a slate of proposed tax credits that would benefit low-income families, workers and veterans, as well as retirees and people receiving military pensions.The credits are included in a separate bill, S.51, over which House and Senate leaders still need to work out their differences in a joint conference committee.While the state budget is typically lawmakers’ last act before adjournment every year, this year, there are still several major bills working their way through the Statehouse that deal with some of the headline issues from last fall’s election. In his letter, the governor urged legislators to pass a version of this year’s landmark education reform bill, H.454. The bill is being debated on the Senate floor Thursday as school district leaders — and a number of senators themselves —  have panned the language that several of the chamber’s committees drafted in recent weeks.Senators were weighing to what extent they should revise their version of the bill to be more in line with what passed out of the House last month. That version appeared to have more support among the members of the Senate’s Democratic majority. Scott has threatened to use his power to summon lawmakers back to the Statehouse if they adjourn for the year without reaching agreement on an education bill. “While not perfect, (the budget bill) makes critical investments in affordability, housing, education and public safety,” the governor wrote Wednesday. “But we must focus on the policy bills that fix what’s broken so the funding can have its intended impact.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Gov.

May 22, 2025 | Screenshot from Kent County's YouTube ChannelGRAND RAPIDS — An ex-Grand Rapids police officer who fatally shot a Black motorist following a 2022 traffic stop will not face a retrial after a first proceeding ended in a mistrial earlier this month.
Kent County Prosecutor Chris Becker announced Thursday that he didn’t think another trial for Christopher Schurr, 34, would produce a new outcome.
“I did not arrive at (the decision) lightly,” Becker said. “Basically, what it boils down to is I don’t think we reach a different verdict if I do do a retrial in this case.”
Schurr was tried for second-degree murder for the shooting death of 26-year-old Patrick Lyoya, a Congolese immigrant.

Over the course of the six-day trial, the jury heard testimony from 22 witnesses, including several experts who gave conflicting testimony on whether Schurr’s decision to use deadly force was justified.
The trial ended May 8 with jurors unable to reach a verdict after deliberating for nearly four days on whether to convict Schurr of second-degree murder, manslaughter or to acquit him.
“This is an extremely difficult decision,” Becker said. “I looked at everything: I looked at our case. I looked at the defense case. I looked at the arguments that were made. I looked at the jury selection process, because I think that’s one of the biggest things that, going into this, we were thinking about getting a good jury. I even went over and watched more of the trial.”
Becker said he spoke to jurors after the trial and said they were evenly split with four wanting to convict, four wanting to acquit and four undecided. As deliberations continued, the vote evolved to 10-2 in favor of acquittal, although Schurr’s attorney, Matt Borgula, has said the it was 11-1 in favor of acquittal after his own discussions with jurors.
“I thought we presented a good case. I presented everything I wanted. All the facts were out there that I had. It’s not like I can change anything,” Becker said.
Schurr pulled Lyoya over on April 4, 2022, for having a license plate that didn’t match the car he was driving. When Lyoya couldn’t produce a driver’s license, Schurr attempted to place him under arrest, but the motorist ran. Schurr tackled Lyoya to the ground and attempted to use his Taser, but was too close and the motorist deflected the probes. The two then wrestled briefly over the device when the officer pulled out his handgun and fatally shot Lyoya in the back of the head.
Schurr was fired from the Grand Rapids Police Department after he was charged in the shooting in June 2022.
Becker said Thursday he spoke with Lyoya’s father, Peter Lyoya, after reaching the decision this week.
“Obviously, he’s very disappointed in that decision. I know there are many members of the community that are disappointed in the decision.”

Attorney Ven Johnson, who represents the Lyoya family, issued a statement shortly after Becker’s announcement Thursday.
“The Lyoya family has not only lost Patrick, but now the hope that former officer Christopher Schurr will ever be held criminally accountable for taking Patrick’s life,” the statement read. “With today’s decision, what was once a pause in justice has now become a permanent reality. This is not a verdict nor the outcome the Lyoya family sought.”
In December 2022, Lyoya’s family filed a $100 million civil lawsuit in federal court against the city of Grand Rapids and Schurr. In August 2023, a judge dismissed the case against the city, but allowed the litigation to proceed against Schurr.
“We will continue to stand with the Lyoya family in their pursuit of truth, accountability and justice for Patrick, and are awaiting our day in civil court,” Johnson said.

Byron Donalds, a GOP candidate for Florida governor, wants to repeal the ""red-flag"" law.Byron Donalds says “job one” for him if elected governor of Florida next year would be the repeal two provisions of the gun-safety package passed by the Florida Legislature following  the shooting massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018.
However, so does Ron DeSantis, and the two measures in question — the state’s “red-flag” law and the ban on individuals under the age of 21 from purchasing a long gun — very much remain the law of the land in Florida.
Donalds appeared Thursday on the Bob Rose Show in Gainesville, where he was asked if he would push for Florida to legalize the open carrying of firearms, another idea the governor has said he supports but which the Legislature has not enacted.
“I would support and push for that, but I think that the bigger thing that we need to get done is really unwinding the red flag laws in our state,” Donalds said.
“When I was in the Legislature, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas bill came through the Legislature. I was a freshman at that time and I opposed that legislation. And I opposed it because I thought that red flag laws really did take away your Fifth Amendment rights as a citizen, and I also felt that there should not be a two-tier system for adults between the ages of 18 and 21.
“I felt that was wrong then, and I still feel that way, so I would tell you that making sure that those two provisions — those constitutional rights are actually restored will probably be job one.”
Formally known as risk-protection orders, the red flag law allows courts to order someone to surrender their firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others. Former Panhandle Republican Joel Rudman filed a measure to repeal that law late last year, but he resigned to run for Congress in January, and his legislation was never picked up by any of his colleagues during this session.

After a bipartisan vote of 31 to 5 in the Senate, the legislation now moves to the House for final passage.
Among its many provisions, the bill would allow the state insurance commissioner to limit rate increases for insurers that have a track record of hiking costs, and fine those that don’t comply with a state law requiring insurers to offer mental health coverage that’s as robust as coverage for medical services.
Sen. Jorge Cabrera, D-Hamden, co-chair of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, said the measure includes changes that residents have been demanding for years. 
“This bill is an attempt to help our constituents all throughout Connecticut navigate an ever complex and moving health care system,” Cabrera said during the floor debate on Wednesday. 
The bill also contains measures directly responding to high-profile public scrutiny of the insurance industry over the past year on issues including prior authorization and proposed time limits on the use of anesthesia. 
Sen. Tony Hwang, R-Fairfield, a ranking member of the Insurance and Real Estate Committee, called the bill “a reflection of compromise” that incorporated feedback on the original draft passed out of committee. The amended version narrowed the scope of certain affordability and prior authorization regulations on the industry.
Susan Halpin, executive director for the CT Association of Health Plans, said she appreciated Cabrera’s willingness to negotiate, even if she doesn’t agree with much of the bill. 
“We appreciate the considerations that were made based upon the feedback we provided, particularly around the fiscal impact of various sections. While the bill still has a lot of problems, it’s certainly better than it was. And like any good compromise, everybody is a little unhappy,” Halpin said.
Affordability, mental health parity 
The package aims to tackle insurance affordability through a provision granting the insurance commissioner power to limit proposed rate increases on state-regulated plans for certain insurance carriers.
Under the bill, beginning January 1, 2027, if an insurer’s rate increases exceed the state’s “cost growth benchmarks” for the previous two consecutive years where data is available, the commissioner can reduce the carrier’s proposed rate increase by up to two percentage points.
Passed first via executive order in January 2020 and adopted by the legislature in 2022, the state’s cost growth benchmarks program requires the Office of Health Strategy to come up with an annual baseline for growing costs of health care. It also requires providers, insurers and others in the industry to report annual price increases.
This year’s insurance omnibus bill also attempts to give some teeth to a 2019 Connecticut law requiring “mental health parity,” meaning insurance providers cannot place greater restrictions on access to mental health services than on surgical or medical care. It also required insurers to submit reports to the state regarding parity.
The bill would allow the Insurance Commissioner to fine insurers up to $625,000 annually for noncompliance with the mental health parity law. It also would require the parity reports submitted by insurers, including the names of each company, to be made public.
Several supporters of the measure said the 2019 legislation didn’t go far enough because it didn’t include sufficient penalties for noncompliance. During a March public hearing on the bill, mental health providers testified they often hear from patients who can’t access treatments they need because payers are less likely to provide adequate coverage for mental health treatment. 
Cabrera said the insurance bill passed on Wednesday would strengthen existing law.
“Mental health parity has been the law in this state for half a decade, but in many instances it’s a law in name only. This bill provides some much-needed bite in instances where insurers are skirting the law to the detriment of our citizens,” Cabrera wrote in a statement following the bill’s passage.
Access to care
Over the past year, the insurance industry has come under strong criticism, and two measures in the bill attempt to rein in some of the practices that have elicited the most public outrage. 
In December 2024, the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson sparked renewed public contempt for prior authorization, the process by which doctors must obtain approval from insurance companies before providing certain services. 
The bill passed by the Connecticut Senate prohibits “step therapy,” a form of prior authorization, for certain diagnoses, including multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
“Step therapy” refers to a strategy used by insurers to contain costs, where patients first try a less expensive treatment option for a given condition before “stepping up” to a more expensive treatment option if the initial treatment is ineffective. Critics say the practice often delays patients’ access to the most effective and appropriate treatments. 
State law already prohibited step therapy for stage 4 metastatic cancer. In addition to multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, the proposal passed by the state Senate would permanently extend an existing law prohibiting step therapy for schizophrenia, major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, which was set to sunset on January 1, 2027.

OKLAHOMA CITY — A deadlocked U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an Oklahoma ruling that struck down the nation’s first religious charter school.
The Court announced Thursday it voted 4-4 with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. It did not disclose how each justice voted, nor did it issue written opinions.
The tied vote affirmed last year’s Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that the concept of a publicly funded Catholic charter school is unconstitutional.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to offer a government-funded online education to students in all parts of the state. St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and operated according to church teachings.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board voted in 2023 to approve opening the school. Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, calling the school unconstitutional and a threat to religious liberty.
Both the school and the statewide board appealed the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up the case and heard oral arguments April 30.
Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board contend charter schools are not truly public schools but rather private entities contracting with the state, who therefore should be free to adopt a religion. Excluding faith-based groups from charter school funding is religious discrimination, they said.
In light of the court’s decision, St. Isidore’s Board of Directors said it will continue exploring other options to deliver a virtual Catholic education for all in Oklahoma.
“Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,” the board stated. “We are disappointed that the Oklahoma State Supreme Court’s decision was upheld in a 4-4 decision without explanation.”
During oral arguments in Washington, D.C., the Court appeared to be divided on the case. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson made their doubts clear on St. Isidore while some of the conservative majority, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, signaled support.
Drummond has long contended the Catholic charter school would create a “slippery slope” toward taxpayers having to fund schools of any religious faith, including belief systems Oklahomans might find objectionable.
“The Supreme Court’s decision represents a resounding victory for religious liberty and for the foundational principles that have guided our nation since its founding,” Drummond said in a statement Thursday.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which dropped the word “virtual” from its name in the year since it appealed the case, issued a statement pledging its commitment to all students and the rule of law.
“The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board respects the Court’s authority and appreciates its willingness to hear complex and deeply significant legal questions,” the board’s statement reads. “The split decision of the court affirms this was indeed a complicated matter with a wide spectrum of views on the appropriate relationship between education, public funding, and religious institutions in our state and country.”
While the attorney general led the legal fight against the school, other Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, advocated for giving religious groups access to charter school funds.

Stitt said the matter is “far from a settled issue.”
“This 4-4 tie is a non-decision,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday. “Now we’re in overtime. There will be another case just like this one and Justice Barrett will break the tie.”
Barrett is a former faculty member of the University of Notre Dame Law School, which aided Catholic officials’ case for the school. She did not participate in the decision to consider the Oklahoma appeal nor did she hear oral arguments.
The court’s deadlock could impact a separate lawsuit challenging St. Isidore in Oklahoma County District Court. That case has been on hold while the Supreme Court appeal was ongoing.
A coalition of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and education advocates filed the lawsuit in 2023 while represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, along with other national legal organizations.
They contend St. Isidore would discriminate against LGBTQ+ students and employees, fail to adequately serve children with disabilities and unlawfully teach religious indoctrination.
Oklahoma City Archdiocese officials said students of all backgrounds and beliefs would have been welcome at St. Isidore. The school promised in its charter contract that it would abide by nondiscrimination laws and other state regulations to the extent that Catholic doctrine permitted.
Americans United is discussing next steps for the Oklahoma County case with the plaintiffs and co-counsel, spokesperson Liz Hayes said.
A religious charter school would be “an abject violation of religious freedom,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United.
“The Supreme Court’s stalemate safeguards public education and upholds the separation of church and state,” Laser said. “Charter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students.”

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A central Iowa dentist involved in an operation that ended with the patient’s death has been fined $7,500 by the Iowa Dental Board.
On April 30, the board entered a final order in the disciplinary case against Jonathan Karch of the Iowa Dental Studio in Johnston. This week, that decision was made public by the board, although some of the contents have been redacted from public view.
The order stipulates that Karch shall not be issued a permit to administer patient sedation until Sept. 13, 2025, and that he shall pay a $7,500 civil penalty and complete some unspecified amount of additional continuing education, with some of that education related to professional ethics. The order also states that should Karch be issued a sedation permit, it will be placed on probationary status for three years during which a practice monitor must be physically present in the treatment room for any sedation procedures handled by Karch.
Last fall, the board issued an emergency order restricting Karch’s practice after a patient who underwent a dental-implant procedure in January 2024 died. The order coincided with a civil lawsuit filed against Karch and others who were involved in the surgery. That lawsuit, filed in Polk County District Court by the family of Joseph Daniels, alleges that on Jan. 26, 2024, the 50-year-old Daniels underwent a dental-implant operation that began at 7:15 a.m. and was completed at 3:15 p.m.
Around 3:30 p.m., paramedics were dispatched to Dental Studio of Iowa with a report of an “unconscious person.” According to the lawsuit, the paramedics arrived at 3:40 p.m. and found Daniels in a dental exam chair “pale, cyanotic, cool and unresponsive.” Daniels was then taken to Iowa Methodist Medical Center where he died at 5:51 p.m.
According to the board’s findings of fact, “R.W.” — identified in other board records as dentist Robert Wolf of Swisher — was the primary surgeon for the procedure, but did not have a sedation permit at the time. Karch did have a sedation permit but, by all accounts, he was only in the operatory sporadically and spent most of the time 10 to 15 feet away in an adjacent room working on the fabrication of temporary implants.
Wolf “nevertheless proceeded with the surgery, with a certified registered nurse anesthetist contracted by The Dental Studio of Iowa to administer and monitor” the sedation, the board determined.
Karch argued before the board that state regulations require a “dentist” and not a “permit holder” to be present for the entire procedure, and he noted that Wolf was the dentist performing the surgery.
The board rejected that argument, stating that “the rule does not make sense if interpreted to not require the permit holder to remain. In fact, no matter how (the rule) is viewed, its structure and language required a dentist with a sedation permit participating in the dental procedure to remain in the room, which did not occur when Dr. Karch left.” The rule, the board concluded, “required Dr. Karch, as the permit holder, to be present for the entire surgery, which he was not.”
The board added that “while it is true no evidence in the record exists that (Karch’s) presence outside of the surgery suite in a nearby room caused any adverse outcome, it is equally true this rule is critical for providing a high level of safety for patients.”
In its decision and order, the board also noted that Karch had “presented significant evidence about himself, including [redacted from public view] that caused him to be bullied as a child and his efforts to overcome this.”
The board noted that its disciplinary action has no impact on Karch’s general dentist license, as his alleged conduct relates only to his actions as the holder of a sedation permit.
In its decision against Karch, the board stated that a third dentist, publicly identified only by the initials “M.K.,” was present for Daniels’ surgery and assisted with patient care despite not having an Iowa license. The involvement of this third dentist would later become an issue for Wolf.
In September 2024, the Iowa Dental Board notified Wolf that it intended to deny his application for a permit to administer  moderate sedation on patients. At the time, the board alleged that Wolf had participated in the operation that resulted in Daniels’ death and that he had “facilitated the practice of an unlicensed dentist and supervised the administration of anesthesia without having the proper credentials.”
The board document detailing that allegation was made public in error, according to the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, and it has since been pulled from the board’s website. The Iowa Dental Board has not charged Wolf with any wrongdoing in the Daniels case.
The civil lawsuit filed by the Daniels family is scheduled to be tried on Sept. 28, 2026.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/DENTAL-.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

McWhorter, 63, of Awendaw, admitted he took a cash kickback to steer a construction contract to a local businessman for a $35.5 million, rail-served plastic pellets warehouse adjacent to port-owned property.
While the scheme occurred while he was president of the state railroad, the case didn’t come to light until after he retired.
“It was a horrible decision I made, one that I will regret for the rest of my life,” McWhorter tearfully told the court. “This act does not reflect the person I’ve tried so hard to be all my life.”
The U.S. Attorney’s office had sought a prison sentence of between eight and 14 months, saying McWhorter “abused his position of trust” as a public official.
“His conduct was serious, the fraud offense is a serious offense, and a period of incarceration is appropriate,” Bryan Stirling, U.S. Attorney for South Carolina, said in a court document.
However, McWhorter’s friends, family members and business associates said the kickback scheme was out of character for the former police officer turned railroad executive, and they asked the judge in testimony and letters of support for leniency.
In the end, Norton opted for a sentence of supervision rather than incarceration.
“This was a very serious offense,” Norton said. “It’s stealing for the lack of anything else. What he did was a betrayal of everything he stood for his whole life.”
In addition to probation, McWhorter must pay $90,000 in restitution, a $4,000 fine and perform 300 hours of community service. McWhorter has already put the $90,000 in an escrow account for repayment.
Hatching a kickback
Recent court documents and testimony have shed new light on how the kickback scheme took place, outlining who else was involved, how they arranged the fraud and the name of the victimized business. Previously, court documents did not identify the co-conspirators.
Texas-based Frontier Logistics in 2018 was looking for a place near Charleston’s port to build a warehouse where plastic pellets — also known as nurdles — could be transferred from rail cars to cargo containers for export to foreign markets.
Charleston’s port is the East Coast’s busiest export hub for plastic pellets and chemicals, and Frontier has played a key role in the growth of those exports at the Port of Charleston.
Kevin Newkirk, a vice president at Frontier, had discussed the warehouse project with McWhorter because the facility would need railroad access. McWhorter then introduced Newkirk to Tony Berenyi, the founder of Charleston contractor Berenyi Inc., who wanted to build the warehouse.
The three men discussed how the construction contract could be steered to Berenyi.
“At one point, Berenyi offered Newkirk and Jeff a commission on the contract,” court records state. “However, Newkirk decided that a kickback payment was more appropriate and approached Jeff about it.”
Newkirk and McWhorter initially considered asking for a $2 million kickback but later settled on $1 million. Berenyi ultimately agreed to pay the men $420,000, with the money coming from his business profits. McWhorter’s lawyers — Bart Daniel and co-counsel Nathan Williams — stressed no taxpayer money was involved.
Frontier was not aware of the kickback scheme but eventually chose Berenyi to build the warehouse on land it bought from Palmetto Railways.
Berenyi is incarcerated in a federal prison in Florida after a jury found him guilty in 2023 of a similar but unrelated kickback scheme for construction at a Nucor Steel plant in Kentucky. He is scheduled to be released later this year.
Things start to unravel
Newkirk and McWhorter were supposed to split the $420,000 but Berenyi never finished making all of the payments. All told, Newkirk received about $84,000 in addition to the money that went to McWhorter.
Investigators learned of the kickback scheme while investigating Berenyi’s actions in the Kentucky case. That eventually led to charges against Newkirk and McWhorter.
Newkirk was sentenced in April to five years of probation for filing a false federal tax return related to the scheme.
“Unfortunately, this discussion of payment came at a point in Jeff’s life where he was struggling, and that struggle, combined with the opportunity presented to him, was more than he could resist,” McWhorter’s lawyers said in a court document.
“At the time, Jeff was going through a difficult divorce with high attorney’s fees, needed to pay for a daughter’s wedding, and was in the process of having to find a new place to live,” they wrote.
McWhorter, a state employee, was being paid $200,000 a year to lead Palmetto Railways at the time the scheme took place. He also received bonuses in 2020 totaling $133,000.
In 23 letters of support submitted to the court, supporters said McWhorter’s conduct was the opposite of the integrity he had shown throughout his career.
“Jeff’s guilty plea stunned his colleagues throughout South Carolina,” wrote Ron Brinson, a former North Charleston councilman. He added McWhorter’s actions are “so uncharacteristic and inconsistent” with his reputation.
Bobby Hitt, the state’s former Commerce Secretary, wrote that he had “developed a trust relationship” with McWhorter and others at Palmetto Railways, “both professionally and personally.”
He added McWhorter played a role in some of the state’s biggest economic development announcements.
The felony McWhorter pleaded guilty to is called honest services fraud — a type of white-collar crime in which a company or individual offers something of value to another person, usually a public official, in exchange for special or preferred treatment.
McWhorter retired from Palmetto Railways in 2022 after 37 years with the railroad — a so-called short line railroad that connects Port of Charleston customers and other businesses to bigger, long-haul services.
Following his retirement, McWhorter started a consulting business that includes Frontier among its clients.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/court-money-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

In March, SBA Administrator Kelly Loeffler announced plans to relocate six of the agency’s regional offices based in cities “that do not comply with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.” The SBA’s Region 10 Office, based in Seattle, covers four states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon and Alaska.

Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher wrote, “unlike other states served by the Seattle Office, Idaho has demonstrated a strong commitment to putting American citizens first. Our state has enacted a statewide ban on sanctuary cities, and the Idaho Congressional Delegation has repeatedly worked to prevent illegal immigrants and sanctuary cities from abusing federal funding.”
The SBA is a federal government agency that helps small businesses get loans.
“By relocating the regional office to Idaho, the SBA would ensure its services align with President Trump’s priorities, directly benefitting law-abiding business owners,” the Idaho congressmen continued.
The SBA has district offices across the U.S. Idaho’s counties are split between being managed by the Boise District and the Seattle District.

Celeste Maloy tries to reason with an unruly crowd during a town hall event at the University of Utah on Thursday, March 20, 2025. (Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah Rep. Celeste Maloy’s proposal to sell off nearly 11,500 acres of public land in southwestern Utah was shot down this week after receiving bipartisan pushback in Congress.
The proposal, which identified parcels owned by the Bureau of Land Management to sell to Washington and Beaver counties, the Washington County Water Conservancy District and the city of St. George, was included by Maloy as part of Congress’ budget package. 
But on Wednesday evening, Montana Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke, who previously said selling public lands is a line he would not cross, rallied support from a bipartisan group of lawmakers to strip Maloy’s proposal from the budget bill during a House Rules Committee meeting.
Maloy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday morning.
Officials eye airport expansion, reservoirs and new roads under Maloy’s proposed public land sale

Maloy, in an earlier statement, said the land would help the southwest corner of the state expand water, transportation and housing infrastructure, as the region deals with rapid population growth. St. George was eying an airport expansion; the Washington County Water Conservancy District had plans to build a new reservoir; Washington County was looking to widen some existing roads. 
Maloy’s amendment identified a total of 70 parcels to be sold in Utah. The proposal had a far greater impact on Nevada, with Republican Rep. Mark Amodei earmarking nearly 450,000 acres for disposal in his state. 
The proposal received broad criticism from environmental groups and public land advocates, who said the bill lacked language mandating what the land would be used for. They argued there was nothing stopping the governments from purchasing the land, then using it for something other than the originally stated purpose. And some of the land abutted rivers and popular recreation areas, including Zion National Park, prompting concerns over access and environmental harm. 
The proposal also had its critics in Congress, on both sides of the isle, including Zinke, who called it his “San Juan Hill,” referring to a famous Spanish-American War battle. 
“I do not support the widespread sale or transfer of public lands. Once the land is sold, we will never get it back. God isn’t creating more land,” Zinke said in a news release on Wednesday.

Environmental groups celebrated the decision, issuing a flurry of statements and reactions. 
Travis Hammill, the Washington D.C. director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance, said Maloy is the “latest in a long list of politicians with the bad idea to try and sell off public lands.” 
“The through line of those failed efforts is this: love of public lands transcends geography and political party. Americans don’t want to see these lands sold off and time and time again have risen up to make their voices heard,” Hammill said. 
Kyle Roerink executive director of the Great Basin Water Network, said Zinke’s move to tank the disposal “sends a strong message to lawmakers of all stripes: We can never break the public trust and the Colorado River for billionaire tax breaks.” 
Others noted the bipartisan opposition to the amendment, including Patrick Donnelly, Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, who called the attempt “appalling” and “Gilded Age-level stuff.” 
“Republicans’ public lands fire sale was so greedy even their own caucus wouldn’t support it,” Donnelly said in an emailed statement. “I hope people remember it the next time Republicans try to pretend they care about public lands.”
According to the amendment’s text, about 70 parcels were identified to be sold off to four entities, at market value. Consider:

Washington County would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels covering about 6,492 acres. 
The Washington County Water Conservancy District would have been allowed to purchase 22 parcels amounting to about 4,375 acres.
St. George would have been allowed to purchase 23 parcels amounting to about 520 acres.
Beaver County would have been allowed to purchase three parcels amounting to roughly 62 acres.

The amendment was a small part of what President Donald Trump has called the “big, beautiful bill” that has been in the works for months. The bill extends Trump’s 2017 tax law, cuts steps out of the energy permitting process, increases defense and border security spending, and makes substantial changes to Medicaid. 
The bill cleared the House early Thursday and is headed to the Senate.

May 21, 2025 | Submitted photoWith funding cuts being pursued by the Trump administration, which is looking to cut what it determines is unnecessary spending in the federal budget, the Michigan Community Action, or MCA, implored lawmakers during its annual Legislative Day to invest in local solutions.
Advocates from Community Action Agencies affiliated with the MCA association, implored state lawmakers in the Michigan State Capitol Wednesday to invest in Community Services Block Grants, or CSBG’s, which allow Community Action Agencies as non-profits to facilitate poverty solution programming, a news release from MCA said.
Michigan receives on average about $23 million a year in CSBG federal funding, the Michigan Department of Health & Human Services reports.
MCA would like to see a 50% state match to the federally funded CSGBs which helps fund programming to fight against poverty through nutritional and health care-related programs, housing solutions and emergency assistance programs. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Many nonprofits in Michigan were sent into a panic in January after a memo from the United States Office of Management and Budget instructed that there would be widespread freezes on federal funding to ensure spending aligns with the will of President Donald Trump’s administration.
“In a time when the future of federal funding for critical community action programs is uncertain, our work on the ground is more important than ever,” Executive Director of MCA Brian McGrain said in the news release Wednesday. “Today, we elevated the voices of those who are too often left out of national debates. Our agencies continue to deliver results, and our Legislative Day is a chance to ensure policy makers see both the needs and the solutions we have right here in Michigan.”
In Michigan, CSBG’s allow nonprofit groups to respond to the needs of their community with speed and flexibility, the MCA asserted, and further investment in the program would unlock new resources in decreasing poverty and increasing self-sufficiency in the state.
However, in a letter sent in early May to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, from Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, the Trump administration said it is not confident CSBG funds are being used appropriately.
The letter says programming using CSBG funds in California have focused on diversity equity and inclusion efforts as well as green energy initiatives, while programming in Wisconsin used funds to “combine clean energy with affordable housing in the pursuit of both economic and environmental justice”.
“Americans in need of job-training and a helping hand would be better served by programs funded at the Departments of Labor and Agriculture,” the recommendation for cutting the $770 million program in the letter said. “The Budget proposes to eliminate dollars that flow to Community Action Agencies who carry out their own agendas.”

Jim Pillen sits in his office in the Nebraska State Capitol. April 29, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen line-item vetoed $14.5 million in general fund appropriations from Nebraska’s legislatively approved budget for the next two years late Wednesday, 83% of which was earmarked for the Nebraska Supreme Court.
In his veto letter returning Legislative Bill 261, the general spending budget bill, and LB 264, a bill allocating various state cash funds, Pillen thanked lawmakers for closing a major projected budget deficit for the next two years while making investments in education, developmental disability support and national security.
He returned four items he said are “necessary to honor our commitment to fiscal restraint,” and that the small number of objections reflects “the depth of fiscal conservatism” in the budget.
“It is critical that we continue to treat nickels like manhole covers, and I urge you to sustain four additional reductions to improve our fiscal position,” Pillen wrote.

If the vetoes are sustained, the Legislature would still finish the budget with a positive balance of $1.1 million, because Pillen’s approach would reduce spending instead of using as much money from the “rainy day” cash reserve fund. His approach reduces by about $14.5 million a transfer from the cash reserves. The lawmaker-approved state budget calls for transferring $147 million from cash reserves to help close a half-billion-dollar projected budget deficit.
The final balance includes $1.55 million in anticipated spending to raise judges’ salaries by 1.5% in each of the next two years, via LB 513. Pillen’s office has said those salaries are already competitive nationally. His staff has declined to say whether he would veto the raises if passed.
Specific vetoes
Three of Pillen’s four line-item vetoes are to the state’s general fund, Nebraska’s main pocketbook that will cover a total of $11 billion in spending through June 2027:

$11.99 million reduction of an increase to the Nebraska Supreme Court. 
$2 million cut from public health departments, zeroing out COVID-19 pandemic-era increases because the “pandemic is over” and “spending must be shrunk to pre-pandemic size.”
$511,972 from the State Fire Marshal for salary and health insurance premium increases because he argues the agency has “sufficient funding” already.

The fourth veto aims to prevent an $18 million diversion of cash funds for Lake McConaughy recreational upgrades. Pillen said the project scope has changed over many years, and further discussion is needed about how local casino revenue could support road improvements.
‘Every branch must contribute’
For the Judicial Branch, Pillen seeks to have the Legislature limit spending growth to 0.625% in fiscal year 2025-26 (a $4.16 million smaller bump) and 1.25% growth in fiscal year 2026-27 (a $7.83 million smaller bump). Pillen said those percentage increases are the same as were afforded to the University of Nebraska.
Pillen said the Legislature approved bumps of 2.7% in the first fiscal year and 4.8% in the second year. He said court spending had grown by 36% over the past five years and blamed Supreme Court administrative leadership for not taking “necessary steps” to reduce spending.
In his original budget proposal, Pillen sought to keep the Supreme Court flat at $232.82 million. He proposed cutting the university’s budget by 2%, down to $676.99 million in general funds.
“Every branch of government must contribute to balancing our state budget,” Pillen said.
In contrast, Pillen said the budget included no growth for the Governor’s Office budget, as Pillen requested, and less than 1% spending growth for the Legislature. 
In a last-ditch effort last week, State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue successfully preserved $3 million of a then-$5 million proposed cut to the Supreme Court, which court officials said could jeopardize certain problem-solving courts or other court services. Holdcroft said he was disappointed in the larger cut.

Problem-solving courts are intensive court programs bringing individuals and families together with one-on-one interactions with judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys, law enforcement, court officials and more, often to help Nebraskans receive intervention or avoid imprisonment.
This includes Adult Drug and DUI Courts, Veterans Treatment Courts, Reentry Courts, Juvenile Drug Courts, Young Adult Courts, Mental Health Courts and Family Treatment Courts.
Cuts would end ‘vital’ court services
Corey Steel, state court administrator for Nebraska, said in a memo to lawmakers Thursday that the funding reduction would lead to the elimination of:

A DUI Problem-Solving Court in Lancaster County.
A Mental Health Problem-Solving Court in Sarpy County.
A Veterans Treatment Court in Sarpy County.
A Drug Court in Platte County.
All transition living reimbursements for adults on probation, post-release supervision or for those leaving problem-solving courts.
Non-statutory services for juveniles on probation and a reduction in the reimbursement of many vital placements.

Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, whom Pillen elevated to the top role last fall, also pleaded with the Legislature to increase the court’s budget. He listed a litany of items in his first State of the Judiciary address in January, in part because while the Legislature had increased the number of services the courts provide but had not always directed new funds specifically for those services.
Funke said existing dollars would soon run out, telling lawmakers that court officials “have done what you have asked.”
“It is essential that the Judicial Branch receive adequate funding for the next biennium to sustain the progress we have made,” Funke said.
Those funds would be “exhausted” at the end of the next biennium, Steel confirmed, and impact the sustainability of services such as judicial and guardian or conservator training.
Steel attributed spending increases largely to legislative action responding to more Nebraskans in the judicial system, particularly high-need, high-risk individuals who require supervision. He said employees in all branches of government also received funding for salary increases.

Steel said the Judicial Branch has also returned more than $30 million in unspent funds over the last six years, while, unlike other agencies, the court can’t increase fees to offset any reductions.
“I urge the Legislature to override the governor’s veto and again ensure these vital services, that save state and counties dollars by reducing incarceration, increasing community safety and rebuilding the lives of individuals and families,” Steel wrote.
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, a defense attorney, said the 2025 session has seen a “systematic wind back” of funding for essential services and those to make Nebraska better. He said cutting Supreme Court funding would hurt veterans, those struggling with mental health and other public safety initiatives.
“If you actually want to make Nebraska safer, you’d be funding those programs,” Dungan said.
Property tax relief ‘failure’
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, a former longtime firefighter, said he was concerned that the veto of the Fire Marshal could possibly impact training for volunteer firefighters or in maintaining current services, which go toward keeping Nebraskans safe.
Pillen also used his veto letter to voice disappointment in the failure of LB 170 on Monday to provide additional property tax relief and mirror the success in 2024 of decreasing property taxes statewide, the first time in 26 years. It was an exception to two earlier years of nearly $300 million increases in property taxes that came largely because the state increased spending to take on the portion of property taxes that would have been paid to community colleges.

Multiple senators said the vetoes appeared targeted at specific lawmakers, such as freshman State Sen. Paul Strommen of Sidney, who represents Ogallala and Lake McConaughy. Strommen was one of seven Republicans who opposed the latest property tax proposal.
“The Legislature’s failure this session means Nebraskans will not enjoy a repeat of this success,” Pillen said.
Strommen said he was surprised and a little confused at the veto of Lake McConaughy funding. He said he would continue fighting for his western Nebraska constituents and hopes to override the veto.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, the Appropriations Committee chair, had no immediate comment on the vetoes.
Pillen’s letter did not acknowledge that LB 170 largely mirrored the same doomed special session approach from last fall on property tax relief — a session called at Pillen’s request. 
The Pillen proposal in that session, too, tried to raise sales taxes and shift or use the revenue to offset property taxes. Pillen is 0-3 for such proposals. He pledged to hold property taxes flat this year and has said that without “a shadow of a doubt,” he and allies would find additional property tax relief this year.
The budget the Legislature passed will direct $57 million for more property tax credits and about $11 million for homestead exemption increases. There is no similar takeover of a taxing authority like the community colleges.
Sales tax, tobacco tax push doom Nebraska’s ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ for property tax relief

Some opponents of Pillen’s cuts to public health departments said they would impact new and essential services and that local communities might choose to fill the hole using property taxes. State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said it was particularly damaging as measles continues to spread.
Pillen said that as “stewards of the public’s resources,” lawmakers must prioritize needs over wants and be “conservative in good times as well as during fiscally challenging times.”
“Reducing spending is hard work, but Nebraskans expect us to exercise common sense and discretion in achieving a balanced, fair and operative budget,” Pillen wrote. “Together we can reduce government growth, invest in our kids, provide tax relief to hardworking Nebraskans and remain true to our conservative values to make sure our state is the greatest state in the union to live, work and raise a family.”
Appropriations Committee overrides
The Appropriations Committee on Thursday afternoon will get first crack at which of the vetoes, if any, to try and override. Doing so would require at least 30 votes.
Dungan said he would “anticipate absolutely” an override attempt for the courts.
“I don’t know who’s going to file it,” Dungan said, “but yes, we’ll have it.”

(Photos by Parker Michels-Boyce and Mechelle Hankerson for the Virginia Mercury)Former congresswoman and Democratic nominee for governor Abigail Spanberger fared better with voters than current lieutenant governor and Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears, according to a Roanoke College poll released Thursday showing Spanberger leading Earle-Sears 43%-26%. This follows another poll published this week showing Spanberger with a 4-point lead over Earle-Sears.
The Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College interviewed 658 Virginia residents between May 12 and May 19 to determine that Spanberger leads Earle-Sears by 17 percentage points. Meanwhile, another new poll commissioned by business organization Virginia FREE conducted between May 9 and May 13 shows independent voters favoring Spanberger by 53%-47%. That poll included 1,000 participants. 
While the sample sizes of the polls is much smaller than the number of people who are likely to participate in November’s statewide election, polls conducted sporadically leading up to elections can point to partisan tides. 
The Roanoke College poll also explored key issues that could affect both campaigns such as the national deficit and debt, political anxiety and the job approval of the current president and governor. 
More than half of polled voters, 51%, think “ things in Virginia have gotten off on the wrong track,” while 66% held the same sentiment about the country as a whole. Voters also had mixed feelings about leadership in the state and country, with Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s job approval rating coming in at 46%, which Roanoke College noted as “his lowest and down seven points since November.” President Donald Trump’s job approval rating, 31%, was low but not his lowest.  
Participants also weighed in with their approval and disapproval of Youngkin’s successor. Spanberger rated 41% favorable/40% unfavorable, similar to how polled voters rated her last November, while Earle-Sears’ favorability dropped from her previous rating and stands at 32% favorable/48% unfavorable. About one-fifth of respondents did not offer opinions on either candidates’ favorability.
The voter anxiety index from the Roanoke poll is 89.41, and reflects big shifts in how Virginians in both parties perceive the current state of government. Democratic voters’ anxiety skyrocketed from -10.39 in May 2024 to 101.77 last November, with a current anxiety index of 153.35. Meanwhile, Republican voters’ anxiety index decreased last year, from 166.59 in May to 13.52 in November 2024, and now stands at -30.10. These figures reflect that political anxiety correlates closely with partisan control of the White House and Congress. 
With Virginia’s gubernatorial election falling the year after a presidential election, the past two decades have shown that voters typically elect a governor who is the opposite party of the one who won the White House the year prior. 
On national debt perceptions, a large majority of Virginians, 42%, are very concerned, while 40% said they are somewhat concerned. When it comes to the cause of the national deficit, a majority, 61%, thinks  it is a result of spending too much, while 34% think it’s from not raising enough money through taxes. 
When asked how to address the deficit, 74% of respondents favor raising taxes for people earning more than $400,000 annually, while 82% oppose across-the-board tax raises for everyone. Seventy-one percent of respondents oppose wholesale spending cuts. 
“Six months in a gubernatorial election season is an eternity in politics, but one would prefer to be ahead by 17 points,” said Dr. Harry Wilson, interim director for IPOR and professor emeritus of political science at Roanoke College. 
He added that more than a quarter of Virginians are still undecided voters — which could be good news for both candidates. 
“Spanberger is obviously leading at this point, and she leads among independents, but a large number of Republicans are undecided, and they will most likely end up voting for Earle-Sears,” Wilson said. “The favorable rating for Earle-Sears, however, should be cause for concern.”

As President Trump seeks to fast-track uranium mines in the Southwest, experts said a robust state review processwill stand in the way. (Photo by Jack Delano via Library of Congress website)Recent federal activity suggests the Trump administration has two long-stalled uranium mines near New Mexico’s Mount Taylor on its radar.
Earlier this month, a federal infrastructure agency included Roca Honda and La Jara Mesa uranium mines on a new list of 20 projects nationally that advance “the President’s directive to take immediate action to facilitate domestic production of America’s vast mineral resources,” according to a statement from the council.
Then last week, the U.S. Interior Department announced that a proposed uranium mine in Utah would be subject to only a 14-day federal review period, shortening what is commonly a years-long process. 
Source New Mexico spoke with state officials, outside experts and longtime anti-uranium advocates about what defense New Mexico will have against the federal government’s efforts to restart uranium mining here for the first time in 50 years. While experts said hard-fought cultural protections are unlikely to present much of an obstacle, they expressed confidence that state regulations will hold up against federal encroachment.
“I think that the realities weigh against the administration’s ignorant and uninformed policies that suggest to the public that these kinds of projects will happen overnight,” said Christopher Shuey, a public health researcher closely monitoring uranium developments here. “They won’t.”
Holding the line
Private companies have sought to develop the La Jara Mesa and Roca Honda mines for more than a decade, though interest heated up with Trump’s executive order seeking to boost domestic energy production. Soon after, Cibola National Forest leaders named both mines priority projects, and then uranium company Energy Fuels then struck a controversial deal with the Navajo Nation that would allow it to transport ore from Roca Honda across the reservation. Meanwhile, Laramide Resources indicated on its state permitting application a desire to expedite the next step of its La Jara Mesa project.
DJ Ennis, program manager for the state’s Mining Act Reclamation Program, confirmed to Source NM there’s been a “renewed interest” from uranium mining companies seeking to break ground in New Mexico. 
But even if the federal government tries to fast-track mining here, Ennis said the state will take its time and fully review both mine proposals, which it is empowered to do under the 1993 New Mexico Mining Act, and in lieu of a federal law.
Trump administration expedites permitting for Utah uranium mine to a two-week process

“The feds are going to do what the feds are going to do,” Ennis told Source. “It does affect us, in that it would be good if the state and the feds were on the same pace and page of permitting. But if that is not the case, the default then becomes the state’s permitting process, and we have a robust permitting process.”
At the federal level, new uranium mines are subject to environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which Trump’s recent orders have accelerated. But that has no bearing on the state’s ongoing review, Ennis said.
If it came down to it, Ennis said, the state could issue daily fines and potentially even deploy state police officers to stop uranium extraction at the Roca Honda or La Jara Mesa sites if the companies did so without a state permit. 
So if Trump were to order a truncated federal review of the La Jara Mesa mine like he did the Velvet-Wood mine in Utah last week, and then the Forest Service issued a rushed environmental impact statement that selected its preferred alternative of extracting uranium, and then company proceeded to break ground, the state would step in and stop it, Ennis said. 
“I’m not sure what that looks like, if it involves state police to enforce the order or courts,” Ennis said. “But it is a state law that we are enforcing.”
Eric Jantz, attorney with the New Mexico Environmental Law Center, said the state’s permit review should offer the public some reassurance that nothing will happen immediately. He also suggested that his organization would consider suing if the federal government sought to fast-track New Mexico uranium mines. 
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

“I suspect that if the Forest Service either ignores its obligations under NEPA because of this executive order or its own regulations, that litigation will probably ensue,” he said.
That’s because, Jantz said, he sees little basis for an “energy emergency” that Trump claims is the reason to fast-track the mines. 
“If there’s one thing to impart, it’s that this whole notion of premising expedited environmental reviews on some sort of emergency is preposterous,” he said. “No emergency exists, and there’s no reason why the usual environmental reviews can’t continue.”
What will TCP designation mean?
While experts and observers expressed confidence in the state’s capacity to hold off a federal push to expedite mining, they said it remains unclear whether efforts by local Indigenous tribes and pueblos to protect Mount Taylor as a cultural and religious site will add another layer of protection. 
In 2007, as several mining companies moved forward with plans to extract uranium from the Mount Taylor area, five tribes made the unusual step of sharing stories about their ancestral and spiritual connections to the mountain. 
That rare disclosure of tribal creation myths marked an early milestone in a multi-year battle to create a 400,000-acre Traditional Cultural Property, drawing a line around Mount Taylor recognized by the state of New Mexico. Among other things, the designation aimed to give Indigenous people a voice in opposing uranium or other mining interests. After mining companies sued in 2009, the New Mexico Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that the designation should stay intact.
Since then, the  pueblos have maintained opposition, with the All Pueblo Council of Governors in December issuing a resolution to state regulators that “Mount Taylor, known by various traditional names is a sacred landscape, central to the cultural identity, traditional practices, and religious activities of numerous Pueblos and other tribal nations.”
Even though the Navajo Nation agreed to let uranium eventually be transported from Roca Honda across the reservation, it has also long opposed any new mines in the Mount Taylor area, Stephen Etsitty, the Navajo Environmental Protection Agency director, said recently.
Uranium transport through Navajo Nation sparks concerns in New Mexico

Designation of Mount Taylor as a traditional cultural property has yet to emerge as an issue in the state permitting process, Ennis said. The designation requires federal and state parties to consult with tribes, but a collision awaits between private mining interests and cultural protections, Ennis said. 
“The intersection of those two is a difficult question to answer,” he said. “I don’t know that we’ll know until we get to the end of the process.”
Shuey, who has advocated against the mines since 2009 as a researcher with the Southwest Research and Information Center, said the recent federal fast-tracking prompted him and colleagues to review what the TCP designation actually meant for protecting Mount Taylor. 
“We’ve been asking this question for the last several weeks,” he said. “My understanding is that the impact of the TCP would be more of a, ‘Pay attention to this site from the standpoint of cultural resources, and make provisions to mitigate any types of impact to cultural resources’ type of thing.”
Even without an outright ban on mining or around the TCP, Shuey said, he expects greenlighting the mines to take years, during which time opponents will watchdog the process. 
“A lot of these folks have lived through the 80 years of the uranium legacy. They’ve learned across generations of the impacts of mining,” he said. “And so I think there’s a lot of not only institutional memory but institutional knowhow of evaluating mining proposals and offering intelligent and compelling comments and testimonies.”
He likes their odds against a Trump administration that seems to “not be particularly interested in understanding or knowing the impacts of mining,” he said, but instead has a “weird, visceral notion that we just need more of these minerals for a variety of purposes, and we’re going to go get them.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-mexico-rez-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

LOUIS — Kevin Hines has been living in a house without a roof in the days since a tornado devastated his community. He has seen some of his neighbors sleeping in their cars. A different man has spent untold hours on a bench.
In the aftermath of the May 16 tornado, Hines, 60, has a blue tarp covering his home. Still, rain came in three days later — an expected problem in a house without a roof. But he didn’t think wildlife would be an issue. Then a bird landed on his television. He spotted a squirrel on the sofa.
He already has enough to handle. He’s not sure when his home will be repaired. A toppled tree destroyed the purple Jeep he bought only months ago. His job told employees not to come into work because the building was damaged.
The tornado cut a 23-mile-long path, touching down in the affluent suburb of Clayton before ripping through the north side of the city of St. Louis then across the Mississippi River through communities in western Illinois. At least five people were killed, 38 more were injured, and about 5,000 structures were damaged, according to St. Louis Mayor Cara Spencer. The twister caused more than $1.6 billion in estimated property damage.
While the impact was felt throughout the area, it will take some neighborhoods longer than others to recover. Kayla Reed, a community activist who runs the Action St. Louis nonprofit, which is coordinating help for storm victims, said residents in the predominantly Black area known as North City especially face a long set of challenges in the days ahead.
“A natural disaster met a created one and a systemic one,” Reed said. “They’ve sort of been in a long-term storm all of their lives. If you live in this footprint, you know this is where infant mortality is highest. This is where incarceration rates are highest. This is where poverty rates are highest.”
Food and water aid provide some relief, Reed said, but the community needs more than that. “I can’t put into words how long it’s going to take to stabilize some of these families and how much trauma they are navigating,” she said.
A possible source of major aid is the federal government, which can unlock resources at the president’s discretion. But Missouri is already waiting for President Donald Trump to approve federal assistance for damage left by three sets of storms in March and April that killed 19 people in the state. Trump has denied major disaster requests from West Virginia and Washington this year, and initially denied one for storm and tornado damage in Arkansas before reversing course and approving the request May 13.
Black families here in North St. Louis are worried that their community will not be prioritized.

On May 19, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, a Republican, requested that Trump issue a federal emergency declaration, which would authorize about $5 million in federal assistance for cleanup efforts. Kehoe also requested that the Federal Emergency Management Agency conduct a preliminary damage assessment, a necessary step to securing a “major disaster declaration,” which would provide federal resources for homeowners and renters, reimburse local government efforts, and pay for damaged public infrastructure.
FEMA was on the ground two days later helping conduct damage assessments. But a disaster declaration could take weeks, if it comes.
“Bringing FEMA in, it’s my understanding, is not going to be a quick process,” the mayor said at a May 21 press conference. “All elected officials at every level here are doing everything they can to make that process as quick as possible.”
That includes Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, who asked Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during an oversight hearing May 20 to help expedite the pending aid requests from Missouri’s three previous storms and for the recent tornado. “Yes, absolutely,” she responded.
 
While the city waits, thousands of volunteers have shown up to the parking lot of the YMCA’s O’Fallon Park Rec Complex in North St. Louis in what they are calling the “People’s Response” to help residents in need. So far, they’ve helped more than 5,000 families. Volunteers have collected more than 17,280 pounds of food, according to Action St. Louis.
The last time such an outpouring occurred around here, according to locals, was in 2014 after the police killing of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson. Rasheen Aldridge, an alderman who represents part of the storm-affected area, said some of the same activists who showed up then made it a point to help now.
Hines, too, looked for ways to help his neighbors. He became an unofficial traffic director at the YMCA as thousands of cars streamed into the area to get help — or provide it.
“It’s not about me,” Hines said. “I’m staying until no one is here because there’s nothing to do at my house. I have no power.”
Residents in North City described the moments after the storm as chaos: trees down everywhere; power lines damaged; limited cellphone service, making it hard to connect with loved ones. Then the sun went down, cloaking corners of the city in complete darkness.
Five days after the tornado, people still needed candles, flashlights, and batteries to make it through the night. Piles of debris filled street corners. Exterior walls were ripped off homes, exposing the inside of closets, bedrooms, and living rooms to passersby on the street. Some buildings were leveled. The downed trees in the tornado’s path left a scar in the city’s canopy visible from miles away.
The tornado flipped a semitrailer outside a new gas station and strip mall that had been scheduled to open this fall. One evening, Charles Stanford, a security guard for the property, sat in the parking lot to make sure no one tried to enter what remained of the building. Stanford said the project had been nearly complete. Now, it is surrounded by rubble and debris.
A giant tree crashed into the house of one of Hines’ neighbors. He said the woman recently had heart surgery and had been recovering at home. But then she went back to the hospital, and he thinks stress after the tornado may be why. Hines was planning to bring her a few Hershey’s Kisses, her favorite candy, to lift her spirits.
Shannette BoClair, 52, said she found her infirm father, Albert Noble, on the floor in the fetal position after the tornado passed her parents’ home. A window had imploded and strong winds knocked him down. BoClair called 911 but, she said, first responders were overwhelmed by calls for help and tree-blocked streets. Her father needed medical attention right away, she said, so his family helped him hobble a mile to his grandson, who drove him to a triage station that had been set up for tornado victims.
They learned he had broken his hip, she said. He had surgery within days.

BoClair, who works as a health and wellness director at the YMCA, said she’s helping care for her mother, who remained at home after the storm. BoClair is depending on meals provided by volunteers and staffers at the YMCA but said she had also spent about $500 on DoorDash meals to feed her family since the tornado hit.
As far as federal aid goes, BoClair said she hopes it comes soon. The community needs dumpsters for the debris, reconstruction, and more.
But the outpouring of support from volunteers amazed her. The People’s Response drew so many volunteers that lines of cars snaked outside of the YMCA parking lot in North City. The smell of barbecue wafted through the air as residents without electricity grilled food for one another before it spoiled.
“I’m so proud of our community,” BoClair said. “They say we don’t care. We do care.”
Reed said volunteers would be stationed in the YMCA’s parking lot for a few more days. But, she said, that doesn’t mean the job ends there. The community will need more help to rebuild.

(U.S. Army Corps of Engineers photo by Michael Davis)The House unanimously approved $464 million in new relief for western North Carolina on Thursday, swiftly sending a package that includes money for small business grants to the Senate.
The aid bill sets out $60 million for a long-requested grant program, allowing western businesses already saddled with loans to build back from damages. And it sends $50 million to local governments to help rebuild infrastructure.
It comes in at about half of the level Gov. Josh Stein requested earlier this week, but earned broad bipartisan support as lawmakers push for investment in a disaster region that has seen a slow trickle of federal aid.
“We didn’t stop with looking at what needed to be funded, what might not have been funded before,” said Rep. Karl Gillespie (R-Macon). “We took a deep dive into what had been funded, and was it on the mark? Was that money doing the job we intended for it to do?”
Much of the money in the House package comes from NCInnovation, a private research nonprofit that Republicans have sought to claw back money from. And $65 million is clawed back from other programs deemed unsuccessful or unsatisfactory, redirected elsewhere for recovery.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle praised the bill during floor debate Thursday.
“Our people in certain places are still really hurting,” said Rep. Eric Ager (D-Buncombe). “This bill’s going to really help.”
The business grants, Ager said, would “keep businesses rolling and really help our economy not fall off a cliff.”
Republicans have previously been hesitant to approve grants for businesses, wary of fraud and large companies taking advantage. They have instead opted for loans — a more fiscally conservative option, but one that many businesses have said they cannot afford to take on.
Budget writers’ solution was to require businesses to document revenue loss in order to receive a grant.
“I think if we have some standard that we can measure those things, our folks are much more comfortable with it,” House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) said Wednesday evening. “We’re not the federal government, we can’t print money like they did for [the Paycheck Protection Program].”



Although the money for local governments to repair infrastructure was necessary, one Democrat said, those municipalities need further aid. Many governments are facing budget shortfalls due to lost tourism revenue in the fall busy season.
“I hope that as we move forward, we can provide more flexible funds,” said Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe).
Also included in the bill is $70 million to continue earning federal reimbursement, $30 million for private road and bridge repairs, $30 million for debris removal, and $25 million to repair destroyed schools.
The regional airport infrastructure is also set to see improvements from a bundle of $25 million. Western North Carolina’s mountainous terrain meant that almost all aid in the weeks after the storm came by air.
If the House package is approved by the Senate and signed into law, it would bring the legislature’s total spending on Helene recovery to more than $1.8 billion.
But the bill’s immediate future is uncertain. The Senate has proposed allocating money for Helene within its budget proposal; the House has approached relief as a separate bill.
Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said his caucus was “open to negotiating” on Helene relief.
“We’ve not had those conversations,” Berger told reporters Thursday. “It’s clear that the House has taken a different approach on that. We’ll see if we can come to an agreement.”
“That may argue for us to actually include it in the budget,” he added, of concerns that prolonged negotiations could delay storm relief. “Because I think everybody wants that to go forward.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hurricane-Helene-debris-Army-Corps-photo2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-22 15:08:19.839521

The tied vote allows the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling against the school to stand. (Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY — A deadlocked U.S. Supreme Court has upheld an Oklahoma ruling that struck down the nation’s first religious charter school.
The Court announced Thursday it voted 4-4 with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. It did not disclose how each justice voted, nor did it issue written opinions.
The tied vote affirmed last year’s Oklahoma Supreme Court decision that the concept of a publicly funded Catholic charter school is unconstitutional.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School to offer a government-funded online education to students in all parts of the state. St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and operated according to church teachings.
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board voted in 2023 to approve opening the school. Attorney General Gentner Drummond, a Republican, asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, calling the school unconstitutional and a threat to religious liberty.
Both the school and the statewide board appealed the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take up the case and heard oral arguments April 30.

Attorneys representing St. Isidore and the statewide board contend charter schools are not truly public schools but rather private entities contracting with the state, who therefore should be free to adopt a religion. Excluding faith-based groups from charter school funding is religious discrimination, they said.
In light of the Court’s decision, St. Isidore’s Board of Directors said it will continue exploring other options to deliver a virtual Catholic education for all in Oklahoma.
“Families across the state of Oklahoma deserve the educational opportunities presented by St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School,” the board stated. “We are disappointed that the Oklahoma State Supreme Court’s decision was upheld in a 4-4 decision without explanation.”
During oral arguments in Washington, D.C., the Court appeared to be divided on the case. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson made their doubts clear on St. Isidore while some of the conservative majority, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, signaled support.
Drummond has long contended the Catholic charter school would create a “slippery slope” toward taxpayers having to fund schools of any religious faith, including belief systems Oklahomans might find objectionable.

“The Supreme Court’s decision represents a resounding victory for religious liberty and for the foundational principles that have guided our nation since its founding,” Drummond said in a statement Thursday.
The Statewide Charter School Board, which dropped the word “virtual” from its name in the year since it appealed the case, issued a statement pledging its commitment to all students and the rule of law.
“The Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board respects the Court’s authority and appreciates its willingness to hear complex and deeply significant legal questions,” the board’s statement reads. “The split decision of the court affirms this was indeed a complicated matter with a wide spectrum of views on the appropriate relationship between education, public funding, and religious institutions in our state and country.”
While the attorney general led the legal fight against the school, other Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Kevin Stitt, advocated for giving religious groups access to charter school funds.
Stitt said the matter is “far from a settled issue.”

“This 4-4 tie is a non-decision,” Stitt said in a statement Thursday. “Now we’re in overtime. There will be another case just like this one and Justice Barrett will break the tie.”
Barrett is a former faculty member of the University of Notre Dame Law School, which aided Catholic officials’ case for the school. She did not participate in the decision to consider the Oklahoma appeal nor did she hear oral arguments.
The Court’s deadlock could impact a separate lawsuit challenging St. Isidore in Oklahoma County District Court. That case has been on hold while the Supreme Court appeal was ongoing.
A coalition of Oklahoma parents, faith leaders and education advocates filed the lawsuit in 2023 while represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and Americans United for Separation of Church and State, along with other national legal organizations.
They contend St. Isidore would discriminate against LGBTQ+ students and employees, fail to adequately serve children with disabilities and unlawfully teach religious indoctrination.
Oklahoma City Archdiocese officials said students of all backgrounds and beliefs would have been welcome at St. Isidore. The school promised in its charter contract that it would abide by non-discrimination laws and other state regulations to the extent that Catholic doctrine permitted.
Americans United is discussing next steps for the Oklahoma County case with the plaintiffs and co-counsel, spokesperson Liz Hayes said.
A religious charter school would be “an abject violation of religious freedom,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United.
“The Supreme Court’s stalemate safeguards public education and upholds the separation of church and state,” Laser said. “Charter schools are public schools that must be secular and serve all students.”

At least for now. 
A bill that would have required movie theaters to publish more accurate start times — or include a notice stating the picture would begin after 10 or more minutes of trailers and advertisements — was amended Wednesday, and now calls only for a study of the issue to be undertaken. The amended bill received a favorable vote from the Senate. 
The legislation, Senate Bill 797, attracted global attention earlier this year after it was put forward by Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven. Looney said the idea came at the behest of multiple constituents. 
“I have received complaints from constituents who note that they incurred additional baby-sitting costs, or were late for a dinner reservation and had to wait a half hour for a table,” Looney said in written testimony on the bill. He also mentioned “the case of a couple who went to see the Bob Dylan biopic, A Complete Unknown, [and] were subjected to a string of trailers for violent/horror films in which they had no interest.” 
The original bill would have fined theaters up to $500 for failing to post accurate notices about start times. 
Quickly, however, the theater industry in Connecticut pushed back on the idea. Business owners argued that advertisers would pull their business if they knew people were not going to arrive in time to sit through their ads, cutting into the theater’s bottom line. About one-third of the state’s theaters have closed since the pandemic, according to Connecticut Association of Theatre Owners.
The unusual subject of legislation appeared in news coverage across the country, as well as abroad. In February the bill — and Looney himself — became the butt of several jokes on the NPR comedy show ‘Wait Wait… Don’t Tell Me!’
Some Connecticut lawmakers questioned the concept and why it was worthy of the legislature’s attention.
“I hear a lot of concerns, a lot of ideas, but this was never one,” said state Sen. Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven. “So this is a new one for me.”
Speaking from the Senate floor Wednesday, Looney rejected the notion that the bill was taking away time from more important issues. He also pointed out the amended bill would create a working group to study larger issues affecting the theater industry. 
“The purpose of the original bill has already been accomplished because of the publicity that the issue has been given,” he said. 
In addition to start times, the working group will review policies to support “family entertainment venues” in Connecticut, including through the use of tax credits. The group will file a report by Jan. 1, 2026.
The Senate voted 27 to 9 to pass the amended measure, with all of the opposition coming from Republicans. The bill now heads to the House for further consideration.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MovieTheaters_AP-20210305-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-22 14:15:43.667817

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)Gov. Kelly Armstrong announced Thursday that he accidentally vetoed part of a bill that set aside $35 million for a state housing development fund.
Senate Bill 2014 is the budget for the North Dakota Industrial Commission. On Monday, Armstrong announced two line-item vetoes for the bill. His office said a “staff markup error” led to the unintentional veto of $25 million for housing projects and programs and $10 million to combat homelessness. 
Staff from the governor’s office met with Legislative Council Thursday to discuss options for correcting the error.
“If necessary, we will call the Legislature back to ensure the appropriate funding is delivered, but we hope to avoid the expense of a special session. This was an honest mistake, and we will fix it,” Armstrong said in a Thursday statement. 
North Dakota governor issues 7 line-item vetoes, including lawmaker ‘immunity’ provision

According to his veto message, Armstrong had intended to veto a $150,000 one-time grant for a Native American-focused organization to fund a homelessness liaison position. The veto markup also crossed some surrounding language, axing the full $35 million appropriation in the section.
Legislative Council staff will advise on options to fix the error, but it will be up to the governor and legislative leaders to decide how to proceed, said Legislative Council Director John Bjornson. At this point, a special session is the only obvious legal remedy, he said.
“I think we all want the easy solution, but sometimes the easy solution has consequences down the line that you need to consider,” Bjornson said.
Legislators have six days remaining of the 80-day legislative limit. If the governor calls them back into session, it would not count against that limit.
Bjornson estimated it would take about a half day for lawmakers to consider overriding the governor’s veto. But there is no mechanism for lawmakers to consider overriding part of a veto, he said.
Lawmakers could also consider a standalone bill that restores the $35 million in funding. But Legislative Council estimates it typically takes three days to pass a bill.
A special session is estimated to cost $65,000 a day, Bjornson said.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ chief financial officer on Thursday attributed a $374.2 million decrease in net available revenue for the current fiscal year to a tax deadline extension due to severe weather and tax cuts in recent years.
Members of the Arkansas Legislative Council questioned Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson about a revised general revenue forecast released Wednesday that projects Fiscal Year 2025 net available revenue will reach $6.526 billion, a 5.4% decrease from FY 2024. 
The FY 2025 surplus is expected to be $214.8 million, more than three times less than the $698.4 million surplus in FY 2024.
Because the governor issued executive orders authorizing the extension of the deadline for individual and corporate income tax payments to July 31, some of the revenue originally expected for FY 2025, which ends on June 30, will now shift to FY 2026, Hudson said. 
“It’s not a net loss of revenue, it’s just more of a timing effect of it. So we’ll see some leakage of revenue both on the personal side and the corporate side out of FY 25 into FY 26,” Hudson said. “We’ve done some estimating on that, but we really don’t know how many people will take advantage of that yet.”
Arkansas governor signs tax, appropriation bills after special legislative session ends

In a May 21 letter to the ALC chairs, Hudson said the revenue decline compared to FY 2024 is also expected because of the impact of individual and corporate income tax rate reductions passed in two special sessions of the 94th General Assembly. 
State lawmakers in September 2023 approved legislation to cut the top corporate income tax rate from 5.1% to 4.8% and the top individual income tax rate from 4.7% to 4.4%. The rate changes took effect on Jan. 1, 2024.   
The General Assembly approved another round of cuts in June 2024 that lowered the top corporate income tax rate from 4.8% to 4.3% and the top individual income tax rate from 4.4% to 3.9%, retroactive to Jan. 1, 2024. The tax cuts went into effect immediately upon the governor’s signature. 
Year-to-date, net available revenues have declined by $224.7 million from the same time last year, resulting in collections that are $52.2 million over forecast at that point, according to the new DFA report. 
Sales and use tax collections have also been marginally below forecast and individual income taxes have been above forecast primarily due to estimated payments. Corporate income tax collections are below forecast, according to the report. 
“Corporate collections are notoriously volatile, they’re even more so I’d say right now just given the number of tax cuts that we’ve done with some retroactive effect, so there could be a forecasting component to this,” Hudson said. 
DFA’s report, which was released Wednesday as required by state law, included revised forecasts for FY 2026 and FY 2027. Net available revenues are expected to reach $6.679 billion, an increase of 152.8 million above FY 2025. The projected FY 2026 surplus is $185.1 million.
FY 2027 net available revenue is expected to reach $6.88 billion, an increase of $201.3 million above FY 2026. 
The revised projections are lower than the Nov. 14, 2024 forecast, which predicted $6.794 billion in net available revenue for FY 2026 and $6.997 billion for FY 2027. The adjustments are “largely attributable to shifts in economic conditions,” according to the May 21 report. 
The revenue forecast is based on S&P Global Market Intelligence’s baseline economic forecast, according to the report. The S&P, one of three major stock market indexes, has had a volatile year as the market reacts to threats by President Donald Trump to levy steep tariffs.

“There’s a lot of speculation about the impact of tariffs, where the economy’s going,” Greenbrier Republican Rep. Stephen Meeks said Thursday. “…is any of that driving the need and is there anything looking forward that we need to be concerned about revenues coming into the state?”
Hudson responded that reductions made to the revenue forecast were “almost entirely driven by macroeconomic considerations.” Tariffs are a big component of forecasting, but Hudson noted it’s more the perception of the potential impact of tariffs that’s affecting the market instead of actual tariffs because many have been paused, he said. 
Earlier this month, the United States and China agreed to lower steep tariffs for 90 days, States Newsroom reported. U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods dropped to a universal 10% baseline from the 145% Trump imposed in April. A 20% emergency tariff announced in February on all products because of illicit fentanyl chemicals in China remained in place. 
The back and forth on tariffs has caused uncertainty, which the market hates, Hudson said. However, the state’s chief financial officer said he believes “the potential upside from tariffs could be significant” for Arkansas if the result is trade agreements that are more favorable to the U.S. than they are today.  
“I think particularly for Arkansas, if our agri exports — we get access to certain foreign markets that we’re currently closed off to, that could be a significant benefit to the state,” he said. “But at this point, we don’t know what the actual long-term benefits will be. Because of the uncertainty, analysts have reduced the projected growth; we’re following suit.”

(Courtesy of Sierra Toomey/Natural Resources Council of Maine)While legislative committees are winding down their work for the session, the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee has yet to decide what it will do with a slew of proposals aimed at reforming or outright eliminating the state’s clean energy credit program. 
The committee is still holding several work sessions this week on the matter, though it has voted on some of the proposals to tweak or toss the program, known as net energy bill, which many agree needs reform.
Meanwhile, clean energy advocates, including representatives from the Natural Resources Council of Maine, Maine Youth for Climate Justice, Maine Conservation Voters, and Maine Community Power Cooperative, gathered at the State House Thursday morning asking lawmakers to reject any attempts at rolling back or making retroactive changes to the net energy billing program.
Activists, solar customers and laborers also roamed the halls talking with lawmakers about continued support for solar energy.
The group also highlighted three specific measures it would like to see passed, including a proposal to develop a cabinet-level Maine Department of Energy. They are also backing a bill to codify the goal of 100% clean, renewable energy by 2040 into state law, and another proposal to establish new energy fairness and affordability standards. 
Multiple speakers, including Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association, underscored the importance of considering investor confidence when contemplating changes to net energy billing
“Businesses like ours can adapt to small changes in a program, but we can’t plan around uncertainty or volatility,” agreed Dale Knapp of Portland-based Waldon Renewables. “We at least need to know the playing field.”
Knapp went on to say that “the policy signals we send right now to the industry can determine whether Maine remains a place where energy companies like ours continue to want to invest.” 
That investment goes beyond new energy sources, Knapp said, calling them a “strategic investment in our economy.” For example, a 20-megwatt project his company is working on in Sanford employs 125 people and the vast majority of them live in Maine. So, he said, they are using local gas stations, grabbing lunch at local restaurants and buying supplies from local hardware stores. 
During the public hearings for some of the proposals, the Governor’s Energy Office also cautioned the committee against proposals that would change the way people are compensated for existing projects. 
“Broad retroactive modifications to the core mechanisms in determining compensation under the program as these bills propose and others will have a dramatic effect on 16,000 projects in the state, more than 114,000 customers,” said Caroline Colan, legislative liaison for the Governor’s Energy Office, testifying before the committee in April. 
The committee has already rejected one such proposal, LD 1317, which would have adjusted the tariff rate over the next few years to eventually reach 12 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2028. Solar companies testified that such a rate would not be sufficient.
Similarly, the committee killed two proposals to repeal net energy billing entirely: LD 257 and LD 450.

,DC,2025-05-22 17:42:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Court order blocks Trump from eliminating U.S. Education Department,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/court-order-blocks-trump-eliminating-us-education-department,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education must temporarily reinstate the hundreds of employees laid off earlier this year and cannot follow through on an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to dismantle the agency, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled Thursday. The ruling stems from a pair of March lawsuits — one from a slew of Democratic attorneys general, another from a coalition of advocacy and labor groups — and blocks three Trump initiatives, marking a major blow to the president’s education agenda as his administration seeks to dramatically reshape the federal role in education.The lawsuits challenge some of the administration’s most consequential education initiatives so far: a reduction in force effort at the agency that gutted more than 1,300 employees, Trump’s executive order calling on Education Secretary Linda McMahon to facilitate the closure of her own department and Trump’s proposal to rehouse the student loan portfolio in the Small Business Administration and special education services in the Department of Health and Human Services.“A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun wrote in his 88-page memorandum and order granting a preliminary injunction.“This court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the Department’s employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the Department becomes a shell of itself,” wrote Joun, whom former President Joe Biden appointed.Joun’s preliminary injunction took effect immediately and will remain until the merits of the consolidated case are decided.A department spokesperson said the administration would immediately appeal the ruling.Win for Democratic statesOne of the cases comes from a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.The other lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.The department’s reduction in force plan prompted concerns from education advocates and leaders over how the agency would be able to carry out its core responsibilities after roughly halving its workforce, including major cuts to key units including the Office of Federal Student Aid, Office for Civil Rights and the Institute of Education Sciences.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, one of the largest teachers unions in the country, celebrated the ruling in a Thursday statement.“Today, the court rightly rejected one of the administration’s very first illegal, and consequential, acts: abolishing the federal role in education,” Weingarten said.“This decision is a first step to reverse this war on knowledge and the undermining of broad-based opportunity. For America to build a brighter future, we must all take more responsibility, not less, for the success of our children.”Joun’s order also bars the agency from carrying out the president’s directive to transfer the student loan portfolio and special education services out of the agency.Trump announced the proposal, which had no accompanying executive order, at the opening of an Oval Office appearance with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. The department had told States Newsroom earlier this week that it had nothing new to share at this time regarding the proposed transfer. Judge ‘dramatically overstepped’Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, said the agency “will immediately challenge this on an emergency basis.”“Once again, a far-left Judge has dramatically overstepped his authority, based on a complaint from biased plaintiffs, and issued an injunction against the obviously lawful efforts to make the Department of Education more efficient and functional for the American people,” she said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.“President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families.”Thursday’s ruling came just a day after McMahon took a grilling from U.S. House Democrats over the drastic cuts and proposed changes at her department during a hearing in a panel of the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations.McMahon appeared before the lawmakers to outline Trump’s fiscal year 2026 budget request, which calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the department.",,,,2025-05-22 14:15:43.667817

The budget passed with a bipartisan 86-20 vote. Some Democrats who spoke Thursday said they hoped House negotiators would be able to keep the items they liked in the final version in negotiations with Senate Republicans.
The House and Senate budgets are marked by glaring differences that must be resolved before both chambers vote on a compromise that will go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein for his consideration.
The chambers are far apart on how much to raise teacher pay and on future cuts to individual income tax rates.
“Do we have a long road? Absolutely. We all know this is a process and this is a first step,” said Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth), a House senior budget writer.
“We will not be intimidated,” he said. “We’re going to hold strong.”



The state’s 2023 budget built in up to three automatic personal income tax cuts in tax years 2027 to 2034 that depend on the state meeting revenue targets.
The House budget changes those revenue targets, meaning the state would need to bring in more money to trigger a reduction in the personal income tax rate, likely delaying a cut. The Senate budget goes in the opposite direction, adding more future cuts.
Talking with reporters Thursday, Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) said it seems that the House wants to reopen negotiations on a tax policy that was settled in 2023.
“We had an understanding and an agreement in 2023 as to what the progression of tax policy would be over the years and the House budget goes in a completely different direction than that,” he said.
Earlier this week, the conservative Club for Growth threatened House members who voted for the budget, based on the tax changes. All House Republicans who were present voted for the budget.
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said he felt good voting for a budget with big teacher raises. The House budget proposes to increase new teacher pay from $41,000 a year to $48,000 for the next school year, and to $50,000 the following year.
Jones said he wanted to strengthen the House negotiators’ position when members sit down with senators.
“I wanted our team to go in with a strong hand,” he said.  “Y’all defend what we’ve done here. I hope we can come out strong with most of what we have painfully, thoughtfully put in. It deserves to be defended.”
Meanwhile, Democrats who voted for the budget said it contained good ideas but could have been better.

The sums Republicans have socked away to pay for private school vouchers continued to come in for pointed criticism.
Rep. Lindsey Prather (D-Buncombe), who voted for the budget, said the state could do more if it stopped prioritizing private schools and corporations instead of people.
The legislature is phasing out the corporate income tax. It will hit zero by 2030.
“I hope that this budget gets much, much better in conference,” she said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/gettyimages-StateBudget-iStock.jpg,,,2025-05-22 14:15:43.667817

Some Kentucky school districts had already committed the funding to projects and services. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The U.S. Department of Education denied a $10.6 million request to extend COVID relief funding submitted by the Kentucky Department of Education on behalf of school districts for nine projects. 
However, the federal department did extend COVID relief funding for two Boone County projects amounting to about $44,000. That includes $26,000 for an interactive online learning platform and another project to fund a year of Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library. 
School districts and states previously had until March of 2026 to spend COVID-19 relief funds that had been approved. However, in a March 28 letter, U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon told state education departments that the federal government was immediately halting nearly $3 billion in relief fund reimbursements.
McMahon wrote in her letter that the U.S. Education Department would consider extending the pandemic relief money on a case-by-case basis. 
Altogether, Kentucky was hoping to preserve $38 million in expected federal funding for projects and services in local districts and $18 million for the Kentucky Department of Education (KDE). The state has not yet received a federal decision on the rest of the projects it submitted for reconsideration, a KDE spokesperson said.
Kentucky earlier this month had asked the U.S. Department of Education (USED) to approve a deadline extension for Kentucky school districts to use the COVID relief funds for planned projects that would be in jeopardy without the dollars. Some have signed contracts or incurred other obligations and must now re-examine their district budgets. 
Kentucky Education Commissioner Robbie Fletcher expressed disappointment at the decision and said the state would appeal it. “We expect the federal government to honor its promises to states and to our students,” he said.

“While I am pleased that USED will allow for Boone County to continue spending money on these two projects that were previously approved by the department last year, it is unfortunate that Kentucky has been denied more than $10 million – so far – to provide resources and improve the learning environment of our students,” Fletcher said in a Tuesday press release. 
“While we hope for more good news in the coming days, we stand ready to appeal the projects that have been denied,” he continued. “We will continue to fight for the resources our schools and districts have been promised by USED to continue their mission of providing the best education possible to Kentucky’s students.”
The KDE request that was denied included projects for school districts in Boone County, Christian County, Clinton County, Covington Independent, Jefferson County and Knox County. Christian County Public Schools had the most projects in the request — five — including about $7.9 million to construct a new high school. 
A spokesperson for the Christian County schools said in a statement that it will continue to focus on its mission to “provide a high-quality education and celebrate student success” and work with legislators “to advocate for the return of these funds to support the construction of the new Christian County High School.” 
“Our focus, as always, is on supporting our students and staff,” the statement said. “At this time, we are especially committed to celebrating the accomplishments of our seniors as they prepare for graduation and the next chapter of their lives.” 
Jefferson County Public Schools, the state’s largest school district, requested about $340,000 to provide students experiencing homelessness with wraparound services. 
Mark Hebert, a spokesperson for JCPS, said in an email that the district is “disappointed that the U.S. government is cutting funds that support the needs of our extremely fragile homeless student population.” The school district had signed a grant contract with the federal government and was using the funding for: 

Case management services for students who are homeless
Food and hygiene items for students who are homeless
Emergency short-term, or under five days, hotel vouchers for families in dangerous situations without shelter
Transportation to ensure students who are homeless have stable schooling even when their families move from place to place

Three key Michigan House Republicans on Thursday said they will request a resolution to hold Democratic Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson in contempt for bucking a subpoena request for unredacted election training manuals.
Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay Township), chair of the Michigan House Oversight Committee, announced the plan at a news conference with Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton Township), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, and Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin), chair of the House Election Integrity Committee.
The move could result in litigation against the department, presumably with a request for the court to order Benson to hand over the information.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, the Department of State said their concerns for safety of election information were valid given the fact that the House gave DeBoyer authority to disclose confidential information to anyone he chooses at his discretion. 
Smit, when she was the minority vice chair of the House Elections Committee, requested access to the Bureau of Elections’ e-learning portal, which holds education and training materials for the state’s local clerks. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
When she became chair of the now-renamed Election Integrity Committee, Smit brought the matter to DeBoyer’s oversight committee, which then issued a subpoena to the Michigan Department of State for any materials that had not already been provided to DeBoyer by May 13.
The department said multiple times that it was working to fulfill Smit’s and DeBoyer’s individual requests, but the department was wary of releasing the materials without review or redaction for security reasons.
On Thursday, Bollin, DeBoyer and Smit called foul on that position and said enough was enough.
“[Our] olive branch was that we said … we’ll give you until 11 a.m. today to sit down and have an opportunity to discuss some of the items that they believe are privileged or protected items,” DeBoyer said. “Whether we agree or disagree with the theory, we believe in professionalism. So we did that, and the response to us, essentially in a letter that was returned to us this morning, said now they’re not providing us with anything further with regard to that.”

That included declining the offer to sit down and hash it out, DeBoyer said.
“That’s a pretty disappointing thing,” he said. “After all, the Legislature is the body that determines how elections are run, the time, the manner, the place, the laws by which they are implemented. [Smit] has not only the right but the duty in that role to request the information that is used to train local clerks with regard to how they administer elections.”
That said, in the letter sent Thursday the department did agree to sit down for a meeting with House legal counsel, but indicated that it would like to have an independent third-party mediator present to resolve questions about disclosing confidential information. It also questioned the scope and purpose of the committee’s inquiry.
“The Committee’s generalized purpose of investigating how every election law is implemented by DOS is so broad as to emit no purpose. But even if that purpose were assumed to be legitimate, the Committee has made no effort to explain why the sensitive information is pertinent to or necessary for its investigation,” the letter said.
A spokesperson for the department said it would have additional comment on the issue later.
2025.05.22 FINAL Pattwell House 2025 Subpoenas
But, given the perception that the House was being stonewalled, DeBoyer said House Republicans had no choice but to ask the full chamber to support a resolution holding Benson in contempt.
The next steps could include litigation.
“I think that’s a strong possibility, but what a sad day for Michigan,” DeBoyer said. “I happened to be a local clerk, as well, in 2020 when [Benson] told local clerks to not worry about signature verification on returned absentee ballots. … This is a continual problem, and the fact that we have to perhaps go to court is a shame for the people of the state of Michigan.”
Smit, who also served a clerk prior to serving in the Legislature, said she could not fathom the security risks cited by Benson and the department as reasons to not release the documents or to spend excess time redacting and reviewing them.
“it just makes us [ask]: What is it that the Department of State is hiding [in] the training materials? If there is such sensitive and protected information, then why can’t Secretary of State Benson explain to us what that is and sit down?” Smit questioned. “I have been asking to have this since November 7, 2023. It is nearly seven months. We are still here without the information.”
Bollin, also a former clerk, said many of these documents are available on the secretary of state’s website under the election administrator tab. She wondered what was so secretive about the e-learning portal as opposed to that front-facing information.
The cadre of representatives was asked if it appeared as though Benson was trying to run out the clock on the request. DeBoyer said he didn’t want to speculate on her thinking, but said that has been a tactic he’s seen play out in Lansing before.
Bollin added that the people of Michigan deserved transparency and confidence in their elections, and that Benson’s unwillingness to comply with requests from the Republican-controlled House did not instill confidence.
DeBoyer went a step further and called Benson’s action lawless.
Benson is one of several names in the race to seek the Democratic nomination for governor. Her campaign has stumbled a bit out of the gate, with the pending contempt resolution adding to headaches over the disastrous rollout of the Michigan Transparency Network campaign finance system and the Department of Attorney General finding her in violation of the Michigan Campaign Finance Act for holding her announcement event in the lobby of the building that houses her department.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250522_110854-1024x707.jpg,,,2025-05-22 13:11:44.633321

(Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)LAWRENCE — The leaders of a Jewish center at the University of Kansas joined a chorus of sorrow and outrage over the killing of alumna Sarah Milgrim and her partner Wednesday night outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.
Milgrim, 26, was shot and killed alongside Yaron Lischinsky, 30, at an American Jewish Committee event for young diplomats. A suspect who was taken into custody shortly after the shooting shouted “free, free Palestine.” Officials said the attack appeared to be targeted.
Milgrim, a Kansas native and KU graduate, and Lischinsky had planned to leave Sunday to visit his family in Jerusalem, where he planned to give her an engagement ring.
Rabbi Zalman and Nechama Tiechtel, directors of Chabad Center for Jewish Life at KU, mourned their deaths. In a statement, they said Milgrim was “a proud Jewhawk” and “an active, deeply loved member of our KU Jewish community.”
“She joined us often for Shabbat dinners, holiday celebrations, and countless Jewish programs, always bringing her warm smile, gentle spirit, and deep passion for her Jewish heritage,” the Tiechtels said. “She was not only a joy to be around but a true embodiment of grace, empathy, and purpose.”
They said Milgrim had recently joined the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., to continue her mission of “bringing light into a world that too often feels dark.”
“Her life was a beacon of hope and humanity,” they said. “Her loss is a devastating blow to all who knew her and to the values she stood for.”
Milgrim’s father, in an interview Thursday with KCUR, said she graduated from Shawnee Mission East High School and then from KU with a degree in environmental science. She earned master’s degrees in international studies from American University in Washington, D.C., and international sustainable colonial development from the United Nations University for Peace in Costa Rica. She had worked for an organization that connected young Israelis and Palestinians before joining the embassy.
The couple planned to leave Sunday for their trip to Israel. Her parents learned after her death that Lischinsky had purchased a wedding ring to give to her during the trip.
“There just needs to be something done to make people realize that we’re many different people living in the U.S., but there’s no reason to hate one another,” Robert Milgrim said in the radio interview. “This hate cannot divide us. We need to overcome it.”
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly in a statement Thursday called for “those responsible for this vicious crime” to be brought to justice. Antisemitic violence is not theoretical, she said.
“In my role as governor, I will continue to call out antisemitism and be active in pushing back against it,” Kelly said. “As Kansans, we value peace over violence, dialogue over destruction, and dignity for all people, regardless of faith or background.”
Authorities identified the suspect as Elias Rodriguez, 30, of Chicago. Deputy FBI director Dan Bongino said on social media that the “act of terror has the full attention of your FBI.”
American Jewish Committee CEO Ted Deutch said the couple were killed as they left an AJC event at the Capital Jewish Museum. He condemned the “shocking act of violence”
“While we wait for the conclusion of the police investigation — and urge all our friends and allies to do the same — it strongly appears that this was an attack motivated by hate against the Jewish people and the Jewish state. This senseless hate and violence must stop.”
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his “heart grieves for the families of the young beloveds, whose lives were cut short in a moment by an abhorrent antisemitic murderer.”
Kansas House Republicans in a statement said “the evil rot of antisemitism has been allowed to fester far too long.”
“The poison of extremist ideologies that lead to this type of violence and are peddled by radicals has no place here,” their statement said. “And while it is most certainly not enough, we offer our heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families, friends, and the entire Jewish community and stand with you through the heartbreak of this horrific tragedy.”
Kansas Senate Republicans condemned “the heinous attack on two Israeli diplomats.”
“Let’s be clear — this is antisemitic and anti-American terrorism that cannot be tolerated,” their statement said. “This vile act underscores why we must continue to be vigilant in our fight against antisemitism at every turn and why this past session, we passed legislation to define antisemitism and declare any form of it will not be tolerated in Kansas.”
The new law, which was inspired by pro-Palestinian protests on college campuses, codifies an International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism that considers criticism of Israel to be antisemitic. The one-page bill declares antisemitism to be against public policy but contains no enforcement mechanism.
“This act of terrorism underscores our need to continue to do more to ensure antisemitism has no place in our state,” the Senate Republican leaders said. “We stand with Israel, the Jewish community, and all who are impacted by this unfathomable atrocity.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/GettyImages-2216486658.jpg,,,2025-05-22 13:11:44.633321

The Idaho agreement, published Tuesday, requires Dr. Ryan Cole to comply with the terms of Washington medical regulators’ disciplinary order.
In January 2024, the Washington Medical Commission restricted Cole’s medical license in the state of Washington after state regulators concluded that he knowingly shared disinformation about COVID-19 and broke medical standards by virtually prescribing ivermectin to COVID-19 patients, against medical evidence, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
Idaho medical malpractice lawsuit against Dr. Ryan Cole ends after legal agreement reached

In the state of Washington, Cole’s medical license is active with restrictions, the Washington State Department of Health’s website shows. He is still licensed to practice medicine in Idaho, the Idaho Board of Medicine’s licensing records website shows.
Cole serves on the Central District Health Board of Health, which directs Idaho’s largest regional public health district.
In April, an Idaho medical malpractice lawsuit against Cole was dismissed following a private legal agreement, months after six doctors disagreed with Cole’s severe cancer diagnosis that led a woman to undergo major surgery, the Sun previously reported.
Cole and his attorney, Nancy Garrett, could not be immediately reached for comment. The Idaho Board of Medicine also could not be immediately reached for comment.

But the agreement says Cole “understands the allegations and acknowledges that the (Idaho Board of Medicine) has sufficient evidence to establish the allegation for purposes of disciplinary action against (Cole’s) Idaho license.”
The Idaho Board of Medicine can adopt another jurisdiction’s order when that licensed provider is disciplined elsewhere on grounds that apply under Idaho law. The Idaho Board of Medicine can also choose not to pursue disciplinary action in response to discipline in other states.
In a 40-page response to the Washington Medical Board to complaints against him, Cole and his attorney argued that he did not violate any rules when he prescribed drugs to patients over telehealth and claimed COVID-19 vaccines are dangerous. But some of the arguments in the response to the Washington Medical Commission do not match Cole’s public comments, investigations by the Sun found.
In public appearances, Cole has said the complaints are politically motivated attacks.
The new agreement appears to be the first public move in Idaho related to disciplining Cole. The Idaho Board of Medicine previously closed a complaint into Cole’s Idaho medical license without looking into patient records, the Sun previously reported. 
 How Idaho agreement works: Cole to comply with Washington order, waives rights with Idaho Board of Medicine

The Idaho agreement says Cole and the Idaho Board of Medicine “mutually agree to settle the matter expeditiously in lieu of formal administrative hearings before the Board.”

The agreement says Cole will “fully and timely comply with the terms and conditions” of the Washington Medical Commission’s order. And within two weeks, Cole will submit a status report to the Board of Medicine about his compliance with the Washington order, the agreement says.
In its order last year, the Washington Medical Commission set several conditions for Cole to keep his Washington medical license, including completing medical education courses and writing an essay focused on honesty in medicine. 
The Washington Medical Commission couldn’t be immediately reached for comment. 
As part of the Idaho agreement, Cole waived his right to a full disciplinary hearing with the Idaho Board of Medicine, including the right to call witnesses, testify, present evidence, confront witnesses, and for reconsideration or judicial review of the board’s orders.

Chellie Pingree outside the U.S. Capitol. (Rep. Chellie Pingree via Facebook) Citing Maine Morning Star’s reporting, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine pressed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on conflicting statements about why it cut grants for forever chemical research in Maine. 
Earlier this month, the EPA terminated all of the grants it had awarded for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in the food supply, including to three Maine-based teams led by the Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe and the University of Maine. The three grants for Maine projects amounted to almost $5 million. The termination notices read, “The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, the EPA Press Office equated the grants to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures. However, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin publicly stated the grants were important and already congressionally appropriated when questioned by Pingree. Overall, the agency has highlighted combating PFAS contamination as a priority in recent weeks. 
Despite saying PFAS contamination is a priority, EPA cut millions in funding for research in Maine

In a letter to Zeldin on Thursday, Pingree requested he address these inconsistencies and clarify EPA priorities by May 30. 
“Do you and the EPA consider tribes – which are sovereign governments to which we have trust and treaty responsibilities – ‘DEI?’ If so, under what basis do you make that claim?” one of Pingree’s questions to Zeldin in the letter reads. 
When asked why the grants no longer aligned with agency priorities, the EPA Press Office sent a statement on May 16 to Maine Morning Star, which read:, “As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities. Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”
Pingree and several of the researchers pushed back on this response, pointing out that the research objectives do not involve DEI or environmental justice and are about protecting public health. PFAS have been linked to long term adverse health outcomes, such as cancers and weakened immune systems, and their pervasiveness in agriculture is not fully understood. 
The statement is also directly at odds with the response Zeldin gave to Pingree about the grant terminations during an Appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 15. 
After Zeldin told the subcommittee that addressing PFAS contamination is a priority for the agency and him personally, Pingree asked, “Since these grants are consistent with the EPA priorities, do you know why they were terminated?” 
Zeldin responded, “It’s an important program. It’s something that’s congressionally appropriated. The agency’s going through a reorg, so the way that the program and these grants are administered are going to be different going forward. But these are important grants. I look forward to working with you, and your team as we’re able to continue that good work going forward.”
In light of these conflicting responses, Pingree asked Zeldin in her letter to confirm that addressing PFAS is a priority for the agency. 
“If PFAS is a priority, which I believe you have stated many times, please provide more
information about why the above listed grants were terminated,” the letter reads. “They are not ‘DEI’ grants and they meet a key priority of the Agency so I would like some clarity as to the exact reasoning for these grant terminations.”
The grantees have 30 days from their termination notices to make the case that their work is in compliance with the EPA’s priorities. If the agency determines the grants are in line with agency priorities, Pingree also requested information on how and when the awards will be reinstated. 
Referring to the agency’s work as a whole, Pingree additionally pressed Zeldin about the agency’s plans for PFAS research beyond these grants. 
“Without grants that fund research and scientific advancement for PFAS remediation, how will the EPA make determinations about effective remediation for PFAS in agriculture, water systems, and contaminated lands?” she wrote in the letter.

Sullivan Sr., and grew up with her older sister, Maureen, and younger brother, Jack, in nearby West Springfield, MA.Carolyn met the love of her life, Joseph S. Pieciak Jr., in 1962 after being set up on a blind date by her best friend, Maureen Doody O’Donnell. Carolyn and Joe married on June 12, 1965, in West Springfield, MA, and began their family shortly thereafter. Their daughter Jennifer was born in 1970, daughter Elizabeth in 1975, and son Michael in 1983.Carolyn and Joe moved to Brattleboro in 1970. They were welcomed to the Vermont community with open arms and formed a deep love for the town and its people. Carolyn was not only the heart of the Pieciak family but also a thoughtful, kind “Mom” to many.At a young age, Carolyn was called to serve others, saying, “God wanted me to work with the poor.” Deeply dedicated, she volunteered with Habitat for Humanity and Meals on Wheels. She and her husband served as United Way campaign co-presidents, and when she stepped down as leader of the Windham County Humane Society, he succeeded her in the post.Carolyn’s biggest life passion was born on St. Patrick’s Day 1982 when she helped open one of the region’s largest soup kitchens, St. Brigid’s Kitchen and Pantry of Brattleboro. At the time, Carolyn was head of the St. Michael’s Catholic Church peace and justice committee when the pastor noted a growing number of visitors requesting food.Carolyn, working with fellow volunteers, raised money and ordered, obtained and cooked food at the church’s former convent for four decades before retiring as director last year. Originally serving a few dozen people, St. Brigid’s now provides more than 45,000 meals annually.To Carolyn, there were no strangers, only friends she hadn’t yet met. True to her Irish spirit, she built a community with love, laughter and unshakable loyalty. She had a heart big enough to hold the whole world and a circle of loved ones that just kept expanding. Whether it was traveling, spending time on the golf course, enjoying her garden club or celebrating at a friend’s birthday lunch, Carolyn loved her friends, and they loved her.Carolyn was a lifelong learner of her faith. She attended The Elms College in Chicopee, MA, and regularly participated in spiritual retreats throughout New England. Through these retreats and her ongoing personal spiritual journey, she sought not only to deepen her relationship with God but also to grow and improve herself as a person. Her devotion to nurturing her faith was a cornerstone of her life, inspiring those around her to do the same.Carolyn’s illness never dampened her spirit nor dimmed the light of love in her eyes. Her family grieves her loss but is comforted knowing she is at peace and in the arms of God.Carolyn leaves behind her husband of nearly 60 years, Joseph S. Pieciak Jr.; her two daughters, Elizabeth Lawyer and her husband, Travis, of Brattleboro, and Jennifer Rau of Chicopee, MA; her son, Michael Sullivan Pieciak and his husband, William Holder, of Winooski, VT; siblings Maureen Sullivan-Iannitelli and her husband, Richard, of The Villages, Florida, and John R.

(Photo: North Carolina Department of Commerce HUD CDBG-DR Helene recovery Action Plan)The firm that will run North Carolina’s Hurricane Helene recovery program in the western mountains, as it sought to win the critical contract, described itself as the only one up to the task.
“Only the HORNE Team has the system, expertise, and experience required to deliver this mission quickly and bring thousands of North Carolinians back home,” wrote one of the firm’s partners to the state.
Mississippi-based Horne LLP won the $81.5 million bid earlier this month. It will implement a $1.4 billion federal housing grant, overseeing an array of other contractors as western North Carolina looks to rebuild from the deadliest storm in state history. Horne’s bid, which won out over four other firms, was first reported by Inside Climate News.
Horne’s successful application for the contract, obtained by NC Newsline through a public records request, details the company’s extensive prior work and contracts: $31.5 million to rebuild in Florida in 2020, and $190 million in Mississippi after Hurricane Katrina.
Mentioned just once in the redacted version of the 350-page plan is the N.C. Office of Recovery and Resiliency, the state office that tapped Horne as prime contractor from 2019 to 2022. The state did not renew the contract amid complaints of poor case management and communication across eastern North Carolina.

Three years later, Horne will once again be at the helm of disaster recovery in the Tar Heel State. And the firm has pledged top-flight customer service, robust in-person staffing and expansive outreach to survivors.
In a hearing Thursday morning, Republican lawmakers said Horne’s return to North Carolina disaster work raised a red flag.
“This is a process that promised to learn from past failures, but it’s already raising some serious concerns,” said House Majority Leader Brenden Jones (R-Columbus), who co-chairs the General Assembly’s committee on hurricane recovery.
A spokesperson for Horne declined to comment, saying the firm was not authorized to speak for the program.
The NC Department of Commerce, which is overseeing the federal grant money and Helene recovery program, provided materials to NC Newsline showing that Horne scored the highest of all bidders in grading by the state’s contract review committee.
Horne’s plan: Local partners, WNC offices & job fairs
The state’s offer with Horne is set to span three years. After that period, the state can choose to re-up the contract for one year, up to six years total.
In the first year, the firm projects the largest cost to be assessing damage and conducting an environmental review. That will cost an estimated $15.6 million. Outreach and intake for survivors and homeowners in the first year is expected to cost around $11 million.
Key to Horne’s outreach plan is partnering with local nonprofits and organizations. Patriot Relief, a North Carolina-based hurricane relief nonprofit, is set to knock on doors and use data tracking to find survivors who may be eligible. And the firm plans to blast out materials online, in local media and even by mail in both English and Spanish.
“Outreach efforts will have intentional focus to reach the unreachable and offer aid to those most in need,” Horne writes in its application.
Among the other local groups Horne has tapped as partners: Endeavors, a Christian crisis care organization with offices in Jacksonville and Fayetteville; and SWCA, an environmental consulting practice with offices in Cary and Charlotte.
The firm plans to set up three offices in western North Carolina — in Boone, Weaverville and Marion. The Marion intake center would remain open for the entire recovery process; Boone and Weaverville offices would be open for at least six months.
Horne plans to source staff locally — outlining a series of three job fairs, including in Buncombe and Watauga counties. The state has required the contractor to have at least 25% of their staff locally hired; Horne wrote that it aims to “hit or surpass 75%.”

Details on how exactly Horne will oversee construction are scant. Portions of its application outlining the timeline, inspections, diagrams, warranties and more have been redacted. But the firm has pledged to work quickly, “without sacrificing the homeowner’s experience in the process.” In the bid, Horne included photos of rebuilt homes in Florida that remained sturdy under two hurricanes.
“Speed is no longer a goal; it is an expectation,” the firm wrote. “When it comes to housing programs, speed is service. We know your homeowners have one goal in mind, and that is to return home as quickly as possible.”
Horne has recently faced legal action in other states over disaster recovery projects. Last month, the company paid $1.2 million in a settlement agreement with the federal government in West Virginia. A spokesperson told Inside Climate News the company had not admitted any wrongdoing.
State officials said Thursday that they learned of the West Virginia settlement after the contract window had closed. Horne provided the state with a copy of the settlement agreement.
Horne taps three veteran employees to lead Helene rebuild
Included in Horne’s application were three top staffers it planned to deploy to lead the Helene project.
Kelly Huck is set to be the program director. Huck, who will be based in Raleigh, is the firm’s director of government services. He previously led a project in Florida using the same federal grant money, serving as construction director after Hurricanes Ian and Michael.
Milena Caterino, who served as a senior manager and deputy construction manager on the Florida contract after Michael, is the proposed construction manager. And Bob Harland, who has served as Horne’s tech director on a number of disaster projects, has been put forward as tech manager. Both would be based in North Carolina.
Gov. Josh Stein’s advisor for western North Carolina, Jonathan Krebs, worked for Horne until April 2024, Inside Climate News reported. Krebs was last paid by the firm in December, the governor’s office said. He was not involved in the review committee and “will not financially benefit from it,” a spokesperson said.
“I do not participate or particularly care who they picked to do the work,” Krebs told state lawmakers Thursday.
Jones, the House majority leader, argued that Krebs’ role in drafting the state solicitation was a “blatant conflict.” Krebs pushed back on that accusation, saying that “recusing myself from that activity would nullify my role.”
Another lawmaker viewed his prior work for the firm as a plus.
“[He could] understand some of their processes, identify red flags,” said Sen. Warren Daniel (R-Caldwell).

How North Carolina graded, awarded Horne
Horne’s bid earned 184 out of 200 possible points from the state’s five-person committee, according to a recommendation memo provided to NC Newsline.
The committee noted the firm’s experience with single-family housing, as well as “glowing references” from South Carolina, Florida and Mississippi. Its technical plan was “well-researched and planned.” And Horne’s recommended leaders were qualified, the committee noted, but lacked experience building housing “in places with characteristics similar to western NC.”
“Horne was by far the best vendor selection,” said Stephanie McGarrah, who is leading the new Commerce division tasked with overseeing Helene operations, on Thursday.
Horne’s price for the contract fell in between the other two bidders, according to the state.
Hunt, Guillot & Associates, LLC, another bidder, earned the next-highest score at 161 points. That firm offered the highest price, at $87.1 million. And it was docked for its lesser experience in specific services, as well as key leaders not relocating to North Carolina.
A third bidder, Tidal Basin, provided the lowest price but had “significant weaknesses” in qualifications. Its recommendations were also lacking — the city of Brunswick, Georgia told the committee “they would not recommend” hiring the group. Tidal Basin earned 140 points.
Two other bidders were deemed non-responsive. McGarrah said Thursday she was “personally very disappointed” that one of those bidders, IEM, did not submit a qualifying offer. They did not provide required financial documents.
“You need to understand, this is a very small group of companies that do this kind of work,” McGarrah said.
The state review committee for the contract included McGarrah, Tommy Clark, the executive director of the NC Pandemic Recovery Office; and Konrad Wisniewski, public information officer for the Department of Commerce.
Allan Sandoval, who is CIO at Commerce, and Mark Poole, who leads the Commerce Finance Center, served as subject matter experts. They did not have voting power.
Asked by Rep. Mark Pless (R-Haywood) whether she would redo the bidding process knowing what she knows now, McGarrah said she would not. The housing process is already expected to take three to four years, she estimated.
“I do think we made the right decision,” she said. “I also think that it just slows the recovery down. It’s slow already. It’s so frustrating.”

Read this story in English.
Si ha revisado detalladamente su factura de electricidad de Connecticut durante el último año, probablemente haya notado que se divide en cuatro secciones: suministro, transmisión, distribución local y, para confusión e ira de muchos, una sección denominada “beneficios públicos”.
Si bien los tres primeros cargos representan el costo de compra y distribución de electricidad que los clientes esperan de su compañía eléctrica, el último cargo es menos conocido para muchos, a pesar de existir de alguna forma durante más de dos décadas.
La existencia de este cargo se ha vuelto más conocida debido al reciente debate sobre las tarifas de electricidad de Connecticut, que se encuentran entre las más altas del país.
Desde los cambios más recientes en las tarifas eléctricas que entraron en vigor el 1 de mayo, los cargos por beneficios públicos representan aproximadamente el 20% de la factura típica de un cliente de Eversource. Para los clientes de United Illuminating, representan poco más del 18% de la factura total.
¿Qué incluye el cargo?
En pocas palabras, el cargo por beneficios públicos es un conjunto de iniciativas estatales y federales que incluyen programas de eficiencia energética y electrificación, asistencia para clientes de bajos ingresos y contratos para la compra de energía de fuentes específicas, como centrales nucleares. También incluye los costos asociados con las operaciones de ISO-New England, la organización sin fines de lucro encargada de supervisar la red regional.
El precio de cada uno de estos programas lo pagan las empresas de servicios públicos, quienes luego trasladan los costos a sus clientes a través del cargo por beneficios públicos.


Las gráficas anteriores muestran los costos relativos de todos los componentes del cargo por beneficios públicos en 2024. Las tarifas actuales se determinan tanto por los costos del año pasado como por las estimaciones para 2025.
El proceso para determinar cuánto debe pagar cada cliente de las dos empresas de servicios públicos estatales, propiedad de inversionistas, por estos cargos es más complejo.
Los cargos por beneficios públicos se calculan por kilovatio-hora, lo que significa que un cliente terminará pagando más a medida que consume más electricidad. 
Cada primavera, las compañías presentan una declaración ante la Autoridad Reguladora de Servicios Públicos (PURA por sus siglas en inglés) que muestra sus costos reales para ofrecer la programación del año anterior, junto con sus estimaciones de los costos de dichos programas para el año siguiente. La tarifa, que debe ser aprobada por los reguladores, se calcula utilizando estas estimaciones, junto con cualquier sobrecobro o subcobro de costos del año anterior.
“Una parte significativa del cargo por beneficios públicos en las tarifas vigentes a partir del 1 de mayo proviene de las recuperaciones insuficientes del año pasado, que ocurren cuando los costos reales que las compañías eléctricas gastaron no coinciden con lo esperado, por lo que las tarifas se ajustan para cubrir esa diferencia”, declaró la Oficina de Asesoría al Consumidor en un comunicado esta semana. “Si bien las compañías registran los costos en detalle, no miden estas diferencias por programa. La Oficina de Asesoría al Consumidor considera importante que los consumidores puedan identificar con precisión qué impulsa tanto los costos como las recuperaciones excesivas o insuficientes por programa. Actualmente, en PURA estamos abogando por mejoras tanto en las metodologías contables de las compañías como en el proceso [del mecanismo de ajuste de tarifas] en su conjunto”. 
El año pasado, la mayor parte del cargo por beneficios públicos provino de un conjunto de programas para personas con dificultades económicas, como Operation Fuel y la tasa de descuento para personas de bajos ingresos, que buscan ayudar a ciertos clientes a pagar sus facturas de servicios públicos. Otra parte del cargo proviene de facturas impagas que las empresas de servicios públicos han considerado “incobrables”, y que pueden recuperar del resto de sus clientes.
Las facturas impagas pueden acumularse durante el invierno, cuando la ley de Connecticut prohíbe a las empresas de servicios públicos cortar el suministro de calefacción a clientes de bajos ingresos. Los reguladores estatales también suspendieron los cortes durante la pandemia de COVID-19.
En conjunto, el costo de los programas para personas con dificultades económicas y las facturas impagas representaron casi una cuarta parte del cargo total por beneficios públicos de Eversource y más del 45% del cargo de United Illuminating.
¿Qué hay de Millstone?
Otra parte del cargo por beneficios públicos que ha sido objeto de un intenso escrutinio es el contrato estatal, de una década de duración, para adquirir energía de la central nuclear de Millstone en Waterford. En virtud de dicho acuerdo, las empresas de servicios públicos están obligadas a comprar la mitad de la producción de Millstone al precio establecido hasta 2029. El acuerdo se cerró después de que Dominion Energy, propietaria de la planta, amenazara con cerrarla debido a la competencia de plantas de gas natural más económicas.
Cuando el precio del gas natural sube, como ocurrió al inicio de la invasión rusa de Ucrania en 2021, las empresas de servicios públicos pueden revender la energía a la red con una ganancia que se traslada a los clientes mediante un crédito en la tarifa de beneficios públicos. Sin embargo, cuando el gas es más barato, esa energía se vende con pérdidas que terminan costando más a los clientes.
Eversource ha declarado previamente que el contrato de Millstone fue responsable de la mayor parte del aumento repentino en el cargo por beneficios públicos que afectó a sus clientes el verano pasado. Sin embargo, desde entonces, las condiciones económicas más favorables han reducido el impacto de Millstone en las facturas de los clientes.
A finales del mes pasado, PURA aprobó un ajuste al cargo por beneficios públicos y otros cargos relacionados con la transmisión que se espera que reduzcan colectivamente las facturas en aproximadamente $13 al mes para el cliente promedio de Eversource y $3 para el cliente promedio de United Illuminating.
¿Por qué tan poca gente era consciente del cargo de utilidad antes?
El cargo por beneficios públicos se mantuvo prácticamente en el anonimato, incluido como parte del componente de entrega más amplio de la mayoría de las facturas, hasta 2023, cuando los legisladores aprobaron una ley que exige a las empresas de servicios públicos desglosar el costo de los cargos por beneficios públicos en una partida en las facturas de los clientes.
Como era habitual, el rediseño de la factura entró en vigor justo antes de un aumento repentino en el cargo por beneficios públicos el verano pasado, y una posterior ola de calor que disparó las facturas de los clientes. La indignación se extendió rápidamente por las redes sociales, los editoriales de los periódicos y los pasillos del Capitolio estatal, donde algunos políticos aprovecharon el tema en un año electoral.
Los Republicanos en la legislatura presentaron un plan para trasladar el costo del cargo por beneficios públicos a las arcas estatales, calificándolo de “impuesto oculto” para los usuarios de servicios públicos.
Los demócratas y el gobernador Ned Lamont han rechazado mayoritariamente esta idea, argumentando que los costos de esos programas —casi mil millones de dólares en 2024 — serían difíciles de incluir en el presupuesto sin aumentar los impuestos ni recortar el gasto en otros programas.
El copresidente del Comité de Energía y Tecnología, el Senador Estatal Norm Needleman, Demócrata por Essex, declaró esta semana que está redactando una legislación que propondría pedir prestado dinero para pagar una parte del cargo por beneficios públicos, como cuentas incobrables e inversiones en eficiencia energética, mientras que el resto del cargo se mantiene. Una copia de esa legislación aún no está disponible para el público.
¿Qué dicen las empresas de servicios públicos sobre el cargo?
Debido a que obtienen ganancias mínimas de los programas incluidos en el cargo por beneficios públicos, la postura de las empresas de servicios públicos ha variado desde la ambivalencia hasta la frustración de que la ira de los clientes se dirija hacia ellas, en lugar de hacia los legisladores que crearon los programas inicialmente.
“No nos corresponde decidir si los costos de los beneficios públicos deben incluirse en la factura de energía del cliente”, declaró Jamie Ratliff, portavoz de Eversource, en un comunicado. “Esa es una decisión de política pública”.
Ratliff añadió que la empresa apoya los esfuerzos de descarbonización de Connecticut, muchos de los cuales se financian a través del cargo por beneficios públicos, y que otros programas “ofrecen un valor crucial” a los clientes. 
“Sin embargo, reconocemos que incluir los costos de estos programas estatales en la factura de energía es regresivo para los clientes de bajos ingresos, y eliminar ese cargo de las facturas de electricidad y pagarlo a través de un sistema más progresivo reduciría la factura de un cliente residencial promedio hasta en $43 al mes”, dijo Ratliff, refiriéndose a la cantidad que paga un cliente de servicio estándar que consume 700 kilovatios-hora al mes de electricidad.
Sarah Wall Fliotsos, portavoz de United Illuminating, envió una declaración similar esta semana, señalando que el cargo por beneficios públicos proviene de programas implementados por legisladores.
“Alentamos a nuestros clientes a que se comuniquen con sus funcionarios electos si tienen alguna pregunta o inquietud sobre esta parte de sus cargos de energía”, dijo Fliotsos.

The levy comprises owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential properties, commercial properties, tangible properties and natural growth, or increase in value, of real estate. 
But not everyone was on board. Five committee members voted against the bill’s passage — a third of the 15-member committee. 
Kislak predicted as much. “I don’t know that it’s going to be unanimous on committee,” she said in a conversation Tuesday in the House chamber before committee meetings began. 
Providence Democratic Reps. David Morales and José Batista have previously expressed their deep dissatisfaction with the bill and voted to block its passage. Rep. Cherie Cruz, a progressive Pawtucket Democrat, and two Republicans, Rep. Richard Fascia of Johnston and Rep. Robert Quattrocchi of Scituate, resisted the bills alongside Morales and Batista.
The only Providence delegate to vote in support of the bill in committee was Democratic Rep. Raymond Hull. Anthony DeSimone, another Providence Democrat, was absent for the vote Tuesday.
Kislak’s bill would allow an increase up to 8% over the previous year. Mayor Brett Smiley and the Providence City Council have shared their plans to increase by 7.5% the total tax levy for the upcoming fiscal year to help the city weather a court-mandated public school funding settlement from November 2024. 
Smiley said in April that the next year’s budget hinges almost entirely on the tax levy hike. The city’s budgeting process is set to end in June, ahead of the new fiscal year’s start on July 1, and the City Council will need to review and revise the current spending plan if the levy hike falls through.
But the Senate Committee on Finance has yet to schedule a hearing on Sen. Sam Zurier’s companion legislation S1041, as of Thursday. The Providence Democrat introduced the bill on May 9.   
“I was not able to gain any cosponsors from the PVD Senate delegation,” Zurier wrote in a Wednesday night email. “I expect the Finance Committee to hear the bill in the next couple of weeks. I am optimistic about its chances, but there is still uncertainty.”
The mayor’s office is staying calm, said spokesperson Josh Estrella in an email Wednesday. “We do not have any concerns — we expect the bill to be heard within the next couple of weeks,” he wrote.
Estrella called the bill “critically important” to the city in order to avoid cuts to city services. He noted that similar measures have passed recently for Middletown, Warren, and New Shoreham.
Helen Anthony, chair of the City Council’s Committee on Finance, shared that view in an email Tuesday.  
“Without action by the General Assembly, the mayor’s budget cannot move forward,” Anthony wrote. “That’s why the city council passed a one-year exemption to the 4% levy increase cap.” 
Kislak said she expects House passage. “When a mayor and a unanimous City Council request something of the General Assembly, we should give it to them,” she said before the committee vote Tuesday.
A number of Providence legislators, residents and landlords feel the tax increase will disproportionately affect both owners and occupants of smaller, multifamily homes. Critics like Morales and Batisita have argued the city has not fully explored other revenue sources, such as Providence’s industrial waterfront or its myriad of tax-exempt nonprofits both big and small. 
While Smiley’s proposal would actually lower direct tax rates for fiscal year 2026, the sharp increase in Providence real estate pricing during a recent evaluation means that most properties citywide would see increases in their tax bills regardless. Single-family and condo homeowners could see a 4% tax increase. Multifamily homes with between two and five units, owner-occupied or not, could face hikes up to 16%. 
In her email message, Anthony underlined that the budget process has not yet concluded. 
“The City Council is doing our job of vetting the proposed budget in detail, but the city needs flexibility,” she wrote. “I urge the General Assembly to pass this exemption and to work with us in the months and years ahead to find creative, fair and balanced ways for our state’s cities to raise revenue without overburdening residents.”
Council spokesperson Marc Boyd said in an email Thursday that the City Council will hold a second public hearing on the budget on Monday, June 9, at 5:30 p.m. at City Hall. Residents can also discuss their concerns with their ward’s elected councilor during regularly scheduled ward meetings, Boyd said.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A coalition of groups opposing a multi-state carbon dioxide pipeline celebrated the removal of controversial language from the budget reconciliation bill passed Thursday by the U.S. House.
Last week, the groups raised alarms about a provision they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law.
South Dakota passed a law earlier this year that bans the use of eminent domain for carbon pipelines. Eminent domain is a legal process for gaining land access from unwilling owners, in exchange for compensation determined by a judge.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

Chase Jensen, a senior organizer for Dakota Rural Action in South Dakota, was among the activists who called for the provision’s removal.
“Within days of being introduced, Congress heard loud and clear that seizing federal siting authority for oil and CO2 pipelines was a nonstarter all across the nation,” Jensen said in a news release.
The groups are also calling for the repeal of a federal tax credit for carbon sequestration, but have not succeeded in getting that repeal inserted in the legislation. And they remain opposed to a “fast-track” provision in the bill that they say would allow potential gas pipeline operators to pay a fee of $10 million for expedited federal environmental reviews within a year’s time.
The proposed $9 billion, five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline does not require that type of federal review, but it does need eminent domain for its proposed route. The project, which would transport ethanol-plant carbon emissions to an underground sequestration site in North Dakota, remains in limbo in South Dakota after the passage of the state’s eminent domain ban and two permit rejections by the state’s Public Utilities Commission.

(Photo by Janine L. Weisman/Rhode Island Current)NEWPORT — The public can enjoy free rides to Newport’s top attractions on the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s (RIPTA) “hop-on, hop-off” trolley service, which returns Friday, May 23.
The free rides will run through Oct. 31 on Routes 67 and 68, thanks to a total of $85,000 in funding from Discover Newport and the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island. 
About $80,000 provided by Discover Newport allows for waiving the $2 fares on Route 67, which stops at a number of the city’s tourist destinations including the Gilded Age mansions, Cliff Walk, Audrain Automobile Museum, and International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
“By providing an easy and sustainable option to get around the city we are able to help divert cars from the road during the busy summer and fall seasons,” Victoria Cimino, president & CEO of Discover Newport, said in a statement.
Cimino said the free-fare program saw record ridership of 178,000 passengers in 2024, according to Discover Newport.
A $5,000 payment from the Episcopal Diocese of Rhode Island covers fares on Route 68, which connects Newport’s North End to the city’s beaches.
“Making it easier for visitors to leave their cars behind while they tour the city helps improve the experience for everyone,” Rt. Rev. W. Nicholas Knisely, bishop of the diocese, said in a statement. “It helps us set an example of being good citizens in our changing climate.”
Riders can park at the Newport Transportation Center at 23 America’s Cup Avenue and pay $5 if they present a same-day trolley voucher provided by the bus operator. 
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand said he was grateful for the ongoing sponsorship, which began in 2022.
“This program significantly reduces traffic congestion, supports local tourism, and provides accessible transit for tourists, as well as residents living and working in Newport,” Durand said in a statement.
Additional information on RIPTA’s summer service in Newport can be found on the agency’s website.

Ron DeSantis signs the ""Pam Rock Act"" on May 21, 2025. (Photo via Rep. Judson Sapp's X account)Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a law Wednesday bringing harsher penalties and restrictions for owners of dogs that severely injure or kill people.
The bill, known as the “Pam Rock Act,” honors a mail carrier who was mauled to death by five dogs in Putnam County in 2022. Starting July 1, owners of dogs that have attacked humans, severely injured or killed pets, or menacingly chased people will have to carry liability insurance of at least $100,000.
“This legislation is not just a policy change; it’s a proclamation to every Floridian that their safety matters,” Green Cove Springs Republican Rep. Judson Sapp, who introduced HB 593, said in a press release. “Pamela’s tragic death was a preventable loss, and with this act, we aim to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again.
Additionally, owners of such dogs must present current certificates of rabies vaccinations, have an enclosure with warning signs, microchip, and spay or neuter the dog.
Animal control gains authority to confiscate dogs pending investigations of incidents and humanely euthanize dogs deemed dangerous that are surrendered.
Owners who don’t comply could face fines of up to $1,000 per violation.
If a dog that has already been classified as dangerous severely injures or kills a person, the owner commits a felony of the second degree. However, for dogs that haven’t been officially deemed dangerous, owners would still face first-degree misdemeanors if they showed disregard for their dogs’ behavior.
Rock’s family and the family of Michael Millett, an eight-year-old boy from Volusia County who was killed by a dog in January, attended the bill signing ceremony, according to the press release from Sapp’s office.

The decision was expected after  a ruling in March by a 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel which determined that there was insufficient evidence that two school employees of Oxford Public Schools acted in such a way as to increase the immediate risk of danger leading up to the 15-year-old student opening fire on his classmates. 
U.S. District Court Judge Mark Goldsmith dismissed the lawsuits Tuesday with prejudice, meaning they can’t be refiled.
The lawsuits asserted that Shawn Hopkins, then a counselor at the school, and Nicholas Ejak, dean of students at the time, acted “recklessly” in the hours leading up to the shooting, showing “indifference” towards the impending danger that worsened the risk of tragedy.
But the judicial panel ruled that Hopkins and Ejak displayed the “opposite of callous indifference” towards concerning behaviors by the shooter and concluded their actions were geared towards mitigating risk.
The shooter, who killed four fellow students – Tate Myre, 16; Hana St. Juliana, 14; Justin Shilling, 17, and Madisyn Baldwin, 17 – was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in December of 2023. 
The parents of the shooter were sentenced to 10-15 years in prison in April 2024 on four counts of involuntary manslaughter for their role in the killings.

The lawsuits stated that on the morning of the shooting, Ejak and Hopkins had been alerted that the shooter had drawn pictures of guns and bloody bodies, and had written concerning messages on a math worksheet.
The teen was promptly removed from class and Hopkins called his parents in for a meeting, where they declined to take him home for the day and Hopkins informed them that if they didn’t get their son into counseling within 48 hours, he would call Child Protective Services.
The judicial panel said that while the lawsuits contended the school was placed at greater risk because the warning had been made in front of the shooter, the actions instead showcase a concerted effort to mitigate risk by getting Child Protective Services involved.
One related lawsuit Another lawsuit that remains active was filed by Molly Darnell, an Oxford teacher who stood face-to-face with the shooter and survived. Darnell, who filed her lawsuit nearly two years after the original set which were dismissed, also alleges school officials saw clear and repeated warning signs that the shooter posed a threat to the school community and repeatedly disregarded the violence that was to come.

When asked for comment, Oxford Community Schools Executive Director of Communications Christine Smith sent Michigan Advance the following statement:
“We are aware of the federal court’s decision and understand that it may bring a range of emotions for our community. As always, our focus is on our students, staff, families, and the Oxford community as we are dedicated to fostering a safe, compassionate, and supportive environment for all.  We remain deeply committed to supporting all who were impacted by this tragedy and want to remind our community that mental health resources and support are available for anyone who needs them at oxfordschools.org/support,” Smith said.

Libby is in the middle of his second consecutive term in the Senate, but he has also spent time as a state representative after being first elected to the Legislature in 1992. He also ran in the 2002 Republican gubernatorial primary.
Among the bills Libby introduced this legislative session are measures to add political affiliation as a protected class under the Maine Human Rights Act and reinstate the failed Property Tax Stabilization Program.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed a major proposal to advance President Trump’s agenda on Thursday, with all Florida Republicans voting for the measure and all Democrats opposing it.
The bill will cut taxes, provide more money to the military and border security, and cut spending on Medicaid, food assistance, education, and clean energy programs. It will also add trillions to the federal deficit.
So is it good for Floridians, or a disaster?
Obviously, it depends on who you listen to. Democrats will focus on the cuts to Medicaid. The proposal will save at least $625 billion and cause 7.6 million Americans to lose their health insurance over the next 10 years, according to initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Those cuts include new work requirements for adults enrolled in the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion beginning in December 2026, more frequent eligibility checks, and disincentives for states to cover unauthorized migrant children.
It’s that part of the bill regarding undocumented immigrants that Republican Party of Florida chairman Evan Power focused on in a statement issued before the final vote took place.
“Time and time again, Florida Democrats choose criminal illegal migrants over American citizens,” he said. “From Darren Soto to Jared Moskowitz, they’ve all revealed themselves as radical leftists who are more interested in appeasing the open-borders crowd than protecting Floridians.”
The bill was urgent, Republicans argued, because the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — which lowered income tax rates for all income groups but disproportionately benefitted the highest earners — is set to expire at the end of this year.
That allocation is why Democrats like Tampa’s Kathy Castor are calling the bill the “Billionaire Boondoggle.”
“The billionaire tax giveaway will hit Floridians particularly hard, as 3.9 million rely on Medicaid and 4.6 million rely on Affordable Care Act (ACA) coverage,” she said in a statement.
“The GOP bill takes health care away from children, seniors, pregnant and postpartum women, and people with disabilities to fund a massive tax break for billionaires and corporations. This is fiscally irresponsible and morally wrong. This bill is chock full of special interest side deals and carveouts that Republicans tried to hide by having most debate in the wee hours of the morning.”
‘Promises kept’
Sarasota-area Republican Vern Buchanan, vice chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the bill is the definition of “promises made, promises kept.”
“I’m proud to have helped lead efforts on the Ways and Means Committee to make the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent and increase the [Section] 199A small business deduction to 23% for 30 million small businesses across the country,” he said in a statement.
“Our bill includes my longtime priority to secure no tax on tips so workers can keep more of what they earn. We also eliminate taxes on overtime, increase the child tax credit for working families and provide an additional $4,000 for seniors living on a fixed income. This is a commonsense, pro-growth, pro-family, America First bill. We will not stop fighting until we get this bill across the finish line and to the President’s desk.”
Southwest Florida Republican Rep. Greg Steube on X listed the provisions in the bill that he champions, including that it “[f]unds the border wall & boosts deportation of illegal immigrants.” The measure includes $46.5 billion to renew construction on the president’s border wall and billions more for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, personnel, and technology upgrades.
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) has already announced that it is targeting Florida Republicans Cory Mills, Anna Paulina Luna, and Maria Elvira Salazar in next year’s elections. In a statement, DCCC chair Susan DelBene said the three had “broken their promise to help the people they were expected to serve.”
“Their vote to pass a singularly devastating piece of legislation that will hurt millions of working people, all to pay for hundreds of billions in tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy, is the latest example of their complete abandonment of everyday Americans in favor of billionaires,” she said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXOnly two Republicans in the House voted against the bill. One of them was Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who endorsed Ron DeSantis for president in 2023. DeSantis has sounded skeptical about the proposal leading up to Thursday’s vote.
Speaking with Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia in a video posted on his X account on Tuesday night, DeSantis said the bill was “pealing back what Trump did in 2017,” referring specifically to the $10,000 cap in the state and local tax deduction (known as SALT). The bill passed on Thursday raises that deduction to $40,000 (up from $30,000 in a prior plan).
“They’re trying to put that back in so New York and California, they get a break if they have high taxes. They get to write it off on their federal taxes. That is not good policy,” the governor said, adding “that the spending levels – really, the Green New Deal is not eliminated. Most of the spending cuts are four or five years into the future, and I think it’s just different how Florida does it versus how they do it in D.C.”
If approved in the U.S. Senate, the bill would increase the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion over 10 years, according to the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Budget Model.

Some experts say Congress’ move is illegal and is likely to trigger a legal battle.,"In summary
Today’s decision could upend California’s phaseout of gas-powered cars and its decades-long battle against air pollution. Some experts say Congress’ move is illegal and is likely to trigger a legal battle.



The U.S. Senate voted today to block California’s landmark mandate phasing out gas-powered cars, dealing a substantial blow to the state’s aggressive transition to electric vehicles.
The decision to revoke a waiver that the Biden administration granted to California could upend the state’s decades-long efforts and authority to clean up its air pollution — the worst in the nation — and reduce greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
The move by the Senate — following a vote in the House last month — sets the stage for what is likely to become a high-stakes legal and political battle between California and the Trump administration. 
Republicans in the Senate and some Democrats in the House who voted in favor of blocking California’s electric car mandate said it’s costly and impractical, and prevents consumers from making their own choices. 
But Democrats in the Senate who voted against it, including California’s Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff, said the tactic used by Senate Republicans is illegal and that the state’s mandate is vital to cleaning up polluted air.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has made the adoption of zero-emission cars and trucks a top priority, has denounced the move by Congress, vowing that “zero-emission vehicles are here to stay.”
“The United States Senate has a choice: Cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for,” Newsom said in a statement on Tuesday, before the vote.Under California’s mandate, 35% of new 2026 model cars sold in the state must be zero-emissions, ramping up to 68% in 2030 and 100% in 2035. It builds on decades of tightening emissions standards for cars sold in the state.
California officials may now have to rely, at least temporarily, on voluntary efforts to clean up cars and trucks in order to meet federal health standards for smog and soot. For instance, state officials could offer financial incentives or rebates to persuade manufacturers to make electric cars and consumers to buy them. The state, however, faces a $12 billion deficit.
Culminating a late-night, marathon session on Wednesday, the Senate vote highlights the growing political division over electric vehicle and air pollution policy as concerns over cost, charging infrastructure and accessibility prevent many consumers from buying them, even in California, which leads the nation in sales.
For almost 60 years, California’s standards for vehicle emissions have been central to cleaning up its air, particularly in the smoggy Los Angeles basin and San Joaquin Valley. Vehicles are still the largest sources of smog-forming gases and fine particles of soot, which can cause respiratory disorders, heart attacks and other serious and deadly health problems.
Because of its highly polluted air and large population, Congress gave California the power to set its own, more stringent vehicle standards under the 1967 Clean Air Act. But before those standards can take effect, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must grant the state a waiver for each one.
Before today, over the past six decades, the EPA and Congress have never blocked any of California’s dozens of car and truck rules. Eleven other states and Washington, D.C. have already adopted a version of California’s electric car mandate, according to the Air Resources Board. 
“This is a major blow to the decades-long public health protections delivered under the Clean Air Act,” said Will Barrett, the American Lung Association’s senior director for nationwide clean air advocacy. “It is more important than ever that California and all other states…continue to cut tailpipe pollution through homegrown, health-protective policies.”
Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, of Wyoming, said Republicans reversed a highly unpopular move by the Biden administration.
“They were losers going out the door and they said ‘we’re coming after you — the American people — with our leftist dreams,’ ” Barrasso said. “This is a whole new meaning in California of fantasy land…America can’t meet these impossible standards, not next year, not in 10 years, and the American people don’t want to meet those standards.”
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, called California’s zero-emission standards for both cars and diesel trucks extreme and a threat to the economy. “I want to be clear, I have no problem with electric vehicles. Consumers should be able to purchase the vehicle of their choice, but I do have a big problem with electric vehicle mandates that replace the will of the consumer and the will of the government,” she said on the Senate floor on Wednesday night.
The Senators mostly voted along party lines. Fifty-one senators voted to rescind the electric car mandate waiver, while 44 voted against it.

“I wonder if any other member of this chamber grew up like I did, where on a pretty regular basis, we would be sent home from grade school because of the intensity and dangers of smog that settled over the San Fernando Valley, the city of Los Angeles,” Padilla said during a Senate session on Tuesday, ahead of the vote.
Schiff said on X Wednesday night that Senate Republicans are “doing the bidding of the oil industry” after Donald Trump promised to help them if they donated $1 billion to his campaign. He said it will mean “Californians and others will be breathing dirtier air, as will others around the country.”

The Senate today also plans to vote on blocking two other California rules approved by Biden’s EPA. One is the Advanced Clean Trucks rule, which was enacted in 2020 and requires manufacturers to meet ramped-up targets for zero-emission heavy and medium-duty trucks for 2024 through 2035. The other is a 2020 regulation reducing nitrogen oxides — a key ingredient of smog — emitted by trucks and buses.
President Donald Trump has long opposed California’s unique authority to set its own limits on emissions from cars and trucks. On his first day in office, Trump issued an executive order that aimed to eliminate federal and state electric car regulations and subsidies and restore “consumer choice in vehicles.”
“Trump and his congressional allies have declared war on the environment and this is the first major legislative battle,” said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. 
The Senate action follows an April 30 vote in the U.S. House of Representatives that shocked environmentalists because 35 Democrats joined Republicans to block California’s electric car mandate.
Included were two California House Democrats, both of whom represent districts in the smoggiest part of the state: Rep. Lou Correa of the 46th District in northern Orange County, and newly elected Rep. George Whitesides, from the 27th District in northern Los Angeles County.
“As Americans, we all want to do our part to protect the environment. As a lawmaker, my primary job is to listen to my neighbors and respect their choices to do what is best for their families and their circumstances. That means protecting consumers’ rights to drive whatever vehicle makes sense for them and their pocketbooks,” Correa said in an emailed statement.
California’s mandate has come under fire from auto dealerships and some car manufacturers who once were more in line with the goals of aggressively requiring more sales. Sales of electric cars have undergone a bumpy road, taking off in the post-pandemic years, but they did not increase last year.
About 23% of all new cars sold in California were zero emissions during the first three months of this year, compared to 25% for all of 2024 and 2023, mostly because of a drop in Tesla sales. Californians own 2.2 million zero-emission cars; about 150 models are now sold in the state, 40% more than a year ago, according to the California Energy Commission.
John Bozzella, CEO of an alliance of automakers, in a statement earlier this month welcomed the move by Congress, saying it would “prevent the inevitable jobs and manufacturing fallout from these unachievable regulations.” 

The Biden administration’s EPA granted the waivers for California’s electric car mandate and nitrogen oxides truck rule late last year, and for the zero-emission truck rule in March 2023. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA can only legally reject a waiver if it’s “arbitrary or capricious,” unnecessary for addressing air pollution or technologically infeasible due to inadequate lead time.
“Congress voted decades ago to allow California, with the nation’s most smog-choked cities, to adopt stronger vehicle air pollution standards,” Becker, a clean-air advocate, said. “This vote will set a dangerous precedent of overturning state law protecting tens of millions in California and 11 other states that have adopted its strong clean air protections.”
The Senate’s votes are likely to set up a legal challenge from the Newsom administration. Experts say the state could sue claiming improper use of the Congressional Review Act.
That law is meant to allow Congress under a new administration to revoke rules recently enacted by the previous administration. But it applies only to regulations, and experts say the waivers are not regulations so they cannot be revoked by Congress. In addition, the three waivers are already in effect, and the diesel truck one was issued more than two years ago, outside the time limits of the review act. 
The U.S. Senate’s Parliamentarian and the Government Accountability Office said Congress cannot review Clean Air Act waivers. The Senate voted to evade their Parliamentarian’s ruling in a 51-46 party line, procedural decision on Wednesday night.
“We’re just in a completely new territory…Congress seems to be willing to use a statute that doesn’t apply, which is highly unusual. We’ve never seen this before.”ANN CARLSON, UCLA LAW PROFESSOR
UCLA law professor Ann Carlson said Congress is violating its longstanding practices. She called the decision “totally norm-busting.”
“We’re just in a completely new territory,” she said. Congress “seems to be willing to use a statute that doesn’t apply, which is highly unusual. We’ve never seen this before.”
Carlson said by using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers are seeking to move fast —  bypassing the courts and a potential filibuster.
During the first Trump administration, California sued to reverse other actions that blocked air pollution regulations for cars.

Combined, the three regulations are designed to eliminate tons of soot and gases from cars and diesel trucks that pollute California’s air by requiring manufacturers to switch to cleaner vehicle technologies.
The stakes are high: The state still has some of the worst air pollution in the country, and failure to meet federal health standards for smog and soot could trigger economic penalties, including the loss of highway funding. People in low-income communities of color are particularly exposed to the unhealthiest air.
California is also considered a leader on climate policy, and zero-emission trucks and cars are critical to meeting its targets to phase out nearly all fossil fuels to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2045, which are mandated by state law.
Congress’ repeal of the rules follows an earlier blow to California’s efforts to clean the air. Days before Trump’s inauguration, the state Air Resources Board abandoned two of its groundbreaking standards because Trump’s EPA was unlikely to grant waivers for them.
One of them would have amped up California’s earlier zero-emission truck rule by ending the sale of new diesel trucks in 2036 and requiring large companies to convert their fleets to electric or hydrogen models by 2042.
The other abandoned rule would have required railroads in California to transition new diesel locomotives to ones powered by electricity. Under that rule, only locomotives less than 23 years old could operate in California after 2030 unless they were zero emissions.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/092523-EV-Fast-Charging-Event-LE-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 12:18:28.365788

It was the first time she had seen the lights out at the now relocated Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center’s adult medicine clinic – a harbinger of changes to come at the former shopping mall turned medical center. 
The transfigured shopping mall finds itself on the cusp of change as the University of Mississippi Medical Center, long one of the medical mall’s key stakeholders and largest lessee of space in the facility, readies itself to move many of its clinical services and reduce its square footage at the mall by about 75% in the next year. 
And with UMMC goes Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, a federally qualified health center and one of the largest providers of primary health care services to poor and uninsured people in central Mississippi. The center has subleased space at the mall from UMMC for over a decade and is one of the last providers to offer primary health care services at the mall. 
“It was just very overwhelming when I walked in the clinic,” said Reed, who began working at the medical mall as a housekeeper in 2010 and rose through the ranks to become chief operating officer of the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation. “I had never seen the lights out. And so to see the lights out, you know, it was kind of a day like, ‘this is real.’” 
UMMC declined to answer any of Mississippi Today’s questions about its decision to leave the mall, future involvement at the mall or the impact that the changes will have on patients. 
Since the late 1990s, the medical mall has stood as an access point to health care and an economic anchor in a majority-Black neighborhood in Jackson with a high concentration of people living in poverty. People from across Jackson and Mississippi have also come to the mall to receive care. 
Jackson lawmakers argue that the loss of health care services will negatively affect patients who rely on the mall for health services and on the neighborhood as a whole.

“The impact is going to be very severe on that area,” Rep. Chris Bell, D-Jackson, told Mississippi Today. “Not only just in the face of the residents who need medical services, but in the whole aspect of an empty medical mall with no cars, or very few vehicles in there, which shows no life, which adds opportunities for crime.” 
As Reed walked through the medical mall, she greeted each person she saw: patients, shop owners and fellow staff members. She picked crumpled receipts off the floor and threw them in the waste bin. The mall has grown into a home for her, she said. 
She has watched the mall adapt before, but the loss of primary care, pediatrics and other clinical services at the medical mall is one of the most significant adjustments the medical mall has yet faced. 
“We will persevere,” she said. “… One closed door is an opportunity for another open door.” 
A long history
When Jackson Mall opened its doors in 1970, it was the first shopping mall in Mississippi, drawing customers from across the state. But it didn’t take long for business to falter with the opening of Metrocenter Mall in 1978 and Northpark Mall in Ridgeland in 1984.
By the 1990s, the mall was largely vacant, with only a few tenants left. 
“The mall was but a skeleton of its onetime glory, surrounded by a decaying neighborhood,” wrote journalist Bill Minor in a 1998 column for the Clarion-Ledger. “For more than a decade it stood as a sort of elephant’s graveyard, a gargantuan relic of urban blight and a breeding ground for crime.”
Legislators and local leaders considered a range of failed proposals to revitalize the property in the late 1980s and 1990s. Plans proffered included a public arts school, an office building for state agencies, a federal Department of Defense accounting center, a latex glove plant and a temporary jail to ease prison crowding.

But the idea for Jackson Medical Mall, Executive Director Primus Wheeler recounted, was devised in an unexpected manner: drafted on a Piccadilly cafeteria napkin during a lunch meeting of Dr. Aaron Shirley, the first Black UMMC resident and then director of Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center, and Ruben Anderson, the first African American Supreme Court Justice in Mississippi. 
Anderson said it didn’t exactly happen that way, and he doesn’t remember the napkin. But a lunch at Picadilly’s – which has remained a tenant at the mall since 1970 – did launch the vision: a multi-institution medical and commercial facility that would bring together UMMC, Jackson State University and Tougaloo College. Shirley passed away in 2014.
Jackson Medical Mall Foundation – a collaborative nonprofit helmed by board members from each academic institution – purchased the crumbling mall property for $2.7 million and its first health clinic opened its doors to patients in 1997. 
Members from each academic institution remain on the foundation’s board today. The property is now worth $77 million, said Wheeler. 
The mall addressed UMMC’s urgent need at the time for additional space to expand its outpatient clinics, and gave it room to open additional services, including a diabetes center, an adult day care center and a prevention and wellness program. When UMMC clinics opened at the mall, it was the hospital’s largest presence away from its main campus on North State Street. 
UMMC has invested a total of $200 million in the medical mall over the years, according to the medical center. 
The medical mall foundation has also redeveloped the area surrounding the mall by creating affordable housing, bringing a grocery store to the area and selling an old pawn shop to a local bank aiming to help low-income people access banking services. 
The mall has served as a model for similar facilities across the country. In 2013, researchers estimated that there were 28 such facilities in the U.S. 
“It is something that wasn’t supposed to happen, wasn’t supposed to be successful, but with all the partners working together, it became a great success story,” said Wheeler.

Health clinics’ departure
When Joey Goodsell began receiving cancer treatment at Jackson Medical Mall in 2023, he was impressed by the convenience of having all of his medical appointments housed at a single location. He was also struck by a palpable sense of community at the medical mall.
“It just felt like a neighborhood,” he said. 
But he has begun to notice changes. There are fewer cars in the parking lot, he said, and he recently received a notice that he will now have to go to UMMC’s main campus for certain health services.
UMMC has leased about half of the mall’s approximately 900,000 square feet of space since 2010. After May 2026, the medical center will maintain just 100,000 square feet of space at the mall, which will include renal and dialysis, dental, infectious disease, pharmacy, addiction and HIV services.
UMMC has shared little information publicly about their decision to leave the medical mall, but a February memo distributed to legislators outlined its plans to exit the mall in phases. 
UMMC will vacate unused, storage, administrative, education and subleased spaces in the mall by the end of this year, including clinic space subleased by Jackson-Hinds Comprehensive Health Center. The comprehensive health center has already removed adult medicine, cardiology, podiatry and social services from the mall. Its pediatrics clinic will leave in June and women’s health services by October.
UMMC will relocate the cancer center, OB-GYN and pain management services to its main campus by May 2026. 
In the memo shared with legislators, UMMC said that ongoing building infrastructure challenges at the mall have resulted in disruptions to UMMC business practices, and that the medical center has experienced challenges with city services including water, crime and aging roads and bridges in the surrounding area. 
Wheeler refuted these claims, saying that the building is in “great condition” because it was gutted in the late 1990s when the medical mall was created and has undergone constant renovations since then. The facility pumps in water delivered by tanker trucks when needed and crime is “basically nonexistent.” The mall has its own full-time security staff. 
“The place is just as solid and new as when it was first built in 1970,” he said. 
Mississippi Today spoke to patients from across the state who received health care services at Jackson Medical Mall. Many said they appreciated the convenience of the medical mall’s location and parking, clean facilities and the feeling of safety at the mall. But they also said some clinical services were crammed in areas that were too small, slowing patient visits, and that the roads around the facility are in disrepair. 
Goodsell said beyond a loss of convenience, he worries that the mall’s community will be lost once health services leave. 
“There’s this community that’s built up there, and people that have invested in putting a restaurant there,” he said. “And if all these people, if all the places move out of there, their livelihood is just evaporated.”
A ‘troubling trend’
At the same time that UMMC is scaling back services at Jackson Medical Mall, it is expanding outpatient clinical services in Ridgeland – a move that reflects a trend of UMMC outpatient clinics moving to wealthier, whiter areas in the Jackson suburbs. 
UMMC opened its Grant’s Ferry clinic in Flowood, which offers primary and specialty care, in 2010.

Earlier this year, UMMC opened Colony Park South, another clinic offering primary and specialty care services, in Ridgeland. The movement of services to the new location allowed medical mall clinics to move to UMMC’s main campus, said LouAnn Woodward in an email to UMMC faculty staff and students in April. UMMC plans to open another clinic in Ridgeland next year. 
Census tract data shows that the area Jackson Medical Mall is located in has a median household income of $22,500 and that 93% of residents are Black. By comparison, Grant’s Ferry and Colony Park South have median household incomes of $92,665 and $169,844, respectively, and over 70% of residents are white.
The movement of health care services out of Jackson and into the city’s suburbs is a “very troubling trend” and will make it more difficult for Jackson residents to access health services, said Sen. John Horhn, D-Jackson, who won the city’s Democratic primary race for mayor last month.
“We’re seeing a hollowing out of health care providers … being available in Jackson, and patients are feeling the brunt of that hardship upon them,” said Horhn.
UMMC provides a free shuttle every 30 minutes to Colony Park clinic locations from its main campus in Jackson, and many outpatient clinical services are offered at UMMC’s main campus in Jackson. 
The Legislature sought to limit UMMC’s expansion outside of Jackson this year by restricting the medical center’s exemption from requiring state approval to open new educational medical facilities. The bill would limit this exemption to areas around its main campus and the Jackson Medical Mall. Gov. Tate Reeves vetoed the legislation, saying he opposed another unrelated provision in the bill.
Bringing primary health care to the mall is a priority, said Wheeler, who envisions new health services opening in the mall, the space being transformed into senior or dormitory housing and the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation implementing more of its own programs. The foundation will soon open a 500-seat auditorium in the space that formerly housed UMMC’s conference center. 
Horhn said he hopes to see the medical mall house a workforce training facility. 
The future of the medical mall remains uncertain, but whatever comes next, the foundation’s goal is to remain an anchor in the community, said Reed, the foundation’s COO. 
“We don’t want to let Dr. Shirley’s vision die,” she said. 
But it is clear the medical mall will look different than it has for the past 25 years. 
“It will not be a medical mall,” Wheeler said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/03134337/3X0A2300.jpg,,,2025-05-22 12:18:28.365788

But hiring gaps remain, so some states also are trying another tactic: changing their standards.The changes in teacher training and licensing come amid widespread turmoil in public schools: Tax revenue is being siphoned toward private school vouchers in many states; some classrooms are being scrutinized for banned books, displays or teaching lessons that trip into diversity, equity and inclusion territory; and students who went through pandemic-era shutdowns are struggling both with sitting still and with learning the material.Some surveys show that fewer than a fifth of teachers are happy in their jobs.“Teaching is not seen as an attractive profession right now,” said Drew Gitomer, an expert on teaching assessment at Rutgers Graduate School of Education.“COVID exacerbated things, and teachers are caught in the middle of political battles — over curriculum, book bans, even personal attacks,” he said. “It’s not a healthy work environment, and that drives people away.”
Last year, Illinois enacted a law allowing teacher candidates to begin student teaching before passing content-area exams. It was an effort to reduce barriers for underrepresented groups, the measure’s sponsor said.A bill under consideration this year would give more districts discretion over whether to factor pupils’ test scores into teacher evaluations, a break from a 15-year-old mandate.In New Jersey, a new law formally removes the Praxis Core exam — traditionally used as an entry-level screening tool for aspiring teachers — from certification requirements.And in Nevada — one of the states hit hardest by teacher shortages — a bill would streamline licensure for incoming educators. The bill would allow teachers credentialed in other states to begin working in Nevada classrooms while awaiting formal approval.It also would remove extra steps for teachers switching grade levels and would waive application fees for recent substitute teachers.Linda Darling-Hammond, founding president and chief knowledge officer of the Learning Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said teacher shortages hit hardest in schools serving low-income students and students of color, where instability often leads to larger class sizes, canceled courses or a revolving door of substitute teachers.“When you walk into a school facing shortages, you see instability,” she said. “Students may be taught by people who don’t know what to do, who leave quickly, and who often rely more on discipline than engagement.”The root cause? Teacher attrition.Rapidly expanding school voucher programs pinch state budgets“Nine out of 10 vacancies every year are because of attrition — and two-thirds of that is not retirement,” Darling-Hammond said. “Support in the beginning matters. Teachers who come in and get a mentor stay longer. If you’re just thrown in to sink or swim, the odds of leaving are much greater.”States have long struggled to attract teachers, and credentialing changes aren’t unusual. But some education advocates fear long-term repercussions.Melissa Tooley, director of K-12 educator quality at the left-leaning think tank New America, said most states now offer alternative and fast-track teacher certification pathways, many of which allow candidates to start teaching with little or no pedagogical training in how to teach.“We’re churning through people who might have potential, but we’re not setting them up for success,” she said. “A lot of what states are doing is short term. It’s about filling seats, not necessarily building a sustainable or high-quality workforce.”More than 40 states require aspiring teachers to take the costly Praxis Subject test for the subject they want to teach, which some experts argue excludes strong candidates and duplicates other assessments.“You were excluding people who might be good teachers but didn’t do well on that specific test,” said Rutgers’ Gitomer, who has researched the test’s effects on recruitment.However, he added, dropping tests doesn’t necessarily help.Several states — Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Washington and Wisconsin — have dropped a licensure requirement known as edTPA since 2022, but there’s little evidence the move has helped ease teacher shortages, Gitomer said. (The acronym stands for Educative Teacher Performance Assessment and involves a portfolio that includes testing and videos of classroom performance.)Some states reexamine school discipline as Trump order paves go-ahead“The state eliminated edTPA but didn’t replace it with a specific alternative,” he said.“Instead, it gave full discretion back to individual institutions to develop or adopt their own performance assessments,” he said. “When we talked to institutions, it became pretty clear they didn’t think removing edTPA would be a major driver in addressing the shortage — and they haven’t seen evidence that it has been.” How best to credential Tooley said state credentialing systems must navigate a delicate balance: ensuring there are enough teachers, maintaining instructional quality and increasing workforce diversity.“There’s this triangle — three pieces that need to be in place — and I think there are real tensions when it comes to how states are designing their certification policies,” she said.And Gitomer described a fragmented national landscape, where some states are tightening teacher entry standards while others are dramatically loosening them — even allowing non-degreed individuals to teach.“Some states are trying to raise standards; others are relaxing them to the point where you may not even need a college degree,” he said.Indiana now requires all pre-K through grade 6 and special education teachers to complete 80 hours of training on the “science of reading,” a method that includes phonics, and pass an exam by 2027. State Sen. Jean Leising, a Republican, has proposed cutting the requirement in half, calling it “an excessive burden with little actual benefit” in a news release.In Texas, a bill aims to reduce the use of uncertified teachers by the 2029-30 school year. The legislation would set a gradual cap on the percentage of uncertified teachers districts can employ in core curriculum classes — starting at 20% in 2026-27 and decreasing to 5% in 2029-30.According to the Texas Education Agency, 31% of new hires in 2024-25 lacked a state teaching certificate or permit.Yet some states stand out for how they’re changing their requirements, Tooley said.She pointed to Washington, which has designed a recruitment strategy encouraging paraprofessionals, often known as teacher’s aides, to become classroom teachers. Also known as paraeducators, they’re a group with classroom experience, community ties and higher retention likelihood.There, school districts are required to offer foundational training — ranging from 14 to 28 hours — directly to paraeducators.Plagued by teacher shortages, some states turn to fast-track credentialingIn West Virginia, a new law now allows districts to count full-time behavior interventionists working in one or two classrooms toward meeting the required number of aides or paraprofessionals in K-3 classrooms.Tooley noted that Pennsylvania and Alabama are experimenting with “menu-style” licensing flexibility — allowing candidates to demonstrate qualification through various combinations of GPA and test scores, rather than rigid cutoffs.“These are people already in schools, often from the same cultural or linguistic backgrounds as students,” Tooley said. “They’re more likely to succeed and to stay.” Low pay A 2024 national survey by the EdWeek Research Center found that public school teachers are increasingly reporting declines in mental health, job satisfaction and classroom stability. Seventy percent of teachers recommended student mental health interventions, and nearly half said schools lack enough counselors, psychologists and social workers.As mental well-being has worsened, the share of public school teachers who are very satisfied with their jobs has also declined by 2 percentage points from the previous year, to 18%, according to the survey, which was conducted by the EdWeek Research Center on behalf of Merrimack College.While teacher wellness supports remain limited, educators say improvements in pay and student discipline are the most needed changes.To entice passionate but burned out educators from leaving the workforce, several states have raised minimum teacher pay. Arkansas boosted salaries to $50,000 statewide, and South Carolina raised starting pay to $47,000 this year, giving it a boost to $48,500 next school year. South Dakota enacted a $45,000 minimum with yearly increases, and penalties for districts that fail to comply by 2026. Connecticut advanced a bill setting a $63,450 salary floor, while Indiana and others are eyeing further increases.At the federal level, the proposed American Teacher Act seeks to establish a national $60,000 minimum salary for teachers at a qualifying school to boost recruitment and retention across the country. The bill, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Frederica Wilson, a Florida Democrat, remains in committee.Editor’s note: This story has been updated to reflect that South Carolina’s minimum teacher salaries will rise for next school year.

The call came ahead of a determinative U.S. House vote expected this week on what’s been dubbed “one big beautiful bill.”
The budget bill could drastically cut public programs like Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Kelly called the proposed bill “deeply unpopular.” Kelly, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham presented a united front of opposition to the bill.
“It is literally a tariff on every American, so that mega — the ultra rich — mega-billionaires and corporations get to have yet another tax break for many folks who already don’t pay taxes,” Lujan Grisham said.

The most recent version of the bill proposes around $700 billion in cuts to federal Medicaid subsidies, the largest in U.S. history, and $267 billion less in SNAP spending. A preliminary analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated that states will have to increase spending by a combined $78 million to offset cuts. It also offers complicated tax code modifications and an elimination of taxes on tips and overtime.
The budget office wrote Tuesday that the bill increases resources for households in the highest 10% of earners, while household resources would decrease for those in the lowest 10% of earners.
SNAP in Colorado benefits 584,500 Colorado residents, or about 1 in 10 people in the state, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Most of those people are in families with children.
Lost Medicaid access would cause citizens to choose between which bills to pay and which medications households can afford, Whitmer, the Michigan governor, said.
“We should be working across the aisle to make health care better and easier to afford,” Whitmer said.
Polis, the Colorado governor, said each proposal this year to cut Medicaid has been “dangerous.” Echoing Kelly, he said states don’t have the money to mitigate cuts and rollbacks to health care.
“They’re basically asking states to do their dirty work for them,” he said.
The Republican Governors Association, in a Tuesday letter signed by 20 governors and addressed to President Donald Trump, remained in support of the bill.
“This landmark piece of legislation embodies your powerful vision to bring about the next great American revival,” the letter said. “It truly delivers on the bold promises all Republicans made to the American people to restore the security, prosperity, and fiscal sanity for our nation.”
 Medicaid ‘a lifeline’

Staff with Alliance for a Healthy Kansas, a statewide Medicaid advocacy organization, traveled to Washington, D.C., this week to urge the state’s congressional delegation to expand Medicaid access. Kansas is one of 10 states in the country that have not expanded Medicaid through the Affordable Care Act to include low-income adults. The state’s lack of expansion has been billed by Republicans as a benefit in the face of Congress’ drastic cuts.
“That is just false,” Kelly said. “The fact of the matter is we have left $8 billion Kansas taxpayer dollars back in Washington, D.C., that’s been distributed to 40 other states that did expand Medicaid for them to take care of their people and for them to expand their economies, while we sit here in Kansas trying to make do on what we’ve got.”
Millions across the country will lose coverage as a result of Medicaid cuts, said April Holman, executive director of the alliance.
The alliance visited with people in each of Kansas’ five congressional districts, speaking with more than 200 Kansans who informed a 12-page booklet that alliance staff gave to each federal representative.
“Medicaid is not just a budget line — it’s a lifeline,” Holman said in a news release. “We came to Washington to ensure that the voices of Kansans are being heard by federal lawmakers. The proposed House cuts will undermine Medicaid and put lives at risk.”

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling striking down a religious charter school will stand after the nation’s highest court deadlocked on the issue.
The U.S. Supreme Court announced Thursday its justices voted 4-4 with Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused. A tied vote affirms the lower court’s ruling.
The Oklahoma Supreme Court decided last year that the concept of a publicly funded Catholic charter school is unconstitutional. St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would have been the first of its kind in the nation.
The Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa sought to open the school to offer a free Catholic education to students in all parts of the state. St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and operated according to church teachings. 
The Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board voted in 2023 to approve opening the school. Attorney General Gentner Drummond asked the state Supreme Court to intervene, calling the school unconstitutional and a threat to religious liberty.
Catholic officials appealed the state Supreme Court ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case April 30.
Attorneys representing the school and the statewide board contend charter schools are not truly public schools but rather private entities contracting with the state, who therefore should be free to adopt a religion.
During oral arguments in Washington, D.C., the Court appeared to be divided on the case. Liberal justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson made their doubts clear on St. Isidore while some of the conservative justices, particularly Justice Brett Kavanaugh, signaled support.

TOPEKA — The Kansas congressional delegation split along party lines on the narrowly passed U.S. House budget bill delivering tax breaks endorsed by President Donald Trump while stripping health care and food assistance from lower-income families.
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat who serves the 3rd District in the Kansas City area, said Congress and Trump should be focused on making life more affordable for families rather than lining pockets of “billionaires and big corporations” with more than $1 trillion in tax giveaways.
“I support responsible government spending. We should be cracking down on things like waste and fraud and abuse,” Davids said. “This budget is not just out of touch. It’s dangerous, irresponsible and means higher costs for hardworking Kansans.”
Specifically, Davids said the House Republican budget package would sever health coverage to 16,000 people in her congressional district by altering the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid. She said a decline in the reach of Medicaid dollars would echo through communities and erode quality of life, especially in rural areas of the state where half of hospitals were at risk of shutting down.
A provision in the House bill would drop an estimated 8,000 households in her district from emergency food assistance, Davids said.
“People shouldn’t have to choose between putting food on the table and seeing a doctor,” the congresswoman said. “Folks shouldn’t have to drive hours just to get basic care because their local hospital shut down.”
 
GOP applauds vote
The bill sent to the U.S. Senate had backing of Republican U.S. Reps. Tracey Mann of the 1st District running from Dodge City to Lawrence, Derek Schmidt of the eastern Kansas 2nd District and Ron Estes of the 4th District encircling Wichita. On Thursday, the legislation passed 215-214.
Trump and GOP House leadership struggled to appease conservative holdouts who sought to pair tax cuts with deeper spending reductions along with investments in border security and the military. Democrats objected to reductions for energy, education and food assistance programs as well as Medicaid.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the deal could add $2.3 trillion to the national debt in the next decade.
Estes said the “one big, beautiful bill,” which combined 11 different pieces of legislation, was significant because it would extend tax cuts initiated during Trump’s first term as president. The legislation addressed wasteful federal spending and poured money into border security, he said.
“It’s a bill that meets the mandate provided to this Congress by the American people last November,” Estes said. “It’s a bill for the American people, and my friends on the left have only empty talking points to try and paint this legislation as something that it’s not.”
Estes said it was wrong for a “cast of deceivers” to “dupe Americans by promoting the extension of the law as a tax giveaway for millionaires and billionaires, which it isn’t.” He said Americans earning $30,000 to $80,000 annually would pay 15% less in federal taxes in 2027. That’s nearly double the percentage reduction for individuals earning more than $1 million per year, he said.
Mann said the package invested $60 billion to expand crop insurance for farmers, supported trade promotion programs in response to the agricultural trade deficit and cut $295 billion in “wasteful and fraudulent spending” within the agriculture budget.
He said the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP or food stamps, would be reformed to make certain able-bodied adults were working or volunteering to qualify for food aid.
“On November 5, 2024, 77 million Americans gave Washington, D.C., a mandate to get our country back on track,” Mann said. “I am hopeful the Senate will move quickly to get this bill over the finish line and look forward to President Trump signing it into law.”
 
Personal perspectives
During a news conference Wednesday hosted by Davids, Kansans explained how they would be impacted by the bill’s reduction in Medicaid funding by an estimated $625 billion during the next decade.
Lenexa residents Mark and Patty Hink, parents of 49-year-old son Brian with intellectual disabilities, epilepsy and diabetes, said Medicaid was essential to providing him around-the-clock care due to the threat of seizures. Services provided Brian under Medicaid were a lifeline to the community, Mark Hink said.
“Otherwise, these disabled adults would be homebound with parents who are aging and can’t provide the level of care that is needed,” he said.
Corey Craig, chief executive officer of Monarch Hospice & Palliative Care, said he was anxious reductions to federal spending on Medicaid would “marginalize a group that is already kind of marginalized, especially in rural communities.”
“I’m here to advocate for, at least at the minimum, keeping things the same because we are doing our best out here to try to service our rural communities,” he said. “They do deserve care, just like anyone else.”
Samantha Armistead, an Overland Park resident, has an adult sibling with intellectual disabilities enrolled in Kansas’ Medicaid program. He receives funding for adult day services that allow him to engage in meaningful work and interact with people in the community.
“Connor currently lives with our parents, and this arrangement works well for now,” Armistead said. “However, our parents are getting older. We know this arrangement is not sustainable long term. He deserves the opportunity to live a meaningful life with dignity and connection. I’m heartbroken, terrified and angry that many of our representatives in D.C. are working to deny basic care for our most vulnerable populations.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Davids-and-kansans-on-medicaid-cuts-1024x592.png,,,2025-05-22 11:03:55.131210

Thirty percent of the Massachusetts population (2.1 million residents out of 7.1 million) are on Medicaid. 
The post ‘Pay now or pay greater later’: Mass. health centers CEO warns Medicaid cuts will lead to higher costs and strain to health system  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE CROWD, gathered inside the Omni Boston hotel in the city’s Seaport district on Tuesday night, represented the various sectors of the Massachusetts economy, from health care and academia to financial services and real estate. As the attendees of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting mingled, talk inevitably turned to what’s happening in Washington, DC. They are “trying to figure out the impacts of the executive orders, the direction of the tariffs, and the wide range of decisions coming out of Congress and out of the White House, what the implications are for their various sectors,” said Michael Curry, who was among three people honored that evening by the chamber as a “Distinguished Bostonian.” Curry, 56, has spent nearly 30 years walking around Capitol Hill, Boston City Hall, and the State House on Beacon Hill. He rose through the ranks of the Massachusetts League of Community Health Centers, becoming the president and CEO of the group in 2021. The organization represents 52 health centers that serve more than one million patients. His economic sector, health care, is affected like all the others by congressional chainsaws and White House whipsawing, and community health centers are considering partnerships, mergers, and acquisitions, with implications for their patients. “I can tell you who our patients are,” Curry said. “These are people who need access. They’re disproportionately poor. Up to 60 percent of our patients are people of color. They’re immigrants.” It’s a population in need of MassHealth, the state’s Medicaid health insurance program geared towards low-income residents. The largest program in the state’s annual budget, MassHealth is also heavily dependent on money coming from the federal government. Thirty percent of the Massachusetts population (2.1 million residents out of 7.1 million) are on Medicaid. Forty-eight percent of Massachusetts children are covered by MassHealth, according to a Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts Foundation report.  With Medicaid on the chopping block as House GOP lawmakers advanced a spending bill, potentially leading to millions of people across the country losing coverage, Curry sat down with CommonWealth Beacon to delve into what’s happening in DC and how it could affect Massachusetts. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. COMMONWEALTH BEACON: Can you describe the issue at a 30,000-foot level? MICHAEL CURRY: I have to remind people I don’t care if you’re a Republican, Democrat, MAGA, super liberal, whatever the polar opposites of that spectrum would be, the bottom line is, if you don’t have health insurance, you don’t get care. Not until it’s critical to get care, which means that you have less chance of survival, which means you suffer longer. And as human beings, we should want that for no one. So our goal should be to make sure that people have a primary care provider, that they can get their cancer diagnosed at stage one instead of stage four, that they can manage that diabetes or that heart disease or that asthma, and you can’t do that without a card in your pocket, without insurance. The quote that I often say is, “Pay now or pay greater later.” The whole notion of that is, we can keep the cost down, you can get care at a health center. It’s saving by keeping you out of the emergency room or inpatient in a hospital for weeks and days, weeks and months, for your illness. Paying now or pay greater later is not just about money, but labor productivity. It’s also about the lives of the folks that we expect to be in our labs, to be driving our trains, or picking our fruit and vegetables, and teaching our classes. CWB: President Trump met with House Republicans and said basically don’t mess with Medicaid. But it seems like there are moves to still cut or touch it. How do you interpret that? CURRY: We have to all come to a common definition on what “touch” means. I think there’s a fundamental disagreement on what would be undermining and disruptive to Medicaid as we know it today, in a way that is not in the best interest of Americans. And part of that is work requirements, any administrative complexities that drive people off coverage, that they’ll get lost and again, pay now or pay greater later. We’ll see them elsewhere, at higher cost settings, or they’ll prematurely die. CWB: What’s the issue with work requirements? CURRY: Most people on Medicaid already work. Many jobs don’t pay you well enough to afford insurance. We know that there is a pervasive problem in this country of underinsurance or employers who avoid providing health coverage because there’s a pretty high cost to provide health insurance for your employees. And then you add the average employer, there’s a 10 percent increase for employers every year on insurance coverage that you offer your employees. To some degree that’s not even sustainable, right? So more and more of your overall budget, nonprofit and for-profit, is health insurance coverage. The concern is that if you start tightening the requirements, and you start adding too many administrative complexities, like work requirements, people churn off of Medicaid, and now they’re uncompensated care. So the worst scenario is that a person no longer has Medicaid, and now we’re still paying for it anyway, because now they’re showing up more sick and in settings where states end up having to – as our state has the health safety net – to cover that care through that mechanism, which is already underfunded and in financial distress. Now you’re driving more people to episodic and emergency care, which is not what we want to do as a system. And work requirements, it won’t increase employment, it’ll just decrease coverage.  CWB: What would the federal cuts mean for Massachusetts if they go through? CURRY: It would be unsustainable without the federal partnership, the federal funds. So, you cut programs, right? You might cut benefits, right? Oral health under Medicaid is an optional program, optional coverage. And states like Massachusetts could choose to not cover oral health, which means that that’s an implication for health centers [which also provide dental care], because now our patients couldn’t go and get coverage or care, then have their insurance provide the health center with reimbursement for their oral health.The post ‘Pay now or pay greater later’: Mass. health centers CEO warns Medicaid cuts will lead to higher costs and strain to health system  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Michael-Curry-MassGovernor-Flickr-feed.jpg?fit=1024%2C662&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-22 11:03:55.131210

In April, the Trump administration paused funding to the center, which is the nation’s largest and longest-running training program for early-career scientists and hub for research on heart disease in African Americans. 
In total, 36 college students lost their scholarships. Five staff members, including White, lost their jobs. As a result of the cuts, the center planned to end its undergraduate training program later this summer. 
Then came the whiplash. The administration reversed its decision in May. Relief. 
White is “cautiously optimistic” about the $1.7 million grant’s renewal and the future of this program that has been the crown jewel for this small, private, historically Black liberal arts college in Jackson, Mississippi. 
“It’s been a roller coaster of emotions ranging from gratefulness to frightening,” White said. 
Since January, federal agencies like the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation have slashed millions of dollars in grants and contracts to comply with federal directives to end research on diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as the study of misinformation. 
Some colleges have lost federal funds in President Donald Trump’s first 100 days of office. Others are trimming already lean budgets and launching fundraising campaigns to prepare for the worst, according to Inside Higher Ed.  
While Trump has signed executive orders supporting HBCUs to “promote excellence and innovation,” the cuts to federal agencies and programs have had a chilling effect at these schools, which are already dealing with decades of underfunding. HBCU professors and graduates say the losses have greater potential for harm and eliminate professional opportunities for students. 
Millions of dollars are potentially at risk. This year, Jackson State University received $7.2 million in federal research from NIH. Tougaloo College received $10 million.  
Low hanging fruit
White and other professors believe their grants were pulled because of words like  “race” or “gender” in the award’s abstract. 
“[These federal agencies] are going for the low-hanging fruit,” Bryon D’Andra Orey, political science professor at Jackson State University, said. “Our grants are on the chopping blocks simply because they are under this umbrella of D.E.I.”

Orey received an email in late April from JSU’s Office of Research that his $510,000 National Science Foundation Build and Broaden (B2) grant was terminated. In 2021, the grant was awarded to study the emotional and psychological toll of racial discrimination and trauma on African Americans participating in democratic and political activities such as voting and activism. 
The research produced new insights on understanding racial disparities in the United States. It has also led to collaborations with prominent research institutions such as the University of Michigan. The collaboration brought resources, professional development, staffing and support that JSU lacked. 
Since the grant was awarded four years ago, 21 students have taken the seminar and graduated. It has provided exceptional learning opportunities and exposed students to new career possibilities, Orey said. 
“I’ve had students who have taken my classes apply to law schools, competitive Ph.D.  programs at Ivy leagues and get into congressional public policy and advocacy work,” Orey said. “They get to see career avenues other than federal government jobs.” 
A whole new world 
Michael J. Cleveland, a graduate of Tougaloo College, benefited from these types of programs and mentorship. Cleveland trained as an undergraduate from 2014-2017 through the Jackson Heart Study program. He had opportunities to shadow medical professionals at hospitals and clinics.

In his sophomore year, he decided becoming a doctor wasn’t for him. Cleveland received guidance from his professors to pursue apprenticeships in community and public health research in Jackson. 
The course work and curriculum as an undergraduate set him apart from his peers at Morehouse School of Medicine when Cleveland applied to get his master’s degree in public health. It eventually led him to become the first African American healthcare executive administrative fellows at Salem Health Hospital and Clinic System in Oregon. 
The need for public health professionals of color in healthcare and medical settings is more important than ever, Cleveland said. 
“Being a JHS scholar opened me up to a whole new world,” said Cleveland, who is now the chief operating officer of Care Alliance Health Center, a community health center in Cleveland, Ohio. “I’ve accomplished all of who I am at 30 because of this program.”  
Future of research
Last month, Trump signed a new executive order that pledged to continue two existing White House efforts to support HBCUs during his first term in office. 
The White House Initiative on HBCUs aims to increase funding, improve infrastructure and provide access to professional development opportunities for students in fields such as technology, healthcare and finance. And the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs will include appointed members who will sit in the U.S. Department of Education and is meant to guide the administration’s efforts on supporting these institutions. 
“[The administration] is saying something on paper and in theory, but their actions aren’t aligned,” White said. “You can’t say you support [HBCUs] when you are cutting student loans, financial aid, research and other programs that support these students and institutions.” 
While the future of this program remains unclear, she warned of the larger, overlooked impacts of potential cuts to this undergraduate program: It could mean the end to a unique collaboration between two HBCUs and a predominantly white institution in the state. 
When the Jackson Heart Study began in the late 90s, it brought Jackson State University, a public HBCU, Tougaloo College and University of Mississippi Medical Center, a predominantly white medical school, together to create a first-of-its-kind partnership. 
The goal was to provide funding in research for the colleges, and promote careers in public health to students. Eliminating this partnership could undermine NIH’s credibility and a symbol of racial progress in Mississippi, White said. 
“We’ve spent more than two decades focusing on overcoming that legacy of medical mistrust for people in this city,” White said. “A move like this could set back decades of science and health research for this country. I just want us to ask, what are we doing about this?”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/06160710/Wendy-White-3.jpg,,,2025-05-22 11:03:55.131210

This month an investment firm connected to the Abu Dhabi royal family announced it was using the WLF's USD1 stablecoin to make a $2 billion investment in a crypto exchange.Neither Catherine Cortez Masto nor Jacky Rosen were in the U.S. Senate when the Commodity Futures Modernization Act was passed a quarter century ago.
But both were in Nevada when Las Vegas was an epicenter for the wildly irresponsible mortgage backed derivatives market that did so much to cause the Great Recession that hit Nevada harder and longer than any other state.
The Commodity Futures Modernization Act is what deregulated and hence led to the explosion — and then implosion — of the  derivatives market.
Which is to say of all the U.S. senators, the two from Nevada should be especially wary of approving weak federal regulations that promote the growth of exotic financial instruments because an industry told them to.
And yet here we go again.
Stable genius
Early this week, Cortez Masto and Rosen were among 16 Senate Democrats voting with all the Republicans to advance the GENIUS Act, a Trump-endorsed gift to the cryptocurrency industry. Crypto-folk are eager to see the bill enacted in the current Congress because they fear Democrats will regain control of the U.S. House in next year’s midterm elections, the industry’s window of opportunity will close, and the legislation will never make it to Trump’s desk. 
(The industry may be underestimating congressional Democratic inclination to curry favor with, or at least try not to upset, extremely deep-pocketed industry political action committees, but I digress).
The legislation will promote the growth of a particular strain of cryptocurrency, stablecoin, by accelerating its integration with the U.S. financial system, while exempting it from regulatory requirements and consumer protections administered by (what’s left of) the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Earlier this month, all the Senate Democrats, joined by two Republicans, temporarily blocked the legislation. At the time, Democrats cited the bill’s failure to rein in the ongoing and unprecedented level of White House corruption made possible by Donald Trump and his family’s entry into the cryptocurrency industry, including stablecoin, enabling billionaires, dictators, and unsavory characters worldwide to enrich Trump in exchange for favors right there on their phones.
Yet the slightly revised version of the legislation Cortez Masto, Rosen and 14 other Senate Democrats accepted Monday “does nothing—nothing—to rein in the President’s crypto corruption,” said Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren in a floor speech rallying a majority of her fellow Democrats to vote against the legislation.
“This is not the first time Congress listened to the financial industry and created a weak regulatory regime for a new, innovative financial product,” Warren warned her colleagues. “We’ve seen this story before, and we know how it ends.” 
Warren, whose sharp critique of policies that led to the Great Recession heightened her national profile in the late aughts, reminded the senators of the Commodities Futures Modernization Act which passed during the last year of the Clinton Administration. 
At that time people said “surely some kind of regulatory framework was better than nothing,” Warren noted, “so Congress created a weak set of rules that was loaded with loopholes – just as the industry wanted. The result was a disaster: derivatives moved from the edge of the financial system to the center of it.”
“Now we are back, doing the same thing yet again,” Warren said.
As if underscoring Warren’s point — that people are yet again saying something’s better than nothing — Cortez Masto said in a statement provided by her office Wednesday that Congress needs “to do more to regulate cryptocurrencies” and the GENIUS Act is “the first step to ensure stablecoins issued in the United States are not used to scam or defraud people or facilitate illicit finance, while also providing regulatory clarity our domestic industry needs to innovate here at home.”
Similarly, Rosen’s office provided a statement Wednesday saying cryptocurrency “is an emerging industry that is in urgent need of regulation” and Rosen  “voted to advance bipartisan legislation to open the door for regulating cryptocurrency. This bill is not the only action Congress should take on crypto regulation, but it is an important step to protect consumers and support America’s innovation.”
Both statements from Nevada’s senators echo the industry narrative, also fully embraced by Trump, that stablecoin and other variations of crypto are a vital innovation that must be promoted in the name of the national interest.
And both statements, again echoing the industry narrative, fail to clearly explain why that is.
All hype, no pulp
Cryptocurrency is undoubtedly a growth industry. But as it increasingly integrates into the financial system, one signature characteristic it brings along is extreme volatility. (Related note: Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange, became the first exchange to be added to the S&P 500 this week, so there’s a good chance crypto is now in your retirement fund.)
In addition to volatility — and of course crypto bros, who will be convening in Las Vegas next week for the Super Bowl of crypto — cryptocurrency is also famous for money laundering and fraud schemes. (On comparably rare occasions it also serves its long ago originally advertised use, as a legitimate alternative form of payment for a product or a service.)
But far and away its largest use is as just another speculative investment, like, oh, orange juice futures, except with no correlation to anything that exists in the material world; for breakfast, nobody orders a glass of fresh squeezed hype.
When members of Congress talk about innovation and, as Rosen put it, “an emerging industry,” they are implying there is some magical but practical and immensely useful economic function only crypto can do.
Meanwhile, the wider world awaits clearly articulated instruction on what indispensable (yet legal) thing crypto can do that oldy timey money can’t, and why it isn’t doing it already. 
To be fair, there is one function that, while not new or unique — every industry does it — is something the crypto industry has proven it can do uniquely well: Raise money to spend against candidates that don’t support the industry’s agenda.
As many of you will recall, the cryptocurrency industry’s PAC raised more money during the 2024 election cycle than any other industry in the U.S.
A common critique is that congressional Democratic support for the cryptocurrency industry’s political and regulatory agenda, which is also Trump’s agenda, is driven not by a vision of crypto playing a beneficial role in the economy and making the world a better place, but fear of the industry’s campaign spending. 
Cortez Masto and Rosen were asked to respond to that critique. In their statements provided by their offices, the request was ignored.
The GENIUS Act still needs to survive another Senate vote. Cortez Masto and Rosen are obviously voting for it. Maybe they think there’s no way playing laissez faire footsy with investment erotica could upend the entire financial system and crash the economy yet again, let alone so soon. What are the odds?
Maybe they’re right.
But that still leaves another disturbing matter, a broader concern that isn’t crypto-specific. 
People who didn’t vote for Trump (a majority of voters and a supermajority of the population) have been wondering if and when Democrats might start standing up to him in an effective way. Democrats have sworn repeatedly they will do that, but have also lamented that they have been presented precious few opportunities to actually thwart Trump because Republicans control all the things.
The GENIUS Act needs to pass the Senate with 60 votes. It’s an outstanding chance for Democrats to block a Trump/Republican agenda item that most Senate Democrats think is not in the nation’s best interest. 
But some Senate Democrats are going to vote for it and give Trump the win anyway. That includes both senators from Nevada, who more than any other U.S. senators should know better.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Image-5-22-25-at-5.51-AM-1024x603.jpeg,,,2025-05-22 10:11:45.440832
