Backyard birding can be a wonderful winter pastime, but it’s important to do it safely — for your sake and the birds’.

Jillian Kilborn is particularly excited to put up her bird feeders this year. Food shortages up north are expected to send winter finches to Vermont for the season, meaning that she could see Red Crossbills and Pine Grosbeaks in her yard for the first time since 2021. 
Birders call it the “finch irruption.” 
“We were home on a consistent basis because of Covid, so I really kind of got to engage with the birds that were coming that winter,” she said. “And it was really cool, because we had big flocks of all those species. So I’m just hopeful that we’re going to see the same thing this winter.”
Kilborn isn’t just an avid birder; she’s a bird biologist for the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife, meaning that she has a fascination with studying how birds interact with their environment. 
“There’s so many different species that use so many different types of habitats that it’s just every day I’m learning something new,” she said. 
While birds don’t need backyard feeders to survive, Kilborn said, the activity is a great way to interact with nature from the comfort of your own home.
But the department also has an unofficial motto: “feed birds, not bears,” Jaclyn Comeau, the black bear project leader for the department, said via email. Cold temperatures and snowy days are the only time when Vermonters can feel safe putting up bird feeders without the fear of unwanted bear visitors, Joshua Morse, spokesperson for the Department of Fish and Wildlife, said in an email. 
If you’re thinking of putting up a bird feeder this year, here are some tips about how to do it safely and what else to know about getting into backyard birding.

When is it safe to start putting out food for birds?
Bears find the most common types of bird food very tasty, according to the department’s website. They’re particularly fond of suet and black oil sunflower seeds and will sniff out even the remnants of seed left on the ground around a feeder. 
Department officials have previously said that the number of human-bear interactions has been on the rise for the past decade, leading to bears being killed. 
So the department recommends that Vermonters limit their bird feeding to the season when bears are in hibernation, which generally runs from the beginning of December to the end of March. Morse wrote that the recent cold snap has made it the perfect time to start feeding. 
“We still recommend people keep an eye on local conditions though,” he said. “If you’re in a place where there’s still not snow on the ground and the temps are spiking above freezing on the regular, best to hold off.”
Comeau wrote that you should also keep an eye on whether your neighbors have had any bear visits. If you hear of any bear activity, the department asks that you take your feeders down and wait until at least a week has passed without any new signs or sightings. 
“Lack of food is a major factor that drives bears into their winter dens and artificial food sources like birdfeeders can incentivize bears to remain active,” she said. 
What about the risk of bird flu?
In 2022, the department asked Vermonters to hold off on feeding birds at all because of the risk of bird flu, which can spread through bird feeders that become hotspots of bird activity. 
Wild birds are less susceptible to bird flu than domesticated poultry, but they can become vectors that spread the disease to local poultry farms, Kilborn said via email. 
But Morse said that bird flu, while still circulating in Vermont, is not as bad as it was in previous years, and the department isn’t issuing guidance for bird flu at this time. 
He noted that it’s still important to clean feeders regularly to prevent disease transmission. The department’s website recommends cleaning your feeder about once a month with diluted bleach or dish detergent and hot water, then rinsing them and drying them off thoroughly before putting them back outside. 
Kilborn said via email that Vermonters should keep an eye out for dead birds that can be a sign of bird flu in the community. If you find multiple dead birds at a feeder, you should take the feeders down for at least two weeks and clean them before you put them back up, along with reporting it to the department.

What birds can I expect in my backyard this year?
The Finch Research Network has a full breakdown on its website of the winter finch species coming to the area. But that’s just the beginning of the many birds that inhabit Vermont backyards. 
More than 200 bird species have been documented in Vermont, according to the department, but not all of them have a tendency to wander close to humans. The department has downloadable checklists of birds to get you started with the most common species. 
Kilborn recommended the Cornell Lab of Ornithology’s bird identification app, Merlin Bird ID, to help figure out what birds you’re seeing in your yard or in the wild. In fact, the department uses the app’s data from its “Feeder Watch” to analyze the patterns of different species in Vermont. 
The Audubon Society chapter in Vermont also has many resources on backyard birding in the state, including opportunities to contribute to conservation and research. It hosts an annual Christmas Bird Count to help track the distribution of wild birds in their wintertime habitats. 
What else can I do to foster a bird-friendly backyard?
Kilborn said there’s been a growing national movement to foster more wildlife-friendly environments in backyards. For most people, that means planting more native plants, maintaining ecological diversity, and participating in “No Mow May,” a monthlong pause in mowing to give insects a home. 
Seed-bearing and fruit-bearing native plants are great for local bird populations, she said. She also recommended lowering pesticide use to prevent killing the insects that birds feed on. 
Even small changes can be helpful. In her own backyard, Kilborn tries to mow around flowers when they’re in bloom and only mows them after they’ve faded. 
“I personally think it’s more interesting to look at pretty flowers and different things going on, and it draws all sorts of different things to the yard that are using it,” she said. 
Along with her platform feeder, Kilborn maintains chickadee boxes, a house wren box and a kestrel box that she’s put up for nesting birds. The department has resources on nesting boxes, native plants and more tips for a wildlife-friendly backyard on its website. 
“I just feel really fortunate to be able to get a glimpse and learn about (birds) on a day to day basis and try and make it better,” Kilborn said. “That’s kind of what keeps me going.”

The ice cream plant in Waterbury topped the list released this month by the state with 130 violations, due to a failure to submit a number of sampling reports.

This story by Lisa Scagliotti was first published in The Waterbury Roundabout on Dec. 22, 2025.
A state announcement of industrial wastewater pretreatment permit violations reports that Ben & Jerry’s ice cream plant in Waterbury topped the list of 17 companies that logged infractions in 2024. 
The Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation oversees the industrial pretreatment program in coordination with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
Federal rules require the state to publicly report significant non-compliance each year. 
The data review and report for 2024, released on Dec. 12 by the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation, lists 17 permittees found to be “in significant non-compliance during the 2024 reporting year.”
Department Commissioner Misty Sinsigalli said the state views the industrial facilities that hold such permits “as key partners in environmental stewardship,” guided by specific requirements they must follow. 
“Fulfilling these permit requirements is how we work together to safeguard the health of Vermont’s lakes, rivers, and wetlands,” Sinsigalli said.
Industrial facilities such as breweries, dairy processing plants, and metal finishers receive pretreatment permits to discharge wastewater to municipal wastewater treatment facilities. The permits set discharge limits to prevent overloading the local wastewater treatment infrastructure. 
Garrett Walsh, pretreatment coordinator with the state’s Wastewater Management Program, explained that the permitting process aims to track industrial wastewater, which ultimately is discharged into Vermont’s rivers and lakes. Big industrial entities that generate large quantities of wastewater are required to have systems on site to pretreat their wastewater before it’s sent into the municipal systems in the communities where they are located. 
“Proper pretreatment helps ensure safe discharges from wastewater treatment facilities into our waterways,” Walsh said. “Without timely and accurate reports, DEC cannot properly manage its pretreatment program.”
As part of the permit requirements, the permittees must submit monthly reports, report instances of non-compliance, and not exceed limits for pollutants set in their permits. Some examples of pollutants are nutrients, heavy metals, and biochemical oxygen demand (a measure of how waste impacts a water body’s oxygen content).
State officials explained that significant non-compliance can occur when facilities discharge a pollutant that causes imminent risk to human health, or discharge pollutants that exceed their permit limits. Other examples of permit violations cover instances when permit-holders fail to submit monthly reports and other required documentation on time.
Violations involve reporting, not overflows
The list released this month by the state shows that six companies in 2024 exceeded the wastewater discharge limits and/or did not meet their requirements for monitoring set in their permits. Ben & Jerry’s Waterbury ice cream plant topped that list with 130 violations. 
In Ben & Jerry’s case, the permit violations did not pertain to its Waterbury plant exceeding its wastewater output limits. 
“It was due to a personnel issue,” said Heather Collins, the state’s Wastewater Management Program Manager. “It was not a flow issue.”
Ben & Jerry’s spokesman Sean Greenwood confirmed that the company failed to meet some of its reporting requirements last year. 
“In 2024, a routine internal audit of our wastewater treatment facility revealed that several required reports had not been submitted to the state. We notified state officials and began a thorough review of our practices,” Greenwood said. “It is important to note that at no time did Ben & Jerry’s release wastewater amounts exceeding permitted limits.”
Ben & Jerry’s staff failed to submit a number of sampling reports in 2024. Collins said the 130 violations were for 24 missed reports on suspended solids, 12 on biochemical oxygen demand, two on total phosphorous and 92 daily reports on pH levels. The other seven violations for Ben & Jerry’s cited in the state’s announcement pertained to monthly reports not filed on time.
Each wastewater pretreatment permit has specific requirements around reporting information to regulators, Collins explained. 
“It’s easy to rack up that many violations if you have a daily requirement to collect and analyze some type of sample,” she said. 
Each report has a required deadline, after which state regulators review the reports. 
“If it’s 30 days past that date, if we haven’t received a report then you’re reporting late,” she said. 
Once Ben & Jerry’s managers were aware of the reporting lapses, they turned their attention to improving their process for reporting, including hiring a consultant for advice, Greenwood said. 
“We strengthened our operations, appointing a highly experienced Chief Wastewater Operator to best manage our operations moving forward, and engaged an independent environmental auditing firm to review our facilities and procedures,” he said. 
Regulators from both the state of Vermont and the federal EPA visited the Waterbury ice cream plant. Following those reviews, the company implemented all recommendations from the auditing firm, which included updating procedural safeguards, hiring the additional wastewater operator, and establishing a system of checks and balances for monthly report sign‑offs, Greenwood noted.  
Although all of the violations Ben & Jerry’s was cited for pertain to reporting and not exceeding the plant’s wastewater limits, Collins said it’s important for the state to have timely reports.
“When we don’t receive reports, and if they miss samples, I can’t say that they were within permits limits or not, because I have no sample to determine that,” Collins explained. “If you don’t collect samples, I can’t tell if they exceeded the limits.”
P. Howard “Skip” Flanders chairs the Board of Commissioners that oversees Waterbury’s Edward Farrar Utility District, which operates the municipal water and wastewater departments. He said issues with wastewater from the Ben & Jerry’s plant in the 1980s led to the company adding its pretreatment system around 1990 which has since worked well to prevent the industrial volumes from overburdening the municipal system. Flanders said there were no instances in 2024 or this year where the plant exceeded its wastewater output limits that resulted in EFUD exceeding its discharge limits.
The flow coming from the ice cream maker typically does not strain the EFUD system, Flanders said.  
“The Ben and Jerry’s volume is pretty well diluted when mixed and run through our lagoon system and then through the phosphorus removal process,” he explained. 
The rest of the list
The other six companies on the 2024 violations list for having exceeded their permit limits and/or not met their monitoring requirements and were found in significant non-compliance are: Metal stamping company New England Precision in Randolph with 68 violations; St. Albans Creamery in St. Albans, 23 violations; Butternut Mountain Farm maple sugar company in Morrisville, 16 violations; dairy cooperative Agri-Mark, Inc. in Middlebury, 14 violations; and Commonwealth Dairy in Brattleboro, nine violations, according to the state announcement. 
The state’s report also lists a total of 11 companies that did not submit monthly reports or other required documents on time, which constitutes significant non-compliance with their permit requirements. 
In this category, Ben & Jerry’s in Waterbury and Swan Valley Cheese of Vermont in Swanton each had seven violations. Ben & Jerry’s failed to submit seven monthly reports on time. Swan Valley missed making four monthly reports on time and had three other instances of failing to submit other documents, the list notes. Two other companies with reporting infractions in the same category included Lost Nation Brewery and Rock Art Brewery, both in Morrisville, with five and two reports not submitted on time, respectively. 
A third category in the state announcement notes that two companies — Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe and Zero Gravity Craft Brewery in South Burlington — had significant violations for not following operation and maintenance requirements and not notifying state regulators. Trapp Family Lodge had one such infraction; Zero Gravity had seven, the list notes. 
State officials noted that the information in this public report is based on 2024 data, and it does not represent the current compliance status of the companies on the list. 
Collins said it takes time to review the various reports submitted by companies and her office right now is going through reports from the third quarter of this year. She said there have been no violations at the Waterbury ice cream plant to date. 
Greenwood at Ben & Jerry’s confirmed: “We’re happy to share that we have had no non‑compliance issues in 2025.”

Co-owners Andrea Jones and Sandy Scott carry forward a 36-year legacy of community, resilience and friendship.

Alana Dutcher-Hirsch is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
HARDWICK — Best friends and store owners for 11 years, Andrea Jones and Sandy Scott — “work wives,” as they affectionately call each other  — run Hardwick’s Galaxy Bookshop with pride. On a snowy Thursday afternoon, the two women bustled around the store, taking business calls, ringing out customers and fulfilling book orders.
“Thursdays are my favorite day of the week because we’re both here and we have fun,” Jones said. Her gaze shifted to Scott who had just rejoined the conversation after a sale at the counter. 
Together, Jones and Scott now anchor one of Hardwick’s most enduring small businesses. Their partnership — forged quickly, and almost by chance — has carried the Galaxy Bookshop through ownership changes, community crises and the daily work of keeping an independent bookstore alive in a rural town.
Though the Galaxy Bookshop is now co-owned by Jones and Scott, the story begins long before they arrived. The store was founded in 1988 by Linda Ramsdell, a recent graduate of Brown University. With little more than the sense that Hardwick needed a bookstore, she developed the concept behind Galaxy. 
“I thought I’d give bookselling a try for five years,” Ramsdell said. 
Those five years stretched into several decades in which Ramsdell shaped the Galaxy Bookshop into the community fixture it is today. Scott, who is from Hardwick, worked at the bookstore on her summers off from school. In 2003, after graduating from Champlain College, Scott came back to work as the bookstore’s event coordinator and bookseller. 
After more than 25 years of owning the store, Ramsdell was ready to move on in 2014, and offered the store to Scott. But the recent college graduate couldn’t afford to purchase the store on her own. 
Enter Jones, an avid customer. Originally from Maine, she came to Vermont for college and worked as an English teacher at Hazen Union School after graduating. While shopping at the store she heard about the switch in management and Scott’s interest in purchasing the store. 
“I went home and I said to my family, as a joke, ‘I’m gonna buy a Galaxy bookshop,’ and they went: ‘Oh my God, you should totally do that,’” Jones said. 
Within just a few months, Jones and Scott agreed to purchase Galaxy Bookstore together. 
“We went from barely knowing each other to being business partners in three months,” Scott said. 
Ramsdell, meanwhile, was thrilled with the new partnership.
“The feeling of selling the store to Scott and Jones felt like keeping it in the family,” she said.
Although the women come from very different backgrounds — Scott has experience in bookkeeping, while Jones built her career in teaching — they each bring something essential to the Galaxy Bookshop.

“I had nothing to bring to the table other than loving to read. Sandy’s all the institutional knowledge and the practical day to day stuff,” Jones said. 
As an avid reader, nothing makes Scott happier than helping someone find a book. 
“When they’re excited about a book and I’m excited about it … the conversations that we have here are really wonderful,” Scott said.
The two friends only work one day a week together, though: Thursdays. That’s when everything comes together, they said, and when they can lean on each other for support. 
But the bookshop has faced significant challenges in recent years. In 2022, a fire in an apartment above the store triggered the building’s sprinkler system, causing the store to flood. Scott and Jones launched a $20,000 GoFundMe campaign to help with recovery expenses from significant water damage to the store and its inventory. For six months, the Galaxy operated out of customers’ living rooms and borrowed spaces around town — staying open in whatever way it could.
Hardwick’s recent floods also took a toll on the business. During the major flooding events of 2023 and 2024, access to the downtown was limited for weeks, and sales dropped as residents focused on recovery. 
“We’ve gotten through COVID, and we’ve gotten through a flood,” said Jones. “People always step up and show us how much they love this store and how much they want it to be here,” she said. 
Above the front register, a large-scale painting captures the store’s relationship with its community. In it, familiar Hardwick faces move books through town, framed by swirling stars and loose, whimsical brushstrokes that give the shop its enchanted feel.
“Sandy and Andrea are creative and stay involved in the community of professional booksellers,” Ramsdell said. “They’re innovative and involved with Hardwick, and they’re both great readers.” 
Even with all of the hardships, the store has always bounced back. Jones said she knows they won’t run the Galaxy forever, and when the time comes, she and Scott will choose its next stewards carefully. “The Galaxy is bigger than us,” she said. 
Scott’s love for the shop is rooted in a lifelong dream she’s had to own a bookstore. “Andrea and I sometimes talk about how we’re kind of stewards of the bookstore; this bookstore exists in town because of all of the support of the community and we’re stewarding it until it ends up being handed off to the next people who will take it on,” Scott said. 
A bookstore, or a library, is an essential part of a town, Jones said. “I wanted to make sure that there was a bookstore in my community,” said Jones. “Because, you know, I used to come here all the time. I still do. More. But now I own it.”

We hired two community engagement reporters — one in Bridgeport and one in Hartford — who joined the staff mid-year and immediately went to work getting to know their communities.
Reginald David, who covers Bridgeport, and Mariana Navarrete Villegas, our reporter in Hartford, joined CT Mirror as part of the Raising Voices Lab, an initiative focused on local reporting and service journalism that aims to understand and meet the information needs of historically underserved communities.
Right away, they began engaging with people across their cities, meetings with neighborhood groups known as NRZs, advocates with the NAACP and Make the Road, university officials and many more local leaders and organizations. They also hosted their own listening sessions, bringing the conversation directly to the people in their communities and learning what people care about and what policies affect them.
As part of the initiative, CT Mirror also launched text lines (sign up for Bridgeport’s here and Hartford’s here!) to provide people with a direct channel for news updates about each city and to open a new line of two-way communication with residents.
The reporters used social media and in-person activities to reach people who may not access traditional media sources for their news or information.
In October, Navarrete Villegas talked to people at a Day of the Dead event in Hartford, interviewing them live about what the day meant to them and working with photojournalist Shahrzad Rasekh to create instant portraits they could take home.
Earlier this month, David interviewed Bridgeport Police Chief Roderick Porter in a Facebook Live event that informed viewers about the police official’s views on public safety and community trust.
They both wrote stories and explained issues important to their communities that we published on our website as well. From education and voting in Bridgeport to housing and cultural history in Hartford, David and Navarrete Villegas were there to capture it. 
Here’s a recap of their efforts to engage with two of the state’s largest cities in 2025.
Social impact
Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum



Among the CT Mirror social media posts with the most engagement this year was Navarrete Villegas’ story about a new museum dedicated to Black equestrian history in Hartford. Our Instagram audience clicked the ‘like’ button more than 16,000 times on a slideshow of images and quotes from the story, which was well-read and widely shared.
The Mary Fields Horse and Heritage Museum, the brainchild of Ebony Horsewomen, Inc., commemorates the first African American woman to work for the U.S. Postal Service, as well as the history of the Black equestrian horsewomen and men across the country. It serves as a cultural landmark and archival center in the city’s North End.

Harding High School



Our reporters’ social videos also engaged readers. A video created out of a Harding High School pep rally in Bridgeport and posted to David’s own social media account drew more than 300 ‘likes’ on Instagram. The video was related to a story David wrote about the high school’s improvement in state rankings, which officially removed it from the state’s list of ‘turnaround’ schools. The move meant the school had met specific improvement goals and is no longer considered one of the state’s lowest-performing.
Now considered a focus school, Harding still receives targeted state support to help students with higher needs continue improving, placing it a step above turnaround status and on a path toward sustained achievement.
Explainers
The reporters also wrote explanatory pieces, based on questions they were hearing residents asking in the communities they cover. Here are some of their more recent so-called explainers.

(Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)Ken Hush gave Emporia State University the best Christmas present possible in 2025.
He quit.
The former Koch executive and higher education outsider spent roughly four years as ESU’s president, claiming he was reshaping the institution’s future. What he actually did was create chaos. His successor, a veteran administrator named Matthew Baker, will now have to figure out how to rebuild a city and college fractured by ignorance.
Hush’s place on the naughty list was secure years ago.
He oversaw the firing of 30 tenured and tenure-track faculty without warning. Legal action continues. He sent secret bonuses to dozens of professors without explanation. He closed programs and departments. When enrollment cratered, he lobbied the Kansas Legislature ceaselessly for special, ESU-only payments (and received $18 million to balance the books). All the while, he refused to voice a scintilla of doubt about his path of destruction.
With his exit fast approaching, Hush embarked on a news media tour of sorts, talking about his tenure with the Lawrence Journal-World and pledging to donate the equivalent of his salary for the past four years to the university. That’s a cool $1.4 million, in case you wondered.
Generous? Perhaps. To me, it proves that Hush torched people’s lives and careers for the fun of it. He did it for free.
Who knows when or if ESU can fully recover. I doubt that highly qualified professors will want to take a risk on a university that has treated their peers so shabbily.
The American Association of University Professors’ 2023 report on the mess put it this way: “Remarkably, the Kansas Board of Regents and the ESU administration have insisted that they support tenure and academic freedom. If we take them at their word, we must conclude that they are unfit to lead, least of all during a crisis.”
We already know that students fled in the aftermath, likely leading to increases at other Kansas institutions. Hush and his cronies have hailed a recent increase in enrollment, but even a dead cat will bounce off the pavement when dropped from a great height. ESU’s enrollment is still down more than 17% over the past five years.
We should note here that Hush and his administration treated both student and professional journalists with contempt. They stonewalled open record requests, lied about our persistent and accurate coverage in public letters, and repeatedly refused to answer our questions.
They may have felt confident in their ability to steer the narrative to their own purposes. But all they did was wound a campus and town that needed care and attention rather than high-handed hackery.
I know that good people in Emporia hate when I write columns like this. They’re trying, they’ve told me. They want to build something great and strengthen their town. Those of us at Kansas Reflector have deep-seated connections to the university and empathize. Our editor in chief Sherman Smith graduated from ESU’s (now-defunct) journalism program. Sunday columnist Max McCoy ran that very program.
My parents received undergraduate and graduate degrees from the school. If they hadn’t met in Emporia, I quite literally wouldn’t exist.
We get it. We really do. But Emporia and ESU were never going to turn a corner with Hush in charge of the university. The fact that the Kansas Board of Regents picked a thoroughly experienced university administrator to succeed him tells us all we need to know.
Baker is a “proven leader with extensive experience developing and implementing initiatives designed to help students succeed in college and after graduation,” said Board of Regents chairman Blake Benson.
It would have been nice to have had one of those earlier, huh?
The “ESU model” has ended, in much the same way that former Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback’s tax-cutting “experiment” did. An ideologically driven chief executive wrecked something beautiful and precious. Now its up to the rest of us to clear the rubble and build anew.

J&D Blueberry Farm, co-founded by Donald Van de Werken and Jeff Brown, started small in 2004 selling fresh blueberries. Over time, they expanded their operation to include blueberry-infused products and a mobile bakery, part of an effort to build a lasting brand and reduce food waste. Van de Werken said their goal is to preserve the local blueberry market while creating new opportunities for future generations of farmers.

Van de Werken, who has an agricultural background in citrus farming, said growing blueberries in south Mississippi felt like a natural fit. Poplarville, known for its annual Blueberry Jubilee, has long been a hub for growers across the region. 
 “We’re trying to build a brand more than we’re trying to sell,” Van de Werken said. “It makes great sense to sell, to make money because that’s what keeps you in business, but if you build a brand, people tend to recognize you.” 
That mindset has guided J&D Blueberry Farm’s growth. What began as a micro fresh-produce operation has evolved into a year-round business that turns Mississippi-grown blueberries into teas, juices and baked goods. Van de Werken said the idea was to create products with longer shelf life and a stronger local identity. 
Beyond the blueberry bushes

At J&D Blueberry Farms, even imperfect berries have a purpose. Van de Werken said the team uses pulp and juice from fruit that might otherwise go to waste to make new products. 
“For example, we take the fresh blueberries and then we pulp it to make juice, where otherwise, if the berry wasn’t perfect, we would have just tossed it,” he said. “It would have been complete food waste.”  
That approach led the farm to partner with the Mississippi Department of Agriculture and Commerce to research and refine its products. Today, J&D Blueberry Farm is known for its blueberry-infused teas but also sells coffee, baking mixes, juices and blueberry-based dog treats.
Van de Werken said their product line expanded even further in 2013 after acquiring a bakery from retired baker Capt. Karl Mueller, who was a neighbor and friend of van de Werken’s.  
“We became self-taught bakers, and we’re known for our German stollen, which is a Christmas bread, and also blueberry pies, muffins, pound cakes — and we now dabble in gluten-free products,” he said. 
Next season, the farm plans to add pear trees and begin producing pear cider as part of its goal to keep diversifying Mississippi-grown goods. 
The local industry
J&D Blueberry Farm began selling its products at local farmers markets before expanding across the region. Van de Werken said his team sold their baked goods and teas at Oktoberfest in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and was selected to take part in the Christmas market in Tomball, Texas — one of only 150 vendors chosen from more than a 1,000 applications. 
Closer to home, the farm is a familiar sight at the Poplarville Blueberry Jubilee, where thousands of visitors sample products and learn about Mississippi’s blueberry industry each year. Events like these, Van de Werken said, are vital to keeping the state’s blueberry community connected and visible. 
But despite strong local support, the number of commercial blueberry farmers in Mississippi has fallen over the past two decades. Van de Werken estimates commercial farms decreased from about 85 growers in 2004 to roughly 15 today — as many longtime farmers retire and few new ones take their place. 
Information from the 2022 Census of Agriculture shows evidence that supports these numbers, but at a slightly different angle. While the number of farmers has increased slightly through Mississippi, the number of acreage on farms has decreased from 2017 to 2022.  
Fewer farms, Van de Werken said, means fewer local jobs and less visibility for a crop once celebrated across the region. 
“There’s not a lot of young people jumping into it,” he said. “You either inherit it or you win the lottery, and you buy a farm. In our case, we started everything from scratch, and I would venture to say to start at our scale, it would cost a million dollars.” 
Van de Werken now serves as president of the Gulf South Blueberry Growers Association, a small network of commercial farmers who meet twice a year to discuss the growing season, market trends and U.S. Department of Agriculture developments. He said the group offers one of the few remaining support systems for growers trying to keep the industry alive. 
Room for improvement

While J&D Blueberry Farm continues to grow, Van de Werken said he’s keeping a close eye on how international competition could reshape the industry.  
The USDA Horticulture Lab in Poplarville developed a variety of blueberry in 2008 known as Southern Highbush, or “Biloxi berry.” The plant has proven highly productive — but not in Mississippi. Instead, it thrives in countries like Peru, Mexico and Colombia, where the climate allows for longer growing seasons and higher yields.  
Van de Werken said he believes Mississippi can still compete by investing in food manufacturing and processing facilities that turn local crops into market-ready products. 
“We would be better off agriculturally and encourage more people to farm,” he said. “Right now, you can only sell so much fresh product before it goes to waste.” 
For Van de Werken, that vision goes beyond his own farm. He said reducing food waste and strengthening local production could give Mississippi’s residents better access to high-quality foods while supporting the next generation of growers.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/23165841/Blueberry_Image_Shop-1.png,,,2025-12-27 09:11:41.268254

Gavin Newsom, to include some people diagnosed with bipolar disorder.","In summary
A California new law expands CARE Court, a mental health program championed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, to include some people diagnosed with bipolar disorder.


In 2023, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched a new program intended to revolutionize the way counties provide mental health care to some of their most vulnerable residents. 
CARE Court provides a new pathway for the courts to coordinate mental health and substance use treatment, medications and housing placements for people in the grip of psychosis, including those sleeping outside on the street. But CalMatters investigations have found that so far, the program is falling short of expectations. It’s helping far fewer people than projected, it’s struggled to help homeless participants, and some families have had their hopes dashed when CARE Court failed to help their loved ones who can’t consent to treatment.
Senate Bill 27, by Democrat Tom Umberg of Santa Ana, seeks to address some of those concerns. The law, which goes into effect on Jan. 1, expands who is eligible for CARE Court. Under the original law, only people diagnosed with schizophrenia and other limited psychotic disorders qualified for the program. Now, people who experience psychosis as a result of bipolar disorder can enter the program as well. 
Umberg has said the law could help CARE Court services reach more people, but he doesn’t expect it to dramatically increase the program’s numbers. Counties seem unsure how much of a difference the change will make. San Diego, for example, estimated it could expand its CARE Court program by anywhere between 3.5% and 48.1%.

The law also attempts to make it easier for people to enter CARE Court by smoothing some of the logistical hurdles: It combines two early court hearings into one to reduce the amount of time participants have to spend in court and save administrative resources. 
This law also allows the criminal justice system to refer someone directly into CARE Court if they are charged with a crime and are deemed incompetent to stand trial.
As of the end of October, California courts had received 3,092 CARE Court petitions, approved 684 treatment agreements and ordered 22 CARE plans, according to the Judicial Council of California. Newsom’s administration initially estimated between 7,000 and 12,000 Californians would qualify for CARE Court.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/031923-Newsom-Mental-Health-Presser-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-27 08:56:56.646506

Meet Amanda, Orion and Mariel and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In the months leading up to his election, President Donald Trump insisted that he had nothing to do with the far-right vision for his second administration known as Project 2025, a Christian-nationalist blueprint to remake the federal government. As the year draws to a close, a crowd-sourced effort, as well as trackers from advocacy organizations and labor unions, show that his administration has implemented roughly half of the goals laid out in the document’s 920 pages.
Project 2025 is rooted in injecting narrower interpretations of gender, sexuality and race in federal policy. It calls for ending nearly all of the U.S. government’s efforts to achieve equity, including the collection of data that could be used to track such outcomes across the public and private sectors.
It suggested eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. It also recommended removing out of every rule and regulation terms like sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender equity and gender awareness, along with abortion, reproductive health and reproductive rights.

The blueprint also suggested transforming the FBI into a politically motivated entity, abolishing the Department of Education and dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).
The White House has made progress on all these fronts — through a series of executive orders and also politically motivated hirings, firings and restructurings that have fundamentally expanded the president’s influence and power across all branches of government.
There is a saying in Washington, D.C., that personnel is policy: the people put in charge of implementing key policies shape their ideologies. Russell Vought, one of Project 2025’s key architects, heads Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, which he has likened to the “nerve center” through which a president can exert their influence across the federal government. Peter Navarro, who wrote Project 2025’s section on trade, is a top trade adviser to Trump. Brendan Carr, who wrote a section suggesting reforms to the Federal Communications Commission, is now in charge of the agency.
Here are some specifics on parts of Project 2025 that have been implemented and how they could impact women and LGBTQ+ Americans:

Reproductive rights

Trump maintained throughout the 2024 campaign that if elected, his administration would leave the issue of abortion access to the states. But as of November 2025, his administration had implemented about 40 percent of the Project 2025 policies aimed at restricting reproductive freedoms, according to Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion-rights group.
Project 2025 is grounded in the fundamental premise that abortion is not health care and should not be treated as such by federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment is woven throughout guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services and sub-agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its public health arm. One example is a September 2025 document outlining CDC priorities stating that the agency “will promote the dignity of human life at all stages of development, improve maternal health care, and strengthen the family.”
The document also guides the health department to collect data on people who have abortions, using “every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders.” The CDC confirmed in late November that it would not release an annual state-level report it has produced on U.S. abortions since 1969 — and that would have captured the first full year of data since Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, the Supreme Court case that overturned the federal right to abortion. In a statement to the anti-abortion organization Live Action, a spokesperson for the department attributed the delay to a former chief medical officer “direct[ing] staff to return state-submitted abortion data rather than analyze it.” The Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group that favors abortion access, has pointed out that staffing cuts at the CDC included most of those in its Division for Reproductive Health, leaving the agency short-staffed to compile the data for the report, which is now due out in the first quarter of 2026.
Both the anti-abortion and abortion-rights movements want the report, though for different reasons: the former so it can strategize about how to further reduce the incidence of abortion; the latter so it can assess the impact of the Dobbs decision on abortion access and health care outcomes.
Additional Project 2025 reproductive health priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June rescinded Biden administration guidance that hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid dollars, which is nearly all of them, provide abortion care in emergency situations under EMTALA, a decades-old emergency medicine law.
Revoked a Biden administration-era order establishing an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access designed to ease access to contraception and abortion.
Project 2025 wanted to prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds, even for non-abortion services. This was accomplished when the GOP-led Congress approved Trump’s tax law in July and a federal appeals court in September said the legislation could take effect. Planned Parenthood has said it could result in the closure of as many as 200 clinics — or about one-third of all its health centers — and that 1.1 million could lose access to health care as a result.

The Trump administration did not make much headway on restricting access to the medication abortion drug mifepristone. Medication abortions now account for more than half of all U.S. abortions.
Project 2025 authors want the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its 2000 approval of mifepristone. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in September that he was reviewing Biden administration changes that expanded access via telehealth as well as the drug’s overall efficacy and safety. A less likely near-term possibility is the Department of Justice enforcing the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of obscene materials and articles intended for “producing abortion,” including medication like mifepristone.

LGBTQ+ rights

Project 2025 called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop collecting data on gender identity and for the National Institutes of Health to fund studies into the negative side effects of gender-affirming care for transgender people. So far, these suggestions have largely played out.
At the beginning of the year, federal health agencies, including the CDC, purged website data referencing LGBTQ+ people. This was in response to a White House executive order that demanded agencies erase all traces of “gender ideology” from public statements, as well as policies and internal communications. Although a federal judge’s order has forced agencies to reinstate these webpages, the Trump administration has made it clear that it rejects data collection that includes LGBTQ+ people.
Project 2025 also proposed cutting federal funds for gender-affirming care for both adults and children, mirroring Trump’s own campaign promises. These cuts have taken shape in various ways: through a planned loss of benefits for federal workers, executive pressure placed on hospitals and policy changes that put trans people at risk of losing their insurance coverage or seeing higher out-of-pocket costs next year. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to keep funding hospitals that provide gender-affirming care for trans youth. Still, clinics across the country are closing.

In a broader suggestion, Project 2025 advised the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that expanded federal nondiscrimination protections. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to do just that. The White House has also urged federal agencies to rescind Biden-era policies that support LGBTQ+ rights. Many of these rested on the Biden administration’s interpretation of the Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, which found LGBTQ+ workers to be protected from workplace discrimination. In particular, the Trump White House has chosen to drop transgender and gay students from the government’s interpretation of  Title IX, the civil rights law preventing schools from discriminating against women and girls. This move changes how the federal government investigates Title IX abuses.
In one of its more extreme statements, Project 2025 equates the act of being trans, or “transgender ideology,” to pornography and declares that it should be outlawed. The White House has not made this specific declaration, but it has taken steps to exclude trans Americans from public life — all while referring to trans identity as “gender ideology.”
Additional Project 2025 anti-LGBTQ+ priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

In January, the president signed an executive order signaling his administration’s opposition to gender diversity and trans identity as a whole.
By this spring, the National Institutes of Health had canceled over $800 million in research grants to understand LGBTQ+ health, including studies about cancer and HIV prevention. Most of those cuts were upheld by the Supreme Court.
The White House has ordered NIH to study the regret rates of trans people who receive gender-affirming care, which the Trump administration inaccurately describes as “surgical mutilation.”
The Trump administration has restricted trans Americans’ access to passports that reflect their gender and eliminated the choice to use an X marker instead of male or female.
The Pentagon has swiftly reversed transgender protections and access to health care.

The White House has also signalled support for Project 2025’s sweeping plan to promote and enforce heterosexuality in families, although it has been slower to take direct action.
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, called for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt the official stance that families are made up of a married father, mother and children and to redirect federal funds to support a “biblically based” definition of family. Protecting adoption and foster care services that refuse to work with LGBTQ+ married couples was a key part of this vision in Project 2025.
A recent executive order charges the HHS with addressing local policies that prohibit religious groups — or people with certain religious beliefs — from participating in child-welfare programs.
That is expected to affect more than half the nation — 29 states and Washington, D.C., prohibit discrimination against potential foster parents based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which tracks LGBTQ+ policy. In contrast, 14 states allow child welfare agencies to refuse services to LGBTQ+ families if doing so conflicts with their religious beliefs.

Education

Both Project 2025’s authors and President Trump have long expressed a desire to eliminate the Department of Education. While they do not have the authority to do that, they have taken active steps to weaken the agency, giving more decision-making control to states and school districts.
Project 2025 education priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The president can’t lawfully eliminate a federal agency with an executive order, but he can undermine its functions and redistribute duties. In November, the administration announced that the Education Department’s core functions related to K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies would be transferred to the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services, and State. Critics of the move — including education leaders, elected officials and families with vulnerable children — argue that it will hurt children with disabilities, those from low-income households and student loan borrowers, most of whom are women.
Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to begin a campaign to monitor and influence K-12 curriculum. Among other objectives of the order, the secretary of education was instructed to eliminate federal funding for schools promoting “indoctrination” based on “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.” The order also called for an enforcement plan to make sure schools allow parents full access to their children’s educational records — an issue the administration connects with accessing information on children’s gender ideology.
Project 2025 encouraged Congress to consider school choice legislation. The Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, included a national school voucher plan that set up scholarships for families to attend private schools around the country.


Military

Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the military has moved quickly to align itself with Project 2025’s objectives, with an emphasis on reducing health care access for women and LGBTQ+ service members and an effort to overturn policies tied to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These changes have the potential to influence civilian policies down the line, in part because military policies reflect the values and strategic priorities of an administration and signal what might be coming to other federal departments.
Project 2025 military priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

Project 2025 called to end any public funding of gender-affirming health care for transgender service members. In May, the Pentagon announced it was halting new hormone treatments and surgical procedures.
Project 2025 also said policies allowing transgender people to serve in the military should be reversed. In January, Trump issued an executive order that listed gender dysphoria — identifying with a gender that’s different from the sex assigned at birth — as one of the medical conditions disqualifying people from military service. According to the Defense Health Agency, nearly 2,000 military personnel had that diagnosis as of 2021.
Project 2025 suggested prohibiting the federal government from paying the travel expenses of service members and eligible dependents who cross state borders to obtain abortions — a 2023 policy that was put in place after Roe v. Wade was repealed.  In January, the Pentagon rescinded the Biden-era policy that granted service members three weeks of administrative leave and travel stipends for abortion services.
Project 2025 called for the Pentagon to abolish all DEI offices in the Defense Department; in January, Trump signed an executive order ending all of the military’s diversity programs. Within the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, high-ranking people of color and women were fired, military academies were ordered to eliminate race-conscious admissions, the military announced it would no longer recognize commemoration months and thousands of images promoting diversity and minority milestones were flagged for removal.

Snider,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/12/27/forget-the-judges-marylands-estate-system-is-rigged-against-families/,"A decades-long battle is raging between Maryland’s Orphans’ Court judges and the Maryland Bar Association over whether our probate judges should be lawyers or laypeople.

The Legislature recently threw down the gauntlet for the latest skirmish, passing legislation during its 2025 session to create a task force ostensibly to study “improving the efficiency, uniformity, and quality” of estate processes.
But this conflict is a sideshow. While the task force focuses narrowly on judges’ credentials, jurisdiction, and elections, it is ignoring the fundamental problems harming Maryland families forced into the government’s labyrinthine estate system.
The Task force met eight times this fall and plans to meet again next spring and then issue a final set of recommendations before it adjourns June 30, 2026.
The stakes are enormous. More than 50,000 Marylanders die each year. The average estate costs between $30,000 and $60,000 to settle, draining assets through legal costs, executor compensation, and government fees. If litigation occurs, costs can easily skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands. Yet, this short-term economic waste pales in comparison to the family estrangement the system causes, inflicting damage that lasts for generations.
The professionals who profit from this system routinely blame families for the conflict. But this blame game sweeps under the rug their own role in fostering that conflict. The root problem is that lawyer interests are aligned with fiduciaries, not beneficiaries, because that is where they earn more than 90% of their fees.
Contrary to fiduciary rhetoric, the actual law incentivizes fiduciaries to act for their own benefit at the expense of less favored beneficiaries. If acted upon, these incentives cause family conflict because a family member is the fiduciary for most estates. While most family members value harmony, the estate process strongly incentivizes bringing existing family stress to a breaking point.
The current task force is a perfect example of this anti-family bias. Every single member of it is either a government official or a representative of the Maryland State Bar Association. There is an old saying in politics: if you aren’t at the table, you are the meal. In this task force, Maryland families are the meal.
The State of Maryland rakes in approximately $235 million annually in “death taxes” but spends only about 15% of that to administer the system. The rest subsidizes other state operations. Politicians remain torn between the fearful power of the lawyers’ trade association—magnified by the fact that roughly a quarter of legislators have law degrees—and a desire not to harm their constituents too blatantly.
If the Legislature genuinely wants to improve the system, it must pursue a “parasite-cleaning” reform agenda.
First, we must automate the disclosure of financial assets and transactions. This was a good idea when the Internet was invented in the 1990s, and it is an even better idea now. Professional fiduciaries continue to oppose this to protect their billable hours and evade accountability.
Second, we must empower AIs to compete with licensed lawyers. The lawyers’ trade association has always fought competition, including the “unauthorized practice of law,” and their resistance to AI is no different. The government should mandate improved public access to estate case law and dockets so that AI models can train on this information and provide affordable legal services.
Third, we must require the elected Registers of Wills to actively educate families. The government currently allows the system to remain opaque; instead, it should mandate that Registers educate families about deadlines, rights, and responsibilities. This information should be automated and customized, but it requires no AI—just a shift in priorities to support Maryland families rather than the donors who contribute to their re-election campaigns.
Finally, we must codify and simplify estate law. The current non-intuitive and complex estate law benefits lawyers more than Maryland families and results in widespread fiduciary practices that mock fiduciary ideals.
In 1853, Charles Dickens’s Bleak House famously observed, “The one great principle of English law is to make business for itself.” Sadly, in the subsequent 172 years, the estate process has become even more skewed against the interests of those it claims to serve.
While the various professional parasites feeding off the system glibly spout talk of championing the public interest, the number of families harmed by the system has increased by orders of magnitude. It is long past time for the Legislature to place the interests of Maryland families first. A task force that actually champions families—rather than those who feed off them—would be a refreshing change.",,,,2025-12-27 07:12:06.252400

I had no idea he would be South Dakota’s next governor.
In 1996, I covered John Thune’s stop in Pierre on his tour announcing that he was running for the U.S. House. I remember thinking that it was a waste of time because there was no way he could win the primary against Lt. Gov. Carol Hillard. Obviously I was in for another surprise.
During the evening of the last three presidential Election Days, I went to bed believing that my country could never elect Donald Trump. One out of three is pretty bad for a prognosticator.
Despite that woeful record for political predictions, I have one for June’s Republican gubernatorial primary. Here goes (drum roll). The candidate who makes the best use of newspaper advertising will do better than expected.

Election 2026
News and commentary on statewide races and ballot questions.
Read the latest>


That means a front-runner like Gov. Larry Rhoden or U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, by using newspaper advertising wisely, could win by a surprising margin. That means the other candidates who have yet to poll as well — Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden and state Speaker of the House Jon Hansen — with the right newspaper ad campaign, could punch above their weight class, make the race interesting and perhaps lay the groundwork for their next campaign.
Anyone who reads knows that in the last few elections political advertising in newspapers has been little more than an afterthought. Candidates still like to see their name in the paper, but they prefer not to invest in it. They have their minions write glowing letters to the editor, but they would rather spend their money elsewhere. They clog up the airwaves on TV or throw their money into the ether, buying ads on social media.
Honest, this isn’t just the ramblings of a cranky retired newspaperman. The benefits of newspaper advertising are real because of the readers.
By virtue of the fact that they have purchased a subscription to their local newspaper, readers prove that they have money. Money is something that every candidate, even the rich ones, needs. I’m surprised that all the candidates aren’t running small ads already, asking for money or at least steering readers to their websites where they can gather contact information and then really put the bite on them for donations.
Much more important than their wallets is the fact that newspaper readers are voters. Many studies have shown that people who subscribe to their local newspaper take an interest in their community, their state and their nation. Using Susquehanna Polling and Research Inc., the National Newspaper Association Foundation found that 96% of newspaper readers are voters.
Closer to home, research from the South Dakota NewsMedia Association shows that 83% of adults in the state read newspapers online or in print. Of those readers, 85% vote in state, national and local elections. A candidate looking for success in the next election should consider investing in advertising where the voters are, in newspapers.
Candidates often tell us how smart they are, how much they love innovation, how they know how to govern. Well, watch your local newspaper to see which one of them knows how to get elected by spending some of that hard-earned campaign cash where voters are likely to congregate.
Just as candidates are forced to make some decisions in an election year, so are newspaper editors. Some have innovated in recent years. As they saw political advertising dry up, they decided not to be used by political campaigns. Some had the foresight and guts to start charging for letters to the editor that include the endorsement of a candidate. That’s a smart decision. Those letters on the opinion page are nothing more than free political advertising, often cranked out by the very campaigns that have forsaken newspaper advertising.


Let us know what you think...


 

Another decision facing newspaper editors is what to do with Rhoden’s weekly column. Now that he’s a declared candidate for governor, it’s unfair to his competitors that he should get free space in the newspaper every week.
There may be some editors who argue that a column from the governor of the state is newsworthy. If that’s the case, it’s likely those editors have been too lazy to read what they’re putting in their newspapers.
Since declaring his candidacy, the topics of Rhoden’s columns have included how thankful he is to be the governor; how hard he’s working on the next budget — with a bit of his legislative background thrown in; and how his budget supports student success. That last one is a bit of a stretch given that the budget he worked so hard on didn’t include a funding increase for education.
The governor’s column isn’t news; it’s a way for him to polish his resume in public. Editors should consider putting the column on hiatus until Rhoden is no longer a candidate for office.
Election years are always interesting and this one is shaping up to hold voters’ attention, at least through the primary. Up until then, watch your newspaper to see which of the GOP candidates for governor has the smarts to advertise directly to voters and which editors are actually reading what they put in their newspaper.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/591A8138-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-27 07:12:06.252400

At the same time, efforts to expand Michigan’s Freedom of Information Act remain stalled in Lansing.
Director of the Eastern Michigan University Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur Institute for Civic Education calls it a “perfect storm” for democracy.
The public’s right to know
FOIA is a fundamental tool for journalists and citizens. Most local and state offices are subject to FOIA. That means government officials must answer requests made for public records in a timely manner and without high fees.
However, in Michigan, these FOIA expectations look a little different. Public records are not available from the office of the governor and the state legislature, restricting access to the public’s ability to understand some government operations.
At Bridge Michigan, a nonprofit organization covering state government policies, FOIA is a valuable resource for its reporting. Joel Kurth, Bridge’s executive editor of impact, emphasized the importance of laws like FOIA that support government transparency.
“We are stridently nonpartisan and not opinionated about anything beyond government transparency and the people’s right to access the basic doings of their government that they pay for,” Kurth said.
Joel Kurth, Bridge Michigan’s executive editor of impact
Bridge’s political coverage goes hand in hand with their mission to inform the public. The news organization collaborates with universities and other outlets to promote dialogue with the community, according to Kurth.
“We try to have a virtuous cycle, where the journalism informs the engagement, and the engagement informs the journalism,” Kurth said.
Education marginalized
In the 21st Century, civic engagement has become inextricably linked with technology and media literacy. Brigid Beaubien, the director of Eastern Michigan University’s Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur Institute for Civic Education, said that the definition of media literacy has evolved since the rise of social media.
As a social studies education professor, Beaubien works with her students on developing strategies for talking about and teaching civics.
“We’ve moved so fast in the last 25 years in this world that nobody’s really stopped and thought intentionally about how this should be addressed,” Beaubien said. “When I started in my career, both as a teacher and as a professor, [media literacy] wasn’t even something we really had to think about. We as a society need to focus on building knowledge and critical thinking skills.”
Brigid Beaubien, the director of Eastern Michigan University’s Jiu-Hwa Lo Upshur Institute for Civic Education
A 2023 Michigan study by social studies leaders found that elementary social studies instruction is severely marginalized due to standardized testing pressures in reading and math. Surveying nearly 1,000 educators, the Michigan Council for the Social Studies, “State of Elementary Social Studies” report revealed limited class time, resources, and professional development for teaching social studies.
Beaubien also highlighted the importance of civility in politics and online, something she said she sees as a core aspect of media literacy and civic education.
“We need to make sure we’re building deliberative dialogue, that people understand what discourse looks like in a way that’s civil and promotes problem solving and not just attacking the other side,” Beaubien said. “I think we really have to tease apart this belief polarization, where when we’re with people who believe the same way we do, our belief about the other side becomes more vehement.”
In the Michigan Legislature, where bills to expand the state’s public information law have stalled in both chambers for nearly a decade, that belief polarization is not uncommon.
Public Policy Manager at the Michigan Press Association Lisa McGraw said that despite public support for FOIA expansion, neither Democrats or Republicans have championed the public’s right to know.
“Everyone, when they’re running for office, says they’re going to do it, and then somehow it doesn’t make it,” McGraw said. “I could never say that any one party has held this up. Often it is the majority that holds it up…because they all know it’s going to apply to them.”
McGraw said she sees that delay as damaging to public trust in the government and media.
“We are suffering a crisis in journalism from a lack of trust, and that gets exponentially bigger when you look at public officials,” McGraw said.
Advisor of the Delta Collegiate Crystal McMorris
Educating media consumers
At Delta College, Journalism Professor, Program Coordinator, and Advisor of the Delta Collegiate Crystal McMorris teaches a popular media literacy course. She said that college students make up a big part of the shifting audience of traditional media.
“Students are tending to be more interested in trending videos with 15-second audios than they are in an in-depth investigation,” McMorris said. “The appetite for that kind of news just doesn’t seem to be there with the audience my students are creating for.”
In the digital age and with the increased use of generative artificial intelligence, McMorris said there needs to be a greater emphasis on educating media consumers about accuracy and authenticity.
“Diverse opinions and approaches are what make our country great,” McMorris said. “But when we don’t even have shared facts…I do fear for the future of democracy.”
Diminishing trust in media and government goes hand-in-hand with the lack of civic education students of all levels receive, according to Beaubien.
“I think most public servants go in with the best intentions and I think the two-party system has set up a structure that rewards polarization,” Beaubien said. “At the same time, we’ve reduced social studies in the classroom. It’s like a perfect storm.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9248-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-27 07:12:06.252400

(Photo by Jim Peaco/National Park Service)This story was first published by WyoFile on Dec. 18, 2025.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population continues to stagnate geographically, a relatively new trend that wildlife managers say is related to bears saturating “suitable habitat” where the species is tolerated.
That finding is described in a new and first-ever rangewide report summarizing where grizzly bears are found in the Lower 48.
Overall, grizzlies, which are classified as “threatened” under the Endangered Species Act, continued their decades-long recovery and reoccupied 4% more habitat over the past two years. That equates to a rangewide expansion of roughly 2,250 square miles, or an area about two-thirds the size of Yellowstone National Park.
Grizzly bears occupy an estimated 59,000 square miles of habitat throughout all their recovery zones in the Lower 48. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
But bruins that dwell in the tri-state Yellowstone area were the exception. The estimated 1,050 grizzlies there occupied about 3.5% less ground, or about 963 fewer square miles, than they did two years ago. The report does not address what drove the change, but lead author and Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks research biologist Cecily Costello said it’s likely related to grizzlies running out of ideal habitat in the modern West.
“When you look at the habitat to the east of the Yellowstone Ecosystem, to the south of Yellowstone, you’re looking at a lot of open prairie,” Costello said. “There’s not really big river valleys those bears could move into. There’s a little bit of a limitation in terms of the range expansion in those directions.”
Wyoming grizzly managers see it similarly, attributing the slight retreat to bears losing spaces where they can live without getting into trouble.
“I think it’s just indicative of where the population is,” said Dan Thompson, large carnivore supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. “I don’t think we should expect it to expand.”
The occupied grizzly bear range in the Yellowstone region is retreating slightly and encompasses an estimated 26,100 square miles, nearly two thirds of which is located in Wyoming. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
Matt Gould, the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team’s new leader, agreed. His predecessor, Frank van Manen, predicted about a decade ago that the grizzly population in the Yellowstone region would soon stabilize — and now it seems to be doing just that.
“Occupied range has kind of waned up, and now it’s kind of slightly decreasing,” Gould said. “It’ll be interesting to see: ‘Does it drastically drop, or is it going to stay steady and bounce around?’”
 Range for grizzlies stopped expanding

Biologists first documented the end of a half-century-long era of grizzly range expansion in the Yellowstone area two years ago. At the time, federal scientists observed a 0.5% reduction in the species’ overall distribution — a retreat of 142 square miles.
The mapping Costello and her co-authors just completed examined the period from 2010 to 2024. Distribution in the Yellowstone and Northern Continental Divide ecosystem is based on hard data — from tracked bears, conflicts and other verified observations — over a 15-year rolling window.
The data is smoothed out based on the whereabouts of all grizzlies known to exist in any given area. For that reason, bears that make “outlier” movements, like the subadult male that reached the Bighorns in 2024, don’t usually influence the distribution maps.
Federal judge strikes down logging project near Yellowstone National Park

Contraction in the Yellowstone Ecosystem’s occupied range comes at a time when there has been a record number of bears dying, though grizzly biologists say they don’t necessarily see the two trends as being related.
Mortality hit a high in 2024, with 72 known grizzlies that died that calendar year, Gould said. The death toll this year is almost the same, at 71, which is about 35% greater than the 10-year average of 54 mortalities.
The leading causes of death, according to Gould, were livestock conflict (21 grizzlies killed as a result), followed by “site conflicts with humans” (16 grizzlies), self-defense killings (12 grizzlies), accidental deaths (nine grizzlies) and natural causes like predation (six grizzlies).
This year, three in four Yellowstone-area grizzly deaths were within a zone in the core of the ecosystem known as the “demographic monitoring area.” That’s a slightly higher rate than average.
 Where grizzly bear habitats are retreating

Wildlife managers count bears in the demographic monitoring area. This area was declared fully occupied by bears in 2019.
In Costello’s distribution report, this “core” area represented 71% of where grizzlies were found in 2024. The other 29% of the occupied range fell outside of this core area on the fringes of the mountainous, public land-dominated ecosystem. This is where grizzly range has been retreating. When Yellowstone ecosystem grizzly distribution reached its peak in 2021, more than 40% of occupied range was mapped outside the core zone.
Last year, the largest contraction in occupied Yellowstone habitat was located in eastern Idaho in the Big Hole Mountains and Snake River Range. Another recession appears in Montana’s Ruby Range, maps from the report show, and there’s a small loss of occupied range in the South Pass area off the tip of the Wyoming River Range.
Costello, who compiled the maps, said she doesn’t put a “whole lot of stock” into small regional changes.
“The edges are a little bit uncertain,” she said, “because you have less [grizzly data] about the edges than you do about the middle.”
The other major population of grizzly bears in the Lower 48 dwell in Montana’s Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem. Occupied grizzly range stretched by 2,500 square miles, a nearly 12% increase. These bears mostly pressed into new habitat on the eastern and southern sides of the ecosystem, gaining ground in the Sapphire Range, and Boulder and Big Belt Mountains, maps show.
There are more than 24,000 square miles of occupied grizzly bear range in the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem, a 12% increase from an assessment two years ago. (Map courtesy of Cecily Costello)
The Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem’s occupied range encompasses much more open prairie than to the south in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.
Partly, that’s explained by Montana grizzlies moving down big river corridors, Costello said. When a bunch of them make the movement, the occupied range line can “pull out really quickly.” Smoothing of the data can then make it look like they’ve reoccupied big chunks of open country, she said.
Habitat is another explanation for why western Montana occupied grizzly range keeps stretching while Yellowstone-area bears have held steady and retreated in places.
“When you look at the plant communities and mountains that exist in western Montana, there’s still a lot of what could be considered decent bear habitat,” Costello said. “It’s the expectation that we’ll probably continue to see bears moving into those habitats.”
A lot of that growth is expected to take grizzly populations toward Idaho’s Bitterroot Ecosystem, which has been unoccupied since the species was wiped out there in the 1950s.

The CT Mirror published more than 50 “Charting Connecticut” stories this year, usually on Fridays.
Here are 10 top Charting Connecticut stories — some because of high reader engagement, some because they were staff favorites — from this year, in no particular order.
1. For a ‘land of steady habits,’ CT has seen changes over 10 years
“The land of steady habits,” a description of Connecticut coined in the 1800s, has changed. This story featured 10 charts looking back at the past 10 years.
One of the biggest takeaways is migration; more people from New York move to Connecticut than from any other state. And while people do move from Connecticut to New York, Connecticut has seen more newcomers from New York. 
Other changes we looked at include housing affordability across the state, employment rates, overdose deaths, voter registration, tuition prices, high-needs students in public schools, reliance on government aid, temperature in the state and immigration court backlogs. (Published Jan. 24)
2. SNAP benefit cuts to families in CT will hit harder than any other state
A number of sweeping revisions being made by the Trump administration have led to tumultuous changes, which have trickled down to Connecticut in more ways than one, including through major changes to eligibility criteria for the federal food assistance program SNAP. 
Connecticut families previously receiving $25 or more a month in SNAP benefits were estimated to lose nearly $200 a month on average under the Big Beautiful Bill Act, according to an Urban Institute report. This average loss is higher in Connecticut than any other state in the nation. (Published Oct. 24)
3. Over 100K CT residents could lose Medicaid coverage. What towns may be hit hardest?
Like SNAP benefits, Medicaid also took a hit this year as eligibility requirements changed at the federal level; an estimated 100,000 to 170,000 people in the state would be impacted.
Data found that residents in Hartford, Waterbury and New Britain could be heavily affected. Data shows that New Haven and Bridgeport could also see a large number of their residents lose benefits. But unlike with SNAP, Connecticut was not among the most affected states in the nation. (Published Sept. 5)
4. CT salaries are among the highest in the U.S. So is its cost of living
Housing costs remain a hot topic in the state and the nation, and the numbers reflect that.
While Connecticut has the eighth-highest salaries in the nation, when adjusted for a high cost of living, the state’s average salary becomes the ninth-highest in the nation. And to live comfortably in the state, a single person would need to make $100,380 annually, or a two-parent household with children would need a combined income of $279,884, one of the highest in the country.
The story features a chart with the state ranking for cost of living and a searchable table for readers to find the average salary for their own job out of all jobs in the state. (Published April 25)
5. Environmental bills lead start of CT legislative session
The beginning of the year also brought the beginning of the 2025 legislative session. On the first day of session, 377 pieces of legislation had been filed in the House and the Senate. 
In the House and the Senate, there were more bills related to environmental issues than anything else. Environmental legislation accounted for 21.5% of the 65 bills filed by the House on day one and 12.5% of the 312 bills introduced in the Senate.
Taking second in both chambers were bills dealing with finance, accounting for 17% in the House and 10% in the Senate. But third place is where the House and Senate diverted from each other. The Transportation Committee ended up handling 11% of the first-day legislation from the House, while public health measures took bronze in the Senate, making up 8% of bills filed. (Published Jan. 10)

6. We tracked over 100 bills during CT’s 2025 legislative session. Where’d they end up?
The Connecticut Mirror continued to keep up with bills introduced in session, and our bill tracker detailed the progress of the bills that the staff determined were most important to follow. 
Around half the 107 bills tracked by the CT Mirror did not make it through both chambers, and some died in committee. Thirty-two were rolled into other legislation, many in the state budget, and 21 made it to the governor’s desk. (Published July 4)
 7. Sports betting is on the rise in CT. Who is cashing in?
In March, Charting Connecticut delved into sports betting, legalized statewide in 2021. And we found that Connecticut residents are definitely gambling, especially online, to the benefit of the state. 
More than $6.2 billion was wagered on sports in Connecticut, $5.9 billion online and $338 million at in-person locations, also known as retail betting. The first two months of 2025 exceeded 2023 in terms of the dollar amount of bets placed. 
Of the total gross gaming revenue, about 13.3% goes to the state as tax revenue and 3.0% goes to the federal government in taxes. (Published March 28)

8. The price of a cup of coffee in CT is up 7.7%. It could be worse.
In October, we wrote about the increasing prices of one of the most popular drinks in the nation: coffee. Due to widespread drought in some of the largest coffee-growing regions of the world, as well as Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs, the price of coffee got a hike this year.
In fact, data collected by Toast, a popular restaurant operations platform, found that Connecticut coffee prices jumped 7.7% 2025 compared to 2024. While this is a large change in price, other states saw larger jumps, some reaching 11%. (Published Oct. 10)
 9. New Haven-area ER visitors more likely to report suicidal thoughts
This story made the list for some of the important trends it uncovers: residents in certain areas of the state are more likely to report suicidal thoughts than residents in others.
But experts say this may be because of the comfort level of residents, not an actual trend. And many believe this is a positive finding, because if suicidal thoughts are being reported, doctors are able to intervene and provide the necessary care. 
ER data also found that residents aged 10 through 17 had the highest rates of suicidal ideation, out of the 38,000 visits in which suicidal ideation was present. (Published Aug. 22)
10. Which CT towns have the most children of foreign-born parents?
This story was published in January, but the Supreme Court’s impending decision on birthright citizenship keeps it in the news, as it could have far-reaching impacts on immigration in Connecticut and across the nation. 
We reported which towns in the state have the most children to foreign-born parents. 
Bridgeport has an estimate of over 16,000 children with at least one foreign-born parent (55.3%), followed by Stamford with almost 14,000 children (55.9%) and Danbury with a little over 10,500 (63.8%).

Wes. Moore (D) in his fiscal 2026 budget. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters.)Health care advocates and state officials labeled the past year “stressful,” “frustrating” and “crazy” — from a jarring transition in federal policies under the Trump administration to an ongoing state financial crisis that limits progress in boosting access to care.
And while the legislature and advocates took steps to mitigate some of the impacts of the new federal health policies, many are ready to leave 2025 behind.
“I wouldn’t replay 2025 again,” said Gene Ransom, CEO for MedChi, the Maryland State Medical Society. “But it could have been a lot worse.”
That said, many of the stressors that plagued Maryland’s 2025 health care landscape will reemerge or influence policy in upcoming years.
As lawmakers look ahead to the 2026 session, here are some of the major points in health care this past year that could have continuing implications in coming years.
HR 1 health care overhaul
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) pointed to the rapid and wide-ranging changes to federal health care operations as a major point of frustration for the health system in Maryland.
“It’s just been a crazy year when it comes to health care because of all the federal policy changes,” Lam said.
Senate Finance Committee Chair Pamela Beidle (D-Anne Arundel) agreed.
“We couldn’t even begin to anticipate all of the things that were going to happen,” she said.
Maryland advocates hope new multistate public health coalition will clarify vaccine ‘confusion’

One of the biggest blows came in the form of the budget reconciliation bill, HR 1, often referred to as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.”
Among its sweeping changes, the legislation will usher in new requirements to qualify for Medicaid, the joint federal and state health care plan often used by lower-income families.
About 330,000 Marylanders are part of the “expansion population” and would be subject to new work requirements to qualify for coverage, which would take effect no later than 2028. Opponents argue that most recipients are already working, and that they are more likely to be tripped up by the increased paperwork that will be needed to prove that they are fulfilling the 80-hour-per-month requirement.
“There’s going to be people who are going to lose their care,” Beidle said. “It’s really going to be sad, because if they don’t pay for their health insurance … they’re going to be at our hospitals which are already really overcrowded.”
Lam said that the legislature was able to correctly predict some of the policy changes that President Donald Trump’s administration had in store and put some state-level protections in place during the 2025 session.
The General Assembly created laws to mandate insurance companies cover certain vaccinations, regardless of federal changes that weaken recommendations for some shots including for COVID-19.
The Legislature also correctly assumed that Congress would not extend a popular health care tax credit on plans purchased through Affordable Care Act marketplaces before it expires at the end of the year. Lawmakers were able to move some funding to help offset that financial impact to some of the lowest-income families using the state marketplace, though others will likely see their monthly health care costs increase regardless.
But Lam says complying with HR 1 will create hurdles for the state in future years.
“The HR 1 bill that passed puts at risk a lot of the gains we’ve made when it comes to expanding coverage for Medicaid patients. Things like work requirements and burdens and documentation are now all being imposed on a population that is just struggling to put food on the table with the rising cost of everything,” Lam said. “They are now being required to jump through a lot of hoops just to maintain their health coverage.”
Work AHEAD: State, federal officials finalizing terms of new hospital system in Maryland

Full speed ‘AHEAD’
The state’s current hospital payment system called the Total Cost of Care model will end on Dec. 31. What will replace it is a new system referred to as the AHEAD model – a hospital payment system that was first negotiated last year under the Biden administration and then revamped under the Trump administration.
State health officials had been in negotiations with the Trump administration since the start of the year. In the months since, state and federal officials have gone back and forth about how much authority Maryland should have in dictating hospital rates.
“Every week it changed,” Beidle said. “Once they finally got it signed … the hospitals had a very short time to sign the participation agreements. And there were some last-minute changes for that. I think the unknown made it really difficult.”
State documents even show a name change for the new hospital payment model. Under the Biden administration “AHEAD” stood for “Advancing All-Payer Health Equity Approaches and Development.” The new agreement changes that to “Achieving Healthcare Efficiency through Accountable Design,” reflecting a move away from the state’s current “all-payer” model that allows health care costs to be consistent across all types of insurance.
Among many changes under the new agreement, Maryland is set to lose its ability to set hospital rates under Medicare, an authority it has held for over 40 years. Losing that authority could complicate how the state keeps costs consistent across health care plans, meaning that people on private plans, Medicare or Medicaid may pay different prices for the same type of care down the line.
The new agreement keeps much of the state’s hospital payment system in place for two years, giving officials time to implement larger policy changes.
Ransom says the two-year timeframe gives the health care system a chance to take “a deep breath.”
“Two years of stability is nice,” he said. “But there’s still a lot of work to do — a lot of complexity that has not been worked out.”
Seniors notified of Medicare Advantage plans ending
Thousands of Maryland seniors notified of the end of their Medicare Advantage plans

Thousands of senior Marylanders were shocked to learn that their Medicare Advantage plans would not be available for the upcoming year, leaving them to scramble to find other plans that may be more expensive, or go without.
About a quarter of Maryland Medicare recipients use a program called Medicare Advantage that helps retirees use a private insurer for additional health coverage such as vision, dental and transportation assistance that the standard Medicare plans may not offer.
But insurance companies say offering Medicare Advantage plans is uniquely costly in Maryland. Insurers are fleeing the state or reducing their coverage.
Industry experts say as many as 100,000 Medicare recipients in Maryland will have to scramble to find a new health care plan by the end of the year or risk losing coverage at an age where many require costly medical care.
Under the AHEAD agreement, Maryland officials are tasked with finding ways to stabilize the Medicare Advantage market. Those talks are likely to begin in the upcoming session.
“We’re going to be dealing with the Medicare Advantage issue, which has turned out to be a really big issue for this year,” Beidle said.
Budget deficit looms once again
Laura Howell, CEO for the Maryland Association of Community Services, fears that a more than $1.4 billion deficit in the coming year could mean another round of intense advocacy to ensure that any cuts to funding don’t impact developmental disability resources.
After rocky legislature, disability agency’s self-directed care may still face budget challenges

Advocates, family members, and care takers came out in droves last session to stave off what was originally proposed to be over $400 million in cuts to the Developmental Disabilities Administration. Advocates were able to claw back close to $300 million in cuts and got program reductions to a level they said was regrettable but survivable, at least.
“The big question becomes, what are we looking at for the ‘27 budget?” Howell said. “I think the administration has made it pretty clear that they want to be working with the developmental disability advocates going into this session and during session.”
“We’re looking at an overall deficit, so we worry what that will mean for the DDA budget,” she said. “But I do think there is more communication with us than there was going into last session.”
But Beidle warned throughout the health care system, the tight financial outlook for the state could create challenges.
“It’s a money issue. It’s going to be tough year for funding – whether it’s DDA or Medicaid Advantage or the hospitals,” she said. “If the money’s not there, it’s not there.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC_0554-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-27 06:56:38.992893

Naps get a bad rap in our society, probably because they connote laziness or idleness. But in my experience, brief snoozes in fact do the opposite. They allow for more focused attention. They open the door to unusual problem-solving approaches. And if you eventually hit another wall, at least you’re slightly better rested.

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

Not all naps are created equal. If you sleep for only two hours one night and then fall asleep for most of an afternoon, that’s not really a nap. That’s making up for lost time.
No, I’m writing about an intentionally short period of closing your eyes and recharging.
My optimal nap is between 20 and 40 minutes. It’s long enough to allow myself to drift away, but not so long that I totally lose consciousness or momentum. If the nap ends and I have to remember where I am and what I’m doing, that nap was too long.
Oftentimes, I’ll nap because I’m either temporarily tired or a bit overwhelmed with the situation at hand. Those minutes spent behind the gray shade of my eyelids allow me to reset, reconsider and come into myself.
Words and phrases work their way into my mind as I settle down. The act of napping frequently turns into an impromptu brainstorming session, as I activate my phone to type various notes to myself. I can scroll through those notes now and read various ideas for columns, ledes that didn’t pan out, entire columns that dropped by the wayside.
“Destruction not easily reversible,” reads one optimistic phrase.
“No one else wanted to write about Trump,” reads another one, oddly enough.
“In the darkest timeline, we have already lost this state and country” begins an entire column that I hope won’t appear anytime soon.
You get the idea. Something about laying back and clearing out my conscious mind allows words and thoughts to congeal. You have to be receptive, of course; when I wrote less frequently I would tune out these transmissions. Not today. I’ve decided they’re my brain giving me free content.
On a serious level, we all need more sleep. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than a third of Kansans — 36.7% of us — went without adequate sleep in 2022. That’s defined as less than seven hours per night.
If you’re like me, I know your response: Somebody’s getting seven hours of sleep per night?
The problem with achieving a solid seven or eight hours of shuteye is that it feels like such a commitment. I love to sleep, don’t get me wrong, but what if you remember an important task that needs completing? What if you need to write a column for the next day? What if your child’s entire science fair project about algae hasn’t even been conceived of, much less built?
Here’s my point (and I do have one): We should treat sleep more casually. Let’s drop the hangups. Take a nap if we need one, sleep a little later if we need to. Be good to ourselves and our bodies, and the unconscious brains that run everything from the top.
Now, if you don’t mind, I need to go lie down.

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)Gov. Greg Gianforte said Friday he does not have “good cause” to suspend Public Service Commissioner Brad Molnar.
However, in a letter regarding a complaint filed against Molnar, the governor also encouraged the internal Public Service Commission “response team” that’s charged with an investigation to move forward.
“To be clear, this decision does not excuse the alleged conduct of Commissioner Molnar,” Gianforte wrote.
Molnar, ousted as PSC president in October, faces multiple complaints of professional misconduct, and he’s accused of interfering with the internal investigation.
Molnar, a Republican from Laurel, himself announced the investigation in July.
In response to allegations of professional misconduct, Molnar admitted to being unpolished, a “redneck wearing a white shirt,” and to using his First Amendment right to free speech to raise questions about the investigation.
However, in response to the complaint, Molnar and his lawyer have argued it is in part an attempt to silence Molnar as a commissioner willing to scrutinize deals involving the largest public utility in the state, NorthWestern Energy.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana. It’s made up of five elected commissioners, currently all Republican.
In his letter, Gianforte, also a Republican, said the facts in the case don’t meet the threshold needed to suspend a commissioner — they aren’t tied to the merits of the investigation, which he encouraged.
“It is my view that the Response Team can and should complete its investigation into his conduct and identify potential recommendations for ensuring PSC employees are able to fulfill their responsibilities in an environment in which they are respected,” Gianforte wrote.
Allegations of unprofessional conduct include Molnar engaged in retaliation and sexual harassment, which include jokes or innuendo.
Molnar, a Republican, albeit maverick, politician, denied retaliation and told the Daily Montanan he made a joke he later was told had sexual innuendo, but he wasn’t familiar with the reference.
Gianforte addressed the letter to Molnar and Commission Vice President Jennifer Fielder, who filed the complaint with the governor against Molnar on behalf of the internal response team. Fielder could not be reached for comment late Friday afternoon.
However, Fielder earlier said people have the right to a workplace “free from harassment and discrimination,” and Molnar’s actions were making it “abundantly clear” that wasn’t possible.
Fielder also previously said Molnar engaged in a “hostile pattern of activity to derail the investigation.”
Fielder filed the complaint in August, when Molnar still was president, and it included allegations Molnar was using his rank to interfere with the investigation, an accusation he denied.
In September, Molnar tried to convince the PSC to rescind the complaint against him, but he only received support from Commissioner Randy Pinocci in a 3-2 vote.
In October, commissioners voted to oust Molnar as president and installed Commissioner Jeff Welborn as president instead, arguing it was time for a fresh start. Molnar subsequently asked the governor to dismiss the complaint, arguing it had become moot with his demotion.
In his letter, Gianforte said he takes seriously allegations of workplace misconduct in the executive branch, including the statutorily created Public Service Commission.
“While administrative leave is a common practice in traditional workplace investigatory contexts, the legislature has expressed a different approach for PSC commissioners,” Gianforte said. “Specifically, the statutory authority granted me by the legislature authorizes me to temporarily suspend a commissioner pending a misconduct investigation if there is good cause.”
Gianforte said when the complaint first was submitted, it appeared then-President Molnar’s “troubling conduct” was stalling the investigation, but since then, the response team has been able to move forward and expects to conclude its work this month.
“With what appears to be adequate measures within PSC policy for the team and commission to navigate this matter, and with the investigation moving forward, I have determined not to exercise my authority at this time,” Gianforte wrote. “ … The Commission can complete its investigation of his conduct and render a decision on its own using the tools available in its policy manual.”
Molnar’s lawyer, Matthew Monforton, has said Molnar should remain in his elected position as chosen by voters.
“(Commissioners) Welborn and Fielder have no dirt on Brad or we would have heard something during these past seven months of investigations,” Monforton said Friday. “Clearly, Gov. Gianforte agrees.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos07-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 20:56:38.519580

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)After the landmark Dobbs decision, where the U.S. Supreme Court sent the topic of abortion back to individual states, conservative politicians predicted a renaissance of restrictions that would essentially curtail the practice — at least in Republican-led states.
But the latest annual “#We Count” report, which tracks abortion statistics at the state and national level, reveals the opposite: The number of abortions since Dobbs and after a raft of state-level restrictions seems to indicate the policies have been either ineffective or backfired.
From January to June 2025, when the latest data was available, there were 591,770 abortions provided nationwide, said the report, produced by The Society of Family Planning.
Montana leaders in reproductive rights said they weren’t surprised the numbers didn’t skyrocket as the Treasure State became a sort of oasis, surrounded by other politically conservative states that have continued to restrict the practice.
Instead, the biggest change is how the overall economy continues shape healthcare, and by extension, abortion and reproductive care. For example, more women nationwide and in Montana are accessing abortion via telehealth — a growing trend.
At the same time, more women in the state and beyond are having more economic struggles obtaining healthcare, even as the number of providers hasn’t changed as dramatically in Montana as it has in other states.
Telehealth changes impact abortion care
In Montana, like many states, the number of abortions performed rose slightly — jumping from a rolling average of around 200 to slightly higher than 210 per month.
Montana has kept the procedure legal and available for decades, tracing its protection to a 1999 Montana Supreme Court case, Armstrong vs. State of Montana. In 2024, voters enshrined the right to access abortion in the state Constitution up to the point of fetal viability outside the womb, generally pegged at 21 weeks. Providers in Montana say the surgical option — the only one available — after that point isn’t offered in state, and is rarely used anyway.
Montana continues to be a destination for those who need in-person abortion care. And traveling a long distance, either in state or out of state, remains the same. What has changed is access to telehealth, which made significant strides during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Montana, the number of patients accessing telehealth abortions averaged around 45 before Dobbs; today, that number is above 50 per month. Meanwhile, in-person visits are slowly getting less frequent.
Before Dobbs, nearly 95% of visits for people seeking abortion were in-person. Today, that number has fallen to 73%. Montana’s average mirrors the national trend: Twenty-six percent of abortions in the state utilize telehealth.
In Montana, the total number of abortions hit 250 in January 2025, but then receded slightly to 210 a month.
South Dakota and Idaho have banned the procedure, but residents use shield laws to protect their medical information and mail-access to prescriptions. Those two states report that 100% of any abortion was prescribed via telehealth or obtained by travel.
According to #WeCount, shield laws provide protections to medical providers so they can mail medications to people in states with abortion restrictions.
“It’s not stopping it. It’s just making it more challenging,” said Erin Case, the executive director of Montana Abortion Access Program. Her organization helps support providers and patients for abortion and reproductive health.
That challenge boils down to economics — less money for healthcare, less money for raising children and less money for travel.
 Weighing financial considerations

For example, MAAP said that more people are asking for help, often related to travel and lodging expenses. Others need childcare help, which has also grown more expensive.
They’re also noticing a different trend: Many of the women who are seeking reproductive care already have children, and many doubt their ability to financially care for more.
“This isn’t just about a family, it’s about finances,” Case said. “Some people just can’t add a child because of the barriers.”
MAAP said that it has seen a massive increase in demand for financial assistance. For example, in 2025, Case said the organization has pledged more support and spent more than it has in its previous 12 years combined.
“Luckily, we have a very supportive community in Montana, but we’re also dealing with a very challenging economy,” Case said.
MAAP board chairwoman Aileen Glazier agrees.
“The need continues to outpace the funding,” Glazier said. “Yes, our funding has increased, but the number of applicants has, too.”
MAAP has even noticed that financial assistance for abortion often becomes more pressing during the winter months, when reliable transportation, clear roads and added expenses, like the holidays, become factors.
“This highlights that abortion is about healthcare, but it’s also about access — it’s getting harder and more expensive,” Glazier said.
Case and Glazier worry that with spiking healthcare costs, including no government support for premiums, that demand and access will only continue to worsen.
Case said that the average amount that MAAP provided in February 2024 per requestor was $354. Today, that number has risen by more than 10% to $384 — and that’s just an average. Glazier said the organization has helped out some with as much as $2,000. In 2025, MAAP pledged $267,334, which supported 686 clients, a 43% increase more than 2024.
  Telehealth, mifepristone are the next battlefronts 

Martha Fuller, the chief executive officer for Planned Parenthood Montana, said the overall numbers have increased slightly, but her organization wasn’t really preparing for a huge increase. That’s because abortion in neighboring states has been somewhat restricted, while Montana’s laws were more permissive.
That didn’t change, she said.
“We’ve seen a slight shift of where patients come from, but we have not seen huge increases, and I don’t think we were expecting it,” Fuller said. “Access was still difficult and roads were still long before Dobbs. Because Montana has played this role (for awhile), so we have not seen a huge shift.”
She said she’s aware of a few more people traveling from much greater distances, like Texas, but Montana is often not the closest stop either.
Medication used for abortion and telehealth is only used through 11 weeks of pregnancy.
Instead, she sees the next battlefront on the abortion subject coming in the form of a resurgent effort to ban the medication mifepristone as a way to halt the procedure, especially with the growth of telehealth. Just recently, members of the Trump administration have been under increasing political pressure to re-evaluate the drug’s long track record of safety.
Fuller said that the state’s longtime, historic commitment to individual freedom and privacy has helped continue to ensure access.
“People still have the attitude that it’s none of my business, and you don’t tell me what to do, and I don’t tell you what to do,” Fuller said.
She said the Constitutional Initiative that enshrined the medical practice has also helped politically, even if the demand for the service remains steady.
“Some politicians have said, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t be spending our time doing this,’” Fuller said.
2025 was also the first year that Fuller can remember not having to testify at the Legislature to block legislation.
Fuller said that the #WeCount reporting is as important for what numbers are included as it is for what it cannot calculate.
“What this report cannot tell us fully is the deep economic and racial disparities,” Fuller said. “Look at the map and where there is not access, especially in the (American) South. There are large Black populations and large low-income populations. That’s different if you look at the map and see where there’s better access.
“People who struggled for care continue to struggle for care in places that are rural, poor, and steady employment is difficult.”
  Another wrinkle 

Since October, Congress and the Trump administration have banned support to the national group Planned Parenthood. Case and Glazier point out that while the measure was meant to target abortions, it ignored the other critical healthcare the organization provides, including cervical cancer screenings as well as testing for sexually transmitted infections.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Attorneys for Tina Peters this week asked the Colorado Court of Appeals to order that the former Mesa County clerk “must be released from custody forthwith” following the signing of a pardon document by President Donald Trump earlier this month.
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted in state court and is now serving a nine-year sentence in state prison for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, part of an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. But her attorneys pursued a presidential pardon anyway, expressing hope that the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court will rewrite the centuries-old legal doctrine of dual sovereignty in criminal proceedings.
Peters’ motion, the latest in a series of attempts by her attorneys and allies in the election conspiracy theory movement to force her release from state custody, was filed on Dec. 23 in her pending case before Colorado’s second-highest court, where she has appealed her August 2024 conviction, arguing that her imprisonment violates her First Amendment right of free speech. Peters has separately petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, while Trump’s Department of Justice has formally requested her transfer to federal custody, a request the state has rejected.

The new filing asks the Colorado Court of Appeals to “enter an order indicating that it lost jurisdiction and finding that … the Pardon which was issued on Dec. 5, 2025, was effective and vitiated the convictions against Tina Peters in the State of Colorado.”
The motion, signed by Peters attorneys Peter Ticktin and John Case, is littered with debunked claims casting doubt on the legitimacy of what it calls the “most controversial Presidential Election in history.” Peters, a prominent election denier, was convicted by a Mesa County jury on multiple felony counts in connection with the breach of her office’s secure elections equipment during a 2021 software update.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.
Trump himself has repeatedly called on Gov. Jared Polis to “free” Peters, and has threatened “harsh measures” if she isn’t released. Democrats characterized the Trump administration’s move last week to dismantle Boulder’s National Center for Atmospheric Research as retaliation for Peters’ ongoing incarceration.
A White House official appeared to acknowledge a retaliatory motive for that announcement in comments to The New York Times, which reported that the unnamed official said “Colorado constituents would be better served if Gov. Polis wanted to work with the president.” Days later, the administration denied two disaster declaration requests that would have opened up federal funding to support wildfire and flood recovery in the state.
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has said Trump’s attempt to pardon Peters of state crimes violates “one of the most basic principles of our constitution.” Case said earlier this month that he had visited La Vista Correctional Facility following the pardon to seek Peters’ release, but was told by a Colorado Department of Corrections official that the pardon does not affect her state conviction. The appeals court filing includes a copy of a Dec. 17 email to Case from a state attorney representing the CDOC, who reiterated that stance.
“The President does not have the authority to pardon an individual convicted of state crimes under state law, such as Ms. Peters,” wrote Nicole Gellar of the attorney general’s office. “Accordingly, the CDOC has a duty to continue to incarcerate her for the duration of her state sentence.”

Olson, a Republican, served as the state’s attorney general from 1972 to 1980 before defeating Democratic incumbent Art Link in the 1980 election. 
Olson’s win over Link interrupted a 20-year run of Democratic governors in North Dakota. 
Former North Dakota Gov. Allen Olson
“Governor Olson served North Dakota with dignity and a steady hand as our state’s top law enforcement officer and chief executive,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a news release
As governor, Olson worked against drunken driving, supported the Garrison Diversion program to use Missouri River water for irrigation and other uses and saw the creation of the Department of Human Services. 
Olson’s bid for reelection was hindered by a report from the Grand Forks Herald in the days leading up to the general election that Olson had not filed his taxes for the previous year. 
He was defeated by George “Bud” Sinner, the last Democrat to hold the office.
Mike Jacobs, who had taken over as editor of the Grand Forks Herald a few months before the tip came in about Olson’s taxes, said Olson never held a grudge about the story. 
“We ended up being friends,” Jacobs said Friday, recalling that Olson was a regular visitor back to Grand Forks for homecoming events at the University of North Dakota. 
Jacobs, in a 2018 column, wrote that Olson “took the loss in good grace; in our many encounters since the loss, he’s never asked me about the tip, and I’ve never told.”

Born in Rolla and raised on a farm near Sarles, Olson earned his undergraduate and law degrees from UND. He served in the U.S. Army as a lawyer. He returned to North Dakota in 1967 and served as assistant director of the Legislative Research Committee (now Legislative Council) from 1967 to 1969, directing the state’s first study of strip mining, soil banks and land reclamation, according to the State Historical Society. 
Olson was elected attorney general in 1972 again in 1976. 
Bob Wefald succeeded Olson as attorney general, winning the seat in 1980 when Olson was elected governor. The two campaigned together. 
Wefald said Friday he had known Olson since 1959, when they had participated in Boys State together. 
“He was a great governor, a good man, a decent man, very proud that he was my friend for all these years,” Wefald said. 
Gerald VandeWalle, a former North Dakota Supreme Court chief justice, worked under Olson in the Attorney General’s Office. 
VandeWalle recalled Friday that Olson took on the regulation of gambling in North Dakota, leading to the charitable gambling rules that the state operates under today. 
“He took a lot of heat to begin with,” VandeWalle said, but helped create gambling regulations that were enforceable. 
After serving as governor, Olson returned to private law practice and relocated to Minnesota, where he became co-owner of a die-casting company in New Hope in 1987. Olson also served as president and CEO of the Independent Community Bankers of Minnesota and was appointed by President George W. Bush to the International Joint Commission, which deals with issues related to waterways shared by the United States and Canada. 
Funeral arrangements are pending.

Suing the state over discomfort caused by an administrative requirement signals a troubling disconnect between public employees and the democratic system funded by taxpayers.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dan Jones: Whatever happened to public service?.","This commentary is by Dan Jones, of Montpelier. He is an activist working for local resilience.  



The Vermont State Employees Association has sued the State of Vermont to overturn the administration’s requirement that employees return to working in state offices, arguing that such a return would cause discomfort to some workers. The state, while acknowledging and accommodating special needs requests, maintains that many state services are best delivered by employees working in person.
I admit that I urged such a decision from the governor months ago. I hoped that bringing workers back into their offices would help restore commercial life to cities like Montpelier, which were hollowed out by the Covid-era work-from-home exodus. But the issue is deeper than downtown foot traffic. At stake is a more fundamental question: what does it mean to work in public service, and what obligations come with that choice?

READ MORE

I have heard of many state employees who, taking advantage of remote work, have moved as far away as North Carolina or Florida. Raising this concern angers friends who work for the state. They argue that if the work is getting done, why should it matter where they live? To question this is often treated as heartless, as an attack on work-life balance or an insistence on unnecessary hardship.
But this reaction reflects a broader loss of a once-common civic understanding. Public service was long understood as a commitment to serve one’s fellow citizens, rooted in shared place and shared fate. Public employees accepted certain sacrifices in pay or comfort in exchange for meaningful work, stability, and the knowledge that they were contributing to the common good. In that sense, public service resembled other civic callings, including public safety work, where sacrifice was part of the job.
Once upon a time, public sector jobs paid less than private sector work but offered dignity, purpose, and security in return. Today, government is increasingly viewed as just another corporate entity, competing for labor and negotiating benefits, while belief in public service itself is dismissed as naïve. Civic obligation is replaced by transactional logic.
When public employees live far from the communities they serve, the people who rely on their work become abstractions. Taxpayers are reduced to “customers.” Neighbors and fellow Vermonters disappear from view. When the people you know, care about, and interact with daily are not the people you serve, commitment inevitably erodes.
Government bureaucracy has always frustrated citizens, but the current shift is more troubling. As government is framed as a service industry, workers are cast primarily as employees to be protected, while citizens are asked to pay ever-higher taxes for services that feel increasingly remote. The result is a growing sense that government no longer exists for the public good but as a costly, impersonal system delivering diminishing returns.
This moment demands something better. As our national politics grow more unstable and economic insecurity deepens for a majority of Americans, we will rely more heavily on state and local governments for essential support. These pressures will require difficult decisions, shared sacrifice, and renewed civic commitment. That burden cannot fall on taxpayers alone.
Public service cannot survive if government is treated either as an abusive employer or as a mere transactional service provider. Democratic strength depends on a shared sense of responsibility, where individual welfare is inseparable from collective welfare. If public employees and the institutions they serve lose that understanding, we risk hollowing out our capacity to respond humanely and effectively to hard times ahead.
Suing the state over discomfort caused by an administrative requirement signals a troubling disconnect between public employees and the democratic system funded by taxpayers. As costs rise and patience wears thin, appreciation for necessary public work will only endure if that work is visibly rooted in service, commitment, and shared community.
Whatever happened to the pride, value, and sense of purpose that were once understood as core benefits of working in service to the public good?

(Photo courtesy of WSDOT)About 20 miles of U.S. 2 are set to reopen Monday on the east side of the Cascades, allowing access to the Stevens Pass ski resort, after devastating flooding and debris slides destroyed parts of the highway this month.
U.S. 2, a major east-west crossing in Washington over the Cascades, has been closed for two weeks along a nearly 50-mile stretch between Skykomish and Leavenworth. Parts of the roadway collapsed entirely.
Fully reopening the highway “is going to take time, a long time, and we’re still evaluating the full extent of the damage,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a press conference Friday. 
The partial reopening will be at 6 a.m. Monday between Coles Corner and Stevens Pass, or mileposts 85 and 64, Ferguson said. A pilot car will shepherd drivers for the final stretch to the pass in one lane between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. This system is expected to last at least a month. 
The west side of U.S. 2 remains closed at Skykomish, blocking access to Stevens Pass from that direction. Ferguson plans to be in Skykomish on Tuesday to survey the damage there and give an update on repairs in that area, hopefully with a timeline for reopening.
“We all understand how critical reopening Highway 2 is for residents of our cities and communities, for our economy, for the ski resort, for travel across our state,” Ferguson said. “We’re very, very mindful of that, and the team is working extremely hard to get it opened as quickly as possible.”
At milepost 54 near Skykomish, “many, many feet of debris” have had to be removed from a bridge before it can be inspected, state Transportation Secretary Julie Meredith said.
Ten days ago, Ferguson said parts of U.S. 2 could remain closed for months. On Friday, he said some repairs will have to wait for snow to clear in the Cascades.
“Repairs like this, as you might imagine, are heavily dependent on the weather, and the weather this time of year, obviously, is not ideal,” Ferguson said. 
There’s no estimate for the cost of the damage to the highway.
The ski resort, owned by Vail Resorts, has drawn frustration from skiers and snowboarders over not offering refunds despite the delayed opening. 
Skykomish Mayor Henry Sladek called Friday’s announcement “a great first step.” Leavenworth Mayor Carl Florea said, “We appreciate the potential for this first step toward that restoration.”

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
“We know it’s going to be a long time coming,” Florea added.
Across the state, about eight sections of highway remain closed due to the flooding, Meredith said.
Ferguson last week proposed roughly $2 billion for preserving and maintaining the state’s bridges and roads.

This story by Alex Ebrahimi was first published in the Valley News on Dec. 25, 2025.
WOODSTOCK — The Woodstock Selectboard and Village Board of Trustees voted this week to update the contract of Municipal Manager Eric Duffy, though the details have not been publicly disclosed.
The vote in support of Duffy, who began his tenure in February 2023, came after discussions between the boards “about the significant progress made during his tenure as well as an outpouring of support from staff and the community,” a Woodstock news release stated. “I was very grateful for the boards’ willingness to continue to work with me,” Duffy said. “And there’s strong support behind me.”
The updated terms of Duffy’s contract, which was signed in 2022 for an indefinite period of time with an annual salary of $130,000 per year, have not yet been released. 
Ray Bourgeois, chairperson of the Woodstock Selectboard, and Seton McIlroy, chairperson of the Village Board of Trustees, said they are unable to discuss the details of the updated terms because the contract still is being reviewed by attorneys.“July 1st is when changes (in Duffy’s contract) we discussed go into effect,” Bourgeois said. “I don’t feel comfortable discussing the contract (at this time) until we have it back from the attorneys.” 
According to McIlroy, Duffy had received cost-of-living adjustments every year since starting in his role as municipal manager.  “We have it written in his contract that he can actually receive a higher COLA than everybody else, but he has never taken a higher COLA than the rest of the team,” said McIlroy.  Additionally, in the past two years, Duffy received a $10,000 dollar bonus. 
Both McIlroy and Bourgeois said the updated contract is a reflection of the confidence the elected officials have in Duffy’s leadership. 
During his time as Woodstock Municipal Manager, Duffy has helped lead the recovery from flooding in July 2023, including overseeing the town’s purchase of a private water system that serves much of the town. Duffy, who prior to serving in Woodstock worked as the town accountant in Stoneham, Mass., said there are more initiatives on the horizon. 
“We have a wastewater plant renovation that’s gonna be voted on a town meeting in March,” Duffy said. “So that’s a $30 million-plus project that we’re working on. It’s going to allow us to kind of continue to develop Woodstock a little more.” 
Stability was another consideration in updating Duffy’s contract, McIlroy said. “If we can maintain that stability and that continuity for the community so they know what’s coming in the next couple years, I think that’s really important,” she said. 
The Valley News reported earlier this month that Duffy had been a finalist for both city manager of Montpelier and town manager in Winchester, Mass. Shortly before the update in his contract on Monday, Duffy withdrew from consideration for both positions. 
“He told us he was applying,” Bourgeois said. “There’s nothing in his contract that says he cannot apply for other positions.”
“I was surprised but not surprised,” Bourgeois said of Duffy interviewing for other jobs. “There’s a lot of bad publicity going around about him.”
Duffy is currently being sued by former Woodstock Police Chief Joe Swanson after Duffy and the Village Board of Trustees demoted him. The demotion was overturned by a judge, who said the town failed to follow the proper legal process to remove a police chief from his post.
Swanson was put on leave after the judges ruling and Duffy and officials now must decide how to proceed. Duffy, the Woodstock Selectboard and the Village Trustees all declined this week to discuss the Swanson situation. 
McIlroy said she was “proud” that the boards wanted him to stay. “We certainly did not want him to leave,” she said. Duffy credited the “overwhelming support” from the community and staff for his decision to remain Municipal Manager. 
“I saw someone over the weekend and they said me staying was the best Christmas gift they could get,” Duffy said.

Those struggles can also lead to higher dropout rates and lower grades, said Josh Anderson of FutureEd, an education think tank. It’s like a stone dropping in a pond, with the impact rippling outward. 
But wraparound services, such as washers and dryers and food pantries, can directly counteract these negative effects, research shows. 
About 25 million students, or more than half of public school students in the country, were eligible for free or reduced-price lunch during the 2022-23 school year. Wraparound services are also essential in a district like Jackson Public Schools, where about a third of students live in poverty.
Jackson Public Schools leaders say the district works hard to eliminate barriers to education through wraparound services especially at their four “community schools.”
It’s a long-standing, mutually-beneficial model where communities pour into their schools to create students who will go on to support their communities. Jackson’s community schools aim to support the whole student, inside and out of the classroom.
“We preach it all day long: What’s your plus?” said Stacey Webb, principal of Lanier Junior Senior High School. “It’s a diploma, plus. It’s not just about academics, but also providing things to help scholars be successful.”

But the services don’t just affect the students. Caring for the child includes caring for their families, Webb said. The services impact parents, too, boosting engagement and cementing schools as the anchors of their communities. 
“A helpful way to think about this is the hours we have,” Anderson said. “If you add them up over 18 or 20 years, we’re spending less than 20% of those hours in a school building and a lot more of our hours with our families and in our neighborhoods. 
“Schools are vital, and we need them to be better and better. But if we want kids to be ready to learn in school, supporting the family makes a tremendous difference.”
‘Just showing we care’
Laundry services operate on a need-to-know basis at Lanier. 
Students put their clothes in a laundry bag and hand it to a teacher, and by the end of the day, their clothes are washed, dried, folded and ready to go home with them — no questions asked. 
Parents in need, too, can wash their clothes at the school on weekends. 
“If the only thing keeping you from coming to school, we’re going to take care of that for you,” Webb said. “I tell my scholars all the time, we’re going to break the cycle some of them are in.”
The home appliance company Whirlpool started donating washer and dryers to schools across the country in 2015, making it easier for students to have access to clean clothes. At the end of the 2022-2023 school year, nearly 61% of students at participating schools considered at risk for chronic absenteeism were no longer at risk, according to the company. 

Laundry services are just one of the ways educators at Lanier care for their students. The school also operates a clothes closet — stocked with prom dresses, professional clothes for jobs interviews, school uniforms and casual attire — a food pantry and health clinic.
The clinic, staffed by nurse practitioners and nurses, opened a decade ago through a partnership with University of Mississippi Medical Center. 
Students can receive primary and preventive care of the clinic — services like mental health and physical assessments, prenatal care and asthma management — instead of missing class to go to a doctor’s office. 
Webb said all of these services the school provides signals to the students that their teachers and principals care about them, which she’s seen reflected in student grades and attendance.
“I believe it’s about the relationship, just showing we care about you as a person,” she said. “I tell my staff and students that if you can develop a relationship with someone, you can do anything to help them.”
Serving the whole family
This past school year, more than a quarter of K-12 students were considered chronically absent statewide, according to data from the Mississippi Department of Education. That’s more than double the rate during the 2018-19 school year. 
More than a third of JPS students are chronically absent. 
The more needs students can have addressed at school, the more likely they are to stay in class, Johnson Elementary Principal Guyniesha Johnson said. 
“If they don’t have a way to wash their clothes, let’s provide them with one,” she said. “If they don’t have food, let’s get them food. It’s our goal to meet all of those needs.”

Aside from laundry services and a uniform closet, the school has operated a weekend food service for years through a partnership with the Mississippi Food Network and the Junior League of Jackson: Students can take home a bag of food on Friday that will last their family through the weekend. Last year, Johnson Elementary also started stocking a food pantry, where students can go “shopping” for groceries.
Johnson Elementary is located in the Georgetown neighborhood. Many homes in the community continue to be multi-generational, the principal said, with grandparents and great-grandparents living in the same house as their grandchildren. 
The neighborhood has seen decreasing access to fresh food over the years, Johnson said — today, there’s just one grocery store. 
When food insecurity is an issue for a Johnson Elementary student, their families are struggling, too. Part of the district’s community schools model is to help the whole family, Johnson said. 
“We ask the kids how many people live in their household because we expect and believe that the food is to help everybody, not just our students,” she said. “We want to be able to fill those gaps.”
Reducing barriers to learning
Everything a student might need is located in one room at Walton Elementary School: The aptly-named “community room.”
The room houses nonperishable food items, uniforms, backpacks, coats, personal hygiene products, and on occasion, even bikes.

Principal LaRoy Merrick considers it a personal responsibility to keep the room stocked at all times, making sure the needs of all of his students are met. 
“I can’t control what a child gets when they leave me, but while they’re with me, they’re getting everything they need,” he said. “My responsibility is to make sure they’re educated and nurtured and loved.”
The school relies on community partnerships to serve its students. During the holidays, nearby Cade Chapel Missionary Baptist Church provides Thanksgiving meals to students and their families. The Junior League of Jackson hosts a sort of farmers market once a month at the school, where families can select fresh groceries to take home. 
“We’re a family here,” Merrick said. “In order to educate students’ minds, we have to educate them in all other ways.”
That community collaboration component is integral because schools alone cannot solve the myriad of challenges students face, said Anderson of FutureEd. A web of community partnerships help support the schools’ work. 
“If you provide support to a child and their family, you are doing one of two things, and both are super helpful,” he said. “You’re reducing barriers for them to get to school ready to learn … and you’re making home a more conducive environment for child development. A model that does these things consistently can make a meaningful contribution to a child’s wellbeing.”
It’s work that’s going to impact students far beyond their years at school, he said, “20 years down the road.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/05140308/3X0A2256.jpg,,,2025-12-26 15:58:33.029689

Gardner Policy Institute report on agriculture in Utah.
During a 2022 census of agriculture in the state, the average price of a pound of ground beef was $1.71. That year cattle sales represented about 26% of the state’s livestock and poultry product sales in the state, according to the report, accounting for $427.5 million.
That price soared, reaching “an all-time high” of $6.32 in August 2025.

“Declining cattle inventories, sustained demand, and rising input prices are (driving) the price increase,” the report says. “While producers benefit from higher beef prices in the short term, they are faced with higher costs to rebuild their herds in the long term.”
Hog production is also in sharp decline in Utah. After Smithfield Foods, the largest pork producer in Utah, ended contracts with 26 hog farms in the state in late 2023, the inventory of hogs fell from a high of over 1 million in September of 2020 to 105,000 in September 2024, researchers wrote. 
Smithfield Foods announced its decision to end the contracts “to optimize its supply chain for more efficient operations in the face of an industry oversupply of pork, weaker consumer demand and high feed prices,” the company said in a news release issued in 2023. 



Let us know what you think...


 


While farmers are receiving more money for their products, nationally, their business costs have been more volatile, the Gardner Institute wrote. 
“The prices paid index for crops has been relatively stable since 2022, while the prices received dropped from 2022 through early 2025 before recovering slightly,” the report says. “For livestock, the prices paid index steadily rose from 2020 through 2025, while the prices received index grew more rapidly over this period.”
The 2022 census also measured that farm sales in the state totaled $2.3 billion that year. 
“While the sales of agricultural products represented a small share of the state’s overall economy, agriculture plays an important role in many rural areas and covers nearly one-fifth of all land statewide,” researchers found.

David Rochefort, a Littleton Republican, said he and the state’s legislative staff are in the process of drafting a bill aimed at addressing systemic abuse and neglect issues in New Hampshire intellectual and developmental disability care system.
In November, the Bulletin published a series of articles outlining abuse and neglect — sometimes fatal — committed by caretakers against people with disabilities. The stories also uncovered systemic failures of oversight and prevention that allowed the abuse and neglect to happen. State records obtained by the Bulletin show that from January 2023 through the first six months of 2025, 467 credible reports of abuse, neglect, and exploitation against people in the system were investigated by the state. The records also show 119 deaths occurred across the system during that time.
People with intellectual and developmental disabilities are legally entitled to care funded and overseen by the state. In New Hampshire, the Department of Health and Human Services’ Bureau of Developmental Services contracts with 10 private area agencies, each responsible for a region of the state, to coordinate the care.
While investigating these tragedies, the Bulletin spoke with several family members of people within this system who were abused or neglected, their attorneys, and advocates within the community. Rochefort, who is chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said the series alarmed him and pushed him to look into the issue.

“I don’t think there’s any opposition to making change here,” Rochefort said. “I think there’s a real desire to do something now from everyone involved, even senators who are not on (the Health and Human Services Committee), who approached me on this.”
He said colleagues from both parties have expressed support for the effort.
“I think that you’re going to see action happen sooner rather than later,” Rochefort said. “Nobody wants to kick the can here.”
Rochefort said he and his colleagues are “still working out the finer details” of the bill, but it’ll seek to strengthen oversight and improve data sharing to allow officials to better identify issues.
“Data on these things would be shared automatically, rather than the way that it’s shared now,” he said. “And it would give the state a better way to either respond to complaints or take action if there’s an issue.”
He also said the bill changes the composition of the Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adults Fatality Review Committee — a panel established by state law to review concerning deaths and make recommendations on how the state can prevent similar deaths in the future — to allow for “better representation of the communities affected and the people that would actually be able to affect change.”
The Bulletin previously reported on the December 2022 death of Stephen Weidlich Jr., a man with physical and developmental disabilities who was found dead behind the care home where he lived. Additionally, in July 2019, Christine Marie Bill, a woman with disabilities, was found dead after overheating in a hot, sealed car, according to the Bulletin’s reporting. Before the Bulletin published its findings, the co-chairs of the Incapacitated and Vulnerable Adults Fatality Review Committee, Vanessa Blais and Francesca Broderick, said they hadn’t been told about either death and that each should have been reviewed by the committee.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/statehousclouds-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-26 14:57:12.152950
,Mississippi Today,2025-12-26 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Some professors say students struggle with reading and critical thinking. This center at UM tackles a more complicated truth,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/26/um-center-supports-relevant-reading/,"Students told Liz Norell, who oversees the University of Mississippi's Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning, that they don't do course readings if the assignments seem irrelevant or redundant.","There’s a complaint that Liz Norell often hears from faculty at the University of Mississippi: Students are not doing the course readings.
Is it true? And if so, what should professors be doing to help students?  
“We’ve been talking about this issue for as long as I’ve been in higher ed, and that’s almost 20-something years,” said Norell, an associate director of instructional support at the university’s Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning. “It’s obviously much more complex than just a simple solution or answer. But I think we’re all trying to figure out how to reach our students in this time when everything feels so hard.” 
Norell provides resources, professional development and other services to help faculty improve their teaching. Her role at the center aims to promote innovative teaching practices, improve student success and create more inclusive learning environments. 
When these professors’ broad theories about college students’ reading habits became too critical, Norell spoke with students.
Last spring, she surveyed 155 students about their reading habits. That semester, Norell also created a student focus group to gather more input for her research. Students shared with her three common reasons why they didn’t complete reading assignments. 
First, some instructors didn’t talk about the readings in class, which students said  made the assignments seem pointless. Some students said they felt unsure of how to apply the information they read on exams or in class discussions. Other students said the assigned readings for different classes within the same major or field of study were too similar. 
Rethinking the types of supplemental materials faculty assign could help their students, Norell said. Reading assignments should be relevant or purposeful to students’ lives. 
“My students tell me all the time, ‘Why do I need to read this? Why should I care about this?’” Norell said. “If I can’t answer that question as an instructor, or if my answer is ‘Because I told you to,’ then I’m not motivating students to learn.” 
Creating ‘aha moments’ in the classroom 
When assistant professor Corbit Franks began teaching athletic training, he considered himself a traditionalist.  
Franks, who is also a clinical education coordinator of athletic training, was adamant about assigning coursework that included lengthy peer-reviewed journal articles and multiple textbook chapters. He also insisted students write papers and do critical analyses of the class readings. 
Since Franks began working with Norell and her team at the center, he adjusted his teaching style and syllabi to accommodate what he sees as a decline in students’ willingness to read and engage with supplemental class work.  His new approach often involves providing “a thoughtful explanation” of why the course readings are useful for future clinicians and healthcare professionals.

If students come to class prepared to discuss supplemental readings such as research and peer-reviewed journal articles from the National Athletic Trainers Association Position Statement website, their knowledge of the profession, the human body and themselves will improve, he said. That effort can also help students pass their board certification exam. 
“When you look at most of the professions that these students are getting into, the biggest thing that they need is the ability to critically think and build upon one complex thought off of another,” Franks said. 
Franks said he tries to create “aha moments,” in class through reading discussion. It helps students see beyond the class and semester. The discussions can also help them engage with their future patients, clients and or athletes, he said. 
He also allows his students autonomy to design coursework such as questions for quizzes and exams, which helps him understand if they have a grasp on the reading assignments. 
Franks also redesigned his assignments around the skills he wants students to learn. 
“When it comes to certain projects, I allow them to do videos, podcasts or find other creative ways to show off their personality,” Franks said. “It allows students to learn, think creatively and critically, plus relay the information in a way they understand. Plus, it creates a sense of equity in the classroom.” 
Franks said he no longer sees teaching as a one-way street, with the instructor as the “authority figure ruling with an iron fist.” Instead, he said, his approach is a constant dialogue with his students.
“When you enter a classroom, you enter into a kind of a contractual agreement or mutual respect between student and instructor that you both are there for the betterment of the greater good,” Franks said. “It makes them feel comfortable to share and express their needs, thoughts or ask for help. It is effective for their overall success which is why I began teaching in the first place.” 
Getting back to the principles of teaching 
In October, Norell presented her first set of preliminary data on students’ reading habits to faculty in a small workshop titled “When and Why Do Students Read for Class?” She highlighted the disconnect she found between students’ motivation to read and what they are asked to do or learn for the course. 
Of students who responded to Norell’s survey, 55% reported a high motivation to complete their assignments, but less than 46% said they felt engaged with the course material.  Less than 44% said they felt well supported in their efforts to learn. The qualitative results also indicated that students don’t feel the assigned reading is useful or connected to their class performance.

Caris Miller, a senior studying integrated marketing, said she is the type of student who reads and completes all of her assigned readings for her classes. But if professors don’t use the textbooks students bought for class, students may feel less obligated to do the readings required for the course, she said. 
“Professors don’t understand that we also have four other classes we’re juggling, so having eight required textbooks that we don’t need, but you have us buy, just feels like a waste of our resources,” Miller said. “A lot of us here are also on loans or student scholarships. We have to be smart about everything, including our money.” 
Norell also asked faculty members to reflect on their own reading habits. It opened discussion around a point often overlooked on the issue: Students’ and adults’ ability to read and focus for long periods of time has decreased. 
A 2021 Gallup poll results released in 2022 indicated U.S. adults are reading about two or three fewer books than they did between 2002 and 2016. The numbers are lower for college graduates, according to Gallup. They read an average of about six fewer books in 2021 than they did between 2002 and 2016.
“There’s an opportunity for us all to think about reading like practice, such as building muscle or a yoga practice where you’re investing time to do it.” 
Norell said she is recruiting other colleges and universities to assist with her research project. Gathering student input from other institutions across the country will help paint a national picture of the trends and patterns in students’ reading choices, she said. 
That input can also help better understand faculty members’ perceptions of the issue. 
“I believe that learning happens when we are in environments where we feel psychologically safe, where we feel like we belong, and where we feel like people care about us,” Norell said. “And that’s all relational.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/03141842/3X0A6095.jpg,,,2025-12-26 14:11:40.906325

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Gov. Mike Dunleavy has appointed two Republicans from the Matanuska-Susitna Borough to fill vacant seats in the Alaska House of Representatives.
The Republican governor made the appointments Wednesday, and the two men may replace Sens. Cathy Tilton, R-Wasilla, and George Rauscher, R-Sutton, whom the governor previously appointed to fill two vacancies in the Senate.
Both appointees are subject to a confirmation vote of House Republicans.
Stephan St. Clair, a former Tilton aide, is Dunleavy’s choice to fill her vacant seat. He is a retired military police first sergeant and has lived in Wasilla for 15 years, according to a statement from the governor’s office. 
Dunleavy picked Garrett Nelson, a salesman and family man, according to his LinkedIn profile, to Rauscher’s seat. He has lived in Sutton for nearly a decade and is chair of the Sutton Community Council.
The appointments come after two resignations in the Senate set off a domino effect of appointments to what are typically elected positions. Sens. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, and Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned in November to pursue campaigns for lieutenant governor and governor, respectively.
The governor then had 30 days to appoint their replacements, Tilton and Rauscher, who were confirmed by Senate Republicans.
The governor then had until Dec. 29 to select his picks to replace them.
The legislative session begins on Jan. 20.

The unified GOP government enacted a major tax cuts and domestic spending law in July, but hit a roadblock in late September when the federal government shut down for a record-breaking six weeks.Here’s a look back at some of the biggest news stories from Washington, D.C.January The U.S. House began the year reelecting Louisiana Republican Mike Johnson as speaker and pushing through a series of GOP-favored bills focused on immigration and transgender student athletes. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., officially took over the role from Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pledging to protect the legislative filibuster, the 60-vote procedural hurdle that requires at least some bipartisanship for major legislation to advance. Meanwhile, several committees began the confirmation process for Trump’s nominees.

Just days ahead of his second inauguration, a judge sentenced Trump in the New York hush money case for paying off an adult film star in the leadup to the 2016 election. Trump, who moved his inauguration indoors amid arctic weather, marked the first day of his second term by signing a series of executive orders addressing immigration and birthright citizenship, as well as climate change and LGBTQ rights. He also pardoned 1,500 people who were convicted of various crimes related to the Jan. 6. 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Just before the end of the month, Trump signed the first bill approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, the Laken Riley Act. And he announced plans to implement tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the start of one of his signature economic policies. FebruaryLawsuits against Trump’s actions began piling up within weeks as Democratic attorneys general, immigrant rights organizations and civil liberties groups accused the administration of overstepping its authority. Trump and other administration officials sought to reduce the size and scope of the federal government by firing thousands of probationary workers and called on the heads of all federal agencies to submit reorganization plans by mid-March. He also fired 20 immigration judges.Republicans in Congress started working through the several complicated steps of the budget reconciliation process that would eventually lead to the “big, beautiful bill.” MarchTrump’s efforts to dismantle the Department of Education began advancing shortly after the Senate voted to confirm Linda McMahon as secretary. In one of her first acts leading the department, she wrote in a memo its “final mission” would be to “to send education back to the states and empower all parents to choose an excellent education for their children.”Trump signed an executive order later in the month directing McMahon to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the Education Department, though much of that authority rests with Congress. Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts issued a rare public statement defending the judicial branch against criticism from Trump. The Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee asked the Defense Department inspector general to look into the use of the Signal messaging app by high-ranking officials to discuss an imminent bombing in Yemen. A journalist at The Atlantic was inadvertently added to the chat and later published a series of articles about the experience. AprilThe Trump administration admitted in court filings that officials mistakenly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.

The Supreme Court became more involved in the national debate about Trump’s policies toward immigrants, first ruling that the administration didn’t need to bring Abrego Garcia back before reversing course and ruling officials must “facilitate” his return to the United States. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, sitting alongside Trump in the Oval Office, later said he wouldn’t send Abrego Garcia back.Separately, Trump’s tariff policies were the focus of a Senate hearing. Republicans in Congress settled on an outline for their “big, beautiful bill” and later began advancing different parts of that package out of House committees. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would refocus autism research funding on environmental factors. And Trump signed a series of executive orders addressing education policy. MayThe Supreme Court ruled that a ban on transgender people serving in the military could remain in place while the case continued at a lower level, that the Trump administration violated due process rights when it tried to deport some Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, that the administration could end temporary protected status for 350,000 Venezuelans, and that the Trump administration could proceed with deportations for 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who had been granted temporary protected status. Republicans in the House voted to approve a 1,116-page package that combined 11 bills into what would eventually become the “big, beautiful bill,” sending the measure to the Senate. Former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with “a more aggressive form” of prostate cancer.JuneTrump doubled tariffs on steel and aluminum, from 25% to 50%, saying during a trip to a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania that he would increase them even further if he thought it would be necessary to “secure the steel industry in the United States.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reported later in the month that his tariff policies would reduce the country’s deficit but likely slow the economy. Immigration continued to be a central part of the news cycle with Abrego Garcia returning to the U.S., California Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla being forcibly removed and handcuffed while attempting to ask Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem a question during a press conference in Los Angeles and the Supreme Court weighing in on lower courts issuing nationwide injunctions. Trump said the U.S. military had bombed ""three key nuclear facilities"" in Iran before calling for peace.

JulyThe Senate approved the final, much reworked version of the “big, beautiful bill,” sending it back to the House, which voted along party lines to clear the sweeping tax and health care package for Trump, who signed it on the Fourth of July. The legislation included several policy goals for the GOP, including on Medicaid, immigration and deportations and a national private school voucher program. The Congressional Budget Office expects the law will increase the federal deficit by $3.394 trillion during the next decade and lead 10 million people to lose access to health insurance.The Supreme Court ruled the Trump administration could continue with its plans for mass layoffs and downsizing at the Education Department.Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a “benign and common” condition for people over the age of 70, according to U.S. Navy Capt. Sean Barbabella, the president’s physician.Senators from both parties expressed frustration that Department of Agriculture officials didn’t consult with Congress before proposing to move thousands of jobs out of the Washington, D.C., area. Trump announced a deal with European Union leaders that would result in a 15% tariff on most goods coming into the U.S. from those 27 countries.August

Trump started off the month instituting a 15% tariff on goods brought into the U.S. from about three dozen countries, though he raised that amount for several nations, including 18% on products from Nicaragua, 30% on imports from South Africa and 50% on goods from Brazil.A New York State appeals court ruled the $465 million civil penalty against Trump in the case where he was found liable for financial fraud for inflating the worth of some of his real estate holdings was excessive.Republican and Democratic state legislatures, urged on by the president and members of Congress, sought to begin the November 2026 midterm elections early by redrawing maps for U.S. House seats to give their party a baked-in advantage. Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook sued Trump after he attempted to fire her, arguing in court documents his actions were an “unprecedented and illegal attempt” that would erode the board’s independence. SeptemberA federal appeals court ruled that Trump did need to pay an $83 million penalty for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. The Supreme Court ruled that federal immigration agents could racially profile Latinos in Southern California as a lawsuit over the issue continued through the federal courts. Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez testified before a Senate committee that she was fired from that role after less than a month because she refused to pre-approve vaccine recommendations. Trump and several other high-ranking Republicans spoke at the memorial service for conservative political activist Charlie Kirk, who was assassinated during an event at Utah Valley University. Kirk’s death was one of several instances of political violence this year that also included the killing of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, the arson at the official home of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and the shooting at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta.A group of U.S. investors reached an agreement to take over TikTok, the immensely popular social media app, avoiding the need for it to go offline in the United States. OctoberCongress failed to approve the dozen full-year government funding bills before the start of the new fiscal year, leaving an opening for a government shutdown. Democrats tried to bring attention to health care costs and other issues throughout the weeks-long debacle. The funding stalemate impacted nearly every corner of the federal government, including pay for federal employees like air traffic controllers, food aid for lower-income families, Head Start and public lands.  The No Kings day protests highlighted some Americans' discontent with Trump and Republican policies a little more than a year before the 2026 midterm elections will measure that frustration at the ballot box. Trump demolished the East Wing of the White House to make way for construction of a ballroom that will be nearly double the size of the 55,000-square-foot residence and workplace. November The shutdown stalemate ended after Senate Majority Leader Thune promised Democrats a vote on a health care bill of their choosing before the end of the year. The funding bill approved by Congress and signed by Trump included three full-year funding bills but a stopgap for the rest of government, setting up the possibility of a partial government shutdown beginning in February if lawmakers don’t broker a deal before then. The final days of the shutdown included a tug-of-war between the judicial branch and the Trump administration over whether they needed to pay full benefits for the 42 million people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case that will determine whether Trump overstepped when he instituted tariffs using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Separately, the justices allowed the Trump administration to continue issuing male or female passports based on a person’s assigned sex at birth. Congress approved a bill forcing the Trump administration to release the Epstein files. A gunman opened fired on two National Guard members from West Virginia who were just blocks from the White House. U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died the next day as a result of her injuries.

December The man charged with shooting the two National Guard members pleaded not guilty during an arraignment hearing and was denied bond in the case, which was later moved to federal court as prosecutors contemplated whether to seek the death penalty.  The Trump administration moved to limit legal immigration and pressed for mass deportations, raising concerns about the shooter, an Afghan national who worked alongside allied troops and was granted asylum in the United States.Separately, the FBI charged a 30-year-old Virginia man with placing pipe bombs outside the Democratic National Committee and the Republican National Committee offices ahead of the 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A federal judge ordered immigration officials to release Abrego Garcia.The House and Senate were unable to come up with a bipartisan agreement to avoid a spike in health insurance premiums for the 22 million Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act marketplace who have benefited from an enhanced tax credit created during the coronavirus pandemic to make coverage less expensive. But a discharge petition in the House will force a floor vote early in the new year to extend the subsidies for three more years. The Department of Justice released tens of thousands of documents linked to the investigation into deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein before announcing officials had received a million more pages that will be published in the coming weeks.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-12-26 13:11:56.568800

Un viernes por la noche reciente, los organizadores de un festival comunitario en San Marcos estaban ocupados planeando una procesión vecinal y preparando bandejas de tamales para los invitados.
Al mismo tiempo, estaban preparando a la seguridad para vigilar la actividad de ICE en el área mayoritariamente latina y de bajos ingresos del norte del condado de San Diego.
 “Dependemos de la comunidad”, dijo la concejal de San Marcos, María Núñez, quien representa al Distrito 1 de San Marcos, donde el 55% de la población en edad de votar es hispana. “La gente está en alerta máxima. Si ven algo, escuchan algo, si hay ICE en la zona, nos avisarán”.
 La Universidad Popular, una organización cívica del norte del condado de San Diego, patrocinó el evento, llamado Posada Comunitaria, junto con la iglesia local Restoration Abbey. Es la tercera vez que se celebra en San Marcos, pero este año las festividades se celebraron en un contexto de aprehensión debido al recrudecimiento de las medidas migratorias bajo la administración Trump.
 La procesión, o posada, recrea tradicionalmente la peregrinación de María y José a Belén antes del nacimiento de Cristo. En San Marcos, residentes y organizadores desfilaron por el barrio, donde los complejos de viviendas asequibles albergan a muchas familias inmigrantes.
El evento sitúa la historia del Adviento en un contexto moderno, dijo Alex Aguas, sacerdote de  Restoration Abbey, que presta ayuda a solicitantes de asilo.
 “La práctica de la Posada realmente invita a la gente a reflexionar sobre ‘¿qué significa ser rechazado?’”, dijo. “O ‘¿qué significa estar al margen y buscar refugio en estos momentos?’. También tenemos la oportunidad de celebrar”.
 Mientras los invitados llegaban y bebían tazas de café y sidra de manzana, los voluntarios de seguridad con chalecos de color rosa intenso se reunían para discutir cómo gestionar el control del tráfico y estar atentos a los agentes de inmigración.

 “Todos nuestros equipos, todos nuestros chalecos rosados, han recibido capacitación en respuesta a la inmigración”, dijo Arcela Núñez, codirectora de la Universidad Popular y hermana de María Núñez. “Tenemos personal vigilando todos los puntos de este barrio”.
San Marcos, una ciudad de 94,000 habitantes en el norte del Condado de San Diego, parece registrar solo unos pocos arrestos por inmigración en el área de San Diego. Sin embargo, datos gubernamentales sugieren que las cifras han aumentado este año, y los organizadores afirman haber observado una mayor actividad migratoria recientemente.
 El Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE) ha arrestado al menos a 38 personas en San Marcos desde septiembre de 2023, 20 de las cuales se realizaron entre junio y octubre de este año, según datos federales proporcionados por el ICE en respuesta a una solicitud de la Ley de Libertad de Información (FOIA), procesados por el Proyecto de Datos de Deportación y analizados por CalMatters. CalMatters contactó al ICE, la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de Estados Unidos (CBP) y el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional de Estados Unidos (DHS) para confirmar las cifras, pero no ha recibido respuesta.
El aumento de la aplicación de la ley y un cambio en la política que permite operativos en áreas como iglesias y escuelas, que anteriormente se consideraban santuarios, han tenido un efecto disuasorio en algunas actividades comunitarias. Arcela Núñez comentó que su organización debatió la posibilidad de cancelar el evento este año debido a estas preocupaciones. Decidieron seguir adelante, pero con cautela.

 Los organizadores estaban particularmente atentos a posibles informes de actividad de ICE en el Home Depot de San Marcos, a menos de una milla de distancia, donde se han llevado a cabo otras redadas de inmigración este año. Las tiendas Home Depot, donde se reúnen jornaleros inmigrantes para buscar trabajo, han sido blanco de las autoridades en Pomona , Los Ángeles y Sacramento este año.
 En octubre, la Patrulla Fronteriza y de Aduanas de Estados Unidos arrestó a 22 personas con antecedentes penales en sucursales de Home Depot en San Marcos y Encinitas, dijo el portavoz del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Jason Givens.
 “Si algo sucede, busquen personal de seguridad con experiencia”, dijo Flower Álvarez-López, codirectora de la Universidad Popular, a unas dos docenas de voluntarios reunidos en círculo. “Podremos ayudarles”.
Los voluntarios distribuyeron velas entre los participantes, quienes formaron fila para marchar por el patio de un edificio de apartamentos vecino. Los músicos tocaron sus guitarras mientras cientos de cantantes les dieron una serenata a los residentes con melodías tradicionales como “Noche de Paz” y “Letanía para pedir posada”.
Su siguiente parada fue El Palenque Taco Shop, a la vuelta de la esquina del bulevar San Marcos. Los organizadores usaron linternas para guiar a los participantes e indicarles a los coches en el estacionamiento que dieran paso,  antes de llevar al grupo unas cuantas casas más abajo hasta la Heladería La Michoacana.
Los participantes hicieron una parada más en un complejo de apartamentos antes de regresar a la iglesia, donde las familias hicieron fila para recibir platos repletos de arroz y frijoles, tamales, porciones de pizza y conchas, un pan dulce mexicano.
El evento de San Marcos se desarrolló sin incidentes, pero ilustra la tensión que enfrentan los líderes comunitarios al intentar planificar celebraciones culturales mientras mantienen la vigilancia ante posibles operaciones de inmigración.
 Inés Delgado, defensora de derechos migratorios del Centro de Recursos LGBTQ del Norte del Condado, en la vecina Oceanside, se ofreció como voluntaria en la posada tras haber organizado una celebración por el Día Internacional del Migrante el jueves por la noche. El viernes por la mañana, comentó que algunos clientes se presentaron a una distribución de alimentos en el centro, pero confesó que habían estado demasiado nerviosos para asistir a las festividades la noche anterior.
 “Muchos dijeron que tenían miedo de salir”, dijo. “Quizás sea por el enfoque en la inmigración, pero también por salir de noche”.

 En las oficinas de la Universidad Popular en San Marcos, un cartel en la puerta dice “Aviso: propiedad y establecimiento privado”, advirtiendo a los agentes de inmigración u otros agentes del orden público que se requiere una orden judicial para ingresar a áreas no públicas.
 En el interior, carteles rosas adornados con flores recuerdan a los clientes su derecho a permanecer en silencio en caso de arresto y a preguntar a los oficiales si están detenidos.
“Muchos de nuestros socios comunitarios están instalando letreros como este”, dijo Arcela Núñez. “Así que si ICE llega, no queremos que entren y queremos que la gente se sienta segura”.
Detrás de su oficina, el grupo cerró la noche con un par de piñatas industriales en forma de estrella. Decenas de niños se esforzaron por romperlas y luego recoger los dulces después de que se reventaran.
 Aunque la organización y la iglesia organizan la posada y otros festivales comunitarios anualmente, la peregrinación vecinal de este año destacó particularmente la difícil situación de los “extraños que buscan bienvenida”, dijo Aguas.
 “En función del clima político cambiante, esa obra adquiere un significado y una resonancia diferentes”.

(Photo by Meghan O'Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)NORRIS — As the last round of students filters in from the school van to the main hallway, Principal Brian Brown greets each student by name, with a high five and an “I’ve been waiting for you all morning.”
After students arrive, they’re served breakfast, and Brown leads a boys’ group and girls’ group in singing Lakota songs to get the day started.
This is the morning routine at Norris Elementary, part of the White River School District in rural southwestern South Dakota. The school borders the Pine Ridge and Rosebud reservations, and serves about 50 students from kindergarten through fifth grade who are predominantly Native American.

Norris is an unincorporated community in Mellette County, one of the most impoverished counties in the state. About a third of the students are raised by their grandparents, Brown said.
“We’ve still got kids that live in houses with no running water,” he said. “So, we have our struggles, we have our hardships.”
Three years ago, barely half of the school’s students were coming to class regularly. That struggle is common for schools serving Native American students in the state, according to data from the state Department of Education. Last school year, nearly half of Native American students were chronically absent, more than double the statewide rate.
But now, Norris’ attendance is above 90%. That’s higher than both the district and state averages. It’s been achieved by engaging one-on-one with students and families and implementing Lakota language and cultural programming.
The improvement is a source of pride for Brown and his staff.
“We can do it,” he said. “We can be successful, we can show people that we care about school and that we want to be the best that we can be.”
South Dakota Secretary of Education Joseph Graves has noticed the improvement. He said keeping students engaged through culturally relevant lessons and communication is an important part of replicating what’s happening at Norris.
“But it’s also that leadership, those people who are willing to make that happen, engage with kids,” Graves said. “You put those two together and it’s proven to be a very strong factor in the success.”
Graves said he wants to keep watching the school, to see if the trend continues and if it leads to increased proficiency and graduation rates.
The geographic isolation at Norris makes it difficult to hire and recruit teachers and staff. Two teachers are in dual-grade classrooms, the school’s head custodian and office administrator are also the school’s bus drivers, and Brown steps in at lunchtime to help serve food.
“We kind of have to make and manipulate our own resources just to get the kids what they need,” Brown said. “It’s been challenging, but then also, it’s been eye-opening to address the needs of the kids out here at Norris.”
Norris is one of many schools across the state trying to fill teaching positions. As of July, there were 144 open teaching positions, according to data from Associated School Boards of South Dakota.
A part of Brown’s morning routine is checking in with teachers during breakfast to ask which students they haven’t seen yet. If they aren’t there for roll call, Brown hits the road for a home visit.
He would’ve been doing that on a recent morning, he said, if he wasn’t talking to a reporter.
“I probably would’ve already went out this morning, and probably would have went and visited at least two houses this morning to parents and say, ‘Hey, how’s it going? What do you need? How can I help you?’” he said.
It’s not just about getting the kids to school. It’s about them wanting to come to school, Brown said.

He also prints and posts photos around the school to acknowledge students who have done well in sports, academics and extracurricular activities. (Photo by Meghan O’Brien/South Dakota Searchlight)

In a small community, it takes everyone to keep students involved, said Wendy O’Brien, who teaches fourth and fifth grade at Norris.
“If you get the community members involved, and they come into the classroom and see what the kids are doing, I think they’re more supportive,” she said.
She wants students to form habits of good attendance. It’s especially important for students in her two-grade classroom.
“When they miss school, they miss learning,” O’Brien said. “Working with two grades, you don’t have time to reteach lessons.”
It’s also important to make the kids feel seen, Brown said. After taking over as principal in 2022, Brown, who works to preserve Lakota language, songs and philosophy, started finding ways to include Lakota culture in the school day.
Now, the morning announcements are followed by a group of students leading the school in Lakota songs. He also teaches Lakota studies to each grade once a week, and started the school’s first traditional Lakota drum group: the Black Pipe Singers.
“When children know their identity, they know who they are, where they come from, they will excel better academically and in basic life skills,” Brown said.
It’s one of the ways he can set students up for success before they get to high school, where more than one-third of Native American students in public schools don’t graduate, according to recent state data.
Brown calls the habits learned in elementary school the “bread and butter” of a student’s academic journey.
“It’s important to go to school every day, be on time, do the best that you can and work hard,” he said. “It promotes a more successful life for the children, and that’s what we try to establish here at Norris.”

Las tortillas que se venden en California tendrán un nuevo ingrediente, uno que está destinado a garantizar la nutrición de los bebés.
 A partir del 1 de enero, entrará en vigor una nueva ley que exigirá que la mayoría de las tortillas y productos de masa de maíz vendidos en el estado contengan ácido fólico, una vitamina importante para la salud infantil.
Las latinas en California tienen muchas menos probabilidades que otras mujeres de obtener suficiente ácido fólico al comienzo del embarazo, una brecha que puede provocar defectos de nacimiento.
 Los datos estatales muestran que, entre 2017 y 2019 (los últimos años disponibles), aproximadamente el 28 % de las latinas reportaron haber tomado ácido fólico el mes anterior al embarazo. Las mujeres blancas consumieron la vitamina con mayor frecuencia: el 46 % reportó consumir ácido fólico, según el Departamento de Salud Pública de California.
Esto aumenta el riesgo de que las latinas tengan un bebé con defectos del tubo neural, una estructura embrionaria que después se convierte en el cerebro y la médula espinal. Algunos ejemplos de problemas del tubo neural son la espina bífida y la anencefalia.
 Las investigaciones han demostrado que el ácido fólico puede reducir los defectos congénitos hasta en un 70 % . Por eso se encuentra en las vitaminas prenatales. Sin embargo, dado que las mujeres pueden no descubrir que están embarazadas hasta semanas o meses después, la salud pública recomienda desde hace tiempo que también se añada ácido fólico a los alimentos básicos.
 En 1998, Estados Unidos exigió a los fabricantes que fortificaran ciertos productos de granos con ácido fólico, como la pasta, el arroz y los cereales, para ayudar a las mujeres en edad reproductiva a obtener las cantidades necesarias. Desde que entró en vigor esta norma, la tasa de bebés nacidos con defectos del tubo neural se ha reducido en aproximadamente un tercio , según los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades.
 Pero incluso con la adición de estos alimentos, las tasas de defectos congénitos entre los bebés nacidos de latinas han sido consistentemente más altas. En busca de una adición más apropiada culturalmente, en 2016, el gobierno federal permitió a los fabricantes de masa de maíz agregar ácido fólico a sus alimentos, pero no lo exigió.
 Joaquín Arámbula, demócrata de Fresno y autor de la ley, dijo que excluir el ácido fólico de los productos de masa de maíz, utilizados en muchos alimentos básicos latinos, fue un “verdadero descuido”.
 Ahora, con la implementación del Proyecto de Ley 1830 de la Asamblea , California es el primer estado en exigir ácido fólico en los productos de masa de maíz. La ley exige que los fabricantes que operan en el estado agreguen 0.7 miligramos de ácido fólico por cada libra de harina e indiquen esta adición en sus etiquetas nutricionales. La ley establece exenciones para productores de lotes pequeños, como restaurantes y mercados, que podrían preparar sus propias tortillas.
 Meses después de la firma de la ley de California, Alabama aprobó su propia versión . Esta ley entrará en vigor en junio de 2026.
 Algunos grandes fabricantes llevan años añadiendo ácido fólico a sus productos. Gruma, empresa matriz de Mission Foods, afirmó que comenzó a fortificar sus alimentos en 2016, cuando el gobierno federal lo autorizó por primera vez. Un portavoz de la empresa afirmó que Gruma mantiene un compromiso de larga data con el apoyo a las iniciativas legislativas de fortificación y apoya las nuevas leyes en California y Alabama.

You can read more about the section here.

Rural communities in Mississippi are constantly being under-resourced, underserved and overlooked.
Growing up in a small town in the Delta, I witnessed firsthand the everyday struggles of my neighbors, from food insecurity caused by high medical expenses to limited access to basic health care services.
I grew up in Belzoni, a small town of less than 1,800 that lost its hospital in 2013. Since then, Belzoni residents have been left vulnerable, with no access to 24/7 emergency care and limited preventive health care options.

Currently Belzoni residents and residents of neighboring towns rely on a single emergency helicopter in Belzoni, and are forced to commute 20 to 35 minutes to the nearest hospital, often during life-threatening emergencies when every minute matters.
This new reality is not just inconvenient; it is extremely dangerous. My community has witnessed community members lose their lives because help could not arrive in time, especially during natural disasters and medical crises.
Without a nearby hospital, many residents began to view health care as a privilege rather than a right, often neglecting their health or abandoning preventive care altogether.
This is not just happening in Belzoni, though. Across Mississippi, nearly half of rural hospitals are at risk of closing, putting thousands more families in danger, according to a 2023 American Hospital Association report.
Additionally, over 200,000 Mississippians fall into the Medicaid coverage gap. They earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, according to a 2024 KFF report.
Without Medicaid expansion, this issue will only worsen.
Medicaid expansion would not solve every issue Mississippi faces, but it would give rural families the chance to invest in their health without sacrificing their essentials and viewing health care as a burden. It would also bring in necessary federal relief to struggling hospitals and provide coverage to families that are caught in the gap.
Medicaid expansion is not a political matter; it is a humanitarian matter.
It is about ensuring that all Mississippians, no matter their location, have access to reliable and quality health care instead of risking their lives simply because of where they live.
We have to take immediate action for our rural communities because they deserve better and simply cannot afford to wait any longer.

The deal is controversial and contested.
However, a spokesperson for NorthWestern Energy said Wednesday the utility anticipates a green light from FERC.
“We are working with FERC to provide additional information and are confident our application will be approved,” said NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black in an email.
NorthWestern Energy announced in August 2024 it would acquire the Puget shares at the coal-fired electricity plant at Colstrip at no cost. Puget is based in Washington, where state law ends coal-fired electricity for state customers by the end of 2025.
NorthWestern said the new shares would provide a benefit to existing customers on Jan. 1, 2026, when the utility acquired them.
However, NorthWestern since created a subsidiary it said would receive all the Puget shares, and it told the Public Service Commission the shell company was outside the authority of regulators.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities in Montana.
This fall, the NorthWestern subsidiary filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to sell power from the Puget shares on the wholesale market.
In a move it later reversed, the Public Service Commission demanded the feds investigate the monopoly utility for attempting to evade the law in shifting the shares to the new subsidiary; the PSC said it would proceed with its own inquiry instead.
An energy watchdog, the Montana Environmental Information Center, has protested NorthWestern’s federal application and filed to intervene in the case.
The energy nonprofit argues in part that the NorthWestern subsidiary should have secured federal authorization for the planned transfer — and its failure to do so is “fatal” to any approval request for a wholesale deal.
The MEIC also said NorthWestern has not shown that existing customers won’t be subsidizing the costs for the wholesale market deals.
In its own filing, the NorthWestern subsidiary argues the feds should reject the argument that the transfer of the Puget shares needs federal approval in part because the utility says the value of the shares doesn’t hit a financial threshold for approval — $10 million.
The MEIC disagrees; the nonprofit said just because the cost of the shares was $0 doesn’t mean the value of the asset is $0.
It said NorthWestern itself has estimated annual revenues of nearly $30 million from the asset and said it would cost $700 million to build an equivalent plant.
Wednesday, NorthWestern did not have an estimate of the value of the shares immediately available, but in a filing, it argues the nonprofit isn’t using an appropriate measure to value them.
The value is one request from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
In the letter calling for additional information, FERC said the NorthWestern subsidiary must provide the original cost of the shares being transferred, undepreciated, in its filing.
The feds also called for details about the transfer within NorthWestern, including ownership arrangements, timing of arrangements, and rights or veto powers to any parties that are “disproportionate” to the deal.
“For example, do any of the owners hold special share classes with different rights that do not match their economic interest?” the letter said.
The letter called for specific information about the timing and structure of the transfer of shares from Puget to NorthWestern, and the timing of the transfer of the ownership interest between NorthWestern and the subsidiary, NorthWestern Colstrip 370Pu LLC.
The letter gives the NorthWestern subsidiary 30 days to provide the additional information.
In the meantime, NorthWestern spokesperson Black said the acquisition from Puget will be complete on Jan. 1, 2026. NorthWestern did not address what its plans are for the shares while the case is pending.
The NorthWestern subsidiary entered into a 21-month contract with Mercuria Energy America LLC and filed for FERC approval of the contract.
That request is also pending with FERC.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/IMG-0028-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-26 10:58:36.405620

Dear Readers,
Here at VTDigger, we’re gearing up for a new legislative session beginning January 6. I’m writing to you to share what your support will help us do this session and why it matters so much.
Right now, there are only a few days left in our year end member drive and I am told we still have $293K left to go to reach our goal. 
All gifts are tripled today thanks to a generous group of Vermont donors. Every contribution helps us toward our goal. Will you join us?

3X your gift

For five months each year, the work of state government shifts into full public view. Decisions that are often made behind closed doors or over private video calls move into open committee rooms. Government leaders are pressed on the record. Lawmakers debate ideas in real time. And in the Statehouse hallways, our reporters ask the questions Vermonters need answered.
If you want VTDigger to keep asking those questions, please join our year end member drive with a gift today.
With Vermont losing 75% of its newspaper jobs over the past quarter century, VTDigger’s coverage of the Legislature is essential.
This session, we’ll be digging into major debates that shape daily life: how to fund education amid rising property taxes; whether health care proposals strengthen or strain hospital systems; how the state plans to confront housing shortages and homelessness; and what it will take to prepare communities for major flooding and other climate disasters.
We’ll track key bills, explain what they mean for people, businesses and towns, and flag potential conflicts of interest. We’ll also highlight testimony that doesn’t always make headlines and pay attention to what isn’t being discussed — and why.
Today, we’re asking for your support to help VTDigger keep reporting the stories no one else is covering. Give before midnight on Dec. 31 and your gift will be tripled. 

Triple your impact

Sincerely,

Ethan Weintstein

Director and producer Sharon Liese says the film looks beyond the First Amendment implications of the raids and dives deeper into the small town of Marion in a way the public hasn’t seen before. She called it “a canary in a coal mine” type of story.
“The story that we eventually told is not what you would expect,” Liese said. “It’s not all about the First Amendment. It’s about what happens between a newspaper and its community in a small town. It’ll make people think about what journalism really is and what people really want journalism to be.”
“Seized” will premiere at the Sundance Film Festival Jan. 22 through Feb. 1. It is one of 10 documentary films chosen to compete in the U.S. documentary category and was chosen out of thousands of submitted films. 
Marion Police Chief Gideon Cody and officers carried out a search warrant on the Record newsroom, editor Eric Meyer’s home and a councilwoman’s home in August 2023. The search contributed to the death of Meyer’s 98-year-old mother. Days later, staff published their weekly paper with the headline “Seized but not silenced.”
Kansas Reflector was first to report on the raids, which were based on a nonexistent crime and defied federal and state laws that project journalists. The news brought immediate international scrutiny to the small town of Marion.
Cody is set to stand trial next year for telling a witness after the raids to delete text messages.
Liese, known for other documentaries such as “Transhood” and Emmy-winner “Flagmakers,” was inspired to follow Marion’s story with it being only a few hours away from her home in Overland Park, even though it wasn’t her usual type of story to pursue. 
“I was a little hesitant at first because I’d never started with pursuing a project that already had international visibility,” Liese said. “Every documentary filmmaker from New York City to LA is going to be clamoring to get this story, but then again it’s only two hours from my house. So I just thought I’d give it a whirl.”
Record publisher and editor Eric Meyer agreed to participate in a documentary as long as he had no financial or editorial control, and selected Liese because of her dedication to telling the story beyond just the raids. What mattered to him was journalistic storytelling, he said. 
“Sharon devoted a huge amount of time and effort into this to the point she’s practically a member of the staff here,” Meyer said. “I was never concerned about the journalistic quality. She likes to tell untold stories, whether they’re stories that liberals or conservatives would like.”

“Seized” producer Paul Matyasovsky has worked with Liese since 2023, including the film “Parker,” which was featured at Sundance in 2023. He was drawn to the story similarly to Liese after seeing it on the news.
“I heard about the story the day it happened and was fascinated by it from the beginning,” Matyasovsky said. “I’ve also spent a lot of my career in small towns, and they’re always very unique. That drew me in along with the freedom violations and constitutional questions.”
The more time the small film crew spent in Marion, the more the story evolved as more community members agreed to be interviewed for the film.  
“We wanted to feature the voices that the national media didn’t,” Liese said. “There’s the layer of small town politics, small town dynamics and the power struggle in a small town between a newspaper and its government. We spent two and a half years there. We really got to know the people in the town.”
Matyasovsky said throughout interviews for the documentary, the crew never wanted to take someone’s words out of context or manipulate anyone’s perspective. 
“The town of Marion felt that they were portrayed in the national media as ‘Hickville’ or a bunch of people who didn’t understand or respect anybody,” Matyasovsky said. “I hope that it’s clear that isn’t true. This bad thing should have never happened. But that also doesn’t mean that every single individual in the town is bad. And we all need to work hard to try to prevent these things from happening in the future.”
Meyer said he hopes the documentary will help break stereotypes of the people of Marion along with shining a light on the long-term implications of the raids. 
“We need to make sure that we understand that this is a town where, yes, something bad happened here. But we’re fixing it,” Meyer said. “We want to show this is a town where we won’t tolerate government overreach and bullying. Hopefully, the message is that Marion isn’t the backwater where they try to sit on the First Amendment, but rather when things come up, we deal with it.”
Through telling the story of Marion, “Seized” will serve as a reminder to the nation to remain holding people of power accountable, Meyer said. 
“This is all part of a trend that’s going on in the country of people wanting to use positions of power to bully and limit free speech,” Meyer said. “It’s the fundamental nature of democracy. We shouldn’t hide our heads in shame. Sometimes the best thing to do when something bad happens is to get out in front of it and not let it happen again.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/PA150879-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-26 09:57:31.444356

(Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Donald Trump was sworn in to office as the president of the United States for the second time on Jan. 20. Within hours, he’d signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, prompting New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, then co-chair of the U.S. Climate Alliance, to co-sign a letter refuting the withdrawal. That evening, he issued pardons for nearly all the Jan. 6 defendants. Shortly thereafter, he signed an executive order ending birthright citizenship.
Dear President Trump: NM delegation calls out federal administration

And that was just the beginning. Disruptions, changes and overhauls of federal programs and policies characterized the Trump administration all year long. They included cuts to national programs for education, health and food, along with ongoing efforts to reshape policy policies ranging from public land use to elections.
New Mexico state and federal officials responded in a variety of ways. Lujan Grisham called two special legislative sessions to address cuts in federal funding and allocated $30 million to address shortfalls in food benefits through the United States Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. New Mexico’s five-member federal delegation—all Democrats—registered opposition through letters, news conferences and proposed legislation.
As 2025 draws to a close, Source NM rounds up a non-exhaustive list of highlights from a year of federal fallout for the state. We also spoke with New Mexico U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham about their impressions of the last year. In the coming days, we’ll take a more in depth look at the top immigration, environment and education stories of 2025.

Funding cuts threaten programs for New Mexico

At the end of January, the federal Office of Management and Budget announced the government would temporarily stop payments on a variety of programs, prompting outcry from the state’s congressional delegation and a lawsuit from attorneys general across the country, including New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez. NM’s AG subsequently launched an online portal for programs impacted by the federal freeze to report the impact, which remains active and now includes an interactive map. The delegation continued to push back at what members described as “chaos” created at the start of the year through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury,of New Mexico’s 1st Congressional District introducing in February a bill titled the Nobody Elected Elon Musk Act. Cuts to programs for firefighters, farmers, children and more prompted ongoing opposition from the state’s federal delegation.



Luján: Trump ‘lied to the American people’

Source NM asked U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) to reflect on the first year of Donald Trump’s second term. The following has been edited for concision and clarity.
“When President Trump was running for his second term, President Trump ran on making everything more affordable for the American people. He said, in one form or another, that he would lower the cost of health care, that he would lower the cost of food, that everything would be more affordable under him. To the contrary, we’ve seen food prices go up.
The blanket tariff policy that President Trump keeps bragging about is making food more expensive. It’s making Christmas more expensive. It’s making holidays more expensive for everyday families across the country. 
He lied to the American people. He said he was going to help them, and I really think he’s hurting them. He’s making things worse for them.”



Trump kicks off immigration crackdown

Upon taking office, Trump signed multiple executive orders kicking off an ongoing immigration crackdown, including ones declaring an emergency at the U.S. border with Mexico; ending asylum for immigrants; and ending birthright citizenship. NM AG Torrez joined a coalition of AGs that immediately mounted a legal challenge to the latter order. That order has been blocked by numerous judges this year. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to take it up in 2026. In addition, his administration swapped out public land on the state’s border to the U.S Army and declared it a new “military” zone. The federal departments of justice and homeland security also issued warnings to jurisdictions with so-called “sanctuary” policies. Recent new data showed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested more than 1,800 immigrants in New Mexico in the first 10 months of 2025, more than 12 times as many as the same period last year.
Health care, food benefits cause partisan standoffs

At the start of October, the New Mexico Legislature held a one-day special session in order to allocate funds to blunt the impact of federal funding cuts, and address expiring Affordable Care Act tax insurance premiums. Those tax credits became a sticking point in federal budget negotiations and led to the government shutdown that ran from Oct. 1 to Nov. 12. By mid-month, however, the U.S. Department of Agriculture had announced it would not be paying for SNAP food benefits come November if the government shutdown continued. Lujan Grisham, in turn, at the end of the month announced the state would allocate $30 million to pay for those benefits come Nov. 1. The governor called lawmakers back to the Roundhouse again Nov. 10 to approve an allocation of up to $162.5 million to cover statewide food assistance through the start of next year in case it’s needed.

Source NM spoke with New Mexico Gov. Lujan Grisham about leading the state during the first year of Donald Trump’s second term as president, and her advice for the next governor—Lujan Grisham’s second term ends in January of 2027—about how to navigate the Trump administration. The following has been edited for clarity and concision.
“I don’t want New Mexicans going into the end of the year, and starting the new year with despair, because it’s an easy place to go, particularly in a state that relies on Medicaid and SNAP and emergency relief funds and [Federal Emergency Management Agency]…I mean all the things, right? I want, particularly this holiday season, for them feel more like they’ve come first for the state of New Mexico, and for everything they throw, we work hard to have your back to the highest degree.
We’ve been very thoughtful about how we save and identify resources so that we’ve got the flexibility to meet these needs, because [Trump] thrives on chaos. He wants people to be apathetic and to give up, and he takes the fight out of you, and he’s not going to take the fight out of this governor. I’m not going to let people suffer without trying every single thing, including joining every lawsuit against the administration.”
Advice for the next governor:
“Don’t wait. Have a strategy. Engage all your local policy makers. Have money set aside all the time. Don’t forget the power of this state’s reserves to have them when you need them.”



Federal government pushes states for voter data

In July, the U.S. Department of Justice  began asking state election officials, including New Mexico, for their voter rolls. New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver told Source at the time her office was “reviewing whether or not we are legally able to prevent sending the private data, which would be Social Security, all dates of birth and driver’s license numbers.”

Ultimately, the New Mexico Secretary of State says it provided the federal government with publicly available data roll information, which excluded Social Security numbers and full dates of birth. On Dec. 2, the US DOJ announced it was suing New Mexico and several other states for not providing the requested data. That case remains pending; at the end of December, Common Cause New Mexico and two residents filed a motion to intervene in the case.



Leger Fernández: ‘Every time America has been in its darkest moments, we have come out of it with renewed purpose’

Source NM spoke with U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, a Democrat who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, on her reflections about 2025; what she thinks will happen in the new year; and why she has participated in the No Kings rallies. The following has been edited for clarity and concision.
“Even as Trump has been causing such pain, has been engaged in such corruption, has been willfully raising costs on New Mexicans and the American public, we’ve fought back, and there have been some good things too. I mean, not because of Trump, but that we’ve been able to accomplish from New Mexico as well.
What we are doing in the [United States House of Representatives] right now is utilizing the discharge petition [a procedural tool to force a floor vote], because in the House, the vast majority of Republicans are in lock step with Trump. They refuse to stand up for the constituents because they’re too busy bowing down to Trump. But there are some moderates who are also in districts that are at risk, who realize that they will lose their job in the midterms if they don’t start responding to their constituent needs. So I think that the political landscape next year is going to make a big difference, and the fact that Trump is seen now as more of a lame duck, that we’re going to start seeing a difference. 
I love the No Kings marches. I think what they do is they show that the American people have a voice and we are willing to take to the streets to raise up our voices. I often talk about how it’s a demonstration of how we belong to each other and with each other in this effort to reclaim our country, but also to bring hope and to recognize that across history, every time America has been in its darkest moments, we have come out of it with renewed purpose, with renewed vision and we have walked into the light of what is possible under The American promise of building a more perfect union.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/betterlceanup-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-26 09:57:31.444356

Here are some of the housing angles that drew our focus at CommonWealth Beacon this year. 
The persistent MBTA Communities fight
This showpiece 2021 housing law requiring multifamily zoning near the MBTA system survived a Supreme Judicial Court challenge, spawned 40 bills on Beacon Hill, and sparked a degree of political soul-searching even among its biggest backers. At a national pro-housing conference in September, advocates who spent years championing the law acknowledged it was “too effing complicated” – its town-by-town approach designed to give municipalities leeway but also creating endless room for resistance. 
Towns like Milton and Duxbury finally fell in line after the state’s high court agreed that Attorney General Andrea Campbell could enforce the law, and a lower court judge waved away challenges claiming lawmakers had created an “unfunded mandate” for cities and towns. But the delayed compliance and ongoing legal vexations kept the statute’s core state versus local control tension in the spotlight. 
Even optimistic projections suggest MBTA Communities might yield just 40,000 units over 10 years – a step to be sure, but nowhere near the 222,000 units Gov. Maura Healey’s administration projects the state will need in the next decade. And even as the final deadline for compliance looms – December 31 for the last group of towns – the fight is headed back to the state’s high court. 
Climate and housing collide
From worsening flooding to wildfires, climate change isn’t coming for Massachusetts housing – it’s already here. 
Experts warn that in 10 to 15 years, large swaths of the country may lack mortgages because insurance markets are failing across entire regions. Meanwhile, FEMA expanded flood maps putting thousands of Bay State homes in new risk zones. 
A federal retreat is complicating the crisis. The Trump administration ended FEMA’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program in April, pulling back $882 billion in climate preparedness funding (which a district judge has since ordered restored), then cut a fifth of the agency’s workforce and scrubbed coastal erosion prediction tools from its website – maps that Nantucket and other communities relied on for risk planning. 
And it is getting hotter, with drought conditions worsening by the end of summer 2025 after a brutal wildfire season the year before. As the state seeks to build more housing, it will need to grapple with climate threats from all sides, carving away at land once considered to be a safe bet for homeowners.  
Mixed federal messages on housing
When the Trump administration abruptly cut $30 million in grants to 78 fair housing organizations nationwide in February – part of the administration’s battle with the specter of “DEI” – Massachusetts ended up in the thick of it. Four national and local nonprofits sued, and a federal judge ordered HUD to reinstate the funding after determining the cuts violated congressional appropriations and administrative law. 
The temporary victory came with a warning: With HUD proposing a 76 percent staffing cut to its fair housing enforcement division, the infrastructure to combat housing discrimination remains under threat.  
While slashing fair housing resources, the administration also offered a seemingly contradictory approach to housing tax credits. The showpiece tax bill enacted over the summer expanded the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, while the president proposed reducing funding for rental assistance programs like Section 8, which help cover housing costs for low-income tenants.  
Add in the hard-to-assess Opportunity Zone program, which is pitched as a way to encourage development in areas that struggle to attract investor dollars, and the Trump approach to encouraging new and affordable housing starts to look like a strategy resting mostly on reducing taxes for developers while leaving social supports and subsidies to help low-income tenants off to the side. 
Lawsuits grapple with murky mortgage products 
Attorney General Andrea Campbell’s consumer protection division spent time in 2025 probing financial products that blur the line between helping homeowners and exploiting them.  
Her first-in-the-nation enforcement action against Boston-based Hometap argues the company’s home equity investments – giving the company a share of the house’s value in exchange for an infusion of cash – are actually illegal reverse mortgages disguised as investments. A Suffolk Superior Court judge let the case proceed in August, setting up a showdown over whether these largely unregulated products need to follow consumer protection rules. 
A politically explosive housing case involved BlueHub Capital, a Roxbury nonprofit whose CEO is a longtime Healey donor. A Superior Court judge ruled in September that BlueHub’s shared appreciation mortgages – which helped distressed homeowners avoid foreclosure but claimed a cut of future home equity – violated multiple consumer protection laws. The ruling came a year after the Legislature passed and Healey signed an economic development bill containing language exempting nonprofit shared appreciation mortgages from those very laws.  
In mid-November, after initially digging in its heels on the program’s integrity, BlueHub announced it was “pausing” these mortgage offerings. 
Rent control’s comeback
Three decades after Massachusetts voters banned rent control by ballot measure, the question may head before a new generation of voters. A coalition of advocates collected enough signatures to put a statewide rent stabilization measure on the 2026 ballot. If it passes, the initiative would cap annual rent increases at 5 percent or at the rate of inflation, whichever is lower, for most buildings across the state. 
The real estate industry is already gearing up for what could be one of the most expensive ballot fights in recent memory, calling it “the most restrictive rent control program in the entire United States.” 
The campaign splits even progressive allies, some of whom worry that proposing a blanket statewide cap on rents, rather than allowing individual communities to opt in, could hurt its chances. Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, who proposed her own rent stabilization policy in 2023, called the ballot measure “quite restrictive” and said she’d have preferred a local-option approach. But tenant advocates, who say Beacon Hill has ignored their calls for action year after year, see rising rents straining household budgets across the state, and they’re betting that voters will support the measure.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_5-Housing.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-26 09:11:40.823845

(Photo by Jacques Julien/Getty Images)COLUMBIA — Public school students can’t use their cellphone during school hours, and the state Department of Education wants nearly $18 million to explain why.
As part of an initiative to get students off their phones, the agency is asking legislators for money to buy curriculum explaining the negative effects of screen time. The education department would partner with ScreenStrong, a North Carolina-based nonprofit that sells books and courses educating children and their parents about how screens can hinder learning and other parts of their lives.
“The evidence is overwhelming: screen overuse is a root driver of the student mental health and absenteeism crises facing schools nationwide,” reads an agency budget request. “Yet while families and teachers see the impact daily, few have access to clear, science­-based guidance for how to help.”
Research has shown that screens can have some benefit for education and learning, but using phones and social media excessively can disrupt children’s development and lead to lower attention spans, worse academic performance and diminished social skills.
If the agency gets the money, it will give all third- through eighth-graders books written for their age groups explaining how their brains work and how too much phone usage can cause problems. The books also offer alternative activities, encouraging children to play and talk to their peers, according to the nonprofit.
SC Board of Education passes statewide cellphone ban for K-12 public schools

After an initial year of providing the books to all students in elementary and middle school, the agency would switch to only students in third and sixth grades, according to the budget request. How schools would teach students this material is not explained in the request.
“Together, we will work with parents, educators, and community partners to reclaim students’ attention, restore genuine connection with peers and families, and strengthen the foundation for academic and behavioral well-being,” the request reads.
Keeping students off their phones has been a priority for the department in recent years, mirroring a similar push across the country.
Under a state policy approved in September 2024, students at all schools must keep their phones and connected devices, such as smartwatches, off and away from the time the first bell rings in the morning until the dismissal bell rings in the afternoon.
Districts had the discretion to create stricter bans, such as telling students not to bring their phones to school at all or requiring them to place their phones in locked pouches. The state provided districts about $2 million from a fund meant for security purposes last year to lock up students’ phones, including with pouches, designated lockers or cubbies.
Any school district that didn’t pass a ban at least as strict as the state-level policy by the beginning of 2025 risked losing state funding, but all schools met the deadline, an agency spokesman said previously.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cellphone-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 09:11:40.823845

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)Research led by a University of Iowa student is opening new doors to potential uterine cancer treatments that could allow patients to regain their health while retaining their ability to have children, the university reported.
Katie Colling, a fourth-year doctoral candidate in the UI cancer biology program, has found promising results from testing different types of drugs aimed at balancing hormones in the uterus — called progestins — on cell cultures created from patient tumor tissue, according to a university news release.
Most uterine cancer cases are caught early, Colling said, and are treated with a surgery that removes the uterus, cervix, fallopian tubes and ovaries. This leaves these patients without the ability to have children. Surgery isn’t always viable, however, for patients with other health factors or those planning to have children, and the current progestins used for uterine cancer treatment are not effective for everyone.

“The problem with these drugs is that they don’t work for every patient. So some patients respond well initially, but for up to 40% of them, their cancer actually comes back, and that’s not a good thing,” Colling said in an interview. “Currently, there are only three progestins used in the clinic, or three hormone therapies, yet over 20 are used for other purposes in women’s health, such as contraception, and we don’t understand which is most effective for treating uterine cancer.”
Uterine cancer is the fourth-most common cancer in women and the fifth-most common cause of cancer death in the U.S., Colling said, and it recently passed ovarian cancer to become the deadliest form of gynecologic cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, the cancer’s five-year survival rate between 2016-2021 was just over 80%, and close to 14,000 people have died of uterine cancer in 2025.
Working in the lab of obstetrics and gynecology researcher and UI professor Kristina Thiel, Colling said she has spent the past two-and-a-half years testing different progestins on cell cultures from tumors called “organoids” to see how they impact tumor growth and cell death within it.
She called the results she’s seen so far “really promising.”
“I have compared a large panel of progestins to those that are currently being used in the clinic, and I have identified five that are performing better than those currently used to treat patients,” Colling said.
Colling’s work had a big hand in earning the UI, as well as the University of New Mexico, University of Utah and University of Kansas, a five-year, $12.8 million grant from the National Cancer Institute, Thiel said.
The University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center is the lead organization on the project, titled “Advancing Hormone Therapy for Endometrial Cancer” and awarded its funding in August, and the UI team will receive around $500,000 annually to continue with its work testing progestins.
“Some of the data that Katie generated were integral to us getting this funding from the National Cancer Institute,” Thiel said.
Next steps in Colling’s work include taking the top progestin candidates she’s identified and testing them in mice, with the data from that phase planned to be combined with data from other institutions and used for clinical trials.
Spreading awareness
Colling’s passion for her work is driven by both academic and personal reasons, she said. The student researcher said she first got interested in cancer-specific research during a summer internship at New York University, and it was during that same summer that she learned her grandmother’s breast cancer had returned after 15 years of remission and metastasized “practically everywhere.”
“From that point on, I kind of saw her navigate the challenges and toxicities associated with cancer treatment and that really inspired me to research safer and more effective therapies for cancer patients,” Colling said.
One question Colling said she’s asked herself is why, with so many progestin options available and being used for other means, they haven’t been tried for uterine cancer treatment. The current progestin treatments have been utilized since the 1970s, and she said women’s health has been traditionally under-researched. This is why she said she’s “really excited” to further this study and advance cancer treatment therapies.
Both Colling and Thiel emphasized that the public should be educated about their research, as well as signs of cancer developing and other information to keep them safe and healthy. Colling recently won the 2025 Three Minute Thesis competition on campus, where she had to explain her research in language the general public would understand in three minutes.
One fact Thiel called “absolutely alarming” is that mortality related to uterine cancer is worse today than in the 1970s.

From the near-daily hand-wringing about the Trump administration’s latest actions to the prospect of voters seizing massive policymaking power in 2026 through a raft of ballot questions, state leaders spent much of the year sighing deeply and staring up at the ceiling.
Sure, there was some action, like banning renter-paid broker fees. But with most lawmaking decisions expected in the second year of the two-year term, and statewide officeholders up for reelection in 2026, this year featured far more sowing than reaping.
Here’s a look at the top five storylines that dominated the politics and policy landscape in 2025.
Trump’s second term upends Beacon Hill
This time a year ago, the Democrats who hold all the reins of state power were bracing for Donald Trump’s return to the White House after four years under President Joe Biden.
Today, those officials would likely say Trump’s second term has been even more damaging than they expected.
For most of the year, it seemed like Gov. Maura Healey, Attorney General Andrea Campbell, and legislative leaders were putting out — from their perspective — one federal fire after another. They careened through responses to major deportation efforts, offshore wind upheaval, disruption to food aid, and a new federal law that will reshape state budgets for years to come.
Reacting to the Trump administration became such a common thread that Senate President Karen Spilka and her deputies began branding some of their work, like an expanded law Healey signed shielding reproductive and transgender care from out-of-state or federal incursions, with the moniker “Response 2025.”
Many Massachusetts officeholders on the left are once again defining themselves in contrast to Trump, while Republicans here are still trying to thread the needle to show support for a president who remains unpopular among most Bay State voters.
Fiscal storm clouds continue to darken
Where would Massachusetts be without the millionaires tax?
The voter-approved surtax on the state’s highest earners — whose revenue must go to either transportation or education investments — has been mostly responsible for any bright lights in the state’s budgetary outlook over the past year, even if it might be due for a slight dip in the near future. All other tax collections (i.e., those that do not have specific constitutional limits on how they can be spent) are sluggish, employment growth has been flat for two-plus years, and state spending continues to rise at a significant clip.
And that’s all before accounting for the impending impacts of the federal reconciliation package, which officials say will trim $946 million in state tax revenue over a two-year period and shrink funding for health care by hundreds of millions of dollars.
State budget math has never been easy, but lately it’s as if the 10th-grade algebra problems have been replaced with college-level differential equations.
Continued cannabis chaos prompts reforms
Shannon O’Brien is back at the top of the Cannabis Control Commission more than two years after Treasurer Deborah Goldberg tried to oust her, but the regulatory agency and the industry it oversees remain in choppy waters.
The five-member panel is still operating shorthanded, a status it claimed for much of the year, and pressure points like the “wild west” of host community agreements continue to create headaches.
Stability could be on the way. After the controversy reached a boiling point, lawmakers advanced major reforms to the CCC’s operations and oversight of the industry itself. House and Senate negotiators still need to buff out some differences between their chambers’ versions of the bill, a compromise that’s more a question of when than if.
The commission is also checking off some items that have long lingered on its to-do list. Social consumption, often described colloquially as “pot cafes,” are on the verge of launching with the CCC’s latest blessing.
There’s another prospective disruption on the horizon, though: the 2026 ballot.
Opponents of recreational marijuana use, which voters legalized in 2016, are pushing a ballot question that would essentially revoke that authorization a decade later. The measure still has several hurdles to clear, as do 10 other proposals that could form a record-breaking field.
Legislature takes a long look in the mirror
It quickly became clear that legislative leaders did not like all the bad press they earned for last year’s chaotic wrap-up.
Speaking to fellow lawmakers to kick off the 2025-2026 term, House Speaker Ron Mariano lamented the “naysayers who couldn’t write enough about how incompetent we were.” A few hours later, Spilka contended that the Legislature’s “accomplishments are consistently overshadowed by a persistent negative media narrative.”
The scrutiny did achieve results, though. In June, after a characteristically long House-Senate negotiation punctuated with occasional disagreements, the Democrats who control both branches rolled out a package of internal rules reforms intended to make legislative operations more efficient and transparent.
Joint committees can now advance bills more quickly without first needing to secure buy-in from both representatives and senators, summaries must be published to make business more comprehensible to constituents, and some deadlines will work differently.
The most impactful changes are most likely backloaded. July 31, 2026, now marks the date by which major legislation needs to be passed by both branches and enter negotiations, not the date by which the House and Senate essentially need to reach compromise on anything significant — meaning the final few months of next year can still play host to substantial cross-branch bargaining and deliberations.
Theoretically, that should alleviate some of the end-of-session backlog that’s become notorious.
Maybe, just maybe, the July 31 lawmaking session will end before the sun rises the next day.
Audit law falls down a well
Sometimes, a landslide electoral victory just isn’t enough.
More than seven in 10 voters agreed to make clear in state law that the auditor has the power to examine the House and Senate, but more than a year after the body politic spoke, little has come of it.
Mariano and Spilka, long critical of Auditor Diana DiZoglio and her relentless approach, continue to insist that allowing her office to probe the Legislature represents a breach of the constitutional separation of powers. DiZoglio wants to litigate their arguments in court, but can’t do so without involvement from Attorney General Andrea Campbell, who says the auditor has not fulfilled all the necessary prerequisites for the next step.
Neither DiZoglio nor Campbell seem happy about the way their feud has stretched for months. Mariano and Spilka, meanwhile, have been mostly able to keep the curtain closed the way they wanted, offering up much smaller-scale external audits as an attempt at transparency.
The debate doesn’t end with the audit. DiZoglio has newly set her sights on another ballot question that would subject the governor’s office and the Legislature to the state’s public records law.
If legislative leaders keep information under lock and key from the auditor, her thinking goes, might as well circumvent their constitutional concerns and make it accessible to the public from the get-go.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Top_5-Beacon-Hill.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-26 08:56:52.023685

(Photo by Getty Images, board seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A Des Moines surgeon accused of negligence and wrongful death has agreed to pay a $2,500 civil penalty for inadequate management of medical records in the case.
According to the Iowa Board of Medicine, Dr. Marc Miller performed an outpatient, robotic-assisted laparoscopic hernia repair on a male patient on May 22, 2020. The patient was discharged later that day. The following day, the patient reported intense pain and swelling and was advised by Miller that the condition was normal and would likely resolve itself in a few days, the board alleges.
According to the board, Miller did not direct the patient to the emergency room or advise him to seek other forms of medical attention, and no entries were created in the patient’s medical record to document the report of pain and swelling.

Ultimately, the patient decided to go the emergency room on the afternoon of May 26, 2020, due to continued pain and swelling. His condition deteriorated as he went into septic shock, emergency surgery was performed and the patient died a few days later.
Earlier this month, more than five years after the patient’s death, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Miller with one count of improper management of medical records in the case.
To settle the case, Miller agreed to accept a warning from the board and pay a $2,500 civil penalty. In addition, he agreed to complete what the board calls a “live, interactive course on medical records documentation.”
Court records indicate the patient in the hernia-repair case was 51-year-old Victor Untrauer of Polk County and that the surgery was performed at the surgical clinic of UnityPoint Health in Des Moines.
According to the Untrauer’s estate, which later sued Miller for wrongful death, Miller perforated Untrauer’s bowel during surgery, failed to discover the error during the course of the operation, and then closed the incision.
The lawsuit alleged Untrauer called Miller the next day to report severe pain and swelling. “Miller returned Victor’s call in the early afternoon of May 23, 2020,” the lawsuit alleged. “Miller was on call and in a hurry. Miller said Victor’s intense pain was ‘normal’ and would take quite a few days to go away.”
Untrauer “remained in intense pain for the next several days,” the lawsuit alleged, and told others he was in “agony” and, “I’m hurting so bad I can’t even try to lay down in the bed.” On May 26, 2020, the lawsuit alleged, Untrauer spoke to one of Miller’s agents, who reiterated Miller’s assurance that the pain was normal and did not require medical intervention.
Several hours later, Untrauer “decided on his own to go to the emergency room” where he went into septic shock and emergency surgery was performed. “During surgery, he went into cardiac arrest and had to be given CPR for 20 minutes and shocked five times,” the lawsuit alleged. “He suffered overwhelming multisystem organ failure … and died on May 29, 2020.”
Miller and UnityPoint Health denied any wrongdoing. In May 2023, the Untrauer family’s lawsuit was settled out of court. The terms of the settlement were not made public.

,California,2025-12-26 13:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,New California laws rewrite car-buying rules with return policy and pricing reforms,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/12/california-new-law-buying-cars/,California lawmakers let automakers opt out of recent changes to the state’s lemon law and approved a law giving used car buyers three days to return a used vehicle.,"In summary
California lawmakers let automakers opt out of recent changes to the state’s lemon law and approved a law giving used car buyers three days to return a used vehicle. 


California lawmakers made major changes to the state’s car-buying rules this year, including a  controversial rewrite of the state law that allows buyers to get their money back if they are sold a defective vehicle and a right to return a used vehicle within three days.
After an intense lobbying push this year from automobile companies, dealers and consumer groups, more legislative battles over California vehicle purchases could follow in 2026. Sky-high car prices show no signs of falling, and a Republican-led Congress and the Trump administration have sought to thwart Newsom’s goal of having 100% of new cars sold in California be zero-emission by 2035. 
Sen. Ben Allen, a Democrat representing the El Segundo area, said he expects California’s Democratic-controlled Legislature will likely push back against national Republicans’ attack on California’s vehicle policies in some form next year, though he said it wasn’t yet clear how.
“We’re very committed to this path, so stay tuned, but clean air is a priority for our state,” said Allen, who chairs the Senate’s Select Committee on Transitioning to a Zero-Emission Energy Future. 
In the meantime, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Allen’s Senate Bill 766, creating a first-in-the-nation policy that allows a buyer to return a used vehicle for a full refund within three days if the purchase price was less than $50,000. Dealers can charge a restocking fee. 
The law, which takes effect in October, also contains other protections for buyers intended to prevent them from getting suckered.

 Democrat, State Senate, District 24 (El Segundo)



Car dealers will have to tell a potential buyer — including in advertisements and initial written communications — the actual price of a vehicle instead of an unrealistic advertised price. Potential buyers will also have to be informed of the full financing costs and lease terms. 
The law also prohibits dealers from charging for add-ons that have no benefit to the buyer, such as free oil changes for electric vehicles — which don’t need oil changes.“That is a huge deal,” said Rosemary Shahan of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, which championed the bill. “It’s historic. It’s going to make cars more affordable.”
Allen said he came up with the idea for the bill after shopping for a used car in 2024. He said he wanted to see what it was like trying to buy a used car in California and didn’t tell the various dealerships he visited that he was a state senator.“I was kind of shocked by the hustle and the extent to which prices were quoted online and that ended up not really being truthful,” he said.He ended up buying a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E, an electric vehicle.
Newsom blocked document fee increase
Most bills take effect immediately the year after they are signed, but lawmakers delayed the implementation of Allen’s bill until October to give dealers time to change their paperwork, amend their contracts and change their signs to meet the new law’s requirements.
Brian Maas, president of the California New Car Dealers Association, said the law should make buying a used car more transparent and easier for consumers.
“The bill certainly is a net positive in terms of more transparency about the total price and advertising,” he said. 
But he said the new law “clearly imposed more responsibility on dealers,” which is why Maas said his group was extremely frustrated Newsom vetoed its bill that would have allowed dealers to raise document-processing fees by $175.  
Senate Bill 791 would have raised the fees dealers can charge to process Department of Motor Vehicles and other paperwork from the current cap of $85 to up to 1% of the purchase price, capped at $260.
Maas said dealers were frustrated by Newsom’s veto message which said the fee increase wasn’t necessary because the state had imposed “no new state requirements” on car dealers. 
Maas said it was “especially frustrating that the veto message somewhat cavalierly said there are no new state requirements when the governor signed just such requirements a week earlier.”
Before the veto, SB 791 passed the Legislature overwhelmingly and with bipartisan support. The California New Car Dealers Association has donated at least $3 million to legislators since 2015, according to the Digital Democracy database. 
Maas said there are so many forms car buyers must fill out, almost all of them stemming from a law the Legislature passed, they’re getting to be like click-through agreements on websites that everyone just agrees to without actually reading.
“You shove form after form after form in front of consumers,” he said. “Consumers just tune it out, turn it off, and say, ‘You know what? I just want to know what my monthly payment is, what’s the interest rate, what the total price of the car is. And then let’s go. Why do I have to sit in here for a half hour or an hour and fill out all these forms?’ ”
Consumers face a watered-down lemon law
Newsom also signed Senate Bill 26, a bill that allows car manufacturers to opt out of changes to the state’s lemon law that gives consumers a right to get their money back if they buy a defective vehicle — sometimes referred to as a “lemon.” 
The result is that California car buyers have different legal protections under the state’s lemon law depending on which brand they buy.
The bill Newsom signed was in response to a law lawmakers hastily passed at the end of the 2024 legislative session, watering down the state’s 55-year-old landmark lemon law. Some 
auto companies, namely GM and Ford, were being sued so often for allegedly selling so many lemons that state courts were clogged with lawsuits. 
The companies and some attorney groups persuaded lawmakers and Newsom to pass legislation in 2024 that shrank the length of time a car buyer could sue under the lemon law to just six years instead of the entire life of a vehicle’s warranty
Last year’s legislation also puts more onus on car owners to initiate claims, not auto companies.
But other companies that don’t get sued as often for selling defective vehicles, such as Toyota and Honda, opposed the rule change. Those companies said the new law didn’t give them time to prepare their best defense
Newsom ended up reluctantly signing the 2024 bill, but he urged the Legislature to come back with a new bill in 2025 that would allow companies to opt out of the changes. SB 26 passed overwhelmingly and Newsom signed it.
Meanwhile, several car companies, including Ford and GM and dozens of RV and motorcycle manufacturers, opted in to the 2024 law this year.

Starting Jan. 1, a new law will take effect requiring most tortillas and corn masa products sold in the state to contain folic acid, a vitamin that’s important to infant health.
Latinas in California are far less likely than other women to get enough folic acid early in pregnancy — a gap that can lead to life-altering birth defects. 
State data show that, between 2017 and 2019 – the latest years for which state data is available – about 28% of Latinas reported taking folic acid the month before becoming pregnant. White women took the vitamin at a higher rate, with 46% of them reporting consuming folic acid,  according to the California Department of Public Health. 
This puts Latinas at higher risk of having a baby born with neural tube defects — defects of the brain and spinal cord. Some examples of that are conditions like spina bifida and anencephaly.
Research has shown that folic acid can reduce birth defects by up to 70%. That’s why it’s found in prenatal vitamins. But because women may not find out they are pregnant until weeks or months after, public health has long recommended that folic acid also be added to staple foods. 
In 1998, the U.S. required manufacturers to fortify certain grain products with folic acid, such as pasta, rice, and cereals, to help women of reproductive age get the necessary amounts. Since that rule took effect, the rate of babies born with neural tube defects dropped by about a third, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
But even with the addition to these foods, birth defect rates among babies born to Latinas have been consistently higher. In search of a more culturally appropriate addition, in 2016, the federal government allowed makers of corn masa to add folic acid to their foods – but didn’t require it.
Joaquin Arambula, a Democrat from Fresno, who authored the law said leaving folic acid out of corn masa products, used in many Latino staple foods, was a “real oversight.” 
Now, with the implementation of Assembly Bill 1830, California is the first state to require folic acid in corn masa products. The law requires manufacturers that do business in the state to add 0.7 milligrams of folic acid to every pound of flour and to list the addition in their nutrition labels. The law makes exemptions for small batch producers like restaurants and markets that might make their own tortillas from scratch.
Months after California’s law was signed, Alabama passed its own version. Its law goes into effect in June 2026. 
Some large manufacturers have already been adding folic acid to their products for years. Gruma, the parent company of Mission Foods, said it started fortifying its foods back in 2016, when the federal government first allowed it. A company spokesperson said Gruma “has a longstanding commitment to supporting legislative fortification initiatives” and supports the new laws in California and Alabama.

As federal funding reductions and policy changes rippled through the health care system, California confronted service cuts, coverage losses and growing uncertainty.
During the summer, a congressionally-approved spending plan slashed nearly a trillion dollars from the Medicaid program over the next decade. Funding cuts and new rules – such as work requirements – are expected to push 3.4 million Californians off their Medicaid coverage as changes take effect.
In Washington, a dispute over whether to renew enhanced premium subsidies that help keep Affordable Care Act marketplace insurance plans affordable prompted the longest shutdown in history. Absent federal action, hundreds of thousands of people could be priced out of Covered California insurance in 2026. More than 2,300 Dreamers in California have already lost access to the state marketplace: The Trump administration overturned a rule that had allowed undocumented people brought to the country as children to buy subsidized health insurance. 
Federal immigration raids prompted undocumented people to skip care, and families reported worsening mental health, and federal anti-trans policies pushed providers to scale back on gender-affirming care.
Shifting federal policy forced the state the state to inject millions into Planned Parenthood to try to keep clinics afloat. Anticipating more restrictive federal immunization rules under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, California advanced its own vaccine guidelines.
Federal changes weren’t the only reversal. State budget constraints and overspending in the Medi-Cal program led California to freeze new enrollment for undocumented people and cut some costly benefits, such as weight loss drugs. 
On affordability, Gov. Newsom delivered on his promise to cut down the cost of insulin. In 2026, diabetics will be able to purchase long-acting insulin pens at pharmacies for $11 a pen. After CalMatters shed a light on disappearing birth centers, state lawmakers approved a new law improving access in underserved areas, streamlining licensure requirements so that birth centers can more easily contract with Medicaid.
2026 outlook
The Legislative Analyst’s Office projects that Medi-Cal spending will continue to grow. Paired with the uncertainty of federal funding cuts, lawmakers may again seek ways to control costs and weigh priorities. 
As federal spending cuts phase in, they’ll have implications for hospitals and other providers, such as an uptick in uncompensated care.

Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2025 announced the closure of another prison, a shutdown that’s possible because the state is incarcerating far fewer people than it did just a decade ago.


A year after Californians voted for a conservative shift in criminal justice policy, they began to see the results. 
Proposition 36, approved by voters last year, gave prosecutors the ability to charge people convicted of various third-time drug offenses with a so-called treatment-mandated felony – a choice between behavioral health treatment or up to three years in jail or prison. 
In the law’s first six months, 9,000 people were charged with a treatment-mandated felony and nearly 15% — or 1,290 people — elected treatment. Of the 771 people placed into treatment, 25 had completed it by the end of June. 
Conditions for incarcerated people were once again the subject of litigation and controversy. The state of California sued the Los Angeles County jail system, citing “inhumane conditions” and a “shocking rate of deaths.”
With temperatures inside some prisons reaching 95 degrees each summer, advocates for the incarcerated demanded air conditioning. The state responded by launching a $38 million pilot test of cooling systems and new insulation over the next four years at three of the department’s 31 prisons. Results of the test are not expected until mid-2029.
The prison population itself is dropping, in part because of changes to sentencing laws over the last decade. About 90,000 people are incarcerated in California prisons, down from a peak of about 170,000.
That falling prison population has given Newsom reason to shutter another prison, the fifth of his term. The prison, a former art deco hotel in Riverside County, is slated to close in 2026. The state expects to save about $150 million by closing the prison. 
Prison spending also caught renewed attention from lawmakers, one year after the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation ran out of money. The department is on track to exceed its budget by roughly $850 million over three years despite recent cuts.  
The union representing 25,000 prison guards — among the wealthiest public worker unions in the state – struck a deal for a new contract that gives California some financial relief in the short term but includes a mix of bonuses and raises that would kick in over time. 
2026 outlook: 
Fewer people in prison also gave new life to an effort to put prisoners in single-occupancy cells, a bill that didn’t make it to Gov. Gavin Newsom this year, but is expected to return in 2026.
A Los Angeles County ban on law enforcement agents wearing masks, which is set to take effect in January and explicitly mentions U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, could prove to be another flashpoint in the ongoing war of words and lawsuits between Newsom and the Trump administration.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060625_ICE-Raid-DTLA_JWBH_CM_54.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-26 08:56:52.023685

“It’s just an opportunity to make sure the narrative is correctly identifying the land that Israel controls,” Gidley said.

According to the United Nations, Palestine was put under administration from the United Kingdom in 1922 by the League of Nations and served as a “national home for the Jewish people.” In 1947, the UN took over decisions about Palestine, which proposed an Arab state and Jewish state. Jordan controlled the part of the region known as the West Bank today. In 1967, Israel took over the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the Six-Day War. 
Conservative lawmakers in  Florida, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri have filed identical legislation, though Gidley said he was not inspired by other states or by U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who introduced a federal bill in February. He said that the bill would be a way for Alabama to strengthen its support for Israel.
“Alabama is a very strong supporter of Israel, has been since 1943, will be forever,” Gidley said. “I think this just shows the strength of our support.”
He said he has “no idea” if any Alabama government documents refer to the territory as the West Bank. According to the bill, official government material includes “any guidance, rule, material, briefing, press release, communication or work product document.”
Rep. Phillip Ensler, D-Montgomery, the only member of the Alabama Legislature who is Jewish, said in an interview that while he is very proud of is Jewish identity, prohibiting the use of “West Bank” is not the way to reach peace. 
“I don’t think that that’s what most Alabamians are concerned about, what that term is in government documents,” Ensler said. “So in the scheme of a finite legislative session, where we only have so many days to get bills through, I would much rather we focus on the day to day issues impacting people.”
He said that Cotton’s federal proposal is one thing, but it is unnecessary to weigh into the complicated conflict as a state. 
“I do very much appreciate Rep. Gidley’s support for Israel. He’s been very understanding, particularly since October 7, the terrorist attack … I don’t think that it’s something we should be focusing on,” Ensler said.

(Photo via Google Earth)The medical director of a central Iowa health spa has been fined $10,000 for failing to adequately supervise work at the spa.
Earlier this month, the Iowa Board of Medicine charged Dr. Daniel Kollmorgen with violating state standards of practice for medical directors. According to the board, Kollmorgen has served as the medical director of 4Ever Young, a medical spa in Waukee, since July 2024. At the same time, he has allegedly worked two to three days per week in Oskaloosa, 80 miles from the Waukee business.
As medical director at 4Ever Young, Kollmorgen was required by law to review the work of nurse practitioners, which included patient histories, physicals and lab work, the board alleges. When board investigators visited the spa in June 2025, they allegedly observed that Kollmorgen was largely working remotely and was onsite at the spa roughly two to three hours per month.
The board alleges Kollmorgen violated state standards that called for him to be physically located, at all times, within 60 miles of the spa, and which also required him to provide at least four hours per week of in-person staff supervision. “Nor did he provide onsite review of medical aesthetic services,” the board alleged.
To settle the case, Kollmorgen agreed to accept a warning from the board and pay a $10,000 civil penalty.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4everyoung2.jpg,,,2025-12-26 08:11:53.107045

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)On June 12 this year, editor Patrick Coolican and I sat down with Melissa Hortman to talk about the end of the legislative session. She walked in late carrying her lunch (Panera Bread), and I remember complimenting her fancy ice maker.
On June 14 — a Saturday — I woke up to multiple missed calls from Patrick. This was unusual, because we’re lucky at the Reformer to rarely work weekends. He called to tell me that he heard Hortman had been shot and she may have died.
My colleagues were all out of town that weekend, so it was up to me to go to the press conference. I cried on the way there. I didn’t know Hortman well. I would only speak to her at press events, but it was surreal that someone I had known was killed. So, unfortunately, that day is top of mind for me when I reflect on 2025.
Despite the tragedies at the front of my mind, it was a good year, even if I’m hoping next year will be far different.
The 2024 election resulted in an evenly split 67-67 state House tie between Republicans and Democrats. A judge ruled that one of the House Democrats didn’t meet the state’s residency requirements, meaning that Democrats were down one member. Republicans had a temporary majority, and they intended to use it. This was the catalyst to a historic 2025 legislative session.
Here are some of the memorable Reformer stories I wrote in 2025.
The 2025 legislative session 
To kick off the legislative session earlier this year, House Democrats didn’t show.
The legislators battled over their interpretations of the Minnesota Constitution, which saw the Democrats’ seats empty while Republicans swore in their own speaker. Republicans held floor sessions and voted on bills without Democrats.
House Democrats sued their GOP colleagues and asked the Minnesota Supreme Court to weigh in and find that Republicans weren’t able to elect a speaker or conduct business without them. The state Supreme Court ruled in their favor.
During this time, House Republicans also threatened to unseat a Democratic lawmaker who won a contested race, which caused negotiations between Republicans and Democrats to drag on. But the parties eventually came to an agreement: Seat the Democratic member and Republicans would gain control of the speakership. The DFL boycott lasted for three weeks.
Once the session started in earnest, I wrote about a Minnesota House member making an appearance on the reality show “Love Is Blind.” Her daughter was on the show and decided not to get married (i.e. love wasn’t blind for her.)
The session was well underway when another bombshell dropped in March: GOP state Sen. Justin Eichorn was arrested on suspicion of soliciting sex with a 17-year-old girl. He resigned from the Senate shortly after he was charged.
A slew of intriguing GOP candidates hopped into the race to fill Eichorn’s seat, including the wife of a House member, the son of a former state senator and former Minnesota Republican Party chair Jennifer Carnahan.
Toward the end of the session, legislative leaders spent weeks negotiating a budget behind closed doors. Lawmakers were unable to pass a budget during the regular session, and they needed a one-day special session to pass 14 bills.
Four days after the special session, Hortman was killed in a politically motivated assassination.
Patrick and I wrote a story about Hortman’s legacy. She was a shrewd politician who merely tolerated the spotlight, happily shared credit and accepted blame, eschewed higher office, and by all accounts was motivated chiefly by an interest in public policy, its details and how it could help as many Minnesotans as possible.
Thousands of Minnesotans lined up at the Minnesota Capitol to pay their respects to Melissa and Mark Hortman and their dog Gilbert. Hortman was the first woman to lie in state.
The Hortmans were remembered at their funeral in The Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis.
In July, I traveled to Detroit Lakes to cover the felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell. Mitchell took the stand and told jurors why she broke into her stepmother’s home in 2024.
The jury deliberated for three hours before finding her guilty. Shortly after her conviction, Mitchell resigned from the Minnesota Senate.
More tragedy struck in August — two children were shot and killed at the Annunciation Church in South Minneapolis.
The mass shooting spurred Walz to call for lawmakers to pass an assault weapons ban. Democrats didn’t pass an assault weapons ban when they had a trifecta in 2023 because some Democrats wouldn’t sign onto it.
People close to Walz said the governor was thrown off by the killing of Hortman, who was a friend and governing partner. But the Annunciation shooting appeared to light a fire in Walz to want to provide leadership during crisis, and he announced he would run for an unprecedented third, four-year term as governor.
I wrote about Sen. Omar Fateh’s run for Minneapolis mayor and how he was known for doing whatever it takes to win his priorities.
Last month, I fact-checked Walz when he said Minnesota has universal pre-K. Yeah, we don’t.
I pointed out that the DFL Party was standing by a northern Minnesota party official who has been charged with vehicular homicide. A few days after my story ran, the official resigned.
I was also at Mike Lindell’s Shakopee MyPillow warehouse where he announced he’s running for governor. He even has a bus.
Next year will be all about the governor’s race, which I’m excited to cover. Send me your thoughts or your tips at michelle@minnesotareformer.com",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250609_0089-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 08:11:53.107045

The state is holding onto $7 billion in unclaimed funds and property, waiting on their rightful owners to take it all back.
Most is cash, but people have left everything from jewelry to guns to a violin stashed in safe-deposit boxes around the Garden State, said Steve Harris, who has headed the treasury’s unclaimed property administration since 2008. Banks auction the boxes’ contents after five years and forward the proceeds — which amount to about $900,000 a year — to the administration for safekeeping, Harris said.
“People die, or they move and forget about it. Or someone doesn’t tell their wife that they have a box, and the bank opens it up and it’s loaded with cash,” he said.

The agency has returned $3.1 billion in cash and liquidated items since it formed in 1947, including $720 million in the last three years alone, Harris said.
Many of the items in abandoned safe-deposit boxes are gold and silver coins, jewelry, and cash, which could be a fortune, with gold worth over $4,000 an ounce, he said.
Officials also have found half-smoked cigarettes in the boxes, as if their owners dashed off, mid-puff, in the middle of admiring their riches. Sentimental items including Purple Hearts and other military medals sometimes get left behind too, he said.
“We try to find a family, in those cases, to get those medals back to them,” Harris said. “We will not sell those medals.”
The items are secured in a safe space, but Harris declined to say where.
“It’s not like Raiders of the Lost Ark. It’s more like maybe six or seven rows of items,” he said. “We have cameras and everything else, and nobody knows where it is — really only about six people.”

This story was originally reported by Amanda Becker, Orion Rummler and Mariel Padilla of The 19th. Meet Amanda, Orion and Mariel and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
In the months leading up to his election, President Donald Trump insisted that he had nothing to do with the far-right vision for his second administration known as Project 2025, a Christian-nationalist blueprint to remake the federal government. As the year draws to a close, a crowd-sourced effort, as well as trackers from advocacy organizations and labor unions, show that his administration has implemented roughly half of the goals laid out in the document’s 920 pages.
Project 2025 is rooted in injecting narrower interpretations of gender, sexuality and race in federal policy. It calls for ending nearly all of the U.S. government’s efforts to achieve equity, including the collection of data that could be used to track such outcomes across the public and private sectors.
It suggested eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. It also recommended removing out of every rule and regulation terms like sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender equity and gender awareness, along with abortion, reproductive health and reproductive rights.
The blueprint also suggested transforming the FBI into a politically motivated entity, abolishing the Department of Education and dismantling the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA).
The White House has made progress on all these fronts — through a series of executive orders and also politically motivated hirings, firings and restructurings that have fundamentally expanded the president’s influence and power across all branches of government.
There is a saying in Washington, D.C., that personnel is policy: the people put in charge of implementing key policies shape their ideologies. Russell Vought, one of Project 2025’s key architects, heads Trump’s Office of Management and Budget, which he has likened to the “nerve center” through which a president can exert their influence across the federal government. Peter Navarro, who wrote Project 2025’s section on trade, is a top trade adviser to Trump. Brendan Carr, who wrote a section suggesting reforms to the Federal Communications Commission, is now in charge of the agency.
Here are some specifics on parts of Project 2025 that have been implemented and how they could impact women and LGBTQ+ Americans:
 Reproductive rights

Trump maintained throughout the 2024 campaign that if elected, his administration would leave the issue of abortion access to the states. But as of November 2025, his administration had implemented about 40 percent of the Project 2025 policies aimed at restricting reproductive freedoms, according to Reproductive Freedom for All, an abortion-rights group.
Project 2025 is grounded in the fundamental premise that abortion is not health care and should not be treated as such by federal agencies. Anti-abortion sentiment is woven throughout guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services and sub-agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), its public health arm. One example is a September 2025 document outlining CDC priorities stating that the agency “will promote the dignity of human life at all stages of development, improve maternal health care, and strengthen the family.”
The document also guides the health department to collect data on people who have abortions, using “every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders.” The CDC confirmed in late November that it would not release an annual state-level report it has produced on U.S. abortions since 1969 — and that would have captured the first full year of data since Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health, the Supreme Court case that overturned the federal right to abortion. In a statement to the anti-abortion organization Live Action, a spokesperson for the department attributed the delay to a former chief medical officer “direct[ing] staff to return state-submitted abortion data rather than analyze it.” The Center for Reproductive Rights, an advocacy group that favors abortion access, has pointed out that staffing cuts at the CDC included most of those in its Division for Reproductive Health, leaving the agency short-staffed to compile the data for the report, which is now due out in the first quarter of 2026.
Both the anti-abortion and abortion-rights movements want the report, though for different reasons: the former so it can strategize about how to further reduce the incidence of abortion; the latter so it can assess the impact of the Dobbs decision on abortion access and health care outcomes.
Additional Project 2025 reproductive health priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in June rescinded Biden administration guidance that hospitals receiving Medicare and Medicaid dollars, which is nearly all of them, provide abortion care in emergency situations under EMTALA, a decades-old emergency medicine law.
Revoked a Biden administration-era order establishing an interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access designed to ease access to contraception and abortion.
Project 2025 wanted to prohibit Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds, even for non-abortion services. This was accomplished when the GOP-led Congress approved Trump’s tax law in July and a federal appeals court in September said the legislation could take effect. Planned Parenthood has said it could result in the closure of as many as 200 clinics — or about one-third of all its health centers — and that 1.1 million could lose access to health care as a result.

The Trump administration did not make much headway on restricting access to the medication abortion drug mifepristone. Medication abortions now account for more than half of all U.S. abortions.
Project 2025 authors want the Food and Drug Administration to reverse its 2000 approval of mifepristone. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced in September that he was reviewing Biden administration changes that expanded access via telehealth as well as the drug’s overall efficacy and safety. A less likely near-term possibility is the Department of Justice enforcing the long-dormant 1873 Comstock Act, which prohibits the mailing of obscene materials and articles intended for “producing abortion,” including medication like mifepristone.

 LGBTQ+ rights

Project 2025 called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop collecting data on gender identity and for the National Institutes of Health to fund studies into the negative side effects of gender-affirming care for transgender people. So far, these suggestions have largely played out.
At the beginning of the year, federal health agencies, including the CDC, purged website data referencing LGBTQ+ people. This was in response to a White House executive order that demanded agencies erase all traces of “gender ideology” from public statements, as well as policies and internal communications. Although a federal judge’s order has forced agencies to reinstate these webpages, the Trump administration has made it clear that it rejects data collection that includes LGBTQ+ people.
Project 2025 also proposed cutting federal funds for gender-affirming care for both adults and children, mirroring Trump’s own campaign promises. These cuts have taken shape in various ways: through a planned loss of benefits for federal workers, executive pressure placed on hospitals and policy changes that put trans people at risk of losing their insurance coverage or seeing higher out-of-pocket costs next year. A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to keep funding hospitals that provide gender-affirming care for trans youth. Still, clinics across the country are closing.
In a broader suggestion, Project 2025 advised the Trump administration to reverse Biden-era policies that expanded federal nondiscrimination protections. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order to do just that. The White House has also urged federal agencies to rescind Biden-era policies that support LGBTQ+ rights. Many of these rested on the Biden administration’s interpretation of the Supreme Court case Bostock v. Clayton County, which found LGBTQ+ workers to be protected from workplace discrimination. In particular, the Trump White House has chosen to drop transgender and gay students from the government’s interpretation of  Title IX, the civil rights law preventing schools from discriminating against women and girls. This move changes how the federal government investigates Title IX abuses.
In one of its more extreme statements, Project 2025 equates the act of being trans, or “transgender ideology,” to pornography and declares that it should be outlawed. The White House has not made this specific declaration, but it has taken steps to exclude trans Americans from public life — all while referring to trans identity as “gender ideology.”
Additional Project 2025 anti-LGBTQ+ priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

In January, the president signed an executive order signaling his administration’s opposition to gender diversity and trans identity as a whole.
By this spring, the National Institutes of Health had canceled over $800 million in research grants to understand LGBTQ+ health, including studies about cancer and HIV prevention. Most of those cuts were upheld by the Supreme Court.
The White House has ordered NIH to study the regret rates of trans people who receive gender-affirming care, which the Trump administration inaccurately describes as “surgical mutilation.”
The Trump administration has restricted trans Americans’ access to passports that reflect their gender and eliminated the choice to use an X marker instead of male or female.
The Pentagon has swiftly reversed transgender protections and access to health care.

The White House has also signalled support for Project 2025’s sweeping plan to promote and enforce heterosexuality in families, although it has been slower to take direct action.
The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025, called for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to adopt the official stance that families are made up of a married father, mother and children and to redirect federal funds to support a “biblically based” definition of family. Protecting adoption and foster care services that refuse to work with LGBTQ+ married couples was a key part of this vision in Project 2025.
A recent executive order charges the HHS with addressing local policies that prohibit religious groups — or people with certain religious beliefs — from participating in child-welfare programs.
That is expected to affect more than half the nation — 29 states and Washington, D.C., prohibit discrimination against potential foster parents based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to the Movement Advancement Project, which tracks LGBTQ+ policy. In contrast, 14 states allow child welfare agencies to refuse services to LGBTQ+ families if doing so conflicts with their religious beliefs.
 Education

Both Project 2025’s authors and President Trump have long expressed a desire to eliminate the Department of Education. While they do not have the authority to do that, they have taken active steps to weaken the agency, giving more decision-making control to states and school districts.
Project 2025 education priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

The president can’t lawfully eliminate a federal agency with an executive order, but he can undermine its functions and redistribute duties. In November, the administration announced that the Education Department’s core functions related to K-12 education, higher education, Indian education and international studies would be transferred to the departments of Labor, Interior, Health and Human Services, and State. Critics of the move — including education leaders, elected officials and families with vulnerable children — argue that it will hurt children with disabilities, those from low-income households and student loan borrowers, most of whom are women.
Trump signed an executive order in January directing the federal government to begin a campaign to monitor and influence K-12 curriculum. Among other objectives of the order, the secretary of education was instructed to eliminate federal funding for schools promoting “indoctrination” based on “gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology.” The order also called for an enforcement plan to make sure schools allow parents full access to their children’s educational records — an issue the administration connects with accessing information on children’s gender ideology.
Project 2025 encouraged Congress to consider school choice legislation. The Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, included a national school voucher plan that set up scholarships for families to attend private schools around the country.

 Military

Under Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, the military has moved quickly to align itself with Project 2025’s objectives, with an emphasis on reducing health care access for women and LGBTQ+ service members and an effort to overturn policies tied to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). These changes have the potential to influence civilian policies down the line, in part because military policies reflect the values and strategic priorities of an administration and signal what might be coming to other federal departments.
Project 2025 military priorities accomplished by the Trump administration:

Project 2025 called to end any public funding of gender-affirming health care for transgender service members. In May, the Pentagon announced it was halting new hormone treatments and surgical procedures.
Project 2025 also said policies allowing transgender people to serve in the military should be reversed. In January, Trump issued an executive order that listed gender dysphoria — identifying with a gender that’s different from the sex assigned at birth — as one of the medical conditions disqualifying people from military service. According to the Defense Health Agency, nearly 2,000 military personnel had that diagnosis as of 2021.
Project 2025 suggested prohibiting the federal government from paying the travel expenses of service members and eligible dependents who cross state borders to obtain abortions — a 2023 policy that was put in place after Roe v. Wade was repealed.  In January, the Pentagon rescinded the Biden-era policy that granted service members three weeks of administrative leave and travel stipends for abortion services.
Project 2025 called for the Pentagon to abolish all DEI offices in the Defense Department; in January, Trump signed an executive order ending all of the military’s diversity programs. Within the first 100 days of Trump’s second term, high-ranking people of color and women were fired, military academies were ordered to eliminate race-conscious admissions, the military announced it would no longer recognize commemoration months and thousands of images promoting diversity and minority milestones were flagged for removal. A new department task force was also created to promote “merit-based, color-blind policies” to ban race and sex considerations from military promotions.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image_123650291-1-1024x569.jpg,,,2025-12-26 08:11:53.107045

Conversations are free and confidential. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada Current)Nevada’s 988 call centers are helping tens of thousands of people each year, and state administrators are already eyeing ways to improve the system in the upcoming years.
Shannon Bennett, a bureau chief within the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health, told lawmakers that since the nation switched to 988 from a 10-digit suicide crisis hotline, there has been an “almost 100% increase” in utilization.
 
The 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by calling or texting 988 or visiting 988Lifeline.org. Conversations are free and confidential.


Nearly 42,000 people in Nevada were served by 988 in 2024, according to a state memo. In 2025, Nevada’s 988 call centers had already exceeded that number by the end of November.
“We have seen tremendous growth,” added Bennett, “and we have a lot more to bring to the table as we move forward into 2026.”
Nevada has made significant progress in raising its in-state answer rate and reducing the amount it takes callers to reach a person. In 2023, Nevada’s hotline had among the lowest answer rates in the country.
That’s no longer the case.
According to 988 data reports, in November 2025, 4,070 calls were routed to Nevada call centers and 3,525 were answered, resulting in an 87% answer rate. (Calls not answered in state are routed to national call centers.) It took 31.9 seconds on average for the calls to be answered, and conversations lasted an average of 20 minutes.
The state’s monthly average answer rate has ranged from 73% to 89% in 2025.
Nevada supports its 988 call centers through a 35-cent monthly surcharge on phone lines billed in the state. That fee is set in statute and was approved by state lawmakers in 2023.
Assemblymember Joe Dalia, a Democrat from Las Vegas, asked whether the revenue from that fee is sufficient to cover the hotline’s operating expenses.
Bennett responded that the state’s current 988 contract costs $1 to $2 million a year more than what the 35-cent fee brings in annually. However, the hotline has funding and reserves to cover the current contract, which runs through 2028.
“Once we get to the end of the contract, or as we start to renegotiate whatever’s going to be next, we’re going to have to keep that in mind,” she said.
The state may be able to take advantage of Medicaid funding matches.
The state will also have to consider whether it wants to improve the hotline’s functionality and add things that it declined to add during the initial setup. That includes fully integrating the 988 system with 911 and 211, the state’s referral services focused on social services.
“We want that interoperability with 911, so I think as we move forward we may have to prioritize what is most important to us,” said Bennett.
Behavioral health calls inundate 911 and the long-term goal is for such calls to be seamlessly dispatched to 988. Technology to connect those systems exists, though the State of Nevada has so far not opted to pay for it, said Bennett.
Mental health advocates have long argued that law enforcement officers are not always the proper people to be responding to behavioral health crises in the community.
“We are doing a lot of work, and we have a lot more work to do, to really fully integrate the mobile crisis teams,” said Bennett. “So, if it is law enforcement responding, perhaps they have a clinician and a peer with them, so then those individuals in the community that may be in crisis are being de-escalated right there and getting the resources they need.”
The Division of Public and Behavioral Health’s 988 update came last week during a meeting of the Interim Finance Committee.

Bob Ferguson to investigate.
Kelly Susewind, the agency director, questioned whether conduct by members of the state Fish and Wildlife Commission complied with state laws after poring through a trove of their emails and texts obtained and shared publicly by an advocacy group for hunters and anglers.
The Sportsmen’s Alliance had argued that commissioners violated state requirements for open meetings and records disclosure, and that they disregarded mandates to maximize hunting and fishing. The group was pressing Ferguson to remove four commissioners. 
Against this backdrop, Susewind made his extraordinary request for an inquiry into the commission, which oversees his department and has the power to remove a director should it choose.
“I know this is a big ask,” he wrote the governor Aug. 5. Susewind said an investigation could clear up a cloud of uncertainty shrouding the nine-person commission. If wrongdoing occurred, he said, the governor could remove members because each is appointed by the executive. 
A few days later, it became public that Ferguson had ordered an investigation. “The governor takes concerns from an agency director very seriously,” Ferguson’s communications director, Brionna Aho, told the Standard.
Four months later, the investigation continues. It may be February before it is done.
And, it turns out, Ferguson set it in motion earlier than previously acknowledged.
On June 20, according to documents the Standard obtained through a public records request, the Office of Financial Management signed a $40,000 contract with Chiedza Nziramasanga of Transformative Workplace Investigations. 
The firm was hired to “provide a comprehensive investigation of a reported experience in a work unit to allow leadership to determine if any discrimination, retaliation and/or other policy violations occurred as alleged.” 
Although the commission and agency are not identified in the contract, the Office of Financial Management confirmed that the contract was for the Fish and Wildlife Commission investigation.
The hiring came weeks after Ferguson received a petition from the Sportsmen’s Alliance to remove the four commissioners. Susewind said he was not told a contract was issued.
“I wrote my (August) letter and I was informed they hired an investigator,” Susewind said. “I’ve not been privy to anything going on with that contract.”
It’s not clear how the scope of the investigation overlaps with or goes beyond the Sportsmen’s Alliance claims.
Ferguson has not publicly commented on the Sportsmen’s Alliance petition and Aho declined to answer questions on how it factored into the hiring of the investigator. That petition and supporting materials were the first documents provided to the investigator in mid-August, based on information the Standard obtained through a public records request.
The governor’s office “was aware of a possible need to investigate, based on a preliminary conversation” with the department, Aho wrote in an email. “After the governor received the letter from Director Susewind laying out his concerns, it was clear an investigation was needed.”
Originally, the investigator’s final report was to be turned in by Oct. 7, with the contract ending Nov. 11. 
Earlier this month, the contract was extended and its cost increased. Transformative Investigations will now earn $64,000 and its findings are due by Feb. 13.
Commissioners who’ve repeatedly said there was no cause for an inquiry were further rankled upon learning the investigator won’t be done until next year.
“I’m very frustrated with the amount of time it’s taking to try and resolve the whole issue,” said Commissioner John Lehmkuhl, who the investigator interviewed in November.
‘It’ll yield what it yields”
Seeds of this investigation were planted in November 2022 when the commission voted to stop recreational hunting of black bears in the spring.
Sportsmen’s Alliance, an Ohio-based organization, opposed the decision. 
The next year, it started requesting emails, texts and other communications of commissioners, convinced the correspondence would reveal violations of state laws requiring public meetings and preservation of public records. It took a lawsuit, but the group received thousands of records.
On May 16, the group filed the petition asking Ferguson to remove commissioners Barbara Baker, Lorna Smith, Melanie Rowland and Lehmkuhl, alleging misconduct and malfeasance. 
Susewind, agency director for seven years, said he became concerned as he read some of the records produced in response to the alliance’s request. He shared his concerns with the governor’s office but said he was not asked directly by Ferguson’s staff to request some kind of action. He did that on his own.
“I just decided it was best for everybody to have an independent investigation to see what’s going on. It’ll yield what it yields,” he said.
Susewind, along with the commissioners named in the petition, are among those who’ve been interviewed by the investigator.
Alliance leaders have not received any response from the governor to their petition. Nor had anyone from the group been interviewed for the investigation as of early December.
“It is very surprising that this has not occurred as our inquiries and scrutiny are what precipitated the investigation,” said Michael Jean, Sportsmen’s Alliance attorney, in an email.
‘It’s very disruptive’
Commissioners targeted in the petition are frustrated. Some wrote letters to Ferguson to rebut claims in the petition and are disappointed at his lack of response. They feel the protracted inquiry is undermining the panel.
“This has been a pretty stressful, awful situation,” said Commissioner Lorna Smith. “It has had a chilling effect on everything this commission wants to be doing.”
Smith said she’s not sure the state’s ever carried out an investigation of a citizen commission in this manner.
“I do not see that they have any grounds for their claims. That’s how I think it will turn out,” she said. “If I or any other commissioners stepped over any lines, it was totally not on purpose.”
Lehmkuhl said, “It’s just sort of hanging over us. It’s very disruptive.”
Commissioner Jim Anderson said since becoming chair in August that he’s not felt the investigation has impeded the commission’s work.
“It is what it is. I don’t think we as a commission have gotten high-centered on this,” he said. “I would like to have it done yesterday because it would give us clarity of where things came out.”
Is change on the horizon?
The investigation is the latest flare-up for the panel. A report released last year included interviews with people who described the commission as “dysfunctional.” It also suggested that the commission’s structure might need to be overhauled.
And shortly after taking office, Ferguson halted two commissioner nominations former Gov. Jay Inslee made. He upset some wildlife conservationists by cutting a commissioner they supported and installing nominees with support from hunters, anglers, and a bloc of tribes.
A pending House bill would have the agency director appointed by the governor and the commission’s role shifted from oversight to advisory. There’s a Senate bill to retool the process for naming commissioners. Both face long odds in the upcoming session.
Sen. Mike Chapman, D-Port Angeles, chair of the Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee, said at a hearing in early December that he’s not planning to advance either policy next year.
“If it were up to me and me alone, which it’ll never be nor should it be, but I believe that the department should be a cabinet-level position. But I have no intention of hearing a bill like that this session,” he said. He added that he also did not plan to hear the bill to change the makeup of the commission.
Chapman invited groups with concerns about how the department is being run to come together to find efficiencies and reforms so that the commission “is a state agency that we all can be, continue to be proud of.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Black-Bear-in-Hozemeen-NPS-Deby-Dixon-Copy-Large.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 07:12:28.958843

Adrian Plank, D-Columbia, speaks during a press conference March 6, 2025, in the House Press Gallery. Among his bills prefiled for the 2026 legislative session, Plank has proposed creating a statewide agriculture education program (Tim Bommel/House Communications).Missouri public school students could see more agriculture-based science lessons starting in kindergarten through high school under bills prefiled in both state legislative chambers that would establish a new statewide program. Lawmakers in the state’s more populous cities filed the bills, hoping agriculture education can benefit students in both urban and rural areas.
“I am a proponent of continuing to have (agriculture education)… and not just in our rural schools but to have this everywhere so that our kids are exposed to agriculture as a science,” state Sen. Barbara Washington, a Democrat from Kansas City, told The Independent.
She filed the bill for the second year in a row, inspired by personal experiences eating homegrown food and visiting Kansas City schools who incorporate agriculture into education.
The legislation uses an existing statute, which established a pilot program for agriculture education in 2020, to make way for a permanent program that can be rolled out statewide.
The pilot ran from 2020 to 2023, starting with 44 teachers in third through fifth grades participating. When it ended, only 20 teachers were participating. The COVID-19 pandemic put stress on the program, according to the program’s final report, and teachers had mixed feelings about the curriculum.
In periodic surveys, educators said they didn’t have enough time to complete the lessons in their entirety but said the hands-on activities kept students engaged. While the pilot program set the framework for the bill, the legislation would not lock in the same program curriculum or format. It would also be voluntary.
State Rep. John Martin, a Republican from Columbia, said he sees opportunities for the state to partner with Missouri Farmers Care. The nonprofit, which advocates for expanded agriculture opportunities, has a program called Agriculture Education on the Move which is currently in some of the state’s public schools.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education, which would be responsible for overseeing the program, is open to public-private partnerships.
“It is our intention to work side by side with the many current commodities groups that are providing this access currently,” the department’s spokesman said in an emailed statement. “It is our hope with this legislation to provide continued access for students in learning about agriculture in the state of Missouri.”
Martin started sponsoring the bill last year after Columbia Democratic state Rep. Adrian Plank asked him to team up.
Plank was the first to file the bill in 2024, but it didn’t get any traction. Last year, with Martin filing an identical bill, it passed a House committee with unanimous approval. But the momentum was stifled after Plank took a leave of absence to undergo heart surgery.
“Me and him together, we should be able to get it on to something this year, pretty easily,” Plank told The Independent.
Gov. Mike Kehoe appears to be supportive of the legislation, Martin told The Independent, and there is growing interest from agriculture organizations.
“Those farmers who come to my office are so anxious to be a part of exposing their world to children at a younger age,” Washington. “And if we expose the children to agriculture now, then they know that there are opportunities for them in the workforce.”
The estimated cost, based on last year’s fiscal note, is limited to teacher training at $116,000 annually.
“If the program gets bigger, which I believe it will, then we will go and advocate for funding for the program,” Plank said. “Especially if it is going to be as successful as I think it will be.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54368644057_ba7b03d684_k-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-26 07:12:28.958843

With lawsuits overshadowing Vermont’s first-of-its-kind climate legislation, new state leaders have begun trying to decipher the costs of a warming planet

For Sue Minter, Vermont’s newly appointed climate superfund specialist, the floods started early.
Back in 2011, when Tropical Storm Irene thrashed Vermont, Minter — serving as the state’s deputy secretary of transportation — helped rebuild the 600 miles of destroyed road and hundreds of damaged bridges. Just over a decade later, as executive director for Capstone Community Action, a regional anti-poverty nonprofit, she helped low-income and vulnerable Vermonters displaced by the 2023 and 2024 floods. 
With a history of public service dating back to the 1990s, Minter was tapped in September to be the program manager for the state’s new Climate Superfund Act. That legislation, overshadowed by a pair of federal lawsuits seeking to dismantle the law, seeks to hold major oil companies accountable for their pollution. Now, Minter is pushing the law forward while the courts consider whether the state law will survive. On Monday, the federal government again asked the courts to void the law.

The Vermont law imposes a one-time fee on fossil fuel companies for emissions between 1995 and 2024. A company qualifies as a payee if its extraction or refining of fossil fuels caused at least one billion metric tons of carbon emissions over the last two decades. 
Those payouts would help the state finance adaptation to climate change, largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels. 
“This current job is so meaningful to me because it’s getting back to the mission that I was on in 2011,” said Minter, a former state representative from Waterbury who made an unsuccessful bid for governor in 2016. “In the future those dramatic costs shouldn’t be borne entirely by taxpayers.” 
Her position oversees the wonkiest aspect of the 2024 law: determining how much climate change has cost the state. The assessment relies on attribution science, a type of modeling that connects events like heat waves and floods to climate change by determining how greenhouse gas emissions increased the likelihood of the event. 
Minter is managing that cost assessment, working with the consulting team — Industrial Economics, Incorporated — along with the state treasurer’s office and the Climate Action Office under the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.
“We’re in the phase where we’re rolling up our sleeves and doing the analysis,” said Mike Pieciak, Vermont’s state treasurer.  “For our office this is the most technical and scientific part of the work.” 
In January 2027, the treasurer’s office will submit a report to the Agency of Natural Resources, which will have another year to connect those costs to oil companies like Chevron, Exxon and British Petroleum to determine which oil giants owe what to Vermont, according to the law.“This is a rigorous report,” Minter said. “We’re not just putting a number out there, we’re really establishing credible scientific evidence for what these costs have been and what they’re projected to be in the future.” 
Pieciak said he didn’t want to speculate at the total cost until the report was done, but a Vermont Resilience Implementation Strategy published by his office and the Agency of Natural Resources in September identified 300 resilience-related measures the state could pursue at an estimated cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Resilient design
Minter came to Vermont in the 1990s and learned about climate change through activists like former Vice President Al Gore and Vermont writer Bill McKibben. But she didn’t see the impacts of a warming atmosphere causing more extreme rain events until 2011, when Irene caused record flooding in Vermont. 
“She has a unique experience and background having been the recovery czar in Hurricane Irene,” Pieciak said. “So whether it’s Irene or more recent flooding, Sue very much understands the impact climate change has on Vermont and the importance and need to prioritize making our communities more resilient.” 
A big part of Minter’s job in emergency response was to convince the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to pay for resilient investments to mitigate future floods. The resiliency built with federal and state dollars after Irene helped reduce the impacts of floods in 2023 and 2024, Minter and Pieciak said. The damages from those two flooding events cost more than $1 billion, according to the resilience strategy report.
“But right now we are not at all sure what FEMA’s future will be,” Minter said, noting that the Trump administration denied Vermont’s most recent disaster declaration over this summer’s floods. She said without a federal safety net, the superfund law was even more vital to ensure taxpayers wouldn’t foot the bill for climate-related disasters.
“A resilient design can protect and reduce costs in the future,” Minter said. “Unless we have a recovery program that can help with these investments, it’s going to be harder and harder for Vermonters to do.” 
Climate lawsuits
The law faces major pushback in a pair of lawsuits filed in May by the federal government and 24 states, led by West Virginia, who joined the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Petroleum Institute, a lobby for oil companies. 
The suits claim that the Vermont law interferes with federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. 
In November, the Vermont Public Interest Research Group pushed back. The progressive advocacy organization told the courts that the law does nothing to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. Rather the law asks polluters to pay for their pollution, much like the original 1980 superfund law asked polluters to pay to clean up contaminated sites, according to the group’s amicus brief.
“Nothing in the Act requires emitters and polluters to change their behavior or mitigate their emissions,” the VPIRG brief reads. “The Act only asks polluters to pay an equitable share of the bill to help Vermont adapt to climate change.”
Paul Burns, VPIRG’s executive director, said the organization has been long-involved with pressing for a climate superfund law. First, the organization backed a federal climate superfund law. In 2021, U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md, drafted legislation to tax major oil and gas companies for climate disasters based on the greenhouse gases emitted from 2000 to 2019. The cost recovery was estimated at $500 billion over 10 years.
When that ambitious plan failed, VPIRG turned to state leaders.
“In the wake of the (2023) flooding, we brought the voices and concerns of Vermont residents, farmers, and businesses to policymakers as they considered this legislation,” Burns said in an email. “That’s a big reason why support for the law was so strong.”
Their amicus brief followed a similar argument made by previous groups, including the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, an agricultural nonprofit, and the Conservation Law Foundation, an environmental advocacy group in New England. In August, Vermont asked federal courts to dismiss lawsuits brought against the state’s Climate Superfund Act. 
The U.S. government filed its reply on Monday, again asking the courts to void the law. The state has asked for an extension until January to respond. After that, the court will decide how it will address the flurry of motions filed since the summer, according to Vermont’s Attorney General’s Office.
“Irrespective of what happens in that case, the work that we’re going to do is incredibly important because we’re going to be defining, really, what the impacts of climate change have been in Vermont,” Minter said.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A number of high-profile audits have yet to be released by the State Auditor and Inspectors office.
Audits into local towns and school districts and the state’s departments of education, tourism and recreation, and turnpikes are among over three dozen forensic examinations that have been requested and have yet to be made public, according to records released by the State Auditor and Inspector’s Office.
All the audits have been requested after 2020 except four. Three of those audits, involving the City of Henryetta and the towns of Calvin and Fort Towson, are in the final review phase, the records show. 
State Auditor and Inspector Cindy Byrd said short staffing, a lack of funds and other factors, some outside of her control, impact when an audit is completed and released.

Editor’s note: This story is part of Oklahoma Voice’s end-of-year series that provides updates to some stories that captured the interest of Oklahomans in 2025.

The office’s manpower has been slashed by 25% even as the demand for investigative audits has doubled in the last decade, said Andrew Speno, a Byrd spokesman.
In 2026, the agency had a $5.4 million appropriation, down from $6.3 million in 2002, according to information provided by the agency.
The special audits are in addition to the 365 annual audits the office is required to conduct, Byrd said.
She said she has to prioritize special audits where there is suspected wrongdoing.
Department of Tourism and Recreation
Byrd’s office has completed but not released an audit of the Oklahoma Department of Tourism’s dealings with Swadley’s Foggy Bottom Kitchen. 
The agency ended its contract with Swadley’s and sued the company, alleging it over-billed the state when it was managing restaurants at some state parks. Swadley’s counter sued, alleging the state owed it money.
In February 2024, the state’s Multi-County Grand Jury indicted Ronald Brent Swadley, Curtis Ray Breuklander and Timothy Raymond Hooper with one count of conspiracy to defraud the state and five counts of presenting false or fraudulent claims against the state. They deny wrongdoing. The case is pending.
Byrd said the audit can’t be released until she gets permission from the Multi-County Grand Jury.
Oklahoma Turnpike Authority
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond in March 2023 requested an investigative audit of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. The agency had become a target of criticism after it announced plans for a new  turnpike in the Norman area. 
The new turnpike is among several projects in the 15-year, $8.2 billion ACCESS program.
“I have had many conversations over the past few months with legislators, community leaders, private citizens and state employees who have expressed a wide array of concerns with the financial conduct of the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority,” Drummond wrote in a letter requesting the audit. “These concerns include but are not limited to improper transfers between OTA and the Department of Transportation; improper contracting and purchasing practices; and internal financial controls.”
In August, Drummond expressed frustration that it had not been completed.
Byrd said that although her office has never audited OTA, an outside financial firm performs annual audits.
She said it has taken a while to get familiar with the agency. Drummond provided very broad parameters for the review, she said.
She would not provide a date for the audit’s completion, but said it will be soon.
“When it is ready, there will be no one happier than me,” she said.
Office of Management and Enterprise Services
In February 2024, Drummond asked for an investigative audit of the Office of Management and Enterprise Services, saying he had serious concerns about the agency’s procurement practices.
“We are waiting on any other specific instances he wants us to investigate,” Byrd said. 
Department of Education
Two audits regarding the State Department of Education are also pending. 
One was requested in 2021 by Gov. Kevin Stitt. It involves financial reporting requirements after an earlier audit found problems with Epic Charter School.
Stitt directed Byrd to determine if the agency and schools were complying with the Oklahoma Cost Accounting System’s financial reporting requirements. 
He also asked if the agency was requiring consistent and timely enforcement of those requirements.
The second audit was requested in October by Drummond and involves spending practices under former State Superintendent Ryan Walters, who resigned to take a job in the private sector. 
Byrd said Drummond has requested that the audit be put on hold.
“Additional issues have come to light that warrant a delay,” said Leslie Berger, a Drummond spokesperson.
Many times the audits find abuse, which never gets prosecuted, Byrd said.
“Legally, I am only allowed so much authority,” she said. “I am only supposed to write and issue a report. I am saddened when prosecutors don’t take action and prosecute the bad actors.”  
Byrd also said she doesn’t have the legal authority to initiate her own audits, something she would like the Legislature to change.
Her office can do investigative audits at the request of the governor, attorney general, Legislature, an agency head, district attorney or with a citizen petition.
Byrd took office in 2019. She is serving her second and final term as state auditor and is running for lieutenant governor.

Budget struggles also took precedence during the Legislature’s 90-day session this spring, when lawmakers worked to fill a budget deficit that at one point grew to $432 million. After making numerous cuts that senators acknowledged were painful, the session concluded with the state’s two-year budget projecting a modest $4 million surplus.
That surplus didn’t last long, because new economic projections made in July put Nebraska back into a projected deficit of $95 million. When Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board met again in October, projections brought the expected shortfall to $471 million.
Arch said balancing Nebraska’s budget is more difficult than normal, because the state’s revenue streams continue to evolve. Passage of the federal “One Big Beautiful Bill” in July is expected to cost Nebraska’s state government about $406 million over the next four fiscal years, according to the state Department of Revenue.
Additionally, Nebraska is in the midst of scaling down its individual income tax rates to eventually hit 3.99% in 2027. Once lawmakers reach 2027, Arch expects state revenue sources to stabilize, which he said should make managing the budget a bit easier.
“After we flatten out in ‘27, there is a very simple formula, and that is: You spend less than you bring in,” Arch said.
The looming budget challenge is on the minds of many senators, and Arch said there may be fewer new bills introduced in 2026. Recent sessions have established a trend of a higher-than-average number of new bills introduced within the first 10 days of a legislative session, and there are still 240 bills carrying over from 2025, according to legislative records.
At the very least, Arch said lawmakers are aware that there needs to be extremely good cause to introduce any bill with an appropriation attached.
“I’ll emphasize ‘extremely,’” Arch said. “Because it’s just going to be very difficult for a bill to pass that has an A-bill attached.”

Aside from balancing the budget, the speaker said another one of his goals in setting the session’s agenda is scheduling as many priority bills as possible.
However, he acknowledged multiple other issues that could make staying on that track more challenging. He said any extraneous matters could mean priority bills suffer.
During the legislative break, Arch reset all existing priority bills from 2025 back to normal status. He said this was because he felt not all were “ready,” and he intends to start 2026’s floor debates with worksheet order bills before focusing on senators’ personal priorities. He noted that senators could still reprioritize the reset bills.
Even with less time for bills, Arch said there is still value to introducing bills on important topics for the sake of starting conversations. He noted that his recent bills on government efficiencies and legislative oversight took years to pass.

Arch said he intends to bring a smaller government efficiency bill in 2026 that would continue to eliminate certain government reports he views as “obsolete.” He said lawmakers should always keep government efficiency on their mind, because there is always something worth addressing.
On legislative oversight, Arch’s Legislative Bill 298 established a new Division of Legislative Oversight and a new Legislative Oversight Committee. This being a significant change to Nebraska’s governmental structure, Arch said it needs time to settle before further bills with changes should be brought.
Arch anticipates that property taxes will remain a top issue for lawmakers in 2026. While it is also one of his goals to make progress on tax reform, he said he doubts there will be enough revenue to pass new tax relief.
In recent sessions, Arch said senators have been more focused on quick fixes for immediate tax relief, mostly through allocating state dollars to local governments.
Arch said he would like to shift the focus to structural reforms that address the root causes of rising taxes. Arch identified several factors that he believes contributes to higher taxes — rising property valuations, unfunded government mandates, and local government spending.
He said the Legislature ought to revisit its discussion on spending caps, and encourage local governments to be stricter about how it spends money. Though that may take more than one session to accomplish, he argued it will be better for the state in the long run.
Arch, who will be term-limited after 2026, said he hopes people look back on his legacy and view him as a speaker who put the institution first.
The 2023 session — his first as speaker — was contentious from start to finish, and Arch said he was pushed in multiple directions in regard to his scheduling. In those instances, he believed ceding to the pressure would not be good for the institution, so he stuck to the Legislature’s policies and held strong to those principles in subsequent sessions.
“You have to have the opportunity to debate what is important in our society, and we as senators have to learn how to do that well,” Arch said. “Some days we do that well, some days we don’t.”

Reporter Katie Klingsporn also spent much of the year following rural health care challenges, library battles and a notorious shortcut.
The post DOGE hits, insurance premiums and school vouchers underscore 2025 in health and education appeared first on WyoFile .","When I majored in print journalism at the University of Montana many years ago, I was surprised to discover I had to take a wide variety of general studies courses over the first two years. I learned about everything from microeconomics to geology and Latin American literature. 
This year at WyoFile proved to me once again the wisdom in this approach. Because while I’m primarily an education and health reporter, the range of issues I covered extended well beyond that — from the politics embattling libraries to the fate of a popular hot springs destination and legal nuances of trail behavior in national parks. 
For me, the year’s biggest story was covering the potential and real impacts of President Donald Trump’s DOGE efforts on Wyoming. That, too, involved more than education — extending to public lands, the social safety net, child care and many other areas.
WyoFile’s first major DOGE piece, an all-hands collaboration of reporters and editors, recounted what became known as the “Valentine’s Day massacre,” when untold numbers of federal employees were fired.

For months after that initial article, we could barely keep up with the flood of news related to program cuts. Advocates worried that diminished resources would hobble outdoor recreation, harm public lands and hollow out tribal programs. DOGE efforts hammered humanities groups and slashed services at places like Devils Tower. I interviewed people, like a Laramie library specialist, who lost their jobs. 
Trump administration cuts also triggered a great deal of panic and uncertainty among groups that nearly lost their funding. Three such groups included Wyoming Job Corps, Adult Education programs at community colleges and after-school programs. Along with meeting the people who fuel these programs, I learned how federal funds prop up Wyoming-tailored initiatives and the benefits they bring. All three are arguably critical for those who use them. 
What else kept me busy? 
A Laramie lawmaker brought a bill to establish a universal school voucher program in Wyoming, igniting months of debate, legislative negotiations, a fish-fry business boycott and a lawsuit challenging the program’s constitutionality. That case is ongoing, and in the meantime, the program has been put on hold. 
Statewide property tax reforms kicked in, rippling downstream to where diminishing revenues meant painful budget cuts for hospital districts, county governments and services like libraries.

Speaking of libraries, partisan fights erupted in more Wyoming branches over who should determine what materials are appropriate for children, pitting free speech concerns against censorship.
Another pitched education battle unfolded in the town of Alpine. This one was over the town’s long-established need for a school, which resulted in the selection of a charter school provider not everyone was pleased with. 
And of course, there were court fights. These included disputed rulings on how Wyoming funds education, a challenge over the fate of the popular Star Plunge aquatic facility in Hot Springs State Park and the federal trial over speed runner Michelino Sunseri’s notorious shortcut on the Grand Teton.

The Sunseri case was full of twists and turns, but none more surprising than the November news that President Donald Trump had pardoned Sunseri. As Sunseri himself posted on social media, “You can’t make this stuff up.”
Health care saw shakeups this year due to federal policy. When Congress passed Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” it cut Medicaid and did not extend temporary COVID-era tax subsidies for Affordable Care Act insurance plans. With those subsidies expiring at the end of the year, costs are surging for consumers in Wyoming, which leads the country with the highest price jumps. Health advocates fear the price spikes will result in more uninsured residents, more uncompensated care and less preventative care. 
Another thing the Big Beautiful Bill did, however, was create the Rural Health Transformation Program, an initiative designed to funnel $50 billion to states over five years to stabilize and strengthen rural hospitals and providers. Wyoming stands to receive up to $800 million, and its application proposes everything from nursing grants to EMS incentives to a state-run insurance plan.
Amid the tumult, politics and divisiveness of 2025, I also made an effort to shine a spotlight on stories of resilience, passion and innovation. I wrote about the people who step up to shape their communities and honor their past.

I profiled Wyoming’s farm-to-school food evangelist, a small but mighty orchestra maestro leading a scrappy central Wyoming symphony, a teacher whose pioneering literacy instruction is changing the lives of older students, and the people growing year-round strawberries in a high-tech indoor western Wyoming farm. 
In 2025, Wyoming also lost the towering and mischievous statesman Al Simpson and Dick Cheney, a Casper boy who went on to become America’s most powerful vice president. 
Selfishly, these stories of remarkable Wyoming lives buoy my spirit. Thankfully, they also make great copy. 
Happy New Year, and thanks always for reading.

The post Walking in a windy wonderland appeared first on WyoFile .","December ushered an array of weird meteorological conditions to Wyoming — from record-high temperatures to hurricane-strength winds and the rare winter rainbow.
The prismatic arch appeared over central Wyoming on Dec. 17, a rare spot of beauty amid raging wind gusts that wreaked havoc across the state. 
That day, winds hit speeds of 123 miles per hour in Red Canyon, 144 miles per hour on Mount Coffin and 91 miles per hour in Hiland, according to the National Weather Service Riverton Office. 
In nearby Lander, the wind knocked down trash cans and fences. It blew Christmas decorations halfway to Colorado, peeled shingles off of roofs, closed the highway to South Pass and felled trees. 
Elsewhere, high winds have knocked out the power to traffic signals in Casper and forced city officials to close the landfill. December gusts also toppled dozens of semi-trucks on highways like Interstate 80, the Wyoming Department of Transportation reported.

Balmy temperatures have attended the winds, breaking records in places ranging from Riverton to Worland and Rock Springs — where a high of 59 was the warmest temperature on record in December, according to the National Weather Service.
Residents accustomed to bundling up for single-digit temperatures, snowfall and ice skating during the holidays may instead reach for a windbreaker and umbrella this year.

This is the season of what’s supposed to be “Peace on Earth, Goodwill toward men.”  Yet, it seems there are more wars and atrocities happening globally right now than in quite some time.  What’s missing is not only a rational justification for the bombing and slaughter of our fellow men, women and children, but the realization that the global community has run out of time and resources to continue endless wars due to the climate crisis that threatens all humanity. 
Every day the media is filled with the latest climate-caused disaster.  On Christmas Eve, 100 mph winds in California have knocked out power to 100,000 people as yet another atmospheric river coming off a too-hot ocean drowns already-flooded homes and businesses. 
For Montanans, the memory of record-setting savage windstorms is still very fresh, resulting in an emergency wind disaster designation by Gov. Greg Gianforte and the continuous buzz of chainsaws at Christmas as clearing the debris continues.
But of course it’s not just wind storms – it’s flooding, drought, hurricanes, ocean warming and acidification, bizarre fluctuations in the polar vortex, and temperature extremes on both ends of the scale proliferating at an unprecedented rate across the globe.
These are not problems that can be solved by any single nation — nor by the belligerence and aggression that now emanates endlessly from the very highest officials of our nation, arguably the wealthiest nation on the planet.
There are any number of ways to truly address the problems we face.  We could perceive humanity as a community of nations that have long realized the best way to co-exist is through peaceful and respectful trade with each other.  If you have what I need, and I have what you need, the exchange takes place to our mutual benefit.  In fact, that’s the way most of us live our daily lives.
On the other hand, as we’re unfortunately experiencing, the alternative is to threaten, attack, and seek to inflict physical and economic harm on nations that hold resources we need — or worse, simply want.  Need examples?  How’s about tariffs, blockades, threats of invading Greenland and Venezuela, and piracy on the open seas —all currently being conducted by our once great nation? 
Or how about a very close to home example?  We’re going to mine what’s left of the West, including in environmentally sensitive areas like the West Fork of the Bitterroot River, to produce rare metals.  China has an abundance of those and a logical progression would be to simply buy them – willing buyer, willing seller — the very basis of what used to be called free trade.  
But that was before we decided China was a “global competitor.”  For what has never been very well explained.  Instead, the military-industrial complex now garners an enormous flood of government money fueling yet another bizarre arms race, apparently unaware that all our previous arms races really didn’t benefit anyone — and for sure not the planet itself or the environment on which our existence relies. 
If any Montanans doubt that, take a look outside here at the end of December — 50 degrees and rain as our hillsides remain bare and brown, lacking the snowpack that sustains our arid state through the longer, hotter summers.  Without water, Montana and the West are toast — as the latest struggle over the Colorado basin water so vividly illustrates. 
“Peace on Earth, Good will toward men” is not just a good idea, it’s a necessity now more than ever — and Christmas would be the perfect time for our so-called leaders to reflect on that ultimate truth.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1282163488-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-26 06:56:55.813648

In a lawsuit filed Dec. 18 in U.S. District Court for the District of Idaho, the conservation groups argue that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Army Corps of Engineers did not take into account the impact the Idaho Club Lakeside Marina Development would have on bull trout, which are a species threatened with extinction under the Endangered Species Act. 
In the filing, the Center for Biological Diversity and Idaho Conservation League challenged the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s July 30 concurrence decision that the project is not likely to adversely affect bull trout. 
“With construction crews already plowing ahead, federal agencies need to protect threatened bull trout from this misguided zombie project once and for all,” Sarah Brown, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity’s Northern Rockies program, wrote in a written statement. “Carving up the North Branch of the creek could worsen polluted runoff into Lake Pend Oreille and put crosshairs on bull trout right in their critical spawning area. It’s time for the agencies to seriously consider the many threats this project poses.”
The development project was authorized adjacent to Trestle Creek, which the conservation groups say is one of the most important bull trout spawning streams in the Pacific Northwest. In court filings, the conservation groups say Trestle Creek has among the highest number of bull trout egg nests in all of Lake Pend Oreille’s tributaries. Trestle Creek flows into Lake Pend Oreille. 
In a press release issued Dec. 23, the Center for Biological Diversity announced that in response to its lawsuit, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ordered a stop to all construction work on the Idaho Club marina and housing development. 
In their order to stop construction work, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wrote that work on the North Branch of Trestle Creek cannot occur until the stream has dry, or no flow conditions.
The Center for Biological Diversity says that work had occurred on the project while the stream was still flowing, despite conditions in place that the stream had to be dry.

Clayton Henkel: “Two stories that didn’t attract major headlines in 2025 — one on breast cancer, the other on an all-Black WWII squadron — demonstrate that even in our deeply divided country, our elected officials can on rare occasions work together and find common ground. Perhaps a glimmer of hope for 2026?”
The irony of the moment was likely not lost on Rep. Renée Price.
Shortly after a tense, hours-long debate in the state House and the passage of a ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) across North Carolina government, it was her time to speak on House Bill 254.

The Orange County Democrat stood and asked her colleagues to support legislation that would designate the fourth Thursday of March as “Tuskegee Airmen Commemoration Day” in North Carolina.
In 1941, the federal government established the 66th Air Force Flying School at Tuskegee Institute to train Black pilots for the war.
Almost 1,000 African Americans trained at the Army Airfield in Tuskegee, Alabama; and 450 of the men who completed training were sent overseas for combat duty. Most battled discrimination and other challenges not experienced by white individuals in the officially segregated U.S. military. And for those who survived, many such challenges persisted in the decades that followed — a phenomenon that DEI policies seek to combat.
“The Tuskegee Airmen were pilots, mechanics, bombardiers, navigators, crew members, nurses, and instructors,” Price said. “From 1943 to 1945 in the European Theatre, they provided escorts during bombing missions, helping the Allied Forces in achieving a victory in the global conflict that caused horrific destruction and casualties.”
The Tuskegee Airmen flew hundreds of patrol and attack missions — first flying older and less well-equipped P-40 and P-39 airplanes, before ultimately being reassigned to escort B-17 and B-24 heavy bombers, using P-47 and P-51 airplanes. They earned the nickname “Red Tails” from the distinctive painted tails of the Tuskegee fighter planes.
“I have a personal interest in this request,” Price shared. “Even though he was from New York State, my father was actually part of the 99th Pursuit Squadron and was with the 332nd Fighter Group.”
 Standing on their shoulders

Rep. Nasif Majeed (D-Mecklenburg) told members of the House that as a decorated Air Force combat pilot who flew 120 combat missions over North Vietnam, the history of the Tuskegee airmen was very dear to him.
“I stand on their shoulders,” said Majeed. “They were known as the Red Tails and all the bomber pilots said that because of their outstanding record, they wanted them to escort them because they lost fewer aircraft.”
The National WWII Museum notes that while 66 Tuskegee Airmen died in combat, it was one of the lowest loss records of any escort fighter group. They are credited with completing more than 1,500 missions, destroying 260 enemy aircraft, and sinking an enemy German destroyer.
Rep. Abe Jones (D-Wake) said it was a Tuskegee Airman who helped change the trajectory of his life.
After the war, Harold Webb became a teacher and a principal, and served as a leading force for school integration, according to the Raleigh Hall of Fame.

Governor Jim Hunt later appointed Webb as the first African American director of the Office of State Personnel in 1977. The former Tuskegee Airman worked to strengthen the state’s Equal Employment Opportunity program that was dedicated to diversifying and strengthening the state’s government workforce.
“I’m proud to be able to have a chance to vote for this bill,” Jones told his House colleagues.
 From aviator to prisoner of war 
Rep. Jay Adams (R-Catawba) became emotional as he thought about his own father in World War II.
“He was shot down outside of Rome in January of 1944. He spent 16 months in a German prison camp.”
Adams said it was after his capture in a dark, crowded box car that his father met a fellow southerner and aviator named William E. Griffin from Montgomery, Alabama. Griffin took flight training at Tuskegee, earned his wings in 1943, and flew more than 23 flights over enemy territory.
“William E. Griffin became one of my dad’s best friends. They dug tunnels together. They cooked together. They exercised together. They did everything together for 16 months.”

After the war, the two POWs lost touch.
Adams said his father was deeply saddened to learn in 1992 that Griffin died in 1969.
“Willie E. Griffin was the only Black guy in that prison camp. In the end of the war, there were 8,500 airmen there. But he was one of them. They were best friends. This is very special to me.”
Adams said it took years, but he made sure that letters his father had in Griffin’s own handwriting were returned to his daughter.
“He was very educated. He was a smart guy.”
Adams, a co-sponsor on the Tuskegee bill, joined 68 of GOP colleagues in voting to approve the bill to ban DEI programs.
Preserving the Tuskegee legacy amid efforts to dismantle DEI 
Earlier this year, in an effort to comply with Trump administration’s crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion, the Air Force removed videos that included stories of the Tuskegee Airmen from the military’s training materials.
Bipartisan outcry over that hasty decision led Air Force officials to walk back the order.
Locally, the Heart of Carolina Chapter of the Tuskegee Airmen and the Wilson V. Eagleson Chapter are now seeking the special day of commemoration outlined in House Bill 254 to ensure that the history of America’s first Black military pilots and their triumph over adversity is never not forgotten.
HB254 won a rare unanimous vote (114-0) on Wednesday in the state House and now moves to the North Carolina Senate.

FAIRMONT, W.Va. — The longest government shutdown in U.S. history didn’t just halt SNAP benefits — it pushed West Virginia’s nonprofit network to fill the gaps, potentially creating long-term repercussions for the sector.
For the first time in U.S. history, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits lapsed on Nov. 1, leaving 274,000 West Virginians without federal assistance for nearly two weeks. A U.S. District Court judge ruled on Nov. 2 that the Trump administration could not withhold the benefits, forcing the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute $4.6 billion in reserves to states to provide to residents.

But in the intervening time, Misty Tennant, director of the food assistance non-profit Soup Opera in Fairmont, said her soup kitchen served nearly double the number of people it would typically.


But in the intervening time, Misty Tennant, director of the food assistance non-profit Soup Opera in Fairmont, said her soup kitchen served nearly double the number of people it would typically.
“We give out emergency food bags every Friday of the month, and instead of 50 or 55 bags, we gave out 107,” Tennant said. “The numbers just keep increasing, and we’ve seen like 15 new faces today that we hadn’t seen ever.”
She said she’s relieved the benefits are back, but she and other nonprofit leaders say the fallout won’t end with the restoration of SNAP. Instead, the shutdown has created a set of long-term financial and workforce challenges that may take months, or even years, to recover from.

Rosemary Ketchum, the executive director of the West Virginia Nonprofit Association, explained how food banks were struggling with funding throughout the government shutdown.
“Many nonprofits that receive state or federal dollars, once those state or federal dollars were paused, they needed to deeply consider or reconsider what their cash flow status was,” Ketchum said. “Just because there has been a continuing resolution doesn’t mean that the faucet automatically turns some of those federal and state dollars on. This was the longest shutdown in American history, and many nonprofits, kind of on the day to day without a government shutdown, are doing more with less.”
Uncertainty around long-term, stable funding, may lead many employees of the nonprofit sector to step away from their roles, Ketchum said.

“We often forget that nonprofits are also economic workforce generators, and so about 14% of the West Virginia workforce is in the nonprofit sector, and we want to keep those folks employed,” she said. “Whether or not the government is shut down or active, those folks need to work and need to support their own families.”
Even though the government shutdown ended, Martin Howe, executive director of the United Way of Harrison and Doddridge Counties, said it doesn’t automatically fix all of the struggles in the nonprofit sector.
“Most likely a lot of the nonprofits may have to resort to utilizing their reserves … or take out loans, or ultimately some of them may have to cut back on certain programs they offered,” he said. “But even with the government opening back up, there’s going to be a backlog of processing for grants and things such as that that will take months and months to catch up on, so the strain is still going to be experienced by many of these nonprofits that deal directly with federal grants and similar funding streams.”

West Virginia’s two biggest food banks, Facing Hunger in Huntington and Mountaineer Food Bank in Gassaway, support smaller pantries across West Virginia.
Mountaineer Food Bank has 470 community partners throughout 48 of the state’s 55 counties, including the Soup Opera in Fairmont.
Beyond access to food, Daniel Brewster, a sociology professor at West Virginia University, said many families face shame that keeps them from seeking help even when they desperately need it.
“We live in a society that shames people for being poor,” he said. “There is that feeling of inferiority — that looking-glass self — where you start adopting the mentality of ‘people like me can’t do this.’”
Even as organizations brace for long-term financial fallout, Brewster said this crisis again highlighted how deeply West Virginians rely on one another when systems fail.
“We get this right a lot of times in West Virginia,” he said. “In moments like what we’re seeing with SNAP, the community steps up. When there’s catastrophic flooding, West Virginians step up.”

Now as things return to normal, those in the nonprofit sector reflect on the 42 days of uncertainty, Brewster notes that West Virginians often see the impacts of federal decisions long before Washington, D.C, acknowledges them.
“All of us are much closer to being in the situation of the people who are struggling right now than we are to being the richest people in the world,” Brewster said.
Faced with these long-term uncertainties, nonprofits are working to diversify their financial portfolios. According to Ketchum, they are looking into funding sources not tied to state or federal dollars.

Hot-button issues ranging from local land-use decisions to the Trump administration’s attacks on the rule of law were among the subjects of Colorado Newsline’s most widely read commentaries of the year.
Amid controversy over the use of Flock surveillance cameras in Denver and dozens of other communities in Colorado, Newsline editor Quentin Young’s Sept. 18 commentary on this new tool for mass surveillance was by far Newsline’s most-read opinion piece in 2025.
Other popular commentaries addressed Denver police spending, the Trump administration’s meddling in the Tina Peters case and the controversy over plans to build a gas station near a conservation corridor in the small town of Palmer Lake.

Turn your Flock cameras off
Flock Safety AI-powered surveillance cameras, which record images of passing cars and store the information in sharable and searchable databases, are present in more 75 communities in Colorado, including Colorado Springs, Boulder, Durango, Longmont and Castle Rock. Concerns about the cameras emerged this year as the Trump administration implemented its mass deportation policies, and civil liberties advocates have urged cities like Denver to stop using them immediately.
“That advice should be heeded by every city in Colorado that operates Flock cameras,” Newsline’s Quentin Young wrote in a commentary. “If they value their residents’ fundamental rights, if they want to avoid chilling free speech and association, if they want to uphold the freedoms that the country was founded on, they would turn their cameras off right now.”
What Colorado communities can learn from the Buc-ee’s saga
Controversy engulfed the small town of Palmer Lake this year when Buc-ee’s, a national gas station chain, announced plans to open a new travel plaza a few miles from town. Vocal opposition to the plans overwhelmed town council meetings and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the mayor and multiple trustees.
The crux of the issue, wrote Sammy Herdman in a Sept. 30 commentary, was groundwater scarcity.
“As Colorado becomes increasingly arid, contentious disputes about how to accommodate population growth and commercial development without exhausting groundwater resources are bound to arise more frequently,” Herdman wrote. “The Palmer Lake controversy is a harbinger, unless small towns proactively establish rules for growth in a water-limited future.
Coloradans get a glimpse of how the rule of law is being dismantled
March brought the first of many attempts by the Trump administration in 2025 to meddle in the state criminal case that led to former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters’ conviction and imprisonment last year. Trump’s Department of Justice wrote in a filing that it was conducting a “review” of Colorado’s prosecution of Peters, who was convicted on multiple felony counts for her role in a breach of secure voting equipment in an attempt to prove Trump’s lies alleging widespread fraud in the 2020 election.
“This is an attack on state sovereignty, and if Trump prosecutors succeed in modifying Peters’ sentence or conviction it will do grievous harm to the rule of law in Colorado,” wrote Quentin Young in his March 7 commentary.
Denver can’t afford Mayor Johnston’s decisions
Denver city leaders faced tough choices about how to close a $200 million budget gap this year, leading to cuts and layoffs that impacted nearly every city department — with the exception of the Department of Public Safety.
Mayor Mike Johnston’s budget spared the Denver Police Department from layoffs and even increased their funding, wrote Vinnie Cervantes in an Oct. 1 commentary, while proven alternatives like the Denver Support Team Assisted Response program continue to be underfunded.
“In 2020, there seemed to be a near-consensus that policing in the United States needed major reform and many cities conceded that new interventions in crisis response and public safety were needed outside of policing,” Cervantes wrote. “Yet, the Johnston administration has doubled down in investing more into policing through the absence of cuts and layoffs to Public Safety in the midst of massive cuts everywhere else in the budget.”
The Colorado governor joins team MAGA
A state employee this year filed a whistleblower lawsuit alleging Gov. Jared Polis broke state law by ordering the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment to produce information for a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoena.
The case was the latest evidence that “Polis, at least on some crucial matters, is on team MAGA,” wrote Quentin Young in a June 26 commentary.
“Immigration officials have repeatedly acted in bad faith, yet Polis has chosen to give them the benefit of the doubt,” Young wrote. “This has come at great cost to Coloradans — not just the countless families in the state who might fear that masked government goons at any time could kidnap one of their own off the street, but also the tens of thousands of residents who grieve the erosion of constitutional order and have registered their fear and anger by marching in multiple protests against ICE’s unaccountable behavior.”

He is among nearly 70,000 people in the United States serving a life sentence who were under 25 at .the time of their offense.","James Lukes says he slips in his earbuds and the slow ache of blues fills his ears. Johnnie Taylor’s “Last Two Dollars” crackles through the radio, carrying him back to the dusty fields of his childhood farm in Mississippi. 
Now 73, Lukes says he has to lean on a cane as he shuffles through the prison yard of the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, where he’s spent more than five decades serving a life sentence. At 17, he was charged with the stabbing death of Grace Justice in a convenience store in Waynesboro. At 19, fearful of the death penalty, he pleaded guilty – a decision he has second-guessed for decades’. He maintains he is innocent. 
For the first two years, Lukes was young, angry and refused to believe he’d spend the rest of his life in prison. He quickly realized he needed to do something with his time. He took up playing basketball in the yard, but when his aging bones finally began to protest, he switched to watching television and taking walks. Lukes has taken re-entry courses, has a job and strengthened his faith by attending church regularly. 
Even so, the Mississippi Parole Board has turned him down 28 times since he became eligible for release in 1982. Lukes tried admitting guilt to the Parole Board in hopes of gaining parole, but to no avail.
Lukes is among 1 in 6 prisoners, or roughly 200,000 people in the United States, serving life sentences. Nearly 70,000 people serving life were under 25 at the time of their offense and over 40,000 people are serving prison sentences of 50 years or more. 
According to a Nov. 3 fact sheet from the Mississippi Department of Corrections, roughly 1,700 prisoners in Mississippi are serving life sentences.
In the years since Lukes was sentenced, the legal system has taken a deeper look at how it treats young offenders. 
Twenty-eight states have banned mandatory life sentences for those whose crimes were committed as juveniles, following U.S. Supreme Court decisions that have called the practice unconstitutional. High court rulings in Roper v. Simmons (2005), Graham v. Florida (2010), Miller v. Alabama (2012), Montgomery v. Louisiana (2016), and Jones v. Mississippi (2021) have cited brain science showing people under 25 are less capable of understanding long-term consequences and are more susceptible to peer pressure. 
In April 2021, the conservative-majority court reversed that trend, concluding in a 6-3 decision that courts could sentence juveniles to life without hope of parole, even without a finding that a juvenile was permanently incorrigible, a benchmark the court had set in Miller v. Alabama.
Juveniles don’t have the same rights and responsibilities as adults, advocates say, so they should not suffer the same consequences. 
Yet nearly 500 U.S. prisoners serve life-without-parole sentences for crimes they committed as juveniles. An additional 8,600 people as of 2020 are serving a sentence of life with parole or virtual life sentences for crimes committed as juveniles. 
Lukes reflects back on his teenage years, admitting he used to party too much. Prison has made him grow up, he said. While he is thankful to be alive, Lukes said he wishes he could have started a family of his own.
“When you’re in prison, you cannot do what you want to do. You have to do what they want you to do,” Lukes said. 
Lukes said he especially misses the Southern home cooking of potato salad and fried okra. Growing tired of the prison’s gray meat, he has opted for eating fish and chicken. 
It took Lukes two years to adjust to prison life. In the beginning of his time in prison, he would call home to his mother frequently, said his cousin Bobby Joe Gandy.
“He cried and cried. His mom said he had to confess or they’d execute him,” Gandy said. 
Gandy and his brother decided to go to the store where the crime occurred to question the victim’s husband, who owned the store. Five decades later, Gandy can still recite Ralph Justice’s response to him: “He said, ‘Somebody has to pay for it. I’m not.’” Justice died 28 years ago.
According to Lukes, when he arrived at the store, he saw blood on the ground. Afraid, he turned around and went home. Lukes said he later learned Grace Justice had run out of the store after being stabbed. She died on the highway. 
Having already pleaded guilty, Lukes said claiming innocence to a Parole Board could jeopardize his chances at leaving prison. 
“I was just sad, but I had to come up out of that because I was going to be here a long time,” Lukes said. “I’ll have to do the time no matter what I do, so I might as well focus on something that will help me do my time more easily.” 
For a while, seeing his family got Lukes through prison. He was furloughed for 10 days around Christmastime in 1979 and never violated the terms. He would go home and visit with family, and come back on time. His only write up in prison was for sending a Christmas card to a female guard. 
A change in administration took away Lukes’ furlough in the 1980s. Now, he relies on phone calls and the rare opportunities his family has to make the long drive up to the prison from Wayne County.
Lukes said he misses his family and hopes to go home to be with them. His family has advocated heavily for his release. His only obstacle is the Parole Board. 
A report from FWD.us says Mississippi’s parole laws “are a major driver of the state’s dangerously high prison population.” And with parole rates decreasing, prisoners like Lukes are trapped in a cycle of denials. 
“The Parole Board used to give parole. The last 10 to 15 years, they started cutting back,” Lukes said. “I don’t know why.”
The board has continuously denied Lukes, citing the violent nature of the crime and victim opposition. The Parole Board has not responded to a request for comment.

Former Parole Board Chairman Steve Pickett said 65% of prisoners in Mississippi are eligible for parole today, compared to about 35% a decade ago. The change comes from a push to undo tough-on-crime laws enacted in the mid-1990s, when prisoners convicted of violent offenses were ineligible for parole. 
Despite the increase in eligibility, Pickett, who served on the board nine years, said the rate of parole is lower now than in 2014. A public records request with the Mississippi Department of Corrections shows the parole grant rate for November 2025 as roughly 54%.
“Unfortunately, it’s just easier for people to throw money at corrections than it is to hold the system accountable,” Pickett said. “The general public is far removed from the world of corrections.” 
But it’s not just Mississippi affected by these practices. 
In Michigan, Henry Hill was 16 when his life came crashing down. He was at a park with his friends confronting other kids when the situation quickly escalated. 
Hill admitted to having a gun on him, but was running away from the scene when his friend shot and killed one of the other boys. Despite a sheriff testifying to this in court, Hill was convicted of first-degree murder for aiding and abetting and sentenced to life. 
A mental evaluation found Hill to have the education level of a third-grader and the mentality of a 9-year-old. Nevertheless, Hill was tried as an adult. 
“To be sentenced to the rest of my life in prison for a crime that I actually didn’t commit, I would have been able to understand it if I never got out, if I actually did something, but I didn’t,” Hill said. “And then on the flip side, if I did commit the crime, at what point is enough enough? 
So far, 22 states still sentence juveniles to life without parole. Despite efforts from local lawmakers to abolish juvenile life without parole, states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Mississippi remain stuck. 
Wisconsin state Rep. Todd Novak said he’s hopeful the legislature will pass a bill aimed at abolishing juvenile life without parole. A bill he sponsored in 2023 didn’t have time to pass before the session ended. Had it gone through, he said, it  would have eliminated juvenile life without parole and installed a sentence review mechanism for minors. 
Novak, a Republican, said Wisconsin needs to follow the ruling of Miller v. Alabama, which called the sentencing of juveniles to life in prison “cruel and unusual punishment.” 
Despite these rulings, Novak said he has seen  hesitation from lawmakers who are afraid of how the bill will affect public safety.
“I think the big key is to make sure people understand that if this passes, that all these 17-year-olds that were sentenced, that are now in their 40s to 50s, aren’t just automatically going to get out,” Novak said. 
Novak hopes the bill will address Wisconsin’s current harsh sentencing of juveniles. 
One example comes from a tragic event in 2022. A 10-year-old boy in Milwaukee was charged as an adult for the fatal shooting of his mother after she refused to buy him a VR headset. Wisconsin state laws require children 10 and older to be tried as adults for violent crimes such as homicide. 
In Mississippi, children 13 and older can be charged as adults for serious offenses like murder or armed robbery.
“Mississippi doesn’t see life for how it is,” Lukes said. “If someone did their time, let them go.” 
Republican state Rep. Becky Currie, who chairs the House Corrections Committee, declined to comment on whether there are  plans to amend Mississippi state law to address juvenile life without parole.  
In Michigan, Hill was able to gain parole in 2017, and has since been working at a factory and spending time with family. 
“So many evil people out here in society,” Hill said. “They don’t believe in second chances. They don’t believe in anything until somebody in their household or their family or friends get in a similar situation, then now (they think) we gotta get him out and see things with a different perspective.” 
Lukes is trying to find a pro bono lawyer to help reopen his case. His next hearing is in four years. He’ll be 77 years old.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/19143428/MT-State-Inmate-JamesLukes-FeatImage-01.jpg,,,2025-12-26 06:12:52.310031

Eight of the 11 universities in the state that responded to a request for data reported declines in the number of international students in fall 2025, compared to fall 2024, losing a total of 569 students over the year. That number was offset by the three campuses that gained a total of 120 students.
The University of Maryland, College Park lost the largest number of students, going from about 4,260 in Fall 2024 to about 3,980 in Fall 2025 — a loss of nearly 300 students, or 6.7%. Campus Counts, the university’s enrollment map report, does not provide data from countries with less than five students, meaning the decrease could be larger.
St. Mary’s College of Maryland had the largest decrease of 80% — but that reflected a drop from just five international students in fall 2024 and one in fall 2025.
Maryland Matters reached out to 16 Maryland universities early in the semester. Eleven provided data on the number of international students enrolled at their university, and five were either not traditional campuses, such as the University of Maryland Global Campus, or did not respond with data.
﻿﻿﻿
Total international student enrollment fell from 7,608 to 7,159, out of a total of more than 118,000 students on the 11 campuses this fall.
The declines follow the Trump administration’s ongoing immigration crackdown and revocation of thousands of student visas in spring. Though many of these visas have been restored, tensions remain high as international students grapple with potential challenges concerning their access to education.
Travel bans, visa interview pauses and a lack of support from the Trump administration, in addition to visa terminations, deter students from choosing to study in the United States and increase global competition, said Rachel Banks, the senior director of public policy and legislative strategy at NAFSA, an international educators association.
“We’re in this sort of fraught, anxious, uncertain period — you have students considering other options, especially in the English language space,” Banks said. “They’re high-quality, and welcoming.”
Banks also cited the Trump administration’s proposals to end duration of status by limiting international students’ studies to four years, while the original duration of status policy allows international students to stay in the United States until their studies are complete. Students — especially those in a Ph.D. program — may choose other countries to study due to concerns that they will not finish their program before their duration of status expires, Banks said.
“If there’s that uncertainty hanging over a student’s head, they’re going to think twice — you know — ‘I’m better off going to Canada, or the UK, or even countries that are non-English speaking,’” Banks said.
The University of Maryland, Baltimore County lost more than 200 international students from Fall 2024 to Fall 2025, leaving them with a 23% decrease. While the number of international undergraduate students increased by 22, the number of incoming international graduate students decreased by 234 at UMBC.
“While the decline in incoming international graduate students is concerning, we are optimistic that we will be able to work with international students to navigate the changing environment and continue to be a thriving community of international learners, researchers and teachers,” Yvette Mozie-Ross, the university’s vice provost for enrollment management and planning, said in a statement.
﻿﻿
Frostburg State University saw a 15.2% decrease in international students on campus. This does not account for its partnership with the Hunan University of Technology and Business in Changsha, China, which saw a 24.3%  increase in enrollment.
Salisbury University’s international student enrollment dropped by 11% — a decrease of 10 students. Fall 2025 numbers are the university’s estimate from late September.
Bowie State University, Towson University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore all faced decreases of less than 10% — losing 19, 11 and 12 students, respectively.
“International students are experiencing increased uncertainty in the past year from new federal proposals and policies that have targeted them,” Michael Sandler, the University System of Maryland’s vice chancellor for communications and marketing, said in a statement. “These actions will constrict the pipeline of international talent that contributes to our academic strength and scientific innovation.”
Three universities — the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Morgan State University and Coppin State University — saw increases in international student enrollment. Coppin State University had the largest increase of international students, at 25%, with 16 extra studens. The University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Morgan State University increased their international student enrollment by 8.1% and 9.2%, or 9 and 95 more students, respectively.
Banks emphasized the importance of international talent at universities, especially at large research institutions, such as those that contribute to research in the health care field or make technological advances.
She also noted that international students bring culture to domestic students who may not be able to have their own international experience, and presented worries about culture-focused small businesses that were inspired by international student’s presence.
“International students play an essential role in Maryland’s campus communities, bringing cultural diversity, global perspectives and research talent,” Sanjay Rai, the Maryland Higher Education Commission’s secretary, said in a statement. “While some institutions have seen short-term decreases, Maryland remains committed to being a welcoming destination for students around the world.”

(Photo by Sarah Vogelsong/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s transportation system is massive, with about 129,000 lane miles of roads and roughly 5,900 miles of rail criss-crossing the commonwealth, according to the Virginia Department of Transportation and a 2022 Virginia Statewide Rail Plan.  
There’s always some kind of improvement or expansion underway, leaving drivers and commuters wondering when relief will arrive. 
But before unpacking what projects Virginians can expect in 2026, federal funding looms as a major factor shaping what moves forward — and what does not.
“Probably the biggest change to transportation development for 2026 is the fallout that all of our local and state partners are feeling from federal funding,” said Brantley Tyndall, director at BikeWalkRVA. 
”Federal funding in many ways [will be] reduced or dried up. And in particular the USDOT has been ordered to oppose the funding of bike/ped projects. They are viewed as antagonistic to cars and driving. We think that’s very shortsighted. It’s going to lead to years and years of funding short falls that will be very difficult to fill.”
 Some bright federal funding spots

In November, U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, both Democrats, touted an almost $70 million release of federal grant funding to improve Virginia’s bus and rail systems. Part of that package includes $8.6 million to the Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation system to replace aging vehicles. 
Also included under that $70 million amount will be roughly $10.9 million to the city of Alexandria and $50.3 million to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority to convert buses to low or no emission vehicles. 
The money comes from the Department of Transportation’s 2025-26 fiscal year Low or No Emission program and a FY25 Buses & Bus Facilities Program — all part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed during President Biden’s administration. 
Also in November, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy released a similar press release announcing the same grants, describing them as part of the Trump’s administration’s investment in modernizing America’s transit bus infrastructure. 
 Highlights for 2026 at the General Assembly

With an eye toward 2026, here’s what some government and transportation officials say are on the horizon for the new year. 
Del. Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, chairs the Transportation Committee. She said one of the biggest issues her committee will be taking up next session will involve expanding photo speed enforcement devices, which she said did not become law during the previous session. 
“That was a big conversation last session and an important one,” Delaney said. “I think that we’re going to get a little more into [it] this session because the crime commission just released a study that I had asked them to complete.” Delaney said the report was based on conversations from the last session. 
“We just need to have this looked at a little closer so that we can really drill down on where the issues are, and what legislative solutions are needed to address,” she said. 
Delaney emphasized that some of those issues range from some transportation board members wanting to expand their use to include more locations — which some lawmakers disagree with. At the same time, there’s a debate about whether the current speed enforcement cameras already in place are doing what they’re supposed to be doing. 
“Are they fair? Are they just? And there’s been a lot of concern about their revenue generation,” Delaney said. “There are some localities in the commonwealth that are making thousands of dollars a year in profits off of their speed cameras. And now those funds are going to the general funds, and adding quite a bit of cushion to their budget. It creates, at a minimum, a concern that localities have an incentive to police for profit.”
The Virginia Mercury reported on this bill last session.
 Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel

“The biggest project in the history of the commonwealth is, have you ever heard of a little thing called Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel?” said John Mahaley, principal transportation planner at Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization. 
“If you’ve ever gone to the Outer Banks, you’ve been through there. That project needed to be done 30 years ago. Finally, we were able to get the money to do it.”
Mahaley said drivers will be able to see substantial completion within a year or so. But full completion — and opening the tunnel to traffic — won’t happen for several months after that, because eight express lanes still need to be built on either side of the water to match the tunnel.
 Washington Metro Area

Northern Virginia rail and transit commuters can expect to see line expansions, increased bus service and the installation of modernized bike parking within the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.
“We’re installing new bike lockers across 73 of our stations,” a Metro spokesperson said. “What that does is kind of enable a kind of wider reach for Metrorail stations. Most people might only walk 10 or 15 minutes to get to a Metro station. But if they live 20 or 25 minutes away, it gives people a safe place to park [their] bike.”
Lockers would cost $1 a day and bikes would be protected from rain and snow. Installation of the lockers will be ongoing, with updates posted on WMATA’s website. 
For riders on the Yellow Line, starting Dec. 31, the Yellow Line will extend to Greenbelt, serving destinations in D.C. including Shaw and Columbia Heights, among others. In mid-December, WMATA released a proposed budget that includes rail and service increases on 15% of their routes. If approved by the Metro Board of Directors, the new services would go into effect July 1, 2026.
 Richmond and Henrico eye more Fall Line Trail segments

“We are really looking at more groundbreaking and ribbon-cutting throughout the region,” said BikeWalkRVA’s Tyndall, in areas such as Lakeside, Bryan Park and Kanawha Plaza.

(Photo by Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)As the year ends, we’re taking an opportunity to highlight our favorite stories of 2025. 
The past year saw bitter fights over Pennsylvania’s state budget, drastic changes to federal programs the state relies on, consequential off-year elections, economic turbulence, data centers driving historic demands on the power grid, and history-making lawsuits. 
To state the obvious, it feels like it’s been a year practically unlike any other for news. 
Through it all, we’ve had changes at the Capital-Star too. In February, Tim Lambert became our new editor. Emily Previti joined our team in May to lead a new audio initiative that’s brought our work to radio stations across the commonwealth. We said goodbye to a great reporter, John Cole, and gained a new one in Whitney Downard.
Our team is small — four reporters and an editor. And it can be daunting to keep track of so many moving parts. But when I look at the work my colleagues have done, always centering the ordinary Pennsylvanians impacted by state and federal policy, I’m proud and grateful to be a part of it. 
When a federal shutdown threatened SNAP benefits for some of the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians, Emily Previti went to a part of the state where roughly one in five people rely on the program to keep food on their tables: Northumberland County. Emily not only broke down the complex hurdles the state faced in getting benefits to those who need them, but managed to convey the sense of fear and vulnerability by the people most affected, as well as their efforts to stay resilient.
Peter Hall has been doggedly reporting on what proliferating data centers mean for Pennsylvanians and their electric bills, as the federal government pushes to keep U.S. companies dominant in Artificial Intelligence. I thought this story was a great look at one federal government effort — to keep coal plants online past their planned retirement dates — and what that could mean for Pennsylvanian’s electric bills and the environment.

Whitney Downard joined the Capital-Star in November, moving from one of our sister outlets in Indiana. She hit the ground running, covering one of the most consequential stories to emerge this year: the impacts of expiring subsidies for Pennsylvanians insured through Pennie plans, and the battle in Washington, D.C. over what to do about them. I loved this particular story because it was a human one, centering the stakes for one couple who rely on those subsidies for life-saving care.

As far as my work goes, I’m particularly proud of the stories I did documenting the Trump administration’s attempts to remake the federal workforce, and how it affected the tens of thousands of federal employees in Pennsylvania. While a lot has changed through lawsuits, pushback and changes in strategy in Washington, D.C., I think this early story I did captured the chaos of the early days of DOGE and mass layoffs, with a focus on affected workers and the impacts of the services they provide.

As Congress debates whether to extend the temporary federal subsidies that have helped millions of Americans buy health coverage, a crucial underlying reality is sometimes overlooked: Those subsidies are merely a band-aid covering the often unaffordable cost of health care.
California, Massachusetts, Connecticut and five other states have set caps on health care spending in a bid to rein in the intense financial pressure felt by many families, individuals and employers who every year face increases in premiums, deductibles and other health-related expenses.
Hospitals and other health care providers are citing Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed by President Donald Trump in July, as one more reason to challenge those limits.
The law is expected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade, which mathematically should help the overall health care system meet the caps. But the law is also expected to increase the number of uninsured Americans, mostly Medicaid beneficiaries, by an estimated 10 million people. Health care analysts predict hospitals and other providers will raise prices to cover the double whammy of lost Medicaid revenue and the cost of caring for an influx of newly uninsured patients.
Whether regulators in some states will allow providers to justify higher prices and exceed the spending caps is unclear. Only California and Oregon can penalize providers financially if they fail to meet targets.
“Are we going to say, ‘That’s OK’? Or are we going to say, ‘Well, you exceeded the target. We’re still going to penalize you for that’?” said Richard Pan, a former state lawmaker and a member of the California Office of Health Care Affordability’s board. “That has not yet been decided.”
The California Hospital Association, the industry’s main state lobbying group, filed a lawsuit in October asking a state court to strike down the spending caps, which it argued fail to account for all the cost pressures hospitals face. Those pressures, it said, include an aging, sicker population; the rising cost of labor; expensive advances in medical technology; large capital outlays on required seismic retrofitting; and changes in federal policy, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The hospital group’s lawsuit also asserted that the state affordability office, by hastily imposing ill-considered cost-cutting targets, was undermining its other key mission of improving health care access, quality and equity.
California’s affordability office last year set a five-year target to cap statewide spending growth, starting at 3.5% in 2025 and declining to 3% by 2029. The annual caps apply to a wide range of health care entities, including hospitals, medical groups, insurers and other payers.
Earlier this year, it imposed much lower spending growth caps — starting at 1.8% in 2026 and declining to 1.6% by 2029 — for seven “high-cost” hospitals.
“The spending caps set by politically appointed bureaucrats could force cuts that result in many Californians traveling farther for care, facing longer emergency room wait times, experiencing more overcrowding and losing access to critical services,” Carmela Coyle, the hospital association’s president and CEO, said in an October press release.
The California attorney general’s office, which will represent the affordability agency, has not yet filed a response to the hospital group’s complaint and did not respond to a request for comment.
Hospitals’ pushback
California is not the only state taking a close look at hospital prices, which are widely considered a primary driver of health care costs.
“States, armed with information that points to payments to hospitals as a driver of what is way beyond affordable commercial premiums, have begun to take increasingly targeted actions focused on commercial hospital prices,” said Michael Bailit, founder of the Needham, Massachusetts-based consultancy Bailit Health, which has advised multiple states, including California, on ways to tame health care spending. “It is not surprising that the hospital industry is going to oppose such state actions.”
In its lawsuit, the California Hospital Association said the affordability office’s own report showed that pharmaceutical and insurance companies are largely responsible for high costs.
Hospitals in some states with cost growth limits, including Connecticut and Massachusetts, have expressed objections similar to the ones raised in the California lawsuit. They could follow their counterparts in California if their lawsuit succeeds, said Peter Lee, who led California’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, Covered California, for over a decade and is now a senior scholar at Stanford Medicine’s Clinical Excellence Research Center.
Lee said the work of California’s affordability office and similar agencies in other states is just about the only systemwide effort being made to cut health care costs. They are basically saying, “‘Look, health care is taking money away from education, it is taking money away from the environment, it is taking money away from everything in the public sector, and in the private sector it is taking money away from wages,’” he said. “‘We don’t know how you, the health system, are going to do it, but it is your job not just to provide quality but to lower costs. Here’s the target.’”
To be sure, achieving the cost savings that California and those other states are seeking is no easy lift. It will ultimately require persuading large, financially powerful players that compete fiercely for health care dollars to adopt a different mindset and begin cooperating to reduce costs instead. And that, in many cases, will mean lower revenue.
But the status quo, as many people know all too well, means continued financial pain for millions.
In early 2020, Estevan Rodriguez, a bartender at California’s Monterey Beach Hotel, had surgery for a staph infection in his leg. The bill came to nearly $168,000. His insurance paid most of it, but he still owed $5,665, which took him two years to pay, more than $200 every month. “It may not be a lot to some people, but it was a lot to me,” Rodriguez said.
He said he dropped his Hulu subscription, switched to a lower-cost cellphone, and got cheaper car insurance. He started going to food banks rather than the grocery store, he said, and had a lot less time with his kids, because he was constantly working to pay off the hospital bill.
Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula, where Rodriguez had his surgery, is one of the seven hospitals identified by California’s affordability office as high-cost. A study by the office attributed high hospital prices in Monterey County to a lack of market competition “rather than higher operating costs or superior quality of care.”
The Monterey hospital referred a request for comment about its “high-cost” designation to the California Hospital Association. CHA spokesperson Jan Emerson-Shea declined to comment beyond the language of the lawsuit and Coyle’s press release statement.
Reduced competition
Health care analysts worry the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will reduce market competition even further by stressing already weak hospitals, leading some to shut services, merge with larger health systems, or close. One study estimates 338 rural hospitals are at risk of closing nationwide.
Less competition, in addition to fewer Medicaid dollars and an increase in uninsured patients, will only strengthen the incentive of health systems with the requisite market clout to raise their commercial prices, increasing premiums for employers and individuals.
“We think commercial prices will continue to increase as health care providers, and hospitals in particular, will seek to preserve or increase their revenue,” said Rachel Block, a program officer at the Milbank Memorial Fund, a foundation that focuses on health equity.
That in turn could pose a challenge to state affordability regulators tasked with overseeing compliance with growth targets for health care spending.
California’s affordability office is required to consider mitigating factors, including changes in federal and state laws. But some of its board members have expressed skepticism about letting hospitals offset Medicaid losses with higher commercial prices.
“There’s a lot of talk about using HR 1 and other federal policies as an excuse to raise prices on commercial payers,” Ian Lewis, an affordability office board member and policy director for UNITE HERE Local 2, a hospitality workers union in the Bay Area, said at the agency’s July board meeting, referring to the One Big Beautiful Bill. “There’s no more blood to be squeezed from this stone.”

Little things
Small essays on simple subjects.
Read the archive.

What about a towel? How many times do we turn it over and across? How small do we make that resulting square? Your mother or father or grandmother likely had strong opinions on the subject, perhaps linked to cupboard size. 
The most challenging items to fold are, of course, shirts. No method of folding shirts makes sense. I learned to fold the shirt vetically and reach both of the arms out as though the wearer was serving a volleyball. (Sometimes the arms naturally reach backward, as though the wearer was being arrested.) Then I folded the arms back toward the shirt and bisect the entire thing.
If you think that description’s confusing, try folding some shirts!
We don’t really have a vocabulary for a practice so basic and ingrained. We learn how to fold them, then we do it for the rest of our lives. Perhaps we squabble over who tackles the next batch. But we don’t focus on the folding itself. The knowledge stays locked inside us like the half-remembered melody of a song, activated when we hear the tune or pick up the rainbow sweater vest.
Clothes don’t have to be folded. You can always put them on a hangers. No item of clothing works better on a hanger than a long-sleeved shirt. A coat comes in a close second because there’s really no other place to put it except a hook, and that stretches out the back of its collar.
You can also leave them in a pile on the floor. This method, while supremely efficient and easy to understand, has faced rejection from mothers in law and neatness-obsessed roommates the world over. I’m not sure what their problem is.
For a brief time, I dry cleaned my clothes. When I moved back to Kansas to work at The Topeka Capital-Journal, I decided that I was going to wear suits every day to work. I like this as a concept: the suit works marvelously as a uniform suggesting formality and elegance. I don’t know that it worked, but I like to imagine that it did.
The suits had to be maintained, however, which meant regular trips to the dry cleaner a few blocks from my home. (Post pandemic, that branch of the cleaner has closed.) I loved the concept of outsourcing the entire operation — cleaning, folding and hanging.
The suits didn’t last. We were raising a kindergartner at the time, and the house was usually turned upside down for one reason or another. Career changes came soon after. I blinked a couple of times and there I was in the laundry room again, taking out a fresh batch of warm clothes and folding them one by one.
There are, I suppose, worse ways to spend a weekend afternoon. And I can always go back to the suits.

Property taxes and gun rights, meanwhile, have emerged as issues likely to dominate the 2026 legislative session, which kicks off in a little more than two weeks.
Donald Trump endorses Byron Donalds (Feb. 20)
With Ron DeSantis now in lame-duck status, one of the biggest stories in Florida politics was to whom would the Republicans run to succeed him. While names like Matt Gaetz, Ashley Moody, Casey DeSantis, Jimmy Patronis, and Jeanette Nuñez were bandied about early on, many of them became no longer viable for various reasons as the year progressed.
Byron Donalds was among those always in the mix, but his candidacy went into the stratosphere after President Trump endorsed him in a Truth Social post, before the Naples Republican had even formally entered the contest. “RUN, BYRON, RUN!” POTUS wrote and, less than a week later, Donalds announced his candidacy.
Since then, he’s never looked back in the polls and, with more than $40 million raised to date, is dwarfing both his Republican and Democratic opponents. Can any candidate catch him? That’ll be the story of the year in Florida politics in 2026.
The Hope Florida story breaks (April 11)
The Tallahassee bureau for the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald broke the Hope Florida story during the middle of the legislative session. If nothing else, the affair amplified the already cold war brewing between Gov. Ron DeSantis’ office and the Florida House of Representatives.
The story reported that just weeks after the administration steered $10 million from a Medicaid legal settlement to the Hope Florida Foundation — the entity led by Casey DeSantis designed to connect Floridians in need with government resources, nonprofits, the private sector, and religious organizations — in the fall of 2024.
The foundation moved those funds to two nonprofit groups (Save Our Society from Drugs, or SOS, and Securing Florida’s Future). Those groups then routed those funds to Keep Florida Clean, a political action committee created to beat the proposed constitutional amendment to legalize recreational cannabis in the state.

The story electrified the Capitol, and was immediately denounced as a political hit job by DeSantis designed to hurt him and the first lady. Hearings were held in the House of Representatives, and in October a Leon County grand jury began investigating the allegations. No indictments or final reports have been issued.
DeSantis appoints Ashley Moody to the U.S. Senate (Jan. 16); Blaise Ingoglia as CFO (July 16); Jay Collins as lieutenant governor (Aug. 12)
Call it the DeSantis Legacy Project. While the governor has just a year left in office, he’s been able to appoint people close to him to positions of power in the state that could shape Floridians’ lives long after he moves out of the Governor’s Mansion.

The governor undoubtedly had many worthy Republicans he could have appointed to replace Marco Rubio in the U.S. Senate. He chose a close ideological partner in Attorney General Ashley Moody. He then quickly replaced her in the Cabinet position with his former chief of staff, James Uthmeier.
He took much more time before selecting two of his then-closest allies in the Florida Senate — Blaise Ingoglia and Jay Collins — to succeed Jimmy Patronis as CFO and Jeanette Nuñez as his lieutenant governor, respectively.
DeSantis and Ingoglia have been singing off the same sheet music in the past half-year in their campaign to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes in Florida in 2026. And while just as conservative as Moody, Uthmeier has embraced picking fights that capture headlines — not a bad strategy as he goes before voters for the first time in his life in 2026. Whether his involvement in the Hope Florida saga lifts his candidacy next year remains to be seen.
And Collins? When DeSantis named him as LG in August in Tampa, the governor hailed him as “the Chuck Norris of Florida politics.” Political observers speculated it was a matter of when, not if, the governor would endorse him to take on Donalds for governor next year.
That DeSantis endorsement hasn’t happened, however, and despite the millions of dollars in TV ads that aired over the past month on college football Saturdays and the Sunday morning political talk shows, Collins apparently still wasn’t ready to announce his candidacy at the end of the year. Will he do so in 2026?
Immigration (Jan. 7)
No governor was more excited about Donald Trump’s campaign pledge for mass deportations during his second go-round at the White Hose than Ronald Dion DeSantis.
Screenshot of AI-generated image posted on the official White House X account on July 1, 2025, promoting the “Alligator Alcatraz” name given to the immigrant detention center in the Everglades.
The governor surprised state lawmakers when he said just days into the New Year that he wanted to call a special session on immigration ahead of the regular legislative session.
“We’ve done a lot. We passed a major bill in 2023, but I think that there needs to be some additional legislation to help complement the federal government’s now–newfound appreciation to stop illegal immigration, and to hold people accountable. … We need to be prepared to act. I don’t think that you can wait until April or May to do something in that respect,” he said.
That led to the first of what would be many clashes with the Florida House and Speaker Danny Perez, when the Perez declaring he saw no need to hold a special session just then. Senate President Ben Albritton also initially rejected the call.
“It is completely irresponsible to get out ahead of any announcements President Trump will make, especially when uninformed or ill-timed state action could potentially impair or impede the success of President Trump’s forthcoming efforts to end illegal immigration, close our borders, and protect the sovereignty of our nation,” Albritton and Perez wrote in response.
Ultimately, the Legislature and DeSantis did come together on an anti-illegal immigration package in mid-February that included a provision making it a misdemeanor for undocumented immigrants over age 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida “after entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.”
That measure was blocked by a federal judge in Miami, who later found Attorney General James Uthmeier in contempt of court for referring to the court’s order blocking the law as illegitimate and unlawful.
The state made international news in the summer with the unveiling of a federal detention center in the Everglades dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz.” In December, Amnesty International said in a report that facility as well as the federal Krome North Services Processing Center may have violated international standards by imposing conditions that could amount to torture of detainees,
The Florida Legislature passes and Gov. DeSantis signs HB 1205, making it significantly harder to pass citizen-led constitutional amendments (May 2)

“This is the most important bill that we will be hearing in this chamber,” Democratic Senate Leader Lori Berman said about HB 1205 when the bill came before the chamber during the last week of the regularly scheduled legislative session earlier this year. “And as you’ve heard, it’s going to greatly restrict the access of the citizens of the state of Florida to be able to address the system.”
The bill was driven by the zeal of Gov. DeSantis, who announced at the beginning of the year that it was a top legislative priority for him. As the Phoenix reported at the time, the governor and his fellow Republicans in the Legislature argued that the measure was needed to combat signature petition fraud that they alleged had been exposed last year in the campaigns to pass constitutional amendments regarding legalizing recreational marijuana and abortion rights.
Floridians narrowly failed to pass the two constitutional amendments that DeSantis fiercely opposed. The effects have become apparent this year, with groups that had hoped to place amendments on the ballot throwing in the towel because of the tougher requirements. And it’s also threatened a new effort by Trulieve and others in the medical marijuana industry in Florida to get a new constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2026.
Democratic Senate Leader Jason Pizzo quits the Florida Democratic Party (April 24)
It was another difficult year for the Florida Democratic Party, which faces a more than 1.4 million voter registration disadvantage to the Republican Party at year end.
Pizzo’s stunned his colleagues and the political establishment in Tallahassee when he declared on the Senate floor that he was done with the Democratic Party, proclaiming it was “dead.” “But there are good people that can resuscitate it, but they don’t want it to be me.”
Two months after his departure, Chair Nikki Fried declared that “our message is s***,” during the Florida Democratic Party’s Leadership Blue gala in Broward County. “Our brand is broken. But quitting, hiding, waiting, or whining will not fix it. What will? Showing up.”
So, the question is going into the 2026 cycle is, will Florida Democrats show up at the ballot box a year from now? And can that make a difference? Nationally, the depression surrounding the party following Donald Trump’s election over Kamala Harris has appeared to dissipate, based on the results of the few major elections this fall. But as was the case going back to 2018 during Trump’s first reign in office, will a “blue wave” even make it to the Sunshine State?
Democrats were heartened in the spring when their two candidates running in special congressional elections lost by “only” 15 points in Florida’s First Congressional District and 14 points in the Sixth District.

The Sixth District seat was won by Republican Randy Fine over Democrat Josh Weil, who stunned political observers by raising more than $15 million in a race that the GOP incumbent in November of 2024 (Mike Waltz) had won by 33 points.
Weil announced in June that would run for the party’s nomination for U.S. Senate in 2026 against Moody, and boasted that his team would raise $10 million on its own for voter registration efforts in Florida leading up to the 2026 election, with an emphasis on Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. Unfortunately for him and the party, Weil announced a little over a month later that he was dropping out of the race because of health concerns.
The party closed out the year on an up note, with Eileen Higgins becoming the first registered Democrat to become mayor of Miami since the 1990s. Fried notably praised Democrats, Republicans, and independents for Higgins’ big victory, because the party is going to need those voters not registered with the party to make an impact at the ballot box next year.
Former GOP U.S. Rep. David Jolly and Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings now look to be in a competitive battle for the party’s nomination for governor in 2026.
Local governments and citizens express revulsion towards Senate Bill 180 (Sept. 29)
The latest blow to local growth management laws in Florida was passage of Senate Bill 180 earlier this year. The measure effectively freezes local land-development regulations and comprehensive plans through October 2027. It didn’t generate much controversy during the legislative session, because for most of its movement through committees it was perceived as a thoughtful measure to help local residents recover from the devastating hurricanes Helene and Milton in the fall of 2024.

Calling it the “largest incursion into local home rule authority” since adoption of the Florida Constitution in 1968, 25 local governments have gone to court to try to block the law that restricts local governments from regulating development.
At the heart of the anger of local governments are two specific parts of the bill that freeze cities and counties from adopting land-use regulations considered “more restrictive or burdensome” than those in place before the recent (or future) hurricanes, even if the changes are unrelated to disaster recovery.
During a Manatee County legislative delegation meeting in Bradenton in late October, several citizens blasted state lawmakers, saying they had “betrayed” them in voting for the legislation.
Pinellas County Republican Sen. Nick DiCeglie said his motivation for the legislation was to ensure that local governments prepare and respond better to natural disasters than they did a year ago. In December, he filed a bill (SB 840) to scale back some the effects of SB 180 that will be heard in the 2026 session.

Will Florida become the first state in the country to eliminate property taxes?
That’s the scenario that Gov. DeSantis appears determined to to leave as one of his most important policy achievements before he leaves the governor’s mansion for parts unknown.
The governor made it clear during the 2025 legislative session that he’d prefer Floridians with homesteaded properties receive a tax break at the same time that the House and Senate was debating how big of a sales tax the state could afford as an alternative.
His advocacy picked up steam after he appointed close ally Blaise Ingoglia to replace Jimmy Patronis as the state’s chief financial officer. Ingoglia travelled around the state with his Florida DOGE (later rebranded as FAFO) team to accuse some of the biggest (and not so big) local governments in the state that they had indulged in millions of dollars of wasted spending — in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars.
Ingoglia’s efforts were a prebuttal to expected complaints from local officials that a major reduction in property tax revenues would deplete vital services for their residents. “I think there is more than enough room to cut local budgets, probably by the amount of 15%, and not even worry about taking away any money for essential services,” he said during a debate at the University of South Florida in November.
Reducing or removing property taxes can only be done by the public via a constitutional amendment. The question is, how many bills to do the job? DeSantis said at a press conference in Tampa in late October that he wanted only one to go before the voters next year. He blasted the eight separate proposals (including seven resolutions that would be constitutional amendments) proposed by the Florida House as “milquetoast,” with “not one proposal that would get people excited about.”
House members say they’re still waiting for DeSantis to offer any specific language for property tax relief.
Florida appeals court declares the state’s ban on open carry unconstitutional (Sept. 10)
For having the reputation as being one of the least regulated states in the country when it comes to firearms (“The gunshine state,” anyone?) Florida had been one of just a handful of states that banned the open carrying of firearms in the country.
No longer.
A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal ruled in September that the 1987 law banning open carry was unconstitutional — a ruling cheered by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
“Our office fully supports the Court’s decision,” he said on X. “This is a big win for the Second Amendment rights of Floridians.”
Days after the ruling, Uthmeier said that reinterpreting the law based on the court’s ruling was “not the cleanest solution and there’s likely cleanup that’s going to be needed by the Legislature.”
An implementing bill is likely, but Second Amendment advocates say they’re concerned about how far that might go.
“Members of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” Logan Edge of that organization told the Phoenix.
“The Legislature remains a hostile opponent against gun rights and open carry but, after many years of pushback, gun owners gained a massive victory in the courts,” he added. “We will make sure every Tallahassee legislator hears from gun rights activists and oppose any effort to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.”
Congressional redistricting (Dec. 4)
In advance of the 2020 U.S. Census, the state’s congressional delegation breakdown was 16 Republicans and 11 Democrats.
Gov. Ron DeSantis’ own congressional redistricting map (later declared by the courts to be constitutional) resulted in the GOP gaining four additional seats, taking a 20-8 lead (the state was awarded an additional seat in the Census).
Now, after President Donald Trump called on Texas to redraw its congressional districts to guarantee him an additional five Republican seats as he fears losing the House to the Democrats in 2026, other states have been following suit, with the Sunshine State only now beginning such efforts.
Gov. DeSantis and the Legislature appear to be in lockstep, with the only dispute so far being the timing: The House wants to come up with a new map by time the regular legislative session ends in mid-March, while the governor and now the Senate want them to wait and focus on the matter during a special session later in the spring.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/0-9-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 00:11:47.334037

Spend a morning with Spike at Royal Farms. For more than six years, he has stocked shelves, organized inventory, cleaned and supported his team in ways that help the whole store run smoothly. His enthusiasm lifts the people around him and quietly shapes the experience of everyone who walks through the door.
Stories like Spike’s are powerful examples of what can happen when businesses open their doors to people with developmental disabilities. Employing individuals with disabilities strengthens the workplace in real and measurable ways. It strengthens our communities as well. Yet far too many people with disabilities still struggle to find meaningful employment.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for people with disabilities is twice the rate of those without disabilities. Only a quarter of working-age adults with disabilities participates in the labor force, compared with nearly 70% of those without disabilities.
Many people with developmental disabilities want to work but never receive the opportunity. Fewer than 20% have a paid job in an integrated setting, and among those who do not, nearly half say they want one.

Employers play a vital role in closing this gap.
Why employers should hire people with disabilities
When they embrace the strengths of people with disabilities, the benefits reach far beyond the individual employee. Businesses report that team members with disabilities are dedicated, dependable and eager to contribute. Many employers tell us that welcoming these employees brings renewed purpose to the workplace. Staff morale improves, teamwork deepens and customers notice the difference.
Research supports this experience. A study from the University of Toronto found that businesses that employ people with disabilities see financial benefits, including cost savings from higher retention. They also experience stronger employee and customer loyalty, as well as meaningful improvements in workplace culture.
People with disabilities bring unique perspectives and thoughtful problem solving. When they are part of a team, colleagues often become more mindful of how to make their work environment stronger and more welcoming for everyone.
Creating a supportive workplace for people with developmental disabilities does not need to be complicated. A few guiding practices can make a meaningful impact.

Train managers so they understand how to support workers with disabilities and when accommodations may be needed. The Job Accommodation Network is a helpful resource.
Provide reasonable accommodations. Many are simple or no cost, and most employers report that accommodations are far less expensive than expected.
Educate staff so everyone understands the organization’s commitment to supporting workers with disabilities and recognizes the value they bring.
Encourage connection among employees, which may include peer groups or informal support networks.
Understand the Americans with Disabilities Act so the workplace remains accessible and equitable.

Disability employment in action
Many local employers have seen firsthand how powerful this can be. Hannah Olexy works at Moonlit Acres Retreat Farm as a peer advocate specialist. She creates workshops and programs for people in the neurodivergent community, from gardening activities to health and safety training. Assistant Director Todd Bonney says, “Not only did we realize she can provide service, but in many ways she is doing it better than we do.” Hannah brings insight, compassion and leadership to everything she does.
Now is the time to make sure our workplaces reflect the belief that everyone has something valuable to offer. Creating employment opportunities for people with disabilities is not only the right thing to do. It strengthens businesses, builds healthier communities, and helps people discover purpose and pride in their work. When we open doors for others, we all move forward together.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/AdobeStock_387670603-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-26 09:57:31.444356

The federal funds covering the cost of the move came through this fall, but for several months earlier this year, it was unclear whether that would happen.
In 2023, a severe storm damaged Ayer Hall’s HVAC system and a few floors where many of the center’s archives and cultural artifacts are stored. In November 2024, the Margaret Walker Center staff applied for a $317,039 federal grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to cover relocating the historic materials while Ayer Hall is renovated. IMLS is a small federal agency that supports museums, libraries and cultural institutions across the country.
Then in March, President Donald Trump issued an executive order requiring the IMLS and other federal agencies to scale down to “the minimum presence.” At IMLS, nearly 70 employees  were placed on administrative leave at the small federal agency, which supports museums, libraries and cultural institutions across the country.
When the IMLS team was placed on leave, the Margaret Walker Center staff was left in limbo about their grant. After nearly six months of uncertainty, the center received its IMLS grant in September. 
“We couldn’t be more grateful,” said Angela Stewart, an archivist at the center. 
The Margaret Walker Center funding will also help cover the cost of professional development workshops with a focus on boosting museum operations and management.

Maintaining cultural institutions like the Margaret Walker Center requires funding that goes beyond the price of admission or local tax dollars, said Sen. Hillam Frazier, a Democrat from Jackson and a 1974 JSU alumnus. In states like Mississippi, where access to resources and support for cultural institutions may be meager, funding has been essential in preserving state history, he said.  
“It is a godsend to get this money, the tools and resources for an institution like the Margaret Walker Center at Jackson State,” Frazier said. “Museums and libraries are sometimes the only access to education that people may have where they can further explore their curiosity and areas of interests, as well as know their history.”
The importance of the history
After the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Margert Walker Alexander, an accomplished poet and writer, founded the Institute for the Study of the History, Life, and Culture of Black People at what was then Jackson State College. 
At the time, universities and colleges across the country were adding Black history departments, courses and programs to their curriculum as a result of student activism from the Civil Rights and Black Power movements. 
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who knew Walker and attended Tougaloo College in the 1970s with her son Sigismund Walker Alexander, remembers admiring her “spirit and commitment to writing about Black people and Black life in the Deep South.” Walker was a pivotal figure in the movement to establish Black intellectual and academic studies,  he said. 
“She aspired for the institute to reflect her passion as an academic, artist and activist, and the university commended her preservation efforts,” said Thompson, a 1972 JSU alumnus.
When Walker retired in 1979 after 30 years as an English professor at Jackson State, the university honored her by renaming the cultural center after her. 
The center is also home to important collections and memorabilia from notable Black Mississippians such as a collection from William Lamson an architect and analyst for court cases dealing with school desegregation, voting rights, housing discrimination and judicial redistricting. Another example is a collection from Rod Paige, the first Black U.S.  secretary of education who was also an interim president of JSU, That collection includes memoranda, reports, speeches, scrapbooks and papers reflecting on Paige’s role during George W. Bush’s presidency. Paige died Dec. 9.
“There’s so much history of Black people in Mississippi that is in danger of being lost, so it’s important to keep funding and supporting these institutions to preserve her legacy but also the works associated with it,” Thompson said. 
Stewart, the archivist, said it was important to Walker to provide space for people to “learn how to think and be curious” rather than being told how to think. The importance of preserving archival work at the center helps engage visitors and students in research, scholarship and history. 
“We have to know who we are and where we’re going,” Stewart said. “That’s the importance of history. And archives do that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/13120146/3X0A4990.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:56:52.975813

(Hongjie Han/Getty Images)This time of year is when Anna Walker, who directs the Western Firefly Project in New Mexico, gets a few false reports in her inbox.
Well-meaning people, mostly in Albuquerque and other urban areas, see flashes of yellow light dancing through trees and become convinced they’ve seen a firefly. What they actually see is a laser beam that’s part of a high-tech Christmas display.
“They project light up into trees and make the lights kind of move around,” Walker told Source New Mexico. “Those fool a lot of people.”

False reports are one common challenge for the community science initiative chasing the elusive New Mexico firefly. Another is convincing the public that fireflies exist here at all. Christy Bills, an entomologist at the University of Utah, started the Utah Firefly Project 11 years ago, partially in response to the “assumption that we don’t have any” fireflies in the West, she told Source NM. Back then, she and a colleague launched a project with a website that solicited firefly sightings from the public and got a flood of responses. 
“We realized they were everywhere. They’re all over the state, and so we just kept tracking them and getting repeat confirmation about certain populations,” she said. “But the project expanded outside of Utah, because we were getting reports from Idaho and Wyoming and Nevada and Colorado and New Mexico.”
Bills decided to partner with institutions in other states to help verify reports. That’s how she met Walker, an invertebrate species survival specialist at the New Mexico BioPark Society. Walker was eager to join the effort, she said, partially because she didn’t know fireflies existed in Western states, apart from old references in museum collections. 
“That’s what drew me to this firefly journey, was that such a charismatic insect could exist without most people even knowing about it, because they haven’t been studied hardly at all,” she said. “Pretty much every time you go out into the field, there’s like a discovery waiting to be found.”
Fireflies are here if you know where to look, Bills and Walker insist. Since launching in New Mexico in 2021, Walker has confirmed 13 firefly occurrences from more than 100 reports. She’s also collected 27 specimens that she entered into the collection at the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico. 
According to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, which touts itself as an open access database of “types of life on Earth,” four confirmed sightings of Photinus pyralis, the Common Eastern Firefly, have occurred in New Mexico since 2021. They all occurred between 8 p.m. and midnight in late June or early July in Northeastern New Mexico, specifically in Guadalupe, San Miguel and the border between Mora and Harding counties, according to the database. 
That is just one of at least 13 species of firefly that Walker says exist in New Mexico, though only a four or five are of the flickering, flying variety. Others are glow worms, and others are “dark fireflies” that never bioluminesce but share common ancestry with flashing fireflies, Walker said.

Of the 13 confirmed occurrences, three are “state records,” Walker said, which means she made the first confirmed sighting of a particular species in New Mexico, and they are still investigating whether several of the sightings are of new species.
But even as Walker sets out to confirm sightings and make new discoveries, she fears climate change is drying up the wetlands that nourish fireflies. For example, she got reports of fireflies in Gallinas Creek near Las Vegas but she was unable to find any after the Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire occurred there in early 2022.  
“I worry that declines due to drought and forest fires may be responsible for our inability to find these populations,” she said. 
But she said will continue tracking down reports of fireflies, even if she’s initially skeptical, because of what happened right after she joined Bills’ project. 
Back on July 3, 2021, Walker set out to confirm a sighting of the Common Eastern Firefly, her fourth or fifth outing. The species  had never been reliably confirmed in New Mexico since the 1920s. The report came from someone in Mills Canyon, which rises on either side of the Rio Grande north of Roy, New Mexico, far from light pollution and under a wide open starry night.
Hundreds of fireflies greeted her, she said. It’s the biggest population she’s ever seen in New Mexico. 
“I don’t even know how to describe what the feeling was. I think it was just, like, awe, with nature again. You experience it a lot when you’re a kid, and then as you get older you forget that nature can be so awe-inspiring,” she said. “It just felt so magical, really.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/firefliesGettyImages-1437427544-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:12:42.303963

Coastal Carolina University is asking state legislators to set aside $390,000 annually in the state budget to start the Teal Works Program at the Horry County college. And Lander University in Greenwood is asking for $500,000 to add stipends to its existing internship program.

“Teal Works removes financial barriers and equips students with the skills and experiences necessary to thrive in the workforce,” Coastal wrote in its budget request. “The program will strengthen the talent pipeline, support local and regional economic development, and increase CCU’s visibility as a leader in preparing students for South Carolina’s workforce needs.”
Coastal plans to start out with $3,000 stipends for 75 students to cover a 10- to 12-week summer internship. Students who go to work in rural or underserved areas of the state can apply for an additional $1,000, according to the school’s budget ask.
The aid is not a loan. Students don’t pay it back. And it’s on top of what the companies hiring the students as interns might be paying.
By year five, the school hopes to get to 250 students, supported through a combination of state, federal and private funds.
Coastal will focus on placing students in high-demand industries, such as health care, education, information technology, manufacturing, agribusiness and hospitality.
The “Experience Your Education” Program has been operating at Lander for about 15 years, according to the university’s website.
Historically, participating students have received academic credits. Those who earn 120 credit hours can graduate with the Golden EYE Award. But now the school hopes to pay students who participate to help cover travel, meals and other summer living expenses.
“Internships provide invaluable educational experiences for college students, and satisfy course credit,” spokesman Graham Duncan said. “Yet, without financial support, many students often feel that these experiences are out of reach.”
Duncan also touted Lander’s record of students staying in South Carolina to work after graduation — 82% of the school’s alumni call the Palmetto State home.
“At Lander, we take seriously our responsibility to educate today’s students for tomorrow’s workforce,” Duncan said. “We believe this is a sound investment for South Carolina.”
Lander’s proposal did not give a dollar amount for its stipends or specify how many it plans to offer.
At Clemson University, the career center had been helping about 30 students each summer find internships. But in summer 2024, with an influx of state funding, that number jumped to more than 400 students, Neil Burton, the executive director of Clemson’s Center for Career and Professional Development previously told the SC Daily Gazette.
State stipends help nearly 2,100 SC college students land internships

“The challenge for a lot of students is there’s an upfront cost they think they can’t afford,” Britton said. “Paying the upfront deposit on an apartment while you’re buying a suit and trying to figure out how to get a car to go there may seem like minor things for a lot of folks. But for a lot of students, it’s prohibitive.”
USC also offers $3,000 to students who participate in internships within high-demand industries in the state, such as aerospace, automotive, energy, financial services, healthcare, insurance and manufacturing.
More than 1,750 students across the USC college system have participated, according to a statement from the university. The school awarded more than $5.2 million in stipends.
Updated numbers were not immediately available from Clemson. But as of last January, the Upstate school had given out a little less than $2 million to 1,151 students, according to a previous report from the university. 
Until this year, the programs at USC and Clemson were funded with surplus proceeds from the state lottery.
For the state budget that started in July, legislators approved $2 million for USC and $4 million for Clemson from the state tax collections. Those recurring dollars will continue in future budgets indefinitely.
USC is now asking for an additional $2.5 million annually to bring the program back up to previous funding levels.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Co-op-Industry-Expo_051224_SL_0018-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 09:12:42.303963

California schools are likely to face continuing threats of funding cuts and more uncertainty.


Last year was tumultuous for California K-12 schools and their 5.8 million students — at least at the federal level. President Donald Trump slashed funding to schools, set about dismantling the U.S. Department of Education and launched an immigration crackdown that left countless families afraid to send their children to school.
The state pushed back against these moves, successfully fighting the funding cuts in court. But the uncertainty continues as the White House seeks ways to reshape public K-12 education. After-school programs, teacher training and Head Start are among the programs that remain at risk of funding cuts. Congress cut extra funding to rural schools last year, but advocates are hopeful it will return in 2026.
But there were bright spots in 2025. Test scores surged after years of post-pandemic malaise. Reading and math achievement still lags behind pre-COVID-19 levels, but education officials welcomed the improvements after years of investments in tutoring and student wellbeing.
Transitional kindergarten expanded to include all 4-year-olds. Now nearly every district in California offers free, play-based classes for children to learn their A-B-Cs and 1-2-3s and otherwise prepare for the rigors of elementary school. The expansion gives California the largest early education system in the country.
In hopes of boosting reading scores, California also rolled out a mandatory dyslexia screener and passed a law to overhaul literacy instruction. The new curriculum doesn’t go into effect until 2028, but many schools are already implementing and using the dyslexia screener to get extra help to children who struggle with reading disorders.
California also passed a law creating an Office of Civil Rights, intended to eliminate discrimination in K-12 schools, especially antisemitism. The new law, which stems from a surge in antisemitic incidents statewide, is expected to provide more transparency and accountability in how schools handle discrimination complaints.
Looking ahead
Immigration raids, federal funding volatility and culture war issues are expected to continue playing out in K-12 schools next year. The fate of the U.S. Department of Education will also affect schools, especially special education and civil rights. 
California’s budget outlook is murky, as well. Gov. Gavin Newsom has largely spared K-12 schools from funding cuts the past few years, but that may change this year as the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office predicts an $18 billion deficit. 
On the academic front, schools are expecting to see reading and math scores improve as the state rolls out new curricula. Politically, voters will be electing a new State Superintendent of Public Instruction to replace Tony Thurmond, who terms out in 2026 after eight years in the job. A slew of candidates have already jumped in the race, including former Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/052125_Paradise-School-Mental-Health_MG_CM_17.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-25 08:56:21.006924

In their approach to higher education, Trump and Newsom shared one thing in common this year: reducing funding for colleges and universities. The federal government pulled back research funds while the state, facing a deficit, imposed austerity measures on the UC and Cal State University systems.


Money is power. If California’s public colleges and universities didn’t already know that, they certainly learned it this year. 
Though the U.S. Department of Justice launched numerous high-profile complaints against California schools — allegations of antisemitism at University of California campuses and concerns about a transgender athlete at San Jose State, to name a few — the most punishing consequences came from federal funding cuts. In its crusade to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion programs, the Trump administration cut funding for UC campuses, including research into dementia, coronavirus vaccines and HIV prevention.
UCLA bore the brunt of Trump’s ire. The Trump administration withheld over $500 million in UCLA research grants this year because of allegations that the campus wasn’t addressing antisemitism related to protests over the war in Gaza. The administration then demanded that UCLA pay a $1.2 billion settlement and forego certain academic freedoms in order to get the money back. In separate lawsuits, a U.S. district judge ordered the Trump administration to stop withholding funds and later said the proposed settlement was “coercive and retaliatory.”
It’s just one of several court rulings ordering the Trump administration to return research money to UCLA or other UC campuses. 
But the bulk of funding for California’s public colleges and universities comes from the state, not the federal government. After years where the state’s higher education system benefitted from a state surplus or was spared from budget cuts, 2025 proved different. 
Both the UC and the California State University system saw 3% reductions in funding this year, though the community college system emerged largely unscathed. Facing particularly severe cuts, Sonoma State tried to cut majors, such as economics and physics, and to slash its competitive athletic programs, only for a judge to halt many of the cuts. 
Looking ahead
Many of the court rulings issued this year were preliminary injunctions, meaning they’re temporary decisions until a final ruling occurs. That means many of the research grants could once again disappear. 
The Trump administration is also going after students without legal status, who have for decades been able to receive state financial aid and to pay in-state tuition at public universities. A November lawsuit could put an end to those financial aid programs, affecting as many as 100,000 students across the state. 
For the community college system, which educates the majority of students in California, the economy is often a key indicator in enrollment. If tariffs, a bursting tech bubble or other economic headwinds hit the state, students could return to college en masse, just like they did during the 2008 financial crisis.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/092225_UC-San-Diego_AH_19.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-25 08:56:21.006924

In a year marked by divisive rhetoric across the nation, those stories were among the most read on Utah News Dispatch’s website, along with announcements about homelessness, Sundance and decisions impacting kids. 
As news pushed the Beehive State into the national spotlight, here are some of the issues that rose to the top for Utah News Dispatch readers.

Fatal shooting as thousands march in Salt Lake City
As 10,000 Utahns joined in a nationwide No Kings demonstration protesting President Donald Trump’s policies and administration, shots rang out, sending the crowd fleeing and leaving one man dead.
When the chaos cleared, police said an armed volunteer, identifying himself as a “peacekeeper” for the event, had spotted a man with a rifle and shot at him, wounding him and hitting a bystander as he passed with the marchers. Arthur “Afa” Ah Loo died of his injuries, and the demonstrator with the rifle, who was legally permitted to carry his firearm in the protest, was released from jail without charges after nearly a week.
Months later, prosecutors publicly identified the armed volunteer, 43-year-old Matthew Scott Alder, and charged him with manslaughter, a second-degree felony. He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance Jan. 6.

Charlie Kirk assassinated at Utah Valley University
The first stop of conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s “American Comeback Tour” was planned for Utah Valley University, where he would engage with students and the public in his signature “prove me wrong” question-and-answer debate. As he spoke at the campus’ open-air event, he was killed by a single shot that police say was fired by a lone gunman on a roof.
After a nearly three-day manhunt, Tyler Robinson, a 22-year-old Washington County resident, was arrested after family members and a family friend convinced him to turn himself in, according to police documents. Meanwhile, mourning for Kirk — and political and professional recrimination for those who spoke negatively about him — swept the nation.
Robinson has been charged with aggravated murder, a first-degree felony. Before he was even arrested, Utah officials were pledging to pursue a death penalty in the case, if he is convicted. As court hearings get underway, Robinson’s attorneys are pursuing restrictions on photos and videos of the proceedings.

Homeless services campus site revealed
For months, state officials searched for a site for what they say will be a centralized location for wraparound services for Utahns experiencing homelessness. When the news broke that they had landed on a location, reaction was swift and strong.
The site for the new 1,300-bed shelter is located at 2520 N. 2200 West, Salt Lake City. It’s an open field located directly west of I-215 and roughly a mile south from North Salt Lake’s city boundaries, in Salt Lake City’s Northpointe area. The small agricultural neighborhood lacks public transit and is far-flung from other services located around downtown.
The new homeless campus is envisioned by state homeless leaders to be a place where people experiencing homelessness can go for all of their services, all in one spot. But advocates have decried the strategy as a ploy to warehouse vulnerable Utahns out of sight and force people into mental health or drug treatment (and in an environmentally important zone, to boot). Surrounding neighbors also fear for what it means for their property values and public safety.

Sundance is out, and a flag ban is in
Two hot-button issues became intertwined in Utah this year — the announcement that the Sundance Film Festival will leave its home in Park City after more than 40 years, and legislation by Republican lawmakers banning most flags from classrooms and government buildings, notably LGBTQ+ banners. The Hollywood news site Deadline reported Utah’s flag ban could have tipped the scales out of the state’s favor.
Both developments drew dismay from the state’s Democrat-led capital city, even as Salt Lake City leaders came up with a loophole in the flag ban law. Meanwhile, some Republican legislators were eager to bid “Bye Felicia” to the film festival that they said doesn’t align with the state’s conservative values.
Sundance’s departure from Utah is a blow not just to local filmmakers, but also the state’s economy. In 2024, the Sundance Film Festival generated about $132 million in gross domestic product for Utah, 1,730 local jobs, $69.7 million in Utah wages, and $13.8 million in state and local tax revenue, according to an economic impact report.

Legislation, lawsuits and debates impacting youth
As lawmakers and state leaders prioritized issues impacting youth in 2025, several made the list of Utah News Dispatch’s most-read reports. 
Those included:

News that the company operating some of the most visited pornographic websites in the world, including Pornhub, agreed to pay Utah $5 million over allegations that it didn’t do enough to remove videos depicting rape, child sexual abuse and secret recordings. 
A bill to restrict the allowable age gap between an underage minor and his or her adult spouse, reducing the age difference to four years.
A debate among the Utah State Board of Education over whether schools were complying with a 2024 law restricting diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in all public institutions.

Chad Robertson, R-Heflin, listens to a presentation on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on April 3, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama lawmaker is proposing a bill that would require public high schools that participate in national signing to host signing days for military enlistment and trade schools alongside athletics.
Rep. Chad Robertson, R-Heflin, the sponsor of HB 75, said in a recent interview that he hopes it would help military recruitment and workforce development.
“We just wanted to make it even across the plane that, you know, if the schools are doing the [signing days] for athletes, then we do a signing day for the ones that are going in the military,” he said.

The move would come as branches of the armed forces try to improve overall recruitment While meeting recruiting goals in recent years, U.S. Army recruitment in 2022 missed its recruitment goal of 60,000 by nearly 25%. The U.S. Navy also missed its recruitment goal of 37,700 in 2023 by 20%.
“We just wanted to make it even across the plane that if the schools are doing the ones for athletes, then we do a signing day for the ones that are going in the military,” Robertson said. “It’s more of a signing day, though, for the military than would be for the technical because they actually do sign a contract at that point.” 
Robertson said there are other schools, such as Cleveland High School in Blount County, that have already implemented a system similar to what the bill proposes.
“They kind of just do everybody all at once and it’s kind of an awards day,” he said. “That was brought to my attention in the committee too, when I passed it through the Education Committee in the House that there were schools that were already celebrating this.”
Under the bill, schools would be required to provide “reasonable accommodations” for signing day, including but not limited to a space with seating and internet connectivity.
This is Robertson’s second time filing a bill similar to this. The bill passed unanimously in the House during the 2025 legislative session but failed to make it through the Senate because of time constraints. He said he doesn’t anticipate any pushback from legislators on this bill when they begin meeting Jan. 13.
“I wish I started it a little bit earlier, so that’s why I prefiled it,” Robertson said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Chad-Robertson-April-3-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-25 08:11:47.278784

We elected a new governor, became a battleground in the Trump administration’s push to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, saw a brief strike that shut down NJ Transit trains, and emptied our wallets paying for electricity.
Our photographers were there to capture all of it. Here are their best shots of 2025:

Amanda Brown snapped a gleeful Gov.-elect Mikie Sherrill taking a selfie with supporters after she won the governor’s race on Nov. 4, 2025.

Anne-Marie Caruso captured the other side, a mournful Jack Ciattarelli conceding the gubernatorial race to Sherrill.

Hal Brown found Ciattarelli in a much more victorious mood on June 10, when Ciattarelli won the GOP primary for governor.

Anne-Marie Caruso was in Newark on Nov. 19 for an ICE raid and managed to get a photo of a federal agent looking her dead in the eye.

Ed Murray was in Jersey City on Oct. 14 to watch the city’s mayoral candidates debate, and he found former Gov. Jim McGreevey preparing in a sea of empty chairs. McGreevey went on to lose the race by a wide margin, ending his bid for political resurrection.

There were a lot of serious speeches at the Oct. 18 “No Kings” protests — and a lot of silliness, evident in this photo from Princeton by Mary Iuvone.

Gov. Phil Murphy spent a lot of 2025 awarding pardons and commuting prison sentences, and Dana DiFilippo on Nov. 10 captured this shot of Jamal Muhammad thanking Murphy for commuting his sentence.

Hal Brown found two guys just sharing a laugh in Camden on Jan. 28 — except here it’s Murphy and South Jersey power broker George Norcross, who at the time was still facing an indictment brought by Murphy’s attorney general (the indictment was tossed by a judge one month later).

Dana DiFilippo caught a lot of Trenton pols with her camera this year, including this one of powerful Bergen County Democrat Sen. Paul Sarlo on June 30, the day the Legislature passed the state budget.

Dana also snapped this one of harm reduction advocates staging a die-in at the Statehouse on June 30, after lawmakers opted to divert $45 million in national opioid funds to four of the state’s largest hospitals.

Reena Rose Sibayan snapped a classic “welp, I lost” photo of Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop on June 10 moments after he learned he would not win the Dem nomination for governor.

Amanda Brown captured a much happier Sherrill with Lt. Gov.-elect Dale Caldwell on election night.

Here’s a frame-worthy shot of a New Jersey institution, the Arlington Diner, from Anne-Marie Caruso.

Dana DiFilippo captured a tender moment between LaShawn Fitch and his mother, Barbara Robinson, after Fitch was released from South Woods State Prison on Dec. 4. Murphy commuted Fitch’s prison sentence after 17 years behind bars.

Anne-Marie Caruso snapped some tense moments at a Dec. 1 legislative hearing at the Statehouse where state Sen. James Beach, right, sparred with U.S. Sen Andy Kim over a bill to water down the powers of the state comptroller.

Dana DiFilippo went to “Not My Presidents Day” on Feb. 17, a protest against President Donald Trump’s new administration that attracted hundreds to rally in Trenton, including this very vocal woman.

Regional and statewide partners are making progress in developing the tools and know-how to respond to our collective flood risk. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Michael Gaughan and Katy Hansen: Vermont needs to get on the road to risk reduction.","This commentary is by Michael Gaughan, the executive director of the Vermont Bond Bank, and Katy Hansen, the director of the Rural and Small Cities Program at the Public Finance Initiative.



Vermont municipalities face a stark reality. The federal support that communities have relied on after disasters may be dramatically reduced in future years. The public will soon see the FEMA Review Council report, which is expected to recommend shifting more disaster response costs to states while also raising the dollar threshold for what qualifies as a federal disaster. Vermont is already confronting this reality with the recent denial of the July 2025 disaster declaration and the related on-again off-again funding for core infrastructure resilience programs.
For a state that has experienced over $240 million in FEMA related municipal damages from flooding in the past three years, the potential reduction in federal support threatens the fiscal and physical structures that undergird our communities. This is a staggering number, representing more than 30% of the Vermont Bond Bank’s current municipal loans, which obscures the threat to individual towns where disaster costs can be overwhelming. Take, for instance, towns such as Lyndon, where an estimated $18 million in damages occurred in 2024, roughly six times the town’s highway budget.

But this moment of uncertainty is an opportunity for Vermont to take matters into its own hands. Recently, the Bond Bank was selected to participate in the Public Finance Initiative’s Rural and Small Cities program, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, to receive capacity building and educational support to develop clear guidance alongside our loan programs for communities to reduce the risks caused by extreme weather to their infrastructure. This builds on the Bond Bank’s decades of experience lending to local government and addressing challenges of infrastructure planning and finance. Our team of experts organized stakeholders from across the state to discuss how to spur action while coordinating resources. 
As others have noted and the FEMA report is anticipated to make clear, we must take responsibility ourselves and change practices to save Vermont from the inevitable. Thankfully, regional and statewide partners are making progress in developing the tools and know-how to respond to our collective flood risk. 
The convening helped the Bond Bank to highlight the largest potential contributor to post-disaster fiscal stress for our municipalities — our municipal roads. This network connects us to families, jobs, schools, grocery stores and hospitals, and is where more than 80% of municipal flood damage has occurred over the last 20 years. 
The Bond Bank’s goal is to use its understanding of public finance best practices and the helpful tools from partners like the Vermont League of Cities and Towns (VLCT) to drive the development of more capital plans and financial benchmarks that incorporate technical analyses from regional and state partners. Simple at its face, the effort is interdisciplinary and complex in practice. The convening was important to help the Bond Bank develop guidance and spur implementation. The Bond Bank aims to coordinate low-cost financing sources and expand the Municipal Climate Recovery Fund (MCRF) to help communities when disaster strikes. The intent is to turn the recovery cycle on its head: align existing resources to reduce risk before disasters strike and plan for more post-disaster relief.
The MCRF, established in partnership with the State and Treasurer’s Office, has already demonstrated its value. Since launching after the July 2023 floods, it has provided $33 million in loans at just 1.3% interest to 27 Vermont towns, offering seven-year terms with two years interest-only to give communities breathing room as they await potential federal reimbursement. This isn’t flashy, but the point is its practical value. For example, Lyndon received $4 million in MCRF loans that gave them space to deal with critical, immediate needs and time to sort through what the federal government would support.
With engagement from the partners at the convening, an expanded MCRF program, when combined with the capacity of our Vermont banks, would help address our vulnerable road infrastructure by aligning incentives for communities to plan, design and invest in improvements, and if disaster strikes, ensuring that communities can access resources through loans and adaptation grants to build back in the right way. 
This approach demands a shift in thinking. It means partners like the Bond Bank need to do everything we can to reduce costs for borrowers while also giving direction on how to take the first step in the financial trade-offs of implementing resilience projects. While this is hard work, it’s also empowering. Instead of waiting for federal aid that might never come, Vermont communities can reduce risk before disasters strike and build resilience on their own.

I was glad to cover this form of protest that leans into the absurd. As the year went on and inflatable frogs and unicorns joined the resistance movement, I was consistently reminded of this 50-years-strong day of song and protest.

The federal raid on Lake Street, the first of many clashes with the growing presence of the feds, was chaotic. Dozens of agents, armored vehicles, a kaleidoscopic array of agencies, and hundreds of protestors all packed into the blocks surrounding Las Cuatro Milpas under a constant rain.
It was impossible to tell from the ground why the agents were there, because so many agencies were involved and none would answer questions. I was grateful to the puppeteers of the Heart of the Beast, who let us file our story and photos in the shelter of the theater, soaked through and covered in pepper spray.

On Saturday morning, while preparing to cover a No Kings day of protest, we heard the news that Melissa and Mark Hortman had been assassinated overnight. I didn’t believe it at first, until the rest of our newsroom confirmed it. Vance Boelter, the alleged assassin, was still on the loose, with No Kings signs photographed in his car.
The State Patrol advised people not to come. Thousands of people still showed up to protest, some with quickly-made signs honoring Hortman.

The march was suffused with anxiety to the point of paranoia. I saw demonstrators constantly checking their phones and trading information about the ongoing manhunt. Boelter had disguised himself as law enforcement, officials said. People kept coming up to me and other photographers, asking us to use our long lenses to check the legitimacy of law enforcement badges or to get a closer look at men with face coverings.

I was especially struck by the tribute Red Lake Drum Group gave to the Hortmans’ memory. Hundreds of people gathered tearfully on the State Capitol lawn as the sun set, candles flickering under the massive elm tree that Melissa Hortman adored.

I was at Karmel Mall, a shopping center filled with Somali-owned businesses in south Minneapolis. I was searching for a cafe owner who freelancer Atra Mohamed had interviewed for a story about the downturn in foot traffic in the mall as people stayed away out of fear of ICE.
As I wandered the mall, multiple times business owners came out of their stalls, noticing my camera and my white face, and asked, “Are they here?” No introduction, no need to describe what they were referencing, just “Are they here?” Each time, I replied, “I’m sorry, I don’t know.”
But they were. Minutes after I left, agents detained several people, in one case smashing a car window to drag a person out. Here, you can see the broken glass sprayed over an unopened Taco Bell order.
Throughout what turned out to be a punishing year of violence, tragedy and chaos, the resistance movement remained strong. I would like for that to be my takeaway, but the year is ending on a raw note.
As I took an Uber to the airport to visit my family for Christmas, driving out of my neighborhood that’s now consistently filled with agents, the Somali driver told me about how for the first time in over a decade in America, he carries his passport all the time.
As we drove past the very spot where I’d watched shackled people marched onto a deportation plane in November, the driver said, “Pray for us, sister.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NN250603_0340-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-25 07:11:42.986944

(Getty Images)Your four-person Indiana Capital Chronicle team brought you a whopping 600 original stories during a busy year that featured a lively Statehouse and our first-ever staffing change.
We delivered play-by-plays of major legislative issues, from a mapping miss to budgetary brawls. We monitored top elected officials — misconduct included — and critical social services.
Before this year’s chapter in our story comes to a close, revisit your favorite and most important articles with us.
1. Map push dies
The Indiana Senate this month defied the wishes of President Donald Trump — despite a protracted national pressure campaign — when lawmakers there rejected a mid-census redraw of the state’s congressional maps.
The proposed maps were explicitly designed to bolster the GOP’s hold on the U.S. House in the 2026 midterm elections.
Trump kicked off the redistricting arms race in July, when he directed Texas to create five more GOP seats.
We began tracking the initiative: Vice President JD Vance’s visits to Indianapolis, Hoosier Republicans’ travel to the U.S. Capitol, closed-door caucuses and more.

The team logged gradual changes in Indiana Gov. Mike Braun’s stance as his wait-and-see approach shifted toward a special session dedicated to the redistricting effort.
And we covered lawmakers’ will-they-or-won’t-they decision on reconvening, which culminated in an early start to the 2026 session. The whole team — including new Deputy Editor Tom Davies — pitched in to analyze the proposed maps, man lengthy public hearings and probably irritate reticent lawmakers in our efforts to bring you the latest.
The Senate’s 31-19 defeat of the maps means the idea can’t be reconsidered until the 2027 session. Now, we’re following the short– and long-term political fallout.
2. Sheriff scrutiny
ICC’s mission, to fill in gaps in state-level coverage, sometimes takes us beyond the Government Center campus in Indianapolis.
Senior Reporter Casey Smith tackled the complicated story of a state investigation into a county sheriff’s alleged wrongdoing, finding that the only person disciplined was the detective who pursued the case.

And she followed up, reporting that a state law enforcement board is considering whether Dubois County Sheriff Tom Kleinhelter — who is accused of mishandling jail commissary funds and more — should be stripped of his police credentials.
Smith also kept tabs on a series she began last year on wrongdoing by former Clark County Sheriff Jamey Noel, which prompted greater state oversight of jail commissary funds.
She catalogued the court-sanctioned sales of Noel’s misbegotten property — complete with pictures of his auctioned luxury cars and self-branded merchandise — as the disgraced man begins making good on restitution orders.
3. Economic development sunlight
Just before she went back east, landing at a sister outlet in Pennsylvania, former ICC Senior Reporter Whitney Downard wrapped up a contentious chapter for the state’s embattled economic development authority.
Over the spring, Braun’s administration launched a forensic analysis into spending by the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and its relationship with several partners. Downard broke down the substantial report, released in the fall, and reaction to it.
The results prompted a spate of accountability-oriented changes. IEDC’s board has revamped its conflict-of-interest policies, with screened members exiting the room for certain projects, and investment policies. Only the full board makes binding votes now. And the quasi-public agency’s nonprofit arm is going to “wind down,” officials have said, although that hasn’t been completed.
Braun wants to move on from damage control. IEDC is revving up a renewed focus on regional development.
4. Indiana governor’s first year
It was a tumultuous first year in office for Braun, who was inaugurated mid-January — after the General Assembly reconvened for legislative business.
Amid slower revenue growth, he led the push to slash state spending, signing the state’s latest biennial budget into law in April.
But he spent much of his political capital on a property tax relief plan that lawmakers weakened and subsumed into a behemoth local government finance law. Revisions are expected this session.
Despite mixed results on his property tax agenda and defeat on redistricting, Braun said year one still featured plenty of wins, during a sit-down interview with Reporter Leslie Bonilla Muñiz.

He highlighted the remake of IEDC and the commission that regulates utility services; the cuts to agency spending and a leadership reorganization; and boosts to education and public safety.
5. Your mileage may vary
Braun’s ascension to the Governor’s Residence in Indianapolis also sparked scrutiny on upgrades made to his family home in southwestern Indiana, and frequent travel between the two.
Downard broke the news of the state’s plans to spend at least $118,000 on security improvements to the house in Jasper. The work included a gravel helipad, fencing, gates and a trailer for a round-the-clock security detail staffed by Indiana State Police.

Braun is the first governor in recent decades to reside outside of central Indiana while in office. Former Govs. Eric Holcomb and Mike Pence made the Indianapolis estate their primary residence, while former Gov. Mitch Daniels split his time between that building and his home in Carmel.
Jasper and Indianapolis are located more than two hours apart by car — or, just 45 minutes by helicopter.
Downard also reported Braun took 11 helicopter rides to and from his Jasper home over about six months, costing almost $24,000. The state said that it would have incurred those costs regardless, because Indiana State Police pilots needed the flight hours to satisfy federal license maintenance requirements.
6. License plates boost budgets
That metal plate fastened to your vehicle can bring in big bucks for nonprofit groups and the state.
Bonilla Muñiz found Hoosiers pumped almost $200 million into charitable causes over two decades — just by buying and renewing special group recognition license plates.
But recently toughened sales and signature requirements may force organizations out of the program and block prospective participants from joining.
Seen those all-black plates on the road? Smith got a preview of the “blackout” designs, which have already generated millions of dollars for the state.
7. Former administration leader disciplined
Smith has also been on top of wrongdoing by one-time Public Safety Secretary Jennifer-Ruth Green, who resigned in September, repeatedly breaking news along the way.
The Indiana State Ethics Commission this month approved a settlement featuring a $10,000 civil fine for Green, finding she violated political activity and misuse of state property rules.
That approval closed the ethics case against Green, but potential criminal charges remain under review by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office, Smith reported.
Smith and ICC Editor Niki Kelly were the first to report on a remediation document revealing Green was the subject of a state inspector general probe prior to her abrupt departure.
She’s still running for Congress again, though. Her campaign has called the investigation a “politically motivated sham.”
8. Social service cuts
The spending cuts undertaken after the lackluster springtime revenue forecast are hitting social services for impoverished Hoosiers, ICC reporting shows.
Indiana enrollment in Medicaid, the low-income health care program, has dropped by about 300,000 people throughout the year, totaling 1.7 million in November, according to the latest forecast, delivered this month. The dip comes as officials continue aggressive post-pandemic eligibility checks.
Lawmakers have also approved cost-controlling work mandates for the Healthy Indiana Plan, a Medicaid-expansion health insurance program for 700,000 low- to moderate-income Hoosiers. But it won’t take effect until 2027, when a federal law imposes such requirements on expansion enrollees nationwide.

And there are big changes coming for providers serving the 8,000 children who receive autism therapy through Medicaid. The state plans to reduce its hourly rate 10% and is considering other cost-cutting strategies for the fast-growing program.
Families who need help paying for child care have also struggled, as a state freeze on vouchers enters its second year. It’s creating enrollment crunches for providers, also hard-hit by the state’s significantly lower reimbursement rates.
Indiana additionally opted out of a summer meal program for hungry low-income schoolchildren. Downard broke that story, then followed up, reporting that a key agency and Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith blamed the miss on poor planning by Holcomb’s outgoing administration.
9. Educational changes
Indiana schools saw mixed results this year.
Third-graders produced a historic jump in reading scores, but about 3,000 were held back for not meeting literacy proficiency standards.
Fewer students are missing large chunks of school, but chronic absenteeism rates still remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Smith, ICC’s education guru, broke down what a recent absenteeism law does.
Indiana has asked the U.S. Department of Education for permission to combine funding from 15-plus federal programs into one block grant, overhauling how the state spends and tracks billions in education aid.
Public higher educational institutions, meanwhile, reported enrollment gains but a lower college-going rate. They also axed or restructured hundreds of degree programs under a recent state law, and recorded millions of dollars in canceled federal research grants.
10. Two more executions
Indiana ended its 15-year execution pause last year after securing a new lethal drug. This year, the state put two more men to death.
Roy Lee Ward was executed in October for the 2001 rape and murder of teenager Stacy Payne. Benjamin Ritchie was executed in May, nearly 25 years after he killed Beech Grove law enforcement officer William Toney.
Details on both were sparse; no reporters were permitted to witness.
Death Penalty Action, a nonprofit that advocates against executions, encouraged protestors to ring the “Delaware Bell” as a sign of their opposition to the death penalty while gathered outside the Indiana State Prison on Monday, May 19, 2025, in Michigan City — ahead of the execution of Benjamin Ritchie. (Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Braun confirmed over the summer that Indiana spent more than $1 million on execution drugs. Three doses were purchased for $900,000 under Holcomb’s administration. Only one was utilized; the other two doses expired without use. Braun’s administration spent $275,000 on a fourth dose, used for Ritchie’s execution.
But his office has refused to disclose exactly how much the state paid for the latest three sets of lethal injection drugs purchased by the Department of Correction in recent months. At least one of those doses was expected to be used for Ward’s execution. The remaining sets expired at the end of October, according to court documents.
Five men remain on Indiana’s death row, but only four are currently considered competent for execution. No new inmates have been added since 2013, and capital prosecutions remain rare and costly.
Smith reports lawmakers are exploring other execution methods in new legislation. Braun told ICC he’ll “look at” whatever “comes up,” but said such measures “don’t rise to the level of” kitchen-table issues.

Charles Dickens MuseumLucy Whitehead, Royal Holloway, University of London

A Christmas Carol is usually read as a Victorian morality tale about capitalism and compassion. Yet an autographed script written by Charles Dickens during the American Civil War raises the possibility he may also have understood the story as speaking to the cause of ending slavery in the US.
First published in the UK on December 19 1843, the novella is famous for its advocacy of a reformed relationship between the Victorian capitalist Scrooge and the workers whose labour he profits from, epitomised by his downtrodden clerk, Bob Cratchit. The story has inspired countless adaptations in theatre, television and film.
However, a slip of blue paper held in Harvard’s Houghton Library shows how Dickens may have also seen the story through the lens of American slavery. As my current research in the library’s collections shows, on March 7 1864, Dickens wrote out and autographed A Christmas Carol’s most famous line so that it could be sold in aid of the anti-slavery side in the ongoing American civil war (1861–65).
The closing sentence – “And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!” – is usually associated with Victorian families united in the Christmas snow. However, Dickens’ contribution to a set of celebrity autographs being collected for sale at the 1864 New York Metropolitan Fair enlisted his novella in the cause of supporting the Union army’s goal of ending slavery in the US.
The New York fair was one of several events held across the Union states to raise funds for the US Sanitary Commission, a philanthropic organisation which promoted the health, welfare and convalescence of Union soldiers. We don’t know how much the autograph collection to which Dickens contributed ultimately sold for. But records show the collection, gathered by the wife of the US ambassador to Britain, Abigail Brooks Adams, was valued at US$1,000 – approximately US$20,000 (£14,500) in today’s money.
Dickens had been an international celebrity since the 1830s, and was well accustomed to requests for autographs. In 19th-century terms, this often meant a copied-out passage from one of his novels as well as a signature.
What survives of these autographs, written for fans in Britain and America, suggests that the passage he typically used was the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop (1841). His unusual choice of the final line from A Christmas Carol therefore seems deliberate for this specific context.
In my ongoing research, I theorise this choice may have been designed to remind people that the message of A Christmas Carol also applied to enslaved black people in the US and show his support for them.
While there are no direct references to slavery in A Christmas Carol, there are good reasons to think it was on Dickens’s mind at the time he was writing the novella.
The two works he was publishing immediately before it – the travel book American Notes (1842) and serialised novel Martin Chuzzlewit (1843–44) – both make vivid reference to the inhumanities of slavery. They had been inspired by the five-month tour that Dickens made of the US in 1842.
There is a long cultural history of ghosts in chains like the ones that weigh down Scrooge’s partner, Jacob Marley, in A Christmas Carol. But at the time Dickens was writing it, he also had a more immediate reference point for the image of people burdened by irons.
In American Notes’s chapter on slavery, he quotes from multiple American newspaper descriptions of escaped enslaved people loaded with iron rings, chains and weights – including a 12-year-old boy with a “chain dog-collar around his neck”.
In A Christmas Carol, Marley attributes his chain, made of “cash-boxes … ledgers … and heavy purses”, to his heartless pursuit of business profit in life. Marley warns Scrooge that he too is a “captive, bound and double-ironed”, suggesting that exploitation for money will ultimately fetter the exploiter as well as the exploited.
Two recent adaptations of A Christmas Carol have suggested that Scrooge and Marley’s business is at least partly built on the trade in enslaved people. Jon Clinch’s 2019 novel Marley makes the link direct, while Steven Knight’s television series of the same year implies it.
For example, Stephen Graham’s Marley tells Guy Pearce’s Scrooge: “Look at these chains Ebenezer … Each link is a man or woman or child who died in our workshops”, mentioning locations not only in “London, Birmingham, Manchester”, but also “Batavia … Mauritius, the Bay of Honduras”. Slavery was present in the last three locations until at least the 1830s.
While Dickens opposed slavery, he was far from immune to racism. Notoriously, his support for the brutal British colonial response to an uprising of Jamaican plantation workers in 1865 contrasted with his career-long advocacy against the deprivations of the British working classes.
In Zadie Smith’s historical novel The Fraud (2023), the character of Dickens suggests that Brits should be turning their attention from the compensation given by the British government to slave owners in the British Empire to problems closer to home. Such a portrayal is supported by Dickens’s mockery of Mrs Jellyby in Bleak House (1853) for her “telescopic philanthropy”, which centres on Africans in the fictional “Borrioboola-Gha” rather than the people in her immediate vicinity.
If Dickens did intend to use the final line of A Christmas Carol to support the anti-slavery cause in the American Civil War, this would allow us to rethink how he may have seen the relationship between exploitation and inhumanity at home and abroad. It suggests that, in at least some circumstances, he was able to see these causes in connection rather than competition.

Luke Karg, of House Springs, had one last shot before graduating to win the Missouri TBF High School Trail Super Tournament for bass fishing – which he and his then 16-year-old fishing partner, A.J. Massa, had won the year before.
It’s the last tournament of the season for the Missouri student program of The Bass Federation, and it’s also the final opportunity to earn enough points to be named Team of the Year — the top-scoring duo in the state.
“The tournament itself meant a lot to us, with it being our last state tournament together,” Karg said. “It was very tough. There was, at most, two inches of visibility in the water, but a lot of fishing is just adapting to the changes.”
Karg and Massa headed out on the water for two days for eight hours each. At the end of each day, they weighed their top five fish. 
“The first day, they caught almost enough bass to win the tournament,” said Gary Foree, Karg’s mentor and family friend, who is a former professional fisherman. “They had almost 19 pounds, which is insane. There hasn’t been a tournament in three years over 17 pounds on Truman Lake.”
They brought in 16 pounds on the second day, which would have brought their total up to nearly 35 pounds. But unfortunately it didn’t count. Their boat malfunctioned, making them miss the weigh in.  
“It was pretty heart-wrenching,” Karg said. “It was one of our best bags as a team on one of the most difficult days.”
But it wasn’t all lost. 
Karg and Massa ended up taking second place at Truman Lake with one day’s worth of fish, and they still had enough points to be named Team of the Year, just as they were last year.
Karg has been part of the Team of the Year five years in a row, including as an incoming high-school freshman. 
That title also sent the team to the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June. 
Only the top two high-school teams from each state can compete, and Karg is the only person in Missouri to have qualified for that opportunity five years in a row, according to officials for the national championship.
“To be one of the top two teams in Missouri for five consecutive years is pretty freaking amazing,” said Karl Buck, who previously led the federation’s high school program in Missouri and was also Karg’s team leader. “I’m just so proud it’s unbelievable. I mean, I can’t believe that I was involved in his upcoming as a fisherman.”
Karg began competitive fishing when he was 12 and participated in dozens of individual and team tournaments as a teen. Through it all, he struggled with an autoimmune illness that made him miss numerous days from school, he said, but he’s proud he still managed to graduate on time in May and continue fishing.
While it was grueling standing on a boat for hours under the hot sun, Karg said the national championship was exhilarating because some of the world’s top fishermen were watching. 
“It’s the biggest tourn of the year, and a lot of people only get to go to it once, if even,” Karg said. “It really could be the biggest tournament of your life.”
 A promise

Karg has loved to fish ever since he could hold a rod, said his father Rick Karg. Even as early as 5, he said Karg could catch fish when the adults around him were coming up empty. 
“There’s a magic,” Rick said. “My scientific brain says, ‘Is there like a vibration from his heartbeat that travels down the line because he’s got his finger touching it, that the fish like?’” 
Foree met Karg because of a life-changing promise he made to Karg’s mother, Becky Rumley.
Rumley was the nurse administering Foree’s chemotherapy treatment at St. Claire Hospital, and one day, she told him how much her nine-year-old son loved to fish. At the time, Foree thought he only had a few months to live.
“I ended up telling her that if I survive this, I’ll take him to Lake of the Ozarks and get him a five pounder because I used to be a [fishing] guide on the lake,” he said.
Luke Karg stands with a paddlefish he caught in Owensville (Photo submitted).
Foree did pull through, and when they went out fishing, Karg didn’t just catch one five-pound bass. 
“I caught three five-pound bass and two six pounders, and like a bunch of big fish,” Karg said. “It is probably the best day of fishing in my life. And ever since then, he’s just dedicated a huge part of his life to help teach me and my partner.”
Foree was equally amazed after Karg pulled out nearly 40 pounds of fish that day. 
“He just had the best day of fishing anybody could have,” Foree said. “That’s how I got him hooked on fishing.”  
Over the years, Foree taught him about tracking fish through the different seasons and how to read the water and the banks. He also helped him get his first boat.
Now, Foree said, Karg’s instincts are his fishing superpower. 
“So many times they won a tournament when the fishing was really tough, and Luke said, ‘Let’s try over here. That bank looks good,’” Foree said. “And they’ll go over, and they’ll catch enough fish on that bank to win the tournament.”
Karg believes his instincts have developed with the dozens of tournaments and countless hours of fishing. 
“Over time, it’s become more of an instinct, than having to think about, ‘Oh, I should make a change,’” he said. “It just naturally comes.”
For instance, at both the Truman Lake and national championship, Karg said he was painting his own custom lures while he was on the boat.
At Truman, he made the decision to color a half-inch chartreuse line on his spinner bait, he said, and he ended up catching much bigger fish, but less fish. If his lure had a straight tail, the catch was better as well, he said.
“It’s all about how the bait works in the water,” he said. “The smallest little detail that can just trigger the fish to eat. That’s where a lot of the fun comes into it for me, is all the difficulties and fun little changes you can make. You can go from catching no fish for hours on end to catching your limit in a minute.”
 ‘Find five’

Karl Buck remembers meeting Karg when he was about 12 on a dock at the Peaceful Valley Lake in Owensville, where Karg’s grandparents have a lake house. Buck used to run a student program called the Owensville Anglers, and they were finishing up a tournament that day.
“When we were doing our weigh-in down at the dam, they came down to the boat ramp to inquire,” Buck said. “He’ll probably hate this, but he was the most bashful young man, super quiet and reserved.” 
The Owensville Anglers is how Karg got his start with tournament fishing, which Buck says is much different than regular fishing. 
In a tournament, Buck said the first rule is “find five.” 
“You’re fishing for five fish,” Buck said. “Doesn’t matter what they weigh, they just got to be keepers,” meaning they are big enough to keep.
Luke Karg, left, and A.J. Massa hold up their top three fish at the TBF Student Angler Federation High School National Championship, which was held at Oklahoma’s Grand Lake O’ the Cherokees in June (photo submitted).
The fish go in the box where they’re kept alive and healthy, which is a standard conservation practice in the high-school tournaments. 
“After you have five, then you’re going to change your game,” he said. “It’s now no longer about just catching fish. You’re looking to upgrade the fish that you already have. Big fish get big for a reason. They’re hard to catch.”
Big fish know how to hide, and that’s where casting skills come into play, Foree said. He called Karg’s casting skills “insane.” 
“He can skip jigs and lures and put them in places nobody else can,” Foree said. “That’s why he’s so good.”
But he wasn’t always that good, Buck remembers, which is why Karg earned the nickname “Oops” after fishing with Buck and his son one day.
“Luke throws this cast — I believe it was a spinner bait — and it winds up on the roof of this dock, stuck,” Buck said. “So we go up and we get it. A little while later, he makes another cast and it gets stuck on somebody’s dock.”
After each time, Karg would just say, “Oops” and the nickname was born. Buck said when they fished together this past summer, he was blown away at his talent. 
Karg and Massa ended up placing 56th out of more than 200 teams in the national championship in Oklahoma. 
“We lost three three-pounders that came off the boat,” Karg said after the tournament finished. “That would have gotten us up to nine or 10 pounds. We would have been around 12th place probably.”
Karg said he’s proud of his accomplishment over this high school career, and he couldn’t have done it without his fishing partners Massa and previously Kyle Kannawurf, along with their boat captains.
“No one gives credit enough to our boat captains, which were both of our dads,” he said, “just giving the time to drive all the way out there and standing with us out the boat for eight hours straight a day.”
As boat captain, Rick said he was in “constant amazement” at his son’s skill.
“I’d just sit there and watch and think, ‘How in the world are you doing this?’” Rick said. “You’re like a super sharp shooter.”
Rick said he’s watched Karg fish for seven hours without catching anything, but he’d still have the focus and creativity change his strategy and get a big catch at the last minute. Karg’s humility and attitude are among the most impressive things about him, said Foree and Buck, particularly his ability to bounce back from setbacks. 
“He never got rattled,” Foree said. “Oh, he’d get upset if he lost a big fish, but he’d just say, ‘Okay, I learned something from that,’ and go on to the next one. His ability to focus and stay focused in times of turmoil when he loses fish or the weather changes is very, very important in professional bass fishing.”
