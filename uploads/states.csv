(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives on Sunday passed a bill that would use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers, namely Planned Parenthood, that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2 was approved in a party-line 43-19 vote, with Democrats in favor. It passed the Senate on Friday, during the ongoing special legislative session that is focused on raising revenue to soften the impact of recent changes to the federal tax code. The bill now goes to Gov. Jared Polis’ desk for his signature.
The bill was proposed in the wake of President Donald Trump signing the federal Republican tax break and spending cut law, dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, in July. That law prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving federal Medicaid funds, including for services like sexually transmitted disease screenings and HIV-related treatments. Federal law already bars federal Medicaid money from funding most abortion services.

SB-2 forces the state to step in. It would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing, which administers the state’s Medicaid program, to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. The provision in the law that affects Planned Parenthood has been paused while a challenge to it moves through federal courts. But PPRM’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said.
“We are in the midst of a health care access disaster that began (when the federal law) was signed,” Teter said.
The bill’s fiscal notes estimates it would cost Colorado a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, called for lawmakers to vote down the bill during initial debate on the bill on Saturday afternoon. She spoke for about 30 minutes against abortion services and Planned Parenthood, and also argued that due to the state budget gap it would be unfair to spend money on Planned Parenthood.
“It’s weird how that works,” Bradley said. “We (the Republicans) can’t have any fiscal notes, but wow, $4.4 million on this bad boy right here.”
Boulder resident Lilly Boyd, a single mother of three children, spoke to the Senate Health and Human Services Committee in favor of the bill on Thursday. Boyd, who is enrolled in Medicaid, said a follow-up appointment she had scheduled with PPRM after receiving a medication abortion was canceled in July due to the recent federal law. Days later, Boyd experienced hemorrhaging and had to go to the emergency room, she said. 
“You’ve heard that ensuring patients on Medicaid can return to Planned Parenthood is a matter of life and death,” Boyd said. “Please know this is not an exaggeration. For many people, myself included, that was the reality we faced following Planned Parenthood being kicked out of the federal Medicaid program.”
More than 150 PPRM volunteers and reproductive rights advocates have come to the Capitol to support the bill over the course of the special session, according to Teter. 
“Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains is an essential, irreplaceable piece of Colorado’s primary and reproductive health care system,” said Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat and one of the bill’s sponsors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The American Southwest – including Arizona, New Mexico, and portions of Nevada, Colorado, Utah and California – is linked to one of four continental-scale “mega-drying” regions worldwide that have undergone unprecedented rates of drying, according to a recent study in Science Advances.
The loss of freshwater from the regions is the result of two key factors: severe droughts and groundwater overuse.
Two decades of satellite observations revealed that as the dry areas of the world become drier and surface water in rivers and lakes declines, communities are becoming more reliant on groundwater, leading to rapid depletion of freshwater.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The lower Colorado River Basin – which supplies water for Nevada, Arizona, and California – has lost groundwater equivalent to Lake Mead’s full storage capacity in the last 20 years, or about 28 million acre-feet of water. An acre-foot of water is enough to supply roughly two urban households with indoor and outdoor water needs for a year.
“All the drying is happening in the Southwest. Three quarters of the country is getting a little bit wetter, but the southwestern quadrant of the country is getting a lot drier,” said Jay Fagmiglietti, the study co-author and Global Futures Professor at Arizona State’s School of Sustainability.
Even areas in the U.S. that are experiencing more precipitation are not keeping pace with the rate of rapid drying, leading to a net loss of freshwater, according to the study. The areas experiencing drying have increased, while the areas experiencing wetting have decreased.
Globally, drying land is expanding by about two times the size of California every year, according to the study.
The four “mega drying” regions globally are Alaska and Northern Canada, Northern Russia, Middle East/North Africa/PanEurasia, and Southwestern North America and Central America.
The research is especially noteworthy for Nevada, where about half the state’s counties rely on groundwater for more than 80% of their water supply, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. In 2015 Esmeralda, Eureka, Lincoln, Mineral and Nye counties received more than 95% of their water from groundwater.
  Mega-drying on the continents: 1 Northern Canada and Alaska; 2. Northern Russia; 3. Southwestern North America and Central America; 4. Middle East/North Africa/PanEurasia. (Map from “Unprecedented continental drying, shrinking freshwater availability, and increasing land contributions to sea level rise,” Science Advances, July, 2025)
Throughout several parts of Nevada, significantly more groundwater is extracted than is returned to aquifers each year, leading to declining water levels. About 20% of Nevada’s groundwater basins are currently over-pumped, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources.
Despite the state’s dependence on groundwater, Nevada lacks detailed data on available groundwater. Water managers in Nevada currently rely on water budget estimates developed 50 to 70 years ago, raising major concerns about the accuracy of groundwater availability, according to the Nevada state agency.
The consequences of groundwater depletion in the Southwest include reduced irrigation water supply and threats to agricultural productivity, reduced capacity for climate adaptation, and damage to groundwater dependent ecosystems.
Most of Nevada’s rivers, streams, and lakes are groundwater dependent. Groundwater also plays a crucial role in supporting the state’s unique ecosystems. There are 242 wetland-dependent species recorded by Nevada Division of Natural Heritage – 143 of which can only be found in Nevada.
A growing awareness of ground water as a critical natural resource has raised several research questions: How much ground water do we have? Are we running out? Where are ground-water resources most stressed by human development?
Fagmiglietti said the study was conceived to answer some of those questions and prepare water managers for a drier future.
About 75% of the world’s population lives in the 101 countries that make up the four mega-drying regions, according to the study.
Researchers used satellites to measure changes in gravity to detect weight loss or gain in regions, indicating groundwater depletion or prolonged drought.
The research team said global drying is not slowing down. Their data indicates groundwater was lost three times faster over the last decade than in the prior one.
The loss of groundwater is also contributing more to global sea level rise than melting glaciers and ice caps, according to the study. Increased runoff from groundwater pumping and glacier melting contributes to the ocean’s water levels, exacerbating sea level rise.
“Drying continents themselves are now contributing, they’re the largest contributor to sea level rise, ahead of either the Greenland or the Antarctic ice sheet,” Fagmiglietti said.
“We pump groundwater for irrigation. And a lot of that, you know, doesn’t make it back into the ground. It evaporates, or it runs off, and ultimately ends up in the ocean,” he said.
The study also points to a tipping point during the “mega El-Niño” years around 2014 to 2015 when equatorial waters in the Pacific were 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above average. During that period climate extremes began to accelerate, leading to more groundwater usage to cover the lack of rainfall.
Fagmiglietti emphasized the critical importance of groundwater in drying regions and the need for better management and protection. Groundwater is often unprotected and unmonitored, Fagmiglietti said, making it at risk in many regions around the world. States need to recognize the importance of groundwater and enforce effective management policies.
“Communities that depend on groundwater entirely, again, need to understand that that groundwater is disappearing rapidly. They need to understand what their supply looks like and need to prioritize how they’re going to use it and try to sustain it,” he said.
Last week, federal officials announced they would continue water allocation cuts on the Colorado River for the fifth consecutive year following a persistent drought that has shrunken Lake Mead, the river’s largest reservoir. Persistent drought like the one impacting the reservoir will only put more pressure on groundwater, said Fagmiglietti.
“No one ever talks about the groundwater, especially when it comes to the Colorado River. Discussion is always about the reservoirs and the river itself, but really thinking holistically about how much water you have in the region is really, really important, and in particular with the increased stress that will happen on groundwater,” Fagmiglietti said.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Summer heat is bearing down on U.S. prisons, where temperatures in uncooled cells can climb well into the triple digits.
Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Some upgrades
At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
‘More miserable’
Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
Future legal battles
Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Lawmakers change funding source for health insurance bill in special session


By: Sara Wilson - Sunday August 24, 2025 12:46 pm





Lawmakers now want to sell additional tax credits instead of borrowing from the state’s unclaimed property fund to shore up the Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise fund, which pays for programs to reduce individual insurance market premiums.
House Bill 25B-1006 aims to raise $100 million for that enterprise to soften the impact of the expiration of federal enhanced premium tax credits. Health insurance premiums for people who buy it on the individual market are expected to face an average of a 28% increase next year, with higher increases along the Western Slope.
HIAE funds the state’s reinsurance for claims from high-cost individuals, subsidies for carriers on the state’s Health Insurance Exchange and the state’s OmniSalud program for undocumented people.
It is possible Congress will extend or partially restore the federal enhanced premium tax credit in question, in which case the loan considered in the bill wouldn’t happen.
The bill originally planned to borrow money from the state’s Unclaimed Property Trust Fund. That is how it passed the House, but the funding mechanism was amended in the Senate Finance Committee on Sunday morning.
“We worked with the treasurer’s office to do this, broadening the pool to make sure we’re not
The state’s treasury department would tap a third-party vendor to sell the tax credits to insurance companies and C corporations during this fiscal year. The credits would allow companies to essentially get a discount on future tax liabilities to the tune of 80 cents on the dollar — the department could sell up to $100 million in credits that would then have a face value of $125 million.
“This $100 million is going to have a meaningful impact on folks,” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway told lawmakers on Sunday morning. “But it’s not going to replace everything at the federal level. It’s not even close.”
The bill would give the Legislature some time and breathing room to come up with a “sustainable solution,” Conway said.
It is a similar strategy to another bill on the table this special session to raise revenue for the state’s General Fund.
The Legislature also allowed the treasury department to sell tax credits to fund loans for small businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
HB25B-1006 now needs to get through the Senate Appropriations Committee.

The bills focus on raising additional state tax revenue to help close the state’s nearly $800 million budget hole, which was triggered by federal tax code changes.

House Democrats use chamber rule to end lengthy debate on tax bills


By: Sara Wilson -  3:46 pm





House Democrats used a seldom-used chamber rule to prevent debate on four of the bills after Republicans spoke at length about the first pair of bills. They used House Rule 16 to call the question — end debate and immediately vote on the bill in question — as debate on the second bill on the agenda extended past an hour.
Before that, Rep. Sean Camacho, a Denver Democrat, accused Republicans of filibustering.
“If every member on this side of the room,” he said, motioning to the Republican caucus, “uses your full allotted 10 minutes to filibuster on bills instead of doing the people’s work, that costs the state $283.” He was referring to the extra cost of operating the Colorado Capitol during a special legislative session.
The remark drew anger from Republicans.
“I will not let them be accused of wasting the people’s time when they are telling the story of their district,” Assistant Minority Leader Ty Winter, a Trinidad Republican, said.
“Don’t make our fighting four our constituents to be a cheap trick,” he said.
Democratic leadership then used Rule 16 on the next four bills, and they all passed. Members are typically allotted ten minutes each ahead of the final vote on a bill, meaning that if all 21 Republicans used their time, debate would be over three hours per bill.
The House is now doing initial debate and votes on the five bills that made it through committee yesterday. Democratic leadership limited floor debate to one hour per bill.









Colorado Legislature begins third day of special session


By: Sara Wilson -  12:27 pm





The House began work on the third day of the special legislative session around 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. The plan is do final votes on a series of tax-related bills and send them over to the Senate for consideration.
Their first vote, after about two hours of debate, was a 43-19 approval of House Bill 25B-1001, which would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deduction on state taxes.
In federal law, some businesses can deduct up to 20% of their QBI for their taxes. It was set to expire this year, but the recent federal tax and spending law extended that tax deduction. The bill would continue to decouple Colorado from the deduction, so taxpayers making above $500,000 individually or $1,000,000 jointly would need to add back that federal deduction for their state taxes.
Republicans argued that the federal deduction is important for small business owners in the state.
“This bill removes a key deduction passed in federal law. It’s a deduction designed to level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses,” Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, said.
But bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, countered that the bill just maintains the status quo in Colorado tax code.
“They still get this benefit at the federal level. In this bill, we’re not making tax policy change. We are simply extending our current tax policy,” she said.
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it will raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
The House has five more bills on its calendar for final votes today. It will likely then head into initial debate on the bills cleared through committee yesterday.









Amended AI bill proposes to delay implementation of 2024 law


By: Sara Wilson - Friday August 22, 2025 5:36 pm





House Bill 25B-1008, one of the dueling artificial intelligence bills introduced by Colorado lawmakers during the special session, was gutted during its House Appropriations Committee hearing on Friday afternoon to become a simple extension of the controversial 2024 law’s effective date.
The bill would now push implementation of Senate Bill 24-205 until October 2026, rather than February 2026. The change was approved on an 8-3 bipartisan vote and now heads to the full House for debate.
“That’s where we are, so that we as a Legislature can come back to this issue and have a proper discussion when have time during a session. Doing this during a special session is quite difficult,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, said. “I’m asking that we move out the date so we can do this responsibly during the next session.”

Colorado Democrats want to raise revenue for food assistance program during special session


By: Sara Wilson -  4:00 pm





Colorado voters could be asked this November whether the state can keep extra tax money to fully fund universal school meals and offset lost federal funding for food assistance programs.
The Legislature referred Proposition MM to the ballot during its regular lawmaking session earlier this year, seeking to raise more money for the Healthy School Meals for All program. Senate Bill 25B-3, being considered during the current special session, would tweak that proposition to allow any leftover money to cover costs associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Senate ends work for the day as House sets slugglish pace for bill debate


By: Sara Wilson -  3:55 pm





As of mid-afternoon on Friday, the Senate had adjourned and the House broke into committee work after moving through just two bills in floor debate.
Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill from Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, was originally scheduled for its appropriations committee hearing, but that is now delayed as sponsors work through possible amendments.  The bill has an approximate $7 million annual price tag to retain more employees in the Office of Information and Technology and Judicial Department.
The Senate will continue work on Saturday.
The other AI bill, favored by moderates and the governor, is set for its own appropriations committee hearing in the House later on Friday afternoon.
The House got through two bills for initial floor debate and voice votes in four hours. The chamber recessed around 2 p.m. for committee work, including for those four bills passed in the Senate on Friday morning.

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

[…],"A member of the National Guard arrives at the Guard’s headquarters at the D.C. Armory on Tuesday, Aug. 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)Gov. Henry McMaster has deployed 200 S.C. National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to “restore law and order” even though South Carolina itself has one of the highest murder rates in the nation.
McMaster and state leaders should deal seriously with South Carolina’s own longstanding violent crime issues before they try to solve Washington’s problems.
And there’s no need to deploy the S.C. National Guard. Just deploy common sense.
The S.C. Guard’s mission in Washington is a bad idea. National Guard units are not trained to police American streets.
The state-based Guard has two main duties: responding to natural disasters and mobilizing, when needed, in time of war, according to the guard’s website.
The guard assists local and state authorities in disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. The guard also plays a role in search and rescue operations, and in riot control. And it can be called up if the country is at war.
It’s certainly true that the guard has been used for other purposes — such as the 250 South Carolina guard troops currently at the southern border — but the question remains whether guard troops are qualified to be street police. Using them as police risks blurring the line between military and civilian authority.
Most Americans, like the Founding Fathers, are wary of a militaristic intervention on U.S. soil in peacetime. Local Washington D.C. officials, of course, did not request military support and appear to have been completely ignored. This undermines democratic governance and home rule in a city that already lacks full statehood representation.
Local officials and residents argue that the troops are a response to a manufactured crisis, with some residents reporting that they feel unsafe.
South Carolina Democrats are right also that the state shouldn’t send out our National Guard troops when they might be needed here during hurricane season.
At best, sending the S.C. Guard to Washington is a waste of resources; at worst, it poses a danger to residents of the district and our own guard troops.
South Carolina should butt out of this misguided crusade in Washington.
We’ve got plenty of crime problems right here at home, including the eighth-highest murder rate in the nation, when including Washington, D.C., at 11.3 homicides per 100,000 people in South Carolina. In overall violent crime, South Carolina ranked ninth in 2023.
The first duty
The homicide rate has fallen nationwide and in South Carolina over the past few years — a hopeful trend.
But it remains near-historic highs.
McMaster said he deployed the troops to Washington to “restore law and order” and “ensure safety for all who live, work, and visit there,” according to reporting by S.C. Daily Gazette Editor Seanna Adcox.
Those are fine sentiments from McMaster, but a governor’s first duty is to protect the citizens of his own state.
In recent years, at least four South Carolina counties — Dillion, Lee, Allendale and Hampton counties — exceeded Washington’s 2024 murder rate, according to the state Department of Public Health.
These counties and all of South Carolina’s counties don’t need militaristic intervention but rather sustained support and partnership.
It begins with listening to South Carolina law enforcement. Advocates have expressed alarm over “historic staffing shortages” in South Carolina law enforcement. Helping police departments and sheriff’s office reach a full-staffing level would be a vital step in reducing violent crime.
Instead of cutting taxes every year, McMaster and state lawmakers should invest in more funding not only for local law enforcement but also for mental health and substance abuse programs.
State leaders also need to focus on South Carolina’s notorious gun violence problem.
Firearms account for more than 80% of homicides in South Carolina.
A lot can be done to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. One study based on 25 years of evidence found that states with universal background checks had homicide rates 15% lower than states without them.
South Carolina also needs safe storage laws and meaningful red flag laws.
Red flag laws, also known as extreme risk protection order laws, allow courts to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed a threat to themselves or others. Attempts to introduce red flag laws in South Carolina have so far failed.
State lawmakers also should finally close the so-called “Charleston loophole” that allowed Dylann Roof to purchase a gun that he used to murder nine worshipers at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015.
A comprehensive 2019 study from Boston University found that “universal background checks, permit requirements, ‘may issue’ laws (where local authorities have discretion in approving who can carry a concealed weapon), and laws banning people convicted of violent misdemeanors from possessing firearms are, individually and collectively, significantly able to reduce gun-related deaths.”
Sending National Guard troops to Washington makes for eye-catching political theater but reducing South Carolina’s high violent crime rate requires something far more challenging: a serious and sustained commitment by principled state leaders to proven anti-crime solutions.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/nationalguarddc-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-24 13:56:31.990495

Photograph by John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

His ex-wife, afraid for the lives of her family members and herself, said it was a lie.
Montesi’s ex-wife had sought a domestic violence protection order against him, alleging in a court petition that he arrived at her home in a rage one spring day, swinging an ax and threatening to kill her. He warned that she should “think twice before messing with him” because he has a “safe full of guns,” she recalled. 
A court commissioner ordered Montesi to turn his firearms over to the King County Sheriff’s Office. Despite the court order, a judge found that about 13 of his firearms remained unaccounted for — assault rifles, hunting rifles, handguns, a shotgun and an AR-15. 
Instead of surrendering the missing guns, Montesi argued that Washington’s firearm surrender law requiring him to do so violates his Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure, citing a November 2022 Washington Court of Appeals ruling known as the Flannery decision.
The Flannery decision, which said an earlier version of the state’s firearm surrender law was unconstitutional under the Fourth and Fifth Amendment, has been similarly cited by judges throughout Washington as preventing them from ordering alleged abusers to give up their weapons, court records show.
Now, the barriers created by Flannery could be knocked down. In one of the clearest rulings to date on the constitutionality of Washington’s firearm surrender law in protection order cases, the state Court of Appeals rejected Montesi’s argument, concluding that the law is constitutional. 
While federal law prohibits some alleged domestic abusers from having guns, Washington — along with 21 other states — has gone a step further, requiring judges to order people subject to certain domestic violence protection orders to surrender their firearms to law enforcement. Victim advocates are hopeful that the recent ruling, issued on June 30, will prompt judges to enforce the law. But so far, legislative efforts to do the same have had limited success. 
Even after state lawmakers updated the firearm surrender law in 2021 and again in 2023 with a “Flannery Fix” aimed at resolving Flannery’s self-incrimination concerns, some judicial officers — including all of those in the Pierce County Superior Court — still aren’t issuing firearm surrender orders in domestic violence protection order cases, according to a recent poll of Washington’s 39 superior courts conducted by InvestigateWest. The Cowlitz County Superior Court had not been issuing firearm surrender orders until recently, when some judicial officers began ordering surrenders again on a case by case basis due to the Montesi decision.
“The bench is and will continue to be discussing the Montesi decision,” Cowlitz County Superior Court Administrator Danyel Paul wrote in a statement to InvestigateWest.
Some superior courts, including Adams County and Grays Harbor County, responded that they do issue firearm surrender orders, but sparingly. In Clark County, Presiding Judge Derek Vanderwood said the superior court began issuing the orders again in January — a few months after a Vancouver mother of three, Carissa Larkin, was shot and killed by her ex-fiance. Larkin had obtained a protection order against her abuser, but the court hadn’t ordered him to turn in his guns due to the Flannery decision, The Columbian reported.
Montesi, who declined to comment through his attorney, is now asking the state Supreme Court to hear his case. If the ruling stands, victim advocates, attorneys and legal experts say it would reaffirm an assertion that they’ve been making for years: that the Flannery decision, which centered on a criminal assault case and an outdated state law, should never have been broadly applied to civil protection order cases.
“I think the Flannery decision, there was some room for interpretation about what they meant by it. I think that’s why you saw different trial courts making different decisions,” said King County Superior Court Presiding Judge Ketu Shah. The King County court has continued issuing firearm surrender orders after Flannery. “In other jurisdictions, there’s stronger passion around firearm rights and Second Amendment rights, and so they want to litigate that more and see where the limits are.” 
Shah noted that the Montesi ruling — decided in a civil protection order case — gives courts more direct legal guidance.
“Montesi is pretty clear. It’s right on the point of what these rights are and whether they infringe on those rights. And they found the statute does not infringe on those rights,” he said.
For some attorneys and victim advocates, courts’ decisions not to issue firearm surrender orders seem to have more to do with political will than with upholding the law.
“What it looked like to me that the courts were doing was just saying, ‘Oh, sorry, it’s out of my hands. Flannery prevents me from issuing a weapon surrender,’” said Benjamin Gould, an attorney who represented Montesi’s ex-wife. “You are, in effect, completely ignoring Washington law as passed by the Legislature. And that is very troubling.”
A controversial legal analysis
Ever since the Washington State Legislature unanimously passed a 2014 law to remove guns from the hands of domestic abusers, that law has drawn constitutional challenges. 
The firearm surrender law requires courts to order the relinquishment of guns in certain circumstances, such as when an individual has a domestic violence protection order against them and is believed to be a threat to the protected person or their child’s safety. Judges have discretion in other circumstances, like when there’s evidence that there will likely be a serious and imminent threat to a person’s health and safety without a surrender order.  
One of the first major rulings on the state law’s constitutionality came in 2022. Dwayne Flannery, a Kitsap County man accused of beating and choking his girlfriend, argued that an order to surrender weapons would force him to illegally search his own home for guns and potentially incriminate himself by admitting to having firearms, which he wasn’t allowed to have under a no-contact order. The Court of Appeals agreed with Flannery and dropped the weapons surrender order.
Judges across Washington immediately raised questions about how the Flannery decision would impact civil protection order cases. Unlike no-contact orders, which are issued in criminal matters, civil protection orders are filed by individuals seeking to keep alleged abusers away from them, even if no criminal charges have been filed. To be granted a protection order, victims must only demonstrate that it’s more likely than not that the abuse occurred.
Upon a judge’s request, a team of attorneys at the Washington State Administrative Office of the Courts, which supports judges across the state, sent two memorandums analyzing the Flannery decision to Cowlitz County judges. Although the office says the memos are meant to be confidential and aren’t official guidance for the courts as a whole, the analysis was widely circulated among attorneys and included in a public 2024 State of the Judiciary report. 
The memos concluded Washington’s firearm surrender law likely violates the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. An immunity provision added to Washington’s firearm surrender law in 2021 likely would not provide “complete protection” from self-incrimination because it only protects against prosecution for certain crimes, the analysis says. It also likened surrender orders to a “warrantless search” under the Fourth Amendment — a characterization that many attorneys representing domestic violence victims disagree with.
“You’re complying with a court order. In this case, the court order says, ‘Go get your guns. You can’t have them.’ But they’re calling that an unlawful search, which is a very creative interpretation,” said Washington state Rep. Lauren Davis, D-Shoreline, who sponsored the 2023 Flannery Fix bill. 
Karla Carlisle, a managing attorney with the Northwest Justice Project, a nonprofit legal aid program in Washington, said constitutional protections against unreasonable searches are aimed at preventing the government from violating a person’s reasonable expectation of privacy — not at individuals who are asked to turn over their firearms to ensure a victim’s safety.
“No search occurs when a trial court grants an order to surrender weapons,” Carlisle argued in a July 2023 appellate court filing. “The orders are served the same way any other legal process is served, and to the extent a respondent locates and surrenders firearms from their own home, there is no governmental intrusion into the privacy of the person’s home.”
Yet following the memos’ release, Carlisle said she saw a “wave across the state” of courts refusing to issue weapon surrender orders.
“Those memos were very damaging because I think they came to trial court judges with the authority and approval from the Administrative Office of the Courts,” she said. “So a lot of judges, I think, took that for face value and didn’t do their own analysis.”

In Cowlitz County, judicial officers started crossing out the weapons surrender section of the protection order and penciling in “State v. Flannery.” A Benton County judge rescinded and terminated a firearm surrender order that had been granted to a domestic violence survivor the year before, citing Flannery.
The Pierce County Superior Court edited its protection order paperwork to remove all firearm surrender language. Now when a person requests a firearm surrender, the court instead gives them a document titled, “Findings on Weapons Surrender.” It informs them that the court is not issuing surrender orders because doing so would “by its very nature” subject the respondent to potential self-incrimination and unreasonable searches and seizures.
To ensure compliance with the law, the Flannery Fix also requires the Administrative Office of the Courts to report annually on the number of firearm surrender orders issued by each court. But the office is still not doing so. A disclaimer on the office’s website explains that because data is unevenly collected across jurisdictions, the office believes that reports “would not accurately convey the reality of enforcement practices across the state.” To address this, the office says it is overhauling the way that it receives and reports protection order data.
Davis said she plans to continue working on legislation to protect domestic violence survivors from gun violence. But there’s only so much that legislators like her can do, she added.
“For the most part, we actually have pretty solid words on paper,” Davis said. “They’re just not being followed.”
The Montesi decision
Attorneys like Carlisle and Gould are hopeful that courts will see the Montesi ruling as limiting the Flannery decision’s application in civil protection order cases. The Pierce and Cowlitz County superior court benches are now reviewing the Montesi decision to determine its impact on firearm surrender orders going forward, according to the courts’ administrators.
Anne Levinson, a retired Washington judge who has helped author several state bills to protect domestic violence survivors, said the decision gives judges a clearer guide than Flannery for how to handle firearm surrender requests in civil cases. 
“The Montesi case is a more current case, more on point for orders that are issued as part of the civil protection order process,” Levinson said. “It can and should be applied by courts across the state.”
In addition to the Fourth and Fifth Amendment issues, the state Court of Appeals also rejected Montesi’s argument that the weapons surrender statute infringes upon Montesi’s right to bear arms. This issue was directly addressed in a June 2024 U.S. Supreme Court decision, United States v. Rahimi, which ruled that a federal law prohibiting people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms is constitutional under the Second Amendment.
Still, it remains to be seen whether the Montesi ruling will clear the path for weapons surrender orders in Washington. Although the ruling affirms that the state law is constitutional, it’s only binding for lower courts in Division I of the Court of Appeals, where the decision took place, according to Shah. This includes King, Snohomish, Skagit, Island, San Juan and Whatcom counties. For counties outside of this division, the ruling can provide guidance for judicial officers but does not necessarily need to be followed, Shah noted. The Flannery decision, meanwhile, took place in Division II, which covers several of the superior courts that had stopped issuing firearm surrender orders, including Pierce, Cowlitz and Clark.
Some legal experts, including Carlisle, dispute this interpretation of Court of Appeals rulings, arguing that appellate court decisions like Montesi are binding for all trial courts throughout the state.
Other similar cases involving firearm surrender orders are also pending before the Court of Appeals. If those decisions conflict with the Montesi decision, that could set up a legal dispute for the Washington Supreme Court to resolve. But for that to happen, the state Supreme Court would first have to agree to hear a case. It has so far declined at least two motions filed by women fleeing their intimate partners — including one by Montesi’s ex-wife — that argued the life-or-death urgency of the issue warrants direct intervention by the high court. 
On July 31, Montesi tried again to put the issue in front of the state Supreme Court, arguing that the appellate court made a mistake by ruling that the Legislature’s Flannery Fix resolves the law’s Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations. The high court has not yet decided whether it will hear the case.
Mary Welch, an attorney and statewide advocacy counsel for the Northwest Justice Project, said that while she’s optimistic about the Montesi ruling, she’s remaining vigilant of how future courts may act. She initially thought that the constitutionality concerns over Washington’s firearm surrender law would be resolved with the U.S. Supreme Court’s Rahimi decision, until judges began using Flannery to justify not issuing the orders. 
“I kind of feel like this is just going to be a continuous battle,” Welch said. “It’s whack-a-mole. We’re gonna knock Flannery down for sure — something else is gonna pop its head up, and then we’re gonna have to do something about that.”

The conservative comic strip was published in my local paper Aug. 9, ironically the 80th anniversary of America’s cataclysmic A-bomb attack on the Japanese city of Nagasaki in 1945, one of history’s most alarming — and also among the most catastrophic and morally fraught — demonstrations of science’s jaw-dropping, world-transforming power.
The long, excruciatingly detailed path to creating a working atomic bomb included countless small research and development steps — as science requires — any number of which might have been seen by nonscientists as incomprehensible, if not pointless.
Which brings us to the recent “Mallard Fillmore” cartoon’s take on a Duke University study, released this July. The study concluded that caloric intake is a far more significant culprit in obesity than how much energy a person expends, or not, in their daily life.


To which, Mallard said, in effect: duh.
Here’s the cartoon’s text:
“A new study from Duke University has revealed that obesity is closely linked to a poor diet, which is fascinating, because without this study, we might have never known that Duke even had a department of observing the blindingly obvious while accepting hundreds of millions in federal research grants.”
Two phrases in that ’toon text jump out: “a poor diet” and “blindingly obvious.” Note that the Duke study found obesity predominant in advanced nations that enjoy abundant and varied, not “poor,” diets. Also, science is intrinsically skeptical because supposedly “blindingly obvious” truths have been proved staggeringly wrong over millennia, including the Bible’s casual acknowledgement that the Sun revolves around the Earth. Pioneer scientists Nikolas Copernicus and Galileo Galilei (and others) proved irrefutably in the Middle Ages, much to the chagrin of the monolithic Catholic Church, that the opposite is true.
So, a widely popular cartoonist’s ignorant denigration of science in the 21st century is a problem, as was the Catholic Church’s debasement and banishment of Galileo to house arrest for the rest of his life and a prohibition from discussing or teaching his “heliocentric” theory that the Sun sits at the center of the solar system, orbited by all the planets, including Earth. For thousands of years, the learned consensus had been that not only did the Sun orbit Earth, the Earth was the center of the entire universe.
This kind of intellectual suppression born of science-wary ideology is still with us in the modern world. We mustn’t forget, for example, that the president of the United States a few years ago urged Americans to consider injecting bleach as a curative for COVID-19, which was devastating the nation and world at the time. 
Ultimately, about a million Americans died during the pandemic, which was finally blunted not by bleach or other fraudulent, harebrained “treatments” but by miraculously effective vaccines developed by scientists in record time — vaccines now being undermined by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Donald Trump’s vehemently anti-vax U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services. Kennedy, in his first six months on the job and after telling Congress, under oath, that he would not undermine vaccines, removed all vaccine and infectious disease experts from the federal Center for Disease Control’s independent and essential Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Replacements included vaccine deniers.
This is numbskull ideology warring against settled science. Vaccines have saved untold millions of lives worldwide over many decades. Decades of countless respected studies have roundly debunked the vaccine fears of Kennedy and his ilk. The overwhelming conclusion of research is that vaccines are demonstrably safe and also don’t cause autism, another favorite Kennedy bugaboo.
Which brings me back to obesity, Mallard Fillmore, and South Dakota’s relationship with rotundity, and why a comic strip’s unfounded denigration of science about obesity matters. A 2011 study report available in the National Library of Medicine, titled “The obesity epidemic in South Dakota: how big is the problem?” reported that 30.3% of the state’s adults self-reported being obese (based on the body mass index), a rate then “higher than the national prevalence and also increasing at a faster rate than other states.” By 2023, the state’s adult obese population increased more than five points to 36%, making South Dakota tied for the 11th highest rate of obesity in the U.S.
So, Mallard Fillmore aside, we don’t know whether South Dakotans are relatively rotund because they eat too much, move too little, or have chubby genes. Or something else entirely.
But the place to find the answer is nuanced science, not ill-informed, snarky cartoons.

More than a thousand people were expected to seek free dental, medical and vision care at the two-day event in the rural and financially struggling area of western Virginia. RAM provides free medical care through mobile clinics in underserved, isolated, or impoverished communities around the country and world. As health care continues to be a contentious issue in America, an estimated 29 million Americans, about one in 10, lack coverage.  An estimated 27 million people — or 8.3 percent of the population of America- were uninsured, according to a report from the Census Bureau.  This rate is considerably high in rural and poorer parts of the country. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.

In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “… But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.


“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 
‘An unprecedented time’
State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid — for herself and daughter Oakleigh McDonald — before she lost coverage in 2023.(Tommy Martino for KFF Health News)ST. IGNATIUS—Jonnell Wieder earned too much money at her job to keep her Medicaid coverage when the COVID-19 public health emergency ended in 2023 and states resumed checking whether people were eligible for the program. But she was reassured by the knowledge that Medicaid would provide postpartum coverage for her and her daughter, Oakleigh McDonald, who was born in July of that year.
Wieder is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana and can access some health services free of charge through her tribe’s health clinics. But funding is limited, so, like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid for herself and Oakleigh.
Months before Oakleigh’s 1st birthday, the date when Wieder’s postpartum coverage would come to an end, Wieder completed and returned paperwork to enroll her daughter in Healthy Montana Kids, the state’s version of the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But her paperwork, caught up in the lengthy delays and processing times for applications, did not go through.
“As soon as she turned 1, they cut her off completely,” Wieder said.
It took six months for Wieder to get Oakleigh covered again through Healthy Montana Kids. Before health workers in her tribe stepped in to help her resubmit her application, Wieder repeatedly called the state’s health department. She said she would dial the call center when she arrived at her job in the morning and go about her work while waiting on hold, only for the call to be dropped by the end of the day.
“Never did I talk to anybody,” she said.
Wieder and Oakleigh’s experience is an example of the chaos for eligible Medicaid beneficiaries caused by the process known as the “unwinding,” which led to millions of people in the U.S. losing coverage due to paperwork or other procedural issues. Now, tribal health leaders fear their communities will experience more health coverage disruptions when new federal Medicaid work and eligibility requirements are implemented by the start of 2027.
The tax-and-spending law that President Donald Trump signed this summer exempts Native Americans from the new requirement that some people work or do another qualifying activity a minimum number of hours each month to be eligible for Medicaid, as well as from more frequent eligibility checks. But as Wieder and her daughter’s experience shows, they are not exempt from getting caught up in procedural disenrollments that could reemerge as states implement the new rules.
“We also know from the unwinding that that just doesn’t always play out necessarily correctly in practice,” said Joan Alker, who leads Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. “There’s a lot to worry about.”
The new law is projected to increase the number of people who are uninsured by 10 million.
The lessons of the unwinding suggest that “deep trouble” lies ahead for Native Americans who rely on Medicaid, according to Alker.
  Changes to Medicaid 

Trump’s new law changes Medicaid rules to require some recipients ages 19 to 64 to log 80 hours of work or other qualifying activities per month. It also requires states to recheck those recipients’ eligibility every six months, instead of annually. Both of these changes will be effective by the end of next year.
The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that the law would reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion during the course of a decade. In addition, more than 4 million people enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to become uninsured if Congress allows pandemic-era enhanced premium tax credits to expire at the end of the year.
Wieder said she was lucky that the tribe covered costs and her daughter’s care wasn’t interrupted in the six months she didn’t have health insurance. Citizens of federally recognized tribes in the U.S. can access some free health services through the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.
But free care is limited because Congress has historically failed to fully fund the Indian Health Service. Tribal health systems rely heavily on Medicaid to fill that gap. Native Americans are enrolled in Medicaid at higher rates than the white population and have higher rates of chronic illnesses, die more from preventable diseases, and have less access to care.
Medicaid is the largest third-party payer to the Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities and organizations. Accounting for about two-thirds of the outside revenue the Indian Health Service collects, it helps tribal health organizations pay their staff, maintain or expand services, and build infrastructure. Tribal leaders say protecting Medicaid for Indian Country is a responsibility Congress and the federal government must fulfill as part of their trust and treaty obligations to tribes.
  Lessons Learned During the Unwinding 

The Trump administration prevented states from disenrolling most Medicaid recipients for the duration of the public health emergency starting in 2020. After those eligibility checks resumed in 2023, nearly 27 million people nationwide were disenrolled from Medicaid during the unwinding, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office published in June. The majority of disenrollments — about 70% — occurred for procedural reasons, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
CMS did not require state agencies to collect race and ethnicity data for their reporting during the unwinding, making it difficult to determine how many Native American and Alaska Native enrollees lost coverage.
The lack of data to show how the unwinding affected the population makes it difficult to identify disparities and create policies to address them, said Latoya Hill, senior policy manager with KFF’s Racial Equity and Health Policy program. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.
The National Council of Urban Indian Health, which advocates on public health issues for Native Americans living in urban parts of the nation, analyzed the Census Bureau’s 2022 American Community Survey and KFF data in an effort to understand how disenrollment affected tribes. The council estimated more than 850,000 Native Americans had lost coverage as of May 2024. About 2.7 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, according to the council.
The National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that represents and advocates for federally recognized tribes, has been working with federal Medicaid officials to ensure that state agencies are prepared to implement the exemptions.
“We learned a lot of lessons about state capacity during the unwinding,” said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.
Nevada health officials say they plan to apply lessons learned during the unwinding and launch a public education campaign on the Medicaid changes in the new federal law. “A lot of this will depend on anticipated federal guidance regarding the implementation of those new rules,” said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority.
Staff at the Fallon Tribal Health Center in Nevada have become authorized representatives for some of their patients. This means that tribal citizens’ Medicaid paperwork is sent to the health center, allowing staff to notify individuals and help them fill it out.
Davis said the unwinding process showed that Native American enrollees are uniquely vulnerable to procedural disenrollment. The new law’s exemption of Native Americans from work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks is the “bare minimum” to ensure unnecessary disenrollments are avoided as part of trust and treaty obligations, Davis said.
  Eligibility Checks Are ‘Complex’ and ‘Vulnerable to Error’ 

The GAO said the process of determining whether individuals are eligible for Medicaid is “complex” and “vulnerable to error” in a 2024 report on the unwinding.
“The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations on such a large scale further compounded this complexity,” the report said.
It highlighted weaknesses across state systems. By April 2024, federal Medicaid officials had found nearly all states were out of compliance with redetermination requirements, according to the GAO. Eligible people lost their coverage, the accountability office said, highlighting the need to improve federal oversight.
In Texas, for example, federal Medicaid officials found that 100,000 eligible people had been disenrolled due to, for example, the state system’s failure to process their completed renewal forms or miscalculation of the length of women’s postpartum coverage.
Some states were not conducting ex parte renewals, in which a person’s Medicaid coverage is automatically renewed based on existing information available to the state. That reduces the chance that paperwork is sent to the wrong address, because the recipient doesn’t need to complete or return renewal forms.
But poorly conducted ex parte renewals can lead to procedural disenrollments, too. More than 100,000 people in Nevada were disenrolled by September 2023 through the ex parte process. The state had been conducting the ex parte renewals at the household level, rather than by individual beneficiary, resulting in the disenrollment of still-eligible children because their parents were no longer eligible. Ninety-three percent of disenrollments in the state were for procedural reasons — the highest in the nation, according to KFF.
Another issue the federal agency identified was that some state agencies were not giving enrollees the opportunity to submit their renewal paperwork through all means available, including mail, phone, online, and in person.
State agencies also identified challenges they faced during the unwinding, including an unprecedented volume of eligibility redeterminations, insufficient staffing and training, and a lack of response from enrollees who may not have been aware of the unwinding.
Native Americans and Alaska Natives have unique challenges in maintaining their coverage.
Communities in rural parts of the nation experience issues with receiving and sending mail. Some Native Americans on reservations may not have street addresses. Others may not have permanent housing or change addresses frequently. In Alaska, mail service is often disrupted by severe weather. Another issue is the lack of reliable internet service on remote reservations.
Tribal health leaders and patient benefit coordinators said some tribal citizens did not receive their redetermination paperwork or struggled to fill it out and send it back to their state Medicaid agency.
 The Aftermath 

Although the unwinding is over, many challenges persist.
Tribal health workers in Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota said some eligible patients who lost Medicaid during the unwinding had still not been reenrolled as of this spring.
“Even today, we’re still in the trenches of getting individuals that had been disenrolled back onto Medicaid,” said Rachel Arthur, executive director of the Indian Family Health Clinic in Great Falls, Montana, in May.
Arthur said staff at the clinic realized early in the unwinding that their patients were not receiving their redetermination notices in the mail. The clinic is identifying people who fell off Medicaid during the unwinding and helping them fill out applications.
Marlena Farnes, who was a patient benefit coordinator at the Indian Family Health Clinic during the Medicaid unwinding, said she tried for months to help an older patient with a chronic health condition get back on Medicaid. He had completed and returned his paperwork but still received a notice that his coverage had lapsed. After many calls to the state Medicaid office, Farnes said, state officials told her the patient’s application had been lost.
Another patient went to the emergency room multiple times while uninsured, Arthur said.
“I felt like if our patients weren’t helped with follow-up, and that advocacy piece, their applications were not being seen,” Farnes said. She is now the behavioral health director at the clinic.
Montana was one of five states where more than 50% of enrollees lost coverage during the unwinding, according to the GAO. The other states are Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. About 68% of Montanans who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons.
In Oklahoma, eligibility redeterminations remain challenging to process, said Yvonne Myers, a Medicaid and Affordable Care Act consultant for Citizen Potawatomi Nation Health Services. That’s causing more frequent coverage lapses, she said.
Myers said she thinks Republican claims of “waste, fraud, and abuse” are overstated.
“I challenge some of them to try to go through an eligibility process,” Myers said. “The way they’re going about it is making it for more hoops to jump through, which ultimately will cause people to fall off.”
The unwinding showed that state systems can struggle to respond quickly to changes in Medicaid, leading to preventable erroneous disenrollments. Individuals were often in the dark about their applications and struggled to reach state offices for answers. Tribal leaders and health experts are raising concerns that those issues will continue and worsen as states implement the requirements of the new law.
Georgia, the only state with an active Medicaid work requirement program, has shown that the changes can be difficult for individuals to navigate and costly for a state to implement. More than 100,000 people have applied for Georgia’s Pathways program, but only about 8,600 were enrolled as of the end of July.
Alker, of Georgetown, said Congress took the wrong lesson from the unwinding in adding more restrictions and red tape.
“It will make unwinding pale in comparison in terms of the number of folks that are going to lose coverage,” Alker said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
Wanted: Poll workers. Must love democracy.

The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

WILSONVILLE — The people of Wilsonville aren’t about to let it happen to them, at least not without a fight.
After seeing residents of nearby Bessemer, Alabama, get blindsided by a proposal for a massive data center, with little public disclosure and public officials silenced by non-disclosure agreements, Wilsonville residents sprang into action when word got out that a developer was looking to build a similar data center in their town.
More than 100 Wilsonville residents packed the town hall for Monday night’s City Council meeting to voice their objections to the proposed “hyperscale” data center in the small, riverside community of fewer than 2,000 residents about 25 miles southeast of Birmingham.

The 3 million square-foot data center project wasn’t on the agenda for Monday’s council meeting, but people showed up anyway, 50 of them carrying red signs that read “No Wilsonville Data Center.” There weren’t enough signs, or chairs, for everyone as the overflow crowd spilled out into the hallway.
Former Wilsonville Mayor Lee McCarty, who was in the crowd among the protesters, said the project, if it proceeds, would be “extremely detrimental to the community.”
“A lot of people live in Wilsonville because they want the country repose,” McCarty said. “They don’t want gigantic power lines and water lines and traffic. They don’t want a Walmart, much less one of these.”
Project planning documents obtained by Inside Climate News from a resident show the site would encompass 664 acres and contain 14 buildings, each 219,000 square feet, more than the size of a typical Walmart Supercenter.
The residents say a data center that size would disrupt their peaceful community that includes multi-generational family farms and million-dollar waterfront homes on Lay Lake.
“All I know is, the people selling this land and the people brokering the deal, that’s going to be their legacy, to potentially destroy a small town,” Wilsonville resident Renny Stanhope said after the meeting.
The Wilsonville data center project is just one in a series of new data center proposals sweeping the country.
In Pennsylvania, Virginia, Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan, Iowa and elsewhere, data center projects are popping up, often in rural or low-income areas, leaving local residents to deal with noise pollution, air pollution, destruction of forest land and likely higher electricity costs due to massive demand.
The Trump administration has announced plans to waive environmental rules and other regulations for data centers that might slow their development in the midst of an arms race for computing power to run AI systems.
Alabama Power, which will likely provide electricity for the Wilsonville project, has already gotten approval to buy an existing natural gas plant for $622 million, increasing customer bills in anticipation of higher loads from data centers.
In Wilsonville, Monday’s council meeting lasted less than 15 minutes, including the opening prayer and Pledge of Allegiance. After some brief council business, Mayor Ricky Morris said that there were no updates on the project, and that any future rezoning or annexation requests for the project would be on the council agenda.
“When we have something to discuss, it will be on the agenda,” Morris told the crowd.

The data center proposal came to light during the council’s August 4 meeting, when a resident asked the council about the project on the outskirts of town.
At that meeting, council members said they had been approached by representatives from NorthPoint Development, a Kansas City commercial real estate company involved in data center development, which  inquired about annexing parcels of land into the town for a data center project. The project location includes land within Wilsonville town limits and land in unincorporated Shelby County. Annexing the land would put the entire footprint under the control of Wilsonville instead of the county, for zoning purposes, documents show.
Council members said Monday they have not yet received a formal application for annexation.
“We’ve had no other contact with them, they have not requested nothing,” Morris said. “So it’s just like it was last meeting.”
NorthPoint Development did not respond to requests for comment or to authenticate the document.
During a brief public comment period, residents pressed the council members for any updates on the project, and asked whether either they or the mayor would pledge not to sign non-disclosure agreements, which have become common in data center development across the country. The council members did not make such a pledge, with Morris saying they could not promise that for legal reasons. He did not elaborate and declined to answer additional questions from Inside Climate News after the meeting.
Shelby County probate records show NorthPoint Development reached a two-year option on approximately 687 acres from Richard Cashio, a Birmingham steel industry magnate, on Feb. 27. The purchase price was not included in the document. Cashio did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
The project would be located off of County Highway 61, alongside Lick Branch, a small Coosa River tributary. It would be located about 2.5 miles northwest of the Ernest C. Gaston Electric Generating Plant, a coal and natural gas-fired power plant operated by Alabama Power alongside the Coosa.
According to the feasibility plan, the projected peak power demand is 1,008 megawatts, more than half of the maximum output from the Gaston Plant, which is 1,880 megawatts, according to Alabama Power’s website.
Running a 1008 MW data center 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, would use 8.8 million megawatt-hours of electricity a year. That’s about half as much as all of Alabama Power’s 1.3 million residential customers used in 2023, according to company filings with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
The Wilsonville data center would use about 20 percent less power than the proposed data center in Bessemer, which would use 1200 megawatts at peak.
The plan also states that developers need to “verify volume of water available and capacity of wastewater treatment plant,” as well as “verify if the site is subject to air quality standards,” and “verify power source, location, substation size & location will be adjusted as needed.”

Coosa Riverkeeper Justinn Overton helped distribute signs at the meeting and share information on social media, and said the large turnout should send a message to the elected officials on the dais.
“Although there was not a lot of information shared tonight, our purpose was to apply gentle pressure and let them know how many people are watching and listening,” she said.
If the council approves the data center request, voter ire would take a while to reach them at the ballot box. According to a post on Wilsonville’s web site, the town will not host municipal elections this year, because the candidates for mayor and five council seats are all unopposed.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Wilsonville-protest-for-August-24-2025-story-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-24 08:57:03.592224

Photograph by John Partipilo/  Tennessee Lookout ©2025NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Concerned Windham citizens: Property taxes may drive residents out of their homes.","This commentary is by Windham citizens, who are listed below the text.


Earlier this year, the Town of Windham underwent a full property reappraisal which has left a significant number of our residents struggling. The Board of Abatement reconvened on Monday, February 10, for the second time to hear and decide on more desperate cases. 
According to the law (32 V.S.A. § 6066), residents with an annual household income not exceeding $47,000 should not have to pay more than 5% (3% for municipal and 2% for educational taxes) of their household income for their house and 2 acres, as long as their reassessed property value is under $400,000. In all of the abatement cases the Board of Abatement heard, this applied to each of the appellants who should not have had to pay more than roughly $600 and yet were charged more than four times that amount. The one-year lag in the income sensitivity calculation is also a very unfair challenge in a reappraisal year for probably every town in Vermont.
In one instance, a person received a tax bill that amounted to 16% of their household income. They own less than 2 acres, 1.09 acres to be exact. Their household income was similar for 2022 ($14,230) and 2023 ($14,871), less than $15,000 in both instances, which qualifies them for a 4.5% cap. Their homestead value rose from $180,000 to $345,000 after reappraisal, which is still less than the $400,000 limit. How does this comport with 32 VSA, Chapter 154, Sec. 6066(a)(3-4), which indicates that they should not be paying more than 4.5% of their household income for their total tax bill? And how are they to handle the increase in their mortgage payments if and when their taxes are in escrow?
Windham is a small rural community with just over 550 permanent residents and about 55% second-home owners. Our town has no grocery store, no post office, no school nor any other amenities — hardly even a street light — and yet it ranks at the top of the tax rates in the state. We are being penalized for the fact that wealthy buyers from out of state have been buying properties for more than twice their value, often sight unseen. 
We fear that if income sensitivity is not effectively applied to the income tax equation, Vermonters will not be able to stay in their homes. We hope that a solution will be found to address the apparent anomaly that occurs as a result of a pandemic and reappraisal. 
In our deliberations that Monday, the Board of Abatement decided to calculate the appellants’ appeals based on the 4.5% value that 32 VSA, Chapter 154, Sec. 6066(a)(3-4) indicates. 
The remaining balance will have to be divided among the town’s residents in order to fulfill our tax obligations, but this cannot be the norm, nor can we continue to see tax rates rising beyond affordability. Oddly enough, all attempts to get confirmation and advice on how to proceed based on 32 V.S.A. § 6066 led nowhere. It seemed like relevant officials were unaware of the income sensitivity 5% cap or did not know how to answer our questions. We wonder how many other communities in Vermont have had a similar experience.

,Mississippi Today,2025-08-24 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Putin, Trump and Reeves all agree that mail-in voting is bad",Bobby Harrison,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/24/putin-trump-and-reeves-all-agree-that-mail-in-voting-is-bad/,"Currently 36 states, both red states and blue states, have universal mail-in voting. Most had mail-in voting when Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020 and won again in 2024.","Russia’s Vladimir Putin, U.S. President Donald Trump and many Mississippi politicians, including Gov. Tate Reeves, have something in common – their disdain for mail-in voting.
Putin, Russia’s president/dictator, has waged wars where thousands of men, women and children have been killed, and his political enemies who aren’t in prison have a knack for dying under strange and often gruesome circumstances.
Yet, Putin has thoughts about American democracy, and apparently President Trump is listening.
One takeaway Trump said he gleaned from his recent Alaskan summit with Putin, which was called to discuss ending Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, is that the Russian president believes Trump would not have lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden if not for fraud and mail-in voting.
Trump volunteered that Putin told him, “‘Your election was rigged because you have mail-in voting. … It’s impossible to have mail-in voting and have honest elections.’” Trump added that Putin said “no country” has mail-in voting.
It is not clear how discussions of the 2020 election will help end the Russian/Ukrainian war. But Putin’s comments are false. Many countries have mail-in voting. And Trump lost the 2020 election because Joe Biden won more votes – a lot more.
Still, soon after the summit Trump announced his intent to draft an executive order to end mail-in voting.
“An executive order is being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots because they’re corrupt,” he told reporters.
And here in Mississippi, Reeves and many other politicians have been longtime opponents of no-excuse, mail-in voting.
In 2020 the Republican governor said on social media, “I will also do everything in my power to make sure universal mail-in voting and no-excuse early voting are not allowed in MS—not while I’m governor! Too much chaos.”
In Russia, Putin could most likely end mail-in voting by himself. Russia has consistently been cited for not conducting fair and free elections. But the election clause of the U.S. Constitution gives the legislature in each state the authority to establish the laws regulating elections. The Constitution gives the U.S. Congress the authority to alter the laws passed by the state legislatures. The president, of course, would have the duty of signing into law or vetoing the changes approved by Congress.
But it is difficult to fathom how the president could end mail-in voting by himself. And the White House staff appeared to be walking back the president’s comments that he could end mail-in voting by himself.
The question then is whether Congress would be willing to take such action.
Currently 36 states, red and blue , have universal mail-in voting. Most had mail-in voting when Trump won in 2016, lost in 2020 and won again in 2024.
So, could Trump convince House members and senators, even Republicans ones, to end early voting in say Florida, Arizona, Georgia, Montana or in various other red or swing states?
Perhaps. Republican politicians have often submitted to Trump’s wishes. But it is important to remember politicians passed mail-in voting because their constituents like it. It makes voting easier and promotes civic engagement.
And contrary to the opinion of Trump, as related to him by dictator Putin, there are safeguards to prevent fraud in early voting.
Some of those safeguards include the fact that people have to sign the envelope the ballot is mailed in. And that signature is checked by poll workers against the signature on record from when the person registered to vote.
In addition, most states with mail-in voting also require some type of identifying information, such as the last four digits of the voter’s Social Security number, driver’s license number or an assigned code (usually a set of numbers) that must be placed on the envelope for the mail-in ballot.
If people trust doing banking online, they should feel comfortable with mail-in voting.
Reeves and other Mississippi officials, it is obvious, do not feel comfortable with mail-in voting. Mississippi is among the 14 states that do not have no-excuse mail-in voting.
In addition, Mississippi is among only three states that have no form of no-excuse early voting either by mail or in person.
In the vast majority of states, people can go vote before Election Day. In Mississippi, a person under the age of 65 must have an excuse to vote early.
Mississippi lawmakers have constantly rejected efforts to expand voter access.
In other words, Vlad Putin would most likely endorse Mississippi election laws.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/07003054/MG_1717-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-24 07:56:52.706761

But making T finances more sustainable by bringing them in line with other large urban transit agencies takes more than just capital improvements.  It will require legislative leaders and Gov. Healey to reinstate and empower an entity like the Fiscal and Management Control Board to explicitly focus on operating cost control.  
The post Without a watchdog, T[...]","SINCE ITS collapse into the snows of February 2015, the MBTA has ramped up capital spending on much-needed maintenance and repairs to move the agency closer to a state of good repair.    
The capital investment was long overdue. But since the Fiscal and Management Control Board established in 2015 to oversee MBTA finances was dissolved six years later, operating costs have spiraled.  Addressing out-of-control costs will require the reinstatement of an operating budget watchdog like the FMCB.  
In 2018, the MBTA balanced its operating budget without state contract assistance or federal funds.  With the onset of the pandemic, MBTA fare revenue fell by $285 million and unlinked passenger trips fell by 37 percent between fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2023. But state operating support increased by $539 million during that time and the T also received about $2 billion in federal COVID relief money.    
Nonetheless, the MBTA was looking at a $700 million deficit for this fiscal year before Gov. Healey approved $535 million for the T in June.  The money comes in addition to funding the agency receives from state sales tax receipts, assessments on the municipalities it serves, and self-generated revenue such as fares.  
Since fiscal 2021, system operating costs have risen more steeply every year, including by nearly 15 percent between fiscal 2023 and 2024.    
The biggest culprit is the bus system. In 2019, the MBTA spent $153 per hour in operating costs to run a bus, compared to $220 at New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority. By 2023, costs had risen slightly to $263 in New York, but the hourly cost of operating an MBTA bus nearly doubled to $297, exceeding New York’s costs.   
An analysis of eight comparable US transit agencies found that MBTA bus operating costs rose by more than 90 percent.  The Chicago Transit Authority had the next sharpest increase at less than 40 percent.  
One way the T control board succeeded at keeping operating costs under control was through the agency’s three-year exemption from the Commonwealth’s so-called Pacheco Law. That unique statute makes it exceptionally difficult to contract out any service provided by state (or MBTA) employees.    
During the exemption, the T contracted out operation of its secure cash counting facility.  It reduced costs by 65 percent and the time it takes to deposit funds by 80 percent.  Contracting out the operation of warehousing and logistics cut costs and improved inventory accuracy from 57 percent to 80 percent, with 99.8 percent of deliveries completed within 10 hours.   
The threat of competition also brought the Carmen, the MBTA’s largest union, to the table to renegotiate their contract, saving an estimated $218 million over a decade.  All told, the T estimated the 1o-year savings from actions taken under the Pacheco Law exemption at more than $450 million.  This exemption expired before the pandemic and should be restored.  
It’s also long past time for the Commonwealth to address the MBTA’s nearly bankrupt pension system.  When the T contributed $37.7 million to the retirement fund in fiscal 2007, its funding ratio was over 90 percent.  The fiscal 2025 budget called for the MBTA to contribute $207.7 million to a system that is just 56 percent funded.   
The fundamental problem is that there are more people collecting benefits than paying in, mostly due to how early MBTA employees can retire. Those hired before December 2012 can retire with a full pension after 23 years of service, regardless of age. Those hired after December 2012 can retire with a full pension at age 55 after 25 years.  In addition, T employees receive pensions that are significantly more generous than those of their state government counterparts.   
 There has been progress at the MBTA of late.  Thanks to increased capital funding and the leadership of General Manager Phillip Eng, service is more reliable and subway slow zones have disappeared.   
But making T finances more sustainable by bringing them in line with other large urban transit agencies takes more than just capital improvements.  It will require legislative leaders and Gov. Healey to reinstate and empower an entity like the Fiscal and Management Control Board to explicitly focus on operating cost control.  
Charles Chieppo and Andrew Mikula are senior fellows at Pioneer Institute.  Together with Aidan Enright, they authored the recent report “Cost Control Takes the Wheel: Priority Reform Areas for Balancing the MBTA’s Operating Budget.”

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Aug. 21, 2025.
A Morristown lawmaker last week called on state health care regulators to block or delay the planned closure of Copley Hospital’s birthing center until the decision could be further analyzed by the state.
Rep. Dave Yacovone, D-Morristown, made his pitch Aug. 13, during Copley’s budget presentation to the Green Mountain Care Board.
Copley, one of the smallest critical access hospitals in the state, was the last to present its annual budgetary plans to the board. A team of administrators led by CEO Joe Woodin and Kathy Demars, vice chair of the hospital’s board of trustees, provided an explanation of the high profile and controversial decision to close the birthing center, and asked the board for support.
Woodin presented data from a consultant’s analysis that paired a declining birthrate with the expense of operating the birthing center, which ultimately swayed most of the trustees to vote to close the center by Nov. 1. An analysis that Copley presented to the Green Mountain Care Board claimed that maintaining birthing center operations would have resulted in the hospital running a $3.7 million loss, based on 2023 data. Also according to the analysis, the hospital would see a $2.9 million gain by only providing pre- and post-natal care.

Woodin’s presentation also emphasized the emotional toll the process had put upon the administration and volunteer trustees, with several slides dedicated to criticism the hospital had received during the process. Woodin claimed last week, as he had previously, that the nurses’ union had collaborated with community members to protest the closure.
“It was more than anything I’ve ever seen, and it made it really hard. But at the end of the day, it came down to a discussion of, ‘Can we afford this?’ and ‘Do we have enough volume to justify a direction towards growth?’” Woodin said. “That’s hard to say, and people really fight over those issues.”
Demars said the trustees had received hundreds of letters at their homes, some of which were unkind.
“We’re a volunteer board, and we really appreciate any support we can get from the Green Mountain Care Board in making tough decisions,” she said.
‘Defer, delay’
Yacovone, in the public comment portion following the presentation, urged the state board to prevent the hospital from closing its birthing center as planned on Nov. 1, so that its full effects on Vermont’s health care landscape could be considered and the decision could be made in accordance with the Agency of Human Services’ ongoing analysis of how to make Vermont’s health care system more efficient and less expensive.
“My request to the board is that you work to defer, to delay any decision on the Copley birthing center until the (Agency of Human Services’) strategic health plan is developed to see if this kind of decision would even comport with the strategic health plan as envisioned,” Yacovone said. “I would also ask that Copley revise their community health needs assessment to see how a community without a birthing center would be impacted and what would need to be done.”
Yacovone, a former Copley trustee, commended the current trustees for attempting to fulfill their fiduciary duty to the hospital, but said the birthing center’s closure would make health care more expensive for Vermonters, even if it helped Copley’s bottom line.
He added the travel time for residents of Morrisville and other areas of Lamoille County would be dangerous for expecting mothers.
Yacovone was not alone in his request that the birthing center be delayed. Vicki Rich, a local lactation consultant and birthing coach, asked the board to give maternal health care providers more time to respond.
Other meeting attendees, including a nurse-midwife at Copley and former birthing center patients, emphasized the importance of the birthing center in maternal health care in Lamoille County.
Yacovone contends that the Green Mountain Care Board has the ability, in setting Copley’s budget, to dictate the hospital take a specific action and require it to work with the Agency of Human Services to under Act 68, a law passed earlier this year meant to help stabilize and reform Vermont’s health care system. However, Kristen LaJeunesse, a spokesperson for the care board, said that it was beyond the board’s authority.
“Decisions about whether to continue or close specific service lines, such as birthing centers, are made by the hospitals themselves,” LaJeunesse said. “The Green Mountain Care Board’s responsibilities include hospital budget regulation and review of certain projects through the certificate of need process, but we do not have the authority to direct a hospital to keep a department open or to close one.”
Communications previously obtained by the News & Citizen between Woodin and care board chair Owen Foster show that the Copley CEO had sought the board’s endorsement of the birthing center decision. Woodin ultimately received a statement acknowledging that “transformational efforts will require hard decisions and trade-offs.”
Foster, during last week’s meeting, endorsed the idea that Vermont hospitals shouldn’t decide what services to cut purely based on their financial burden following tearful testimony from a mother who had suddenly gone into labor but was able to make it to Copley due to its proximity.
“With some of the budgets we’ve seen, there’s often a request for finances for services that lose money,” Foster said. “As we go forward with transformation, we definitely don’t want to see cherry picking and lemon dropping. It has to be consistent with the transformation plan that the Agency of Human Services is leading.”
Modest request
While the birthing center closure decision continued to be the center of attention, Copley’s actual spending proposal was more modest than in years past.
The hospital requested a 3.7% decrease to net patient revenue, a 1.6% increase to operating expenses and a 4.2% increase to commercial insurer reimbursement rates. Woodin previously asked the board for double-digit percentage increases to its commercial reimbursement rates after complaining of financial issues and a cost for services that are far lower than other hospitals in the state.
Copley also asked for spending exemptions for its financial support of the beleaguered Lamoille Health Partners and for the construction of a fourth operating room at the Morristown hospital.
The hospital gave Lamoille Health Partners a $150,000 lifeline last year after the federally qualified health care center suddenly found itself in a financial crisis. The hospital also took back some of the laboratory diagnostic work the health center had previously outsourced to a different company and provided additional services following the closure of the partner’s Stowe office.
The hospital said the construction of a new operating room was necessary to meet the demand for more space from across the hospital.
“The addition of a fourth OR is in direct response to increased demand across multiple service lines. This expansion is essential to meeting our growing patient care needs, improving financial stability, and keeping care local,” Copley’s presentation to the care board said. “The additional capacity will directly reduce patient wait times for surgical procedures, improve overall patient experience and provide surgeons with additional block time availability, supporting both provider satisfaction and recruitment efforts.”
Woodin touted the cost savings of the New England Health Care Collaborative he announced last year, and Foster encouraged hospital staff to lean into its status as a relatively low-cost health care provider and more aggressively compete with larger hospitals like the University of Vermont Medical Center.
“I think as Vermonters become more aware of the affordability challenges we have as a state, I think they probably are more sensitive to the fact that your prices are lower,” Foster said. “We would like to see you be a competitor and would like to see others compete on your prices.”

Kate Lewton is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
BURLINGTON — Christmas trees are a staple in many households throughout Vermont in the winter months, but it’s the summer months that make the Christmas magic happen. Even though peak sales for Christmas tree farms are in November and December, the saplings are largely tended in the spring and summer. 
“We all feel like Christmas tree farms are a vital part of Vermont’s rural landscape and character and contribute to Vermont’s economy,” said Amanda Werner, the daughter of Cheryl and Fred Werner of Middlebury’s Werner Tree Farms. “They are a tradition that connects generations.” 
Werner Tree Farms has been selling trees since 1980, after a push for Christmas tree planting in the mid 1970s. They’ve since grown to about 15,000 trees across their properties. 
“There was a county forester who was really pushing Christmas tree planting in Addison County, and in the early ages of this farm, about 30 years ago, there were about 75 tree farms in Addison County,” Werner said. “You look out there today, now there’s 15.” 
There is a trend of dwindling farms in Vermont, including tree farms, but according to the 2022 agricultural census there were still 3,495 acres of Christmas trees in the state on 260 farms. That crop is worth $2.6 million as of 2022. 
Steve Moffat began Moffat’s Tree Farm in 2000. However, his family had been selling trees loosely on the side since they started a dairy farm on the land in the 1930s. The trees looked different back then, Moffat said.
“The trees were just wild,” Moffat said. “Uncultivated, unsheared, unfertilized, very natural trees.”
But today trees require more cultivation to become marketable. After Cody Purinton started selling trees from the Purinton Maple and Tree Farm in Huntington in 1996, he learned a drip application method, a system of irrigation to deliver water and other substances, like herbicides and pesticides. The herbicides remove weeds, said Purinton, and the pesticides prevent insects like aphids from harming the plant. 
“Aphids come in and they will attack the new growth on trees just as it starts growing and they actually make it curl so it isn’t as pretty or lush as it’s supposed to be on the Christmas tree,” Werner said. 
In late spring, fertilizer is put down, and then they start trimming the trees, followed by mowing and more shaping. Werner Farms estimated it took about 60 full days to complete the shearing. 
Werner said he’s intentionally crafted cultivation practices at Werner Farms with sustainability and innovation in mind. 
“I think any smart farmer understands that without good stewardship of their land, their farm is not gonna be viable in the future,” Werner said. 
He implemented rotational grazing to keep their trees healthy with a breed of sheep called Shropshires. They’re extremely picky eaters, and they skip the trees and instead much on the grass and weeds around them, Werner said. 
“They’re removing grass so that we don’t need to go and mow the grass that they eat. They’re leaving manure behind that should be improving the soil over time,” Werner said.
But Christmas tree farming is a long-term investment because the slow growth of trees requires longer land leases.
“It takes 10 years to grow one Christmas tree and it isn’t profitable to only get one crop off. You realistically need a 15 to 20 year lease to make it feasible,” Werner said. “Without land access, existing farms will continue for a while, but if the new generation of farmers can’t afford to take ’em over then it doesn’t work.”
But modern farmers say they will keep working because of the joy it brings to Vermont’s Christmas season. 
“I like to think that, spiritually, if you wanna put it that way, that the Christmas trees know they’re being grown as Christmas trees. They’re happy with their fate. I’m good with that. And I always say, you cut it down, I’m gonna plant another, don’t worry,” Moffat said.

Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE —The Trump administration may deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges in Tennessee and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego have already filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Abrego002-1536x1015-1-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-08-24 05:57:30.640417
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-24 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,This CT recovery coach could lose his job to federal cuts. What will happen to his clients?,Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/24/ct-recovery-coach-federal-funding/,"The future of CT’s recovery coaches, who help people navigate sobriety and stay safe, is in flux. One man’s story shows what could be lost.","On a rainy April morning, Kerry Bilda pulled up to his client Jack’s apartment in downtown Norwich to give him a ride to work. 
Close to the street corners where tiny bags of fentanyl change hands, Jack locked his front door, jumped into Bilda’s car, and together they left the city behind: a beloved grinder shop, the imposing stone facade of the Catholic Church, skinny headstones on a hillside. Are any of Bilda’s former clients buried here, taken by an overdose epidemic that’s stalked this corner of Connecticut more viciously than virtually any other? 
Bilda is a recovery coach. He helps people enrolled in medication-assisted treatment in 11 cities and towns in eastern Connecticut to navigate sobriety and saw 107 clients last year. Bilda acts as a shield from the kinds of small but bedeviling snags — a needed ride, a glitched prescription — that can quickly unravel a delicate recovery. 
But to witness Bilda’s work is to see a still larger project in action: how scores of workers at clinics, nonprofits and state agencies help some of Connecticut’s most at-risk residents to stay not only sober, but also fed, safe, housed. It’s the nonlinear endeavor of helping people who may have never known stability to build stable futures. 
But that work’s future has been spun off-kilter in recent months by massive federal budget cuts to programs that serve the poor. Those cuts will soon impact everything from food security to access to health care.
Bilda’s position relies on a $140,000 annual grant from the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, but the money comes from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, an agency that’s currently being dismantled. Which raises the question: will Bilda’s job survive? And if not, will his clients?

Many lives
When they’re in the car together, Jack and Bilda chat about Jack’s schedule, an idea he has for a small business, his work fixing up apartments. At times, they look and sound like old high school buddies, reminiscing. 
Bilda is a native son of Norwich who has lived experience with addiction — in his case, long-ago struggles with alcoholism. At 6-foot-2, he’s most often speaking to someone below his eyeline, but his casual stance and restrained expression create a gentle, sturdy presence: he is here to help.
Jack, 41, asked that his last name not be used out of respect for his family’s privacy. He’s originally from East Haven. He has a soft, even voice, and when he talks about his struggles with addiction and the road out, he’s self-critical but unguarded, the story flowing unencumbered. Bilda chimes in when a moment he witnessed comes up. 
Like back in 2018, when Jack was using heroin.  
“I would go to these programs and detoxes and whatever, and as soon as the doors would open, I’d be using again,” Jack remembered. “It was kind of hopeless.”  
Jack had manic episodes and for years couldn’t find a medication that effectively managed them. 
In the throes of an episode, Jack felt grandiose — like he was right about everything — and like he could get anything done. “Who wants to be around someone like that?” he said. Though he didn’t swing to the opposite extreme of major depression, he sometimes felt pushed low by “the crap I got myself into.” That “crap” included a combination of larceny, drug possession and misdemeanors, according to his criminal record, landing him in prison and jail for a total of five years. 
Jack ended up in a New London shelter in 2018. It was there that he met Bilda through United Community & Family Services, the nonprofit health clinic where Bilda works.
Each morning, according to shelter rules, Jack had to be out of his bunk by 9 a.m. He couldn’t return to bed until 6 p.m. 
“It was just so easy to walk in circles and get in a trap, you know? Staying occupied was vital at that point,” Jack said.
Bilda had spent two decades working in behavioral health, but he was still new to the recovery coach position when he came by the shelter to pick Jack up. 
“Get me out of there for the day, get my mind off everything,” Jack remembered.  
“And we’d go hiking,” Bilda said. “Get a bite to eat, get coffees.”
On one outing, Jack and Bilda drove to Fort Shantok, sacred Mohegan land. They walked into the clean woods there, tree trunks like cathedral beams, light peeking through leaves overhead. On those trips, Bilda could offer Jack something more than a ride or a bag of groceries — he could give Jack the feeling of peace he’d always found in nature. 
One day at the shelter, police arrived and showed residents a photograph: they were trying to identify a man who had recently overdosed. Jack felt like he was in a movie, that eerie experience of recognizing the two-dimensional version of a friend whom he would never see in three dimensions again. And the final image of that friend’s life rattled him: “These two little kids were going to Sunday school one morning and found him” in front of a fast food joint. 
It was then that Jack really decided to stop using. He had made the decision before, but now he was determined.

‘There’s no way to delay that trouble coming every day’ 
Bilda drives a new company car, with a computer screen to connect him to online libraries of music and podcasts. But he favors the radio, and quotes the poetry he finds there. “It’s a fun job. It’s interesting. What’s that quote? ‘There’s no way to delay that trouble coming every day,’” a Frank Zappa lyric. “So you just deal with it, you figure it out. You figure it out the best you can, and you work with the person.” 
The line is from a Zappa song packed with images of a society in collapse, written in response to the Watts riots in Los Angeles: 
“...Don't you know that this could startOn any street in any townIn any state if any clownDecides that now's the time to fightFor some ideal he thinks is rightAnd if a million more agreeThere ain't no great societyAs it applies to you and meOur country isn't free…”
The trouble Bilda sees in eastern Connecticut every day crested just a few short years ago. It was then that the overdose death rate reached its apex: 42.3 per 100,000 people in the state, 57.6 per 100,000 in Connecticut’s southeast corner. 
Some of his clients were driven to use in a narrative heard across the U.S.: Patients were prescribed OxyContin for a workplace injury or bad back, the drug that was manufactured in Stamford and marketed as a nonaddictive pain killer. But then many found they were addicted when their prescriptions were unceremoniously cut off by doctors. People like Bilda’s client H.W., who was injured while working at Electric Boat, found that heroin filled the void. 
That crisis spurred a rise in overdose deaths, one that exploded when fentanyl infiltrated U.S. illegal drug markets in 2013, rapidly poisoning the supply. People who thought they were taking heroin or cocaine, or even pills like Adderall or Xanax, died of unintentional overdose when they took drugs laced with fentanyl, while people seeking out fentanyl often died of overdose too, because the concentration of the drug varied so widely. 
The most deadly year in Connecticut for overdoses was 2021, as it was in many states around the U.S., when the combination of fentanyl in the illegal drug market and the isolation of the COVID pandemic converged. 
But during the past three years, as the state has invested in recovery efforts, including the availability of the overdose reversal drug naloxone, the number of overdose deaths has been on the decline. In southeast Connecticut, a region hit especially hard by the crisis, the rate fell from 57.6 per 100,000 in 2021 to 37.8 per 100,000 people in 2024.
Rep. Cristin McCarthy-Vahey, D-Fairfield, co-chair of the Public Health Committee, said that such progress isn’t free. 
“It takes medication, which requires funding,” she said. “It requires recovery coaches. It takes infrastructure, people, buildings, staff, which requires funding. The things in place now are saving lives, but lacking those interventions, people will die.”
But there is more to living than survival. Recovery coaches like Bilda are part of a deeper effort to help people sustain their progress and rebuild their lives.
“We usually don’t see or recognize that somebody is struggling until they’re at the severe end of their addiction,” said Rebecca Allen, the director of recovery advocacy at the Connecticut Community for Addiction Recovery. But Allen said getting people beyond sobriety, to help them rebuild a life that may have been damaged by that addiction, requires more than just treatment. 
While Medicaid pays for medication-assisted treatment for recipients, recovery coaches are mainly funded by grants. There are dozens of state-funded recovery coaches across Connecticut, according to Luiza Barnat, opioid services director at DMHAS. Many are located in emergency departments within hospitals, others at health centers like the one where Bilda works in Norwich, sometimes going by other titles, like recovery support specialists. 
Some of the funding that supports recovery coaches, like the federally allocated State Opioid Response grant of $15 million per year, is approved through September 2027. Typically this grant is renewed on a two to three year cycle, and though state officials are hopeful it will be renewed again, that remains uncertain.
“People will struggle, people will suffer and some people will die,” McCarthy Vahey said of the prospect of such funding cuts. 
Medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, the program in which Bilda’s clients are enrolled, has also come a long way. For decades, methadone was the only medication available to treat opioid use disorder, a treatment that has involved taking the drug daily at a specialized clinic. 
“That is an incredible burden for many people, and it also makes it very hard to hold down a job if you have to go to a clinic every day and stand in a line,” said Robert Heimer, a Yale professor of epidemiology and pharmacology.  
Regulations have relaxed, allowing people who have been faithfully using the drug to eventually be allowed to bring doses of methadone home instead of having to come in person to take the drug every day, Heimer said, and there is also another medication available — buprenorphine — which is an alternative to methadone and can be taken by injection or prescribed by a doctor. That’s the only medication Bilda’s clients use. 
Barnat says that while medication alone can keep people from returning to opioid use and overdosing, that’s not enough to truly “recover.”
“A lot of folks working on recovery have lost a lot of their connections to family and friends, and it can be really difficult to maintain recovery when you’re alone and isolated,” Barnat said. A recovery coach may serve as that figure, or just help someone as they find a different type of support — like a minister, a family member or a new career.

‘Maybe I don’t look like a heroin addict, alcoholic anymore’
Once Jack decided to quit using, he went into detox. 
“The easiest thing was to go find a fix at that time, but I just remember sticking through it and being so ill, so sick,” he said. He enrolled in a medication-assisted treatment program at the health center where Bilda works. Then, Jack was able to move into a halfway house, where he lived for 18 months. He got a job at a ShopRite and worked his way up to manager of dairy and frozen foods. 
“It was a big thing for myself, because I hadn’t lasted anywhere, really. The trust and friendships I started to build … ” he said.
Before, Jack said he felt like he always had a reason close at hand to throw his sobriety away: “‘It’s a beautiful day out!’ Or, ‘it’s a horrible day out!’ And you’d always have an excuse to go use.” But he wasn’t using. He wasn’t throwing it away.
Then, COVID happened. During that time, Bilda learned that Jack had lost his job at ShopRite. Bilda never learned exactly what happened but he’d seen precarious moments like this one before, times when it would have been obvious for a client like Jack to start using again. Then, Jack was evicted. 
“Boof, there I am. I’m homeless.” 
It would have been so easy to use again, so obvious. 
Jack found a spot in the woods to camp where he wouldn’t bother anyone, and where no one was around to tempt him out of sobriety. Soon he found a job doing maintenance for the owner of some of the grand homes in Norwich that had been divided into apartments. He lived on instant ramen and cheap pizza. He used a gas-powered bike to get to work. And he had Bilda, whom he could call on rainy days when he couldn’t commute by bike.
It was May 2021 when Jack first started camping out. But when the weather got cold, Jack decided it was time to tell his boss his story.
“He’s very pure,” Jack said of his boss, awestruck at encountering a person who “doesn’t lie, he doesn’t cheat, he doesn’t steal. Period. He does not.” When his boss seemed genuinely shocked that Jack had once used drugs, it meant something to him. “I was like wait, maybe I don’t look like a heroin addict, alcoholic anymore.” It was a morale booster. 
By November, Jack had saved $1,700. He gave it all to his boss for the rent and first month’s deposit on a one-bedroom apartment, where he has lived ever since. The following spring, Bilda took Jack to Connecticut College in New London, where he’d been invited to pick up unwanted furniture after graduation. 
“It’s a rich college, so what happens is, the kids leave and they don’t take anything with them — they just leave. Lamps. TVs. Radios. Clothes. A whole bunch of jackets,” Bilda said. Bilda drove Jack down in the big van from work and told Jack, “Take whatever you want.”

Peaks and valleys 
Norwich has lived many lives: home of the Mohegan tribe; armory of American revolutionaries; hub of shipbuilding and textile mills. At the dawn of the 20th century, Norwich claimed more millionaires per capita than any other U.S. city — in fact, the apartments Jack works on are subdivided mansions in the city’s “Millionaires’ Triangle.” But when industry after industry departed, what was once Connecticut’s most densely populated city fell to its 10th. Today, the median income hovers at around $37,000 a year. 
Bilda has lived through tough stretches and hopeful moments in his city, like when the Mohegan Sun Casino opened in 1996, bringing jobs.
“This city’s like any other city,” Bilda said. “It’s got problems like any other city. Peaks and valleys, peaks and valleys is what I would say.”
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney says that the district he represents has been gaining more economic momentum in recent years — in fact, it’s now the fastest growing labor market in the state, thanks in large part to jobs at General Dynamics Electric Boat. 
But the region was not spared the opioid crisis. Courtney said the devastation of the opioid epidemic is closely linked to the rural character of the region. Courtney worked to secure a grant in 2022 for two recovery coaches in the region. 
“The wonderful thing about the recovery coach model … is that these guys were able to sort of overcome that tyranny of distance in terms of just door-to-door service,” Courtney said, so the coach can bring preventative care to clients as opposed to waiting for them to show up in emergency departments. 
But Courtney says that the recent progress his area of the state has made — both in lowering overdose numbers and building economic stability — is threatened by the potentially devastating impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
Cuts to Medicaid, nutritional assistance and programs that support medication-assisted treatment and recovery efforts is “really a terrible convergence as far as this issue is concerned,” Courtney said. “To me, it’s proof of concept that shows when you have that concerted, persistent coverage for vulnerable populations that you can really make a difference.” 
Over the past few years, as opioid death numbers declined, Courtney had begun to feel more confident that efforts were working. 
“You sort of felt like we really have sustainability here, and now with the wave of cuts that are about to come, it is frightening. We really could be just going backwards and squandering structures that were put in place to address the problem.”

Small victories
Before becoming a recovery coach, Bilda spent 22 years working at the state Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services, and he learned the importance of maintaining boundaries. At 4:30 p.m., he turns off his work phone. Clients know the other numbers to call in the evening. The boundary serves Bilda, but it’s also a way of showing his clients that they can set their own limits with the people in their lives. 
“Recovery coaching is definitely the model of, ‘what does a healthy relationship look like?’” said Michelle Melendez, director of substance use at United Community & Family Services, the clinic where Bilda works. 
Bilda told Melendez about a tense moment when he told a man he was coaching that he wasn’t allowed to leave his things in the health center’s car. “I think many times with our clients, if someone gets upset, they’re all done and they don’t talk to them forever. And that’s not the real world,” Melendez said. Having a disagreement with Bilda and seeing that he’s still there for them on the other side can help a client learn to weather conflict in their other relationships, she said. 
When Melendez first started the medication-assisted treatment program at United Community & Family Services, she said she would only open the program if they had a staffed recovery coach, because there is only so much that a clinician can do within the four walls of a health center. 
“A recovery coach is really going to be able to figure out what a person is going to need, whether it be housing, employment, life skills,” Melendez said. “In order to sustain recovery, you need to have someone on your side to help you navigate all of that.” 
Above his desk, Bilda logs the past month’s activity on a Post-it: 92 trips, 1,975 miles. On a Tuesday in May, he signed out a few specimen cups from the health center, and grabbed bags of food from its pantry. Then he set off to collect urine samples from people enrolled in medication-assisted treatment programs.
At his first stop, Bilda learned that his client was in crisis. Though she was taking her medication, her adult daughter was using drugs, and they’d gotten into an argument. The client was worried about her grandson, who had been living with her, but who had gone across the state to temporarily stay with his dad. She confided in Bilda “because I’m comfortable enough to tell him.” She asked that her name not be used in this article, “for my grandson’s sake.” 
In the car, Bilda took notes on the meeting, information he’d share with the client’s team at the health center.
Another client had good news to report — her daughter had gotten into art school, and a friend had agreed to pay the costly tuition. The day could just as easily lead him into crisis as success. Throughout, he maintained an air of calm reserve. 
“We tend to celebrate the small victories,” Bilda said as he drove. “And then they tend to add up and add up and add up.”

Invisible thread  
Today, Jack takes sublocade injections, a form of buprenorphine, for opioid addiction, and medications to manage his mania and ADHD. He’s been sober for seven years, since July 3, 2018. He loves his apartment, a place he can finally call home, even though it’s close to some of the most active drug corners in town. 
“You need to put your blinders on and don’t inquire for anything, because that will get you ripped down,” he said. It’s no mystery what would happen if he veered from his path: “If you play the tape through, it’s the same result every time.”
After a nine-year estrangement, he has a relationship with his mother again. They talk every day. “Beyond my wildest dreams, I didn’t think that relationship would be healed, or normal,” he said. 
Now, every few weeks, his mother drives an hour and a half to Norwich where they do laundry and she takes him out for a meal. “She spoils the shit out of me.” 
Jack has a good relationship with his boss, too. And then there’s Bilda, so enmeshed in Jack’s story that it’s easy to miss him. Like invisible thread, Bilda was there making sure Jack’s recovery held together: driving him to his medical appointments, picking up a urine sample from work so he wouldn’t have to take time off to come in person, sitting with him through a manic episode and then speaking to clinicians to make sure they adjusted his meds. Bilda might have been a good Samaritan, but his presence was no accident: he is an employee, placed here by a health center, funded by the state, which was given that funding by Congress, to help Jack see his recovery through.  
Bilda isn’t too far from retirement now, and said he’d like to work his way out of the job — if only he could help enough to outpace the need. “But unfortunately, I don’t see that happening in the future, because there’s more bad stuff hitting the streets,” he said.
Every month he attends a meeting at a soup kitchen with other advocates and volunteers and together they get updates on the opioid epidemic. They learn about new synthetic drugs, like carfentanil, N-pyrrolidino protonitazene. “I can’t even pronounce the names.” 
Seven years since they first met, Bilda has faded some from Jack’s life, as intended. But the combined forces of the medication, psychiatric care, counseling, and, when needed, Bilda’s support, mean that Jack is no longer in crisis. It doesn’t mean he no longer needs the help. Rather, the combination is working.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/RECOVERY-COACH-0501-7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-24 05:57:30.640417

Fawson, whose salary and benefits are currently $686,941, is under fire over executive pay at the six-county mental health center. (Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)IOLA — Nathan Fawson is a man under fire.
And he wants you to know he is grateful.
Sitting in a consultation room painted a calming shade of neutral, Fawson — CEO of the Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center here — uses the word or a variation of it half a dozen times in explaining why his salary and benefits are more than $628,074. That figure has raised eyebrows and tempers in the community, a fiscal Rorschach test of one’s beliefs about the value of work, the cost of expertise, and who — if anyone — should pay for the public good.
“I’m very grateful that we’ve been able to offer fair, market-competitive wages to better support the community that coincidentally increased wages for management,” he says. “I’m grateful that we’ve been able to offer those competitive wages for expert services provided by management, allowing for those with that expertise to live and enjoy southeast Kansas rather than feel the need or desire to relocate.”
During the interview in the neutral room, decorated with a soothing triptych of what may be a beach scene, Fawson smiles often, gestures broadly, and sometimes refers to a printout summarizing the exponential growth of his six-county agency over the past decade. The center’s number of employees has nearly tripled since 2015, to 583; the budget has grown from $8 million to $75 million; and the number of patients served has expanded sixfold, to 25,906. The center has also, in recent years, offered medical and dental services, as part of its mission as a Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic and doubled its number of sites, to 30, including the clinic on Jefferson Street where our interview takes place.
But it’s not the additional employees or added services that has sparked a regional political backlash. It’s Fawson’s pay and benefits, which have more than quadrupled since 2020.
The SEKMHC serves six of the sickest and poorest counties in Kansas: Anderson, Allen, Bourbon, Linn, Neosho and Woodson. The median household income for Allen County is $57,618, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and about 10% of its residents lack health insurance. That compares with the Kansas median income of $70,333 and an uninsured rate of 8.4%.
In Iola, the seat of Allen County, a historic town of 5,400 on the Neosho River, the need for mental health services is one of those obvious things, like the need for rain to break a drought. Some townspeople told me that just about everyone knows somebody close who died by suicide or who were lost to drugs or alcohol. Local resident Sharla Miller, whose 19-year-old son Matt killed himself in 2019, started a conversation about mental health that included a local conference with representatives from the mental health center. The SEKMHC provides school therapists for districts in all six counties it serves.
Most of the center’s revenue comes from a variety of grants and Medicare and Medicaid. Its board of directors are appointed by the county commissions in the six counties. Each county appoints two representatives and also contributes a combined total of $550,120 in funding for this year, which amounts to less than 1% of the center’s budget. The county funds are earmarked for those not on Medicaid and who could not afford to pay for services — not salaries.
But this year, because of the heat over Fawson’s compensation package, the counties began decreasing their support. Three counties — Allen, Anderson and Neosho — dropped their support to just $1 — that’s right, a single dollar — for 2026, according to reporting by the Iola Register. Anderson County also stopped its quarterly payments for the last two quarters of this year. Linn County voted to contribute $0 for 2025 and 2026. Woodson County slashed its 2026 contribution by more than half, to $35,000. Bourbon County has discussed the issue, but has not yet made a decision on funding.
Even if all six counties pulled funding, Fawson said, the center would continue to operate. Under federal law, nobody who needed emergency services would be turned away because of an inability to pay.
The controversy began in February of this year, when Allen County Commissioner David Lee called, according to Fawson. The commissioner had just seen the center’s latest available 990, from 2023. A 990 is the federal return tax-exempt 501(c)3 nonprofits are required to file annually with the IRS.
Lee asked him if the executive salary and benefits reported were accurate.
“I responded yes,” Fawson said. “Then he responded, ‘The community would disagree with those wages, and prepare yourself for a challenge.’ And that challenge has ensued.”
Fawson said he didn’t anticipate there would be a political concern about executive compensation until that call. He said he was surprised because he was confident in the wage analysis provided in 2021 and 2023 by the Hebets Co., a Phoenix-based consulting firm. The center retained Hebets, Fawson said, because its advisers are experts and would provide a reliable and objective analysis.
The center’s board of directors adopted the Hebets recommendation to increase salaries across the board. Fawson also said that because he was familiar with medical and behavioral health operations, the executive compensation packages suggested seemed appropriate to him.
Before the increases, Fawson said, wages at the center were below the 25th percentile nationally, and the goal was to bring them up to at least the 50th percentile. These increases were across the board, he said, and have improved the lives of the center employees and added to the southeast Kansas economy.
In 2023, according to the center’s 990 tax return, other top-paid executives and employees included Doug Wright, chief operating officer, $444,282; Job Springer, chief financial officer, $423,551; Holly Jerome, director of human resources and marketing, $348,614; John Robinson, urologist, $334,368; and Steven Dooley, chief information officer, $311,604.
Michelle Hoag, clinical director and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic grant oversight officer, made $276,555 in salary and benefits. Greta Sue McFarland Huebert, a pediatrician, was listed on the 990 at $253,481.
All executive compensation for 2023 was just more than $3 million.
A master’s level clinical therapist just starting out at the clinic, Fawson said, is paid about $71,000.

Fawson, a native of St. George, Utah, graduated in 1997 from Washburn University in Topeka with a master’s degree in clinical psychology. He also has an MBA in business and health service administration from the University of Utah. He began as a therapist with the SEKMHC in the 1990s, he said, and worked his way until he became associate director. In 2010 he left to become director of clinic operations at Cox Medical Center in Branson, Missouri. He returned to the Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center in 2013 and became CEO in 2016.
In a June shakeup, the Allen County Commission dismissed its two previous representatives to the SEKMHC board and replaced them with new members. One of those new members is Jerry Daniels, a Republican who is also the chair of the county commission.
“I agreed with the reduction of funding,” Daniels told me, citing Fawson’s salary as a primary reason. “It’s more than the (U.S.) president makes.”
The U.S. Code sets the salary of the president at $400,000, with an additional $50,000 in expenses. That, of course, does not represent the ever-expanding perks of being president.
“My concern, whether you agree with it or not, is that in this DOGE environment, what are they going to do if the funding runs out?” Daniels said. “I don’t know all the details, but it’s my speculation that their budget got big on Biden bucks. What are you going to do with all these employees and salaries when the money dries up?”
Daniels said he has no doubt the center is doing good work and that its therapists are dedicated to their clients. He said he wasn’t picking on the center but that oversight of management and expenditure of funds was a serious business concern.
“I’ve been a commissioner for 10 years, and I’ve never had as many phone calls as on this subject,” Daniels said. “There’s (also) a lot of text and emails and Facebook questioning.”
A question Daniels said he had, but to which he had not received a clear answer, was whether the SEKMHC was subject to the state’s open records and open meetings laws. I posed the question in an email to Bob Johnson, counselor to the Allen County Commission, but did not receive a reply.
Fawson told me board meetings were open to the public, though few community members attended, and that the center was subject to both the Kansas Open Records Act and the Kansas Open Meetings Act. He said, however, that he would not provide a copy of the Hebets wage analysis. It was propriety, he said.
Fawson also said he didn’t feel comfortable with the Hebets report going public because it might make some center employees uncomfortable. It also might draw unwanted scrutiny to organizations used for comparison, he said.
“That may well bring harm to our employees,” he said. “One thing I recognized early on in my management experience is how sensitive employees are regarding the subject of salary.”
And, he said, exposing other organizations to scrutiny would be unfair.
“I don’t want to draw this type of attention to any organization and have them experience the level of scrutiny we’ve experienced,” he said.
Some of the comparable institutions, both for-profit and nonprofit, were in Missouri and others in Oklahoma, he said, but he declined to identify them more narrowly.
“It’s not fair to them,” he said. “I realize it’s your role to do just that, but I don’t want comparison. I want the community to come to understand value, but not from a perspective of ‘they’re better than you’ or ‘you’re better than them.’ Right?”
Comparisons with other nonprofits in Kansas, including the 25 other mental health centers in the state, are difficult because of differences in size and mission. The Iroquois Center for Human Development at Greensburg, for example, has expenditures of about $2.6 million, according to a database compiled by ProPublica, while the Bert Nash Community Health Center at Lawrence had expenses of more than $34 million. Executive pay typically ranged from 2% to 4% of expenditures for the Kansas mental health nonprofits included in the database.
The Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center executive compensation was 5.8% of its $38 million in expenses in 2023, according to ProPublica. An independent audit commissioned by the organization for fiscal 2023, ProPublica noted, found a “deficiency in internal financial or governance controls that could limit the organization’s ability to track and report financial data reliably.”
Fawson said no audits or other reviews had flagged executive compensation as a cause for concern. He also referred to his information handout, which indicated the center’s executive compensation was reviewed by the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services.
A KDADS official told me the agency reviews all expenses that make up the cost of operating a mental health center, with an eye to the “bigger picture” of the services provided by certified community behavioral health clinics to communities.
“The goal of reviewing these reports is to ensure transparency and accountability,” said Cara Sloan-Ramos, director of communications for KDADS. “Reported salaries are also reviewed using U.S. Department of Labor statistics and evaluated for reasonableness compared to other health care salaries by a third-party contractor.”
She said, however, Fawson’s individual salary was not reviewed as part of the most recent process.
“With regard to specific salaries, in the last report from the Southeast Kansas Mental Health Center,” Sloan-Ramos said, “all administrative salaries were grouped in one line item. Additionally, it is the role of the SEKMHC Board of Directors to approve and finalize executive salaries.”
The fear among some Iola civic leaders is that the controversy about executive compensation at the mental health center will impede its ability to provide vital services to the community. The Iola Register, in a July 3 editorial signed by managing editor Tim Stauffer and publisher Susan Lynn, cited the achievements of the center, from being designated a CCBHC to having therapists embedded in the public schools to staffing an around-the-clock crisis line. The editorial made the case for scrutiny, but cautioned county officials against defunding the center. Diminishing the SEKMHC’s capacity would only result in self-inflicted harm.
“At a time when it’s abundantly clear federal and state funding cannot be counted on, it’s also a dangerous thing to do,” the editorial reads. “We know the risks. Do we want more unattended crisis, more substance abuse, more violence?”
The county should restore the center’s funding and continue to invest in the community’s mental health, the Register urged. If there was concern over executive pay, then dialogue was the answer.
Toward the end of our 90-minute interview in the consultation room, Fawson asked for my take on the salary controversy. If I were offered a salary that was more than 10 times the median household income for my area, I said, I would be uncomfortable.
“I am uncomfortable with it,” he said, and it was the first time I noted emotion in his voice. “I’m very uncomfortable with it. So tell me … I don’t know how to … I don’t know how to effectively resolve that.”
I asked if he had considered taking a salary cut.
“I’ve considered a lot of ways in which I could give back,” he said. “And yet I have some advising me not to take a salary reduction (for) the best interest of the organization. I’ll just say that I’m very conflicted in that regard, very uncomfortable with where I’m at, and I very much wish there was a solution that would both satisfy the concerns and best support the community.”
Earlier this year, Fawson said, the SEKMHC board had frozen executive salaries. But, he said, the next 990, which has not yet been filed, will likely show an increase. The Hebets salary plan the board adopted included an increase for 2024 as well, an adjustment made before the salary freeze went into effect. Fawson estimated his current pay to be $495,000 plus benefits similar to 2023.
That amounts to $686,941.
Holy smokes.
Fawson and his board were naive at best in accepting the recommendations from an out-of-state consulting firm without taking into account the mood of the community. The eye-popping salaries paid to Fawson and his top executives may be justified by the market, but they may end up doing more harm to the center than good. What Fawson and his board have traded for competitive wages is the trust of the county commissions that appoint the center’s governing board. Some of those commissioners, including David Lee, who kicked the hornet’s nest in February, already believe the center is an experiment in socialized medicine diverting patients from the local Iola hospital.
Should staff salaries have been adjusted to keep and recruit therapists and others? Of course. But quadrupling the CEO salary and benefits? Risky at any time, but downright foolish in this age of populist revolt. It’s like handing a hammer to those who, out of misunderstanding or malice, would like to beat the system to pieces.

Phillip Randolph. This was the first predominantly African-American labor union in the U.S.
Pullman CarsIt was in 1862 that George Pullman launched the first deluxe railroad sleeping cars bearing his name. They were an instant hit, offering middle and upper-class passengers the comforts of home while on the rails.


All of the Pullman Car conductors were white, but the porters (who tended to the passengers) were Black. Many of them were former slaves. Pullman theorized they would be used to the subservient roles of lugging baggage, making up the sleeping berths and serving the white passengers’ every whim.
After they retired for the night, passengers could place their shoes in a small compartment accessible from the corridor where the porters would retrieve and shine them while passengers slept.
Long hours, low payPullman’s porters had to be on call 20 hours a day, serving passengers and tending to boardings at intermediate stations.
Porters worked 400 hours per month with their time off being uncompensated. They had to pay for their own uniforms, meals and shoe shine kits. Between runs, even away from home, they paid for their own lodging. The hours they spent before and after each trip preparing and cleaning the car were also unpaid… much like some present day flight attendants.
In 1926 the average porter earned $72 a month in wages and got about $58 a month in tips. In contrast, Pullman’s white conductors (who had a union) earned $150 for a 240 hour month, plus benefits and a pension.
Still, Pullman’s Black porters made a good income compared to other Black workers, allowing many to enter the middle class in railroad hub cities like Chicago and St Louis.As one historian put it, a Pullman porter had the best job in his community and the worst job on the train. There was no room for promotion. Passengers often referred to Pullman porters by demeaning names like “boy”, or “George,” applying the first name of the Pullman cars’ owner.
Unionization
In 1925 A. Phillip Randolph started organizing The Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters under the rallying cry “Fight or be slaves.” It took a decade of court battles and the threat of a national strike before the union was recognized in 1937, giving porters a big wage hike and a 240-hour per month work schedule.
Randolph and others in the Brotherhood went on to become leaders of the civil rights movement. One porter, Edgar D. Nixon, helped organize the Montgomery Alabama bus boycott after Rosa Parks’ arrest in 1955.
Among other famous Pullman porters were future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, activist Malcolm X and photographer Gordon Parks.
By the 1950’s, train service was in decline and in 1959 Pullman closed up its sleeping car business. Some porters went on to work with the legacy railroads and a few were still around when Amtrak took over.
In 1981 when the Pullman company delivered its last Superliner sleeping car, it was named after George Pullman. Years later, after Randolph had passed away, another Amtrak sleeping car was named in his honor.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Pullman-Porters-AmericanHistory-dot-edu.jpg,,,2025-08-24 04:56:10.026633

(Photo by Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado House of Representatives gave final approval to six bills on Saturday, sending them to the Senate for consideration as part of the ongoing special legislative session. 
The bills focus on raising additional state tax revenue to help close the state’s nearly $800 million budget hole, which was triggered by federal tax code changes.
House lawmakers started off by approving House Bill 25B-1001 in a party-line vote of 43-19, with Democrats in favor. The bill would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deductions on state taxes for high-income taxpayers. The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
Next up was House Bill 25B-1002, which House lawmakers approved in a party-line vote of 43-20, after more than an hour of debate. The Democrats voted in favor of the bill, which would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens. The bill would bring in an estimated $36 million in state tax revenue for the current fiscal year, according to its fiscal note.
The bill’s sponsors have argued that the bill closes corporate tax loopholes that are costly for the state. But Republicans said the bill would harm businesses.
“It doesn’t really give these corporations and companies the motivation to expand, to hire more people, which is what we need,” said Rep. Carlos Barron, a Fort Lupton Republican who voted against the bill.
House Democrats used a seldom-used chamber rule to prevent debate on four of the bills after Republicans spoke at length about the first pair of bills. They used House Rule 16 to call the question — end debate and immediately vote on the bill in question — as debate on HB25B-1002 extended past an hour. They then used Rule 16 on the next four bills. 
Members are typically allotted ten minutes each ahead of the final vote on a bill, meaning that if all 21 Republicans used their time, debate would be over three hours per bill.
House Bill 25B-1003 passed the House in a 41-21 party-line vote. It would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado. The bill would raise $44 million for the state in the current fiscal year and $91 million the following year, based on the estimate in its fiscal note. 
House lawmakers approved House Bill 25B-1004 in another party-line, 41-20 vote. This bill would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount, which its sponsors have argued is necessary during the state budget crunch. The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise up to $100 million during the current fiscal year.
The fifth proposal, House Bill 25B-1005, passed the House in a 37-25 vote. This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes. The bill’s fiscal note estimates it would raise $28 million in revenue for the state in the current fiscal year, and $57 million the next year. 
By mid-afternoon on Saturday, House lawmakers made it through the last of the six bills: House Bill 25B-1006. The bill, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases, passed the House in a 41-22 vote.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Special_Session_Day_3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-23 18:57:41.562964

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The Trump administration intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.
The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters defense claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government for contesting his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
The revelations come one day after Abrego was released from a Tennessee jail where he was awaiting a January trial on human smuggling charges. The sheet-metal apprentice was on his way back to Maryland, where he lives in Prince George’s County with his wife and children, when his attorneys received an emailed notice at 4:01 p.m. Friday from Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying it may send him to Uganda.
Abrego, an undocumented immigrant who was arrested in March, was swiftly and erroneously deported to a prison in El Salvador, even though a previous court order prohibited his deportation there because of possible threats from Salvadoran gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged his deportation was a mistake, and since then his case has focused unwelcome public scrutiny on the administration’s immigration crackdown tactics.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia released from custody in Tennessee, heading back to Maryland

On return to the U.S., Abrego was taken to Tennessee to face charges that an unremarkable 2022 traffic stop there with several immigrants in his car was really part of a human smuggling ring.  Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.
Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tennessee. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.
“The only thing that happened between Thursday — Costa Rica — and Friday — Uganda — was Mr. Abrego’s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,” his attorneys wrote.
Government officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica “or else that offer will be off the table forever.”
“There can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,” Abrego’s attorneys wrote.
Attorneys for Abrego on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.
The ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego’s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.
“The Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security “are obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention — or worse — in a country halfway across the world,” the attorneys wrote. “It is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.”

As part of the campaign against him, Abrego’s motion to dismiss said, Trump administration officials early on mounted a public campaign to distract from the erroneous deportation by smearing him. It started with Vice President JD Vance falsely claiming Abrego was an MS-13 gang member, and “other Executive Branch officials soon joined the Vice President’s effort to discredit Mr. Abrego, claiming publicly that he was violent, a gang member, and a terrorist,” the motion said.
Those attacks continued Friday when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem complained in a social media post about “this publicity hungry Maryland judge mandating this illegal alien who is a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator be allowed free.”
Abrego has never faced any of those charges in the U.S. Even though Noem also blasted a Maryland judge, Abrego’s release Friday was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee, not U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland, who is overseeing his original deportation case.
Abrego is scheduled to appear at ICE office in Baltimore on Monday. According to the email from the agency, the 72-hour clock on his threatened deportation was paused over the weekend.

Republican President Donald Trump’s continued power grab in the nation’s capital, and his threat to expand his militarized takeover to other Democratic-led cities, is setting up a high-stakes showdown over the country’s democracy that pits him prominently against a familiar political foe: Black women.
On Aug. 11, Trump declared that crime in the District of Columbia was “out of control,” despite violent crime being at a 30-year low, and directed Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Black woman, to hand over control of the city’s police force.

This report was first published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Trump then attempted to oust the city’s police commissioner, a Black woman, and replace her with a white man, before backing down after the city threatened legal action. Now, his Justice Department is investigating the accuracy of the reported crime statistics, which the agency touted in a still-available press release earlier this year.
“Mayor Bowser better get her act straight or she won’t be mayor very long because we’ll take it over with the federal government and run it like it’s supposed to be run,” Trump said from the Oval Office on Friday, calling the city a “crime-infested rat hole.”

Earlier this summer, Trump deployed Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles in response to protests over his administration’s immigration raids — the first time in 60 years that a president had taken such action without a governor’s request. Los Angeles is led by Mayor Karen Bass, another Black woman, who confronted the uninvited federal agents in a high-profile exchange at a city park.
Using the District of Columbia as a template, even though 79 percent of its residents oppose Trump’s actions, according to a Washington Post/Schar School poll, the president has, citing crime, threatened to send federal law enforcement back into Los Angeles, and to Baltimore, Chicago, Oakland and New York — all cities led by Democratic Black mayors, including Barbara Lee in Oakland.
And the power struggle between the administration, its allies and Black women is not limited to mayors. Texas state Rep. Nicole Collier said she was held as a “political prisoner” in the state Capitol overnight this week due to Democrats’ opposition to a Trump-ordered redistricting plan aimed at shoring up U.S. House control in the midterms. Trump, who has lobbed escalating complaints at the Federal Reserve for not lowering interest rates, on Wednesday called for the resignation not of its chair, Jerome Powell, a White man, but its governor, Linda Cook, after his housing finance agency chair launched an investigation into her personal mortgages.


Let us know what you think...


 

While Trump’s retribution is neither currently nor historically limited to Black women, or to women or people of color more broadly, and is directed at anyone who opposes him, including one-time supporters, there are twin realities colliding when it comes to Black women political leaders, said Sydney Carr-Glenn, a political scientist at the College of the Holy Cross. Black women have in recent years reached new levels of political power and are the electoral group that most opposes the president. It’s converging at an “interesting time,” Carr-Glenn said, given the “simultaneous penalty that Black women face in this country on account of being both Black and women.”
“We have seen Black women really ascending to these roles of political prominence in recent years in ways we haven’t seen before,” said Carr-Glenn, who studies race, ethnicity and politics. She cited big-city mayors like Bowser, Bass and Lee, along with high-profile Trump critic U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett; Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman in the role; and former Vice President Kamala Harris, whose South Asian, Black and gender identities drew related attacks from Trump as the two competed to lead the country in the 2024 elections.
“Black women have certainly been breaking these barriers but it’s also come at a really interesting time in our American government, and our democracy, when we are seeing this rise in authoritarianism,” Carr-Glenn added. “And it presents different challenges for Black women who are trying to really push back against what we’ve seen.”

For Harris, her identities as a Black, South Asian woman meant enduring and sometimes having to respond to attacks based on her race and gender during the 2024 campaign. Trump amplified suggestions that Harris traded sex to get ahead in her career and questioned whether she was actually Black, suggesting she was deploying her racial identity for political benefit.
In the closing weeks of the race, high-profile Trump supporter and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson likened Trump to a dad who was going to spank Harris because she was a “bad little girl.” Then-Trump ally Elon Musk’s super PAC cut an ad that called Harris a “big ol’ c-word,” before eventually saying the “c” stood for communist.
Though Harris’ presidential bid was historic, becoming the first Black woman to be nominated by a major party, she ultimately failed to be elected as the country’s top executive. No Black woman has been elected governor of a state yet either, noted Jamil Scott, an assistant professor at Georgetown University who has written about the political power of Black women mayors.
“So where is the next place to let the backlash flow? It’s in cities with very visible executives that are Black women,” she said. “This is in many ways a political warning, a political message, to say to these Black women and other Black mayors and other women of color mayors, ‘Your leadership can be challenged, too.’”
Victoria Woodards, the mayor of Tacoma, Washington, and a board of trustees member for the African American Mayors Association, said Black women mayors are resilient despite the realities they face in a job that requires balancing community needs with external pressures from state and federal governments.
“These are women who, despite all of the things that have been in their way or barriers that have come to them, they are still fighting the fight. They are still getting up every day and going to city hall,” she said. “They are still doing the jobs, because that’s what’s required of us.”
Wendy Via is co-founder and CEO of Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, an organization that tracks how online discourse shapes the potential for political violence. Via said the president’s actions against the mayors and their jurisdictions are “part of the authoritarian playbook” to try to crush political opposition. She noted that demonizing them creates an “enemy” that can later be used to justify military action and formal policy that removes rights.
“I do not think it is an accident that the mayors he’s gone after have been Black women, because another trait of authoritarianism is demonizing communities that have a history of being marginalized,” Via said. “When you can send in the troops and it’s a Black woman leader on the receiving end, then it’s not such a big deal to send in the troops — because they’re already the enemy, and they must not be capable of managing their city.”
The manner in which Trump insults Black women political leaders frequently calls into question their ability and aptitude to do their jobs.
The president just this week repeated a demand that Crockett, the Dallas-area representative who uses her post on the House Oversight Committee to hold the administration accountable, take an intelligence test. He also put quotation marks around the word congresswoman in a move to delegitimize Crockett’s stature and demeaned the progressive group of mostly women House members of color known as the Squad.
Crockett responded in a fundraising email that “Donald Trump just cannot stop thinking about me. He’s insulted me, challenged me to an IQ test — but now, he’s finally said something I agree with.” She then linked to a social media post in which the president wrote: “Jasmine Crockett is the future of the Democrat party!”
Black women have also faced physical restraint and even arrest for opposing the president’s actions.
Rep. LaMonica McIver of New Jersey is the first sitting member of Congress to be prosecuted by the Trump administration. She was indicted on three counts of “forcibly impeding” law enforcement during a confrontation earlier this summer outside an ICE facility. She pleaded not guilty, and in a recent court filing argued that her prosecution showed “unconstitutional differential treatment” because the Trump administration dropped cases against defendants facing the same charges over their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
When McIver denounced as racist Trump’s characterization of his militarized incursion into the District of Columbia as “liberation day,” a White House spokesman called her an “unserious person.”

In Texas, Collier spent the night in the Capitol alone after she refused a GOP-mandated law enforcement escort to monitor her whereabouts ahead of a vote on the Trump-requested congressional redistricting map, which had previously prompted Democrats to delay the vote by leaving the state, and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott to order their arrests.
“I thought: ‘Hell no,’” Collier said in a video released to the public.
Collier settled in for her long night on the House floor with a blue eye mask and white-and-red blankets and a small Texas flag that marked a page in the book “African Founders: How Enslaved People Expanded American Ideals.” She abruptly left a video call with U.S. Sen. Cory Booker and California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday after someone off screen informed her she faced a felony charge for speaking from the Capitol.
Scott said the president may be miscalculating how leaders like Bass and Bowser will respond to his attempts to seize their power — partly because of their own years of experience in politics, and partly because of how the information ecosystem is shaped now. Mayors are able to directly communicate with constituents in ways that may have been more limited in the past. Plus, social media platforms allow the public to see the impact of troops on the streets in these heavily Democratic communities where they are not welcomed.
“There’s a narrative that’s being placed on them, but they’re able to negate those narratives by what they themselves put out there on social media,” she said. “These are folks who are not shying away from the media … they want to talk about what they’re doing.”

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.
But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
States scramble to shield hospitals from GOP Medicaid cuts

“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Five hours after the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) declared its Providence headquarters bat-free Friday, there was another bat sighting on the second floor of the five-story building.
That sent the agency scrambling to confirm for its staff that everything was still going according to plan, with pest control technicians scheduled to report to the Friendship Street building Saturday, according to an internal agency email sent Friday at 7:25 p.m.  
The agency still plans to reopen the office building Monday morning, following what it assumed was the successful removal of two bats found on the premises last week. The offices have been closed since Monday, Aug. 18. One bat was spotted and caught on Aug. 14. Another bat sighting came on Aug. 17, prompting the office shutdown. 
In a follow-up email sent to staff, union representatives, and Rhode Island Current around 10 p.m. Friday, DCYF Chief of Staff Misty Delgado wrote that the bat was sighted “before our contractors could begin sealing the entry points we had previously identified.”
“A professional pest control team will return to the building to locate and safely remove the bat to conduct a comprehensive search to ensure no other bats are present,” Delgado wrote. “Once the building has been cleared, our contractors will immediately begin their work to permanently seal all potential entry points.” 
Bats out, workers back in at DCYF headquarters

No details were available about who saw the bat Friday night and exactly where. 
SEIU Local 580 workers are concerned that the building’s age and condition, including poor ventilation, expose them to health and safety hazards. The union represents about 300 of the 460 workers who regularly occupy the building, where some labor long hours or into the night. 
The local’s president, Matthew Gunnip, fired off emails to DCYF leadership after the bat was spotted. In emails sent up to 11:59 p.m. Friday, Gunnip included responses from union members who were surveyed on Aug. 19 and again Friday night about their concerns about the health and safety conditions in the building.  
“[W]hy would a return to ‘business as usual’ be in order?” wrote one union member in the Friday night survey. “Shouldn’t the health and safety of not only the staff, but children and families who enter the building come first?”
“Yet another bat was found tonight? I thought the company secured the building?” wrote another union member.
The building’s lease is up for renewal, but the State Properties Committee has twice postponed a decision on a proposed 10-year lease renewal pending a public hearing for union input. That meeting has still not been scheduled as of Friday.

Eviction protections for bat families
Liz Frieling, co-owner of Vanguard Wildlife Solutions, a pest removal specialist in Coventry, who is not involved with the DCYF response, said the little brown bat and the big brown bat are Rhode Island’s two most common bat species and are known to favor human-made structures to raise their young.
Frieling said in a phone interview Saturday that removing bats from a property during June and July would strand baby bats who haven’t learned to fly. Then, bats hibernate from late October through May, making removal unfeasible then, too. That means pest control can only remove bats in select months. In Rhode Island, “eviction season” runs from August through mid-October, and once more in May, before the bats’ “maternity season” begins, according to Frieling.
“They say, ‘June and July, let them fly,’” she added. 
While Frieling couldn’t speak to the specific process being used at DCYF, she described one process of bat eviction. First, pest control workers identify entry points, which can be anything as small as ⅜ of an inch. Then, one-way valves are installed that allow bats to exit but not re-enter. As the bats depart nightly, the population in a building slowly evacuates, and it takes about two weeks for a full exodus, Frieling said. Then, the valves and any additional entry points are sealed back up.     
Based on last week’s timeline of events, and the appearance of multiple bats, Frieling said, “It’s not going to be just one or two bats.”
Colony sizes can vary, but a maternal colony for big brown bats is typically 40 to 100 bats. According to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, bat colonies can be as small as a few mothers and their babies.
But even technicians have trouble knowing the exact size of a colony, Frieling said, because the bats hide themselves in a structure’s dark recesses, like attics or rafters.
“They’re not always popping into a living space,” she said. “If you’re seeing them in the living space, there is a colony there.”
A more reliable metric is guano, or bat excrement, Frieling said, as its presence and volume can help pest control determine the potential size of a colony. Frieling added that union members’ concerns about disease in guano, particularly histoplasmosis, are “reasonable.” But she added that to get sick one needs continued exposure to large amounts.
Frieling said old buildings like the Friendship Street headquarters can be a “nightmare for pest control” as they’re hard to seal, and it can “be difficult to fully exclude bats.”

The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Colorado Legislature begins third day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Saturday August 23, 2025 12:27 pm





The House began work on the third day of the special legislative session around 10 a.m. on Saturday morning. The plan is do final votes on a series of tax-related bills and send them over to the Senate for consideration.
Their first vote, after about two hours of debate, was a 43-19 approval of House Bill 25B-1001, which would make permanent an add-back for federal qualified business income deduction on state taxes.
In federal law, some businesses can deduct up to 20% of their QBI for their taxes. It was set to expire this year, but the recent federal tax and spending law extended that tax deduction. The bill would continue to decouple Colorado from the deduction, so taxpayers making above $500,000 individually or $1,000,000 jointly would need to add back that federal deduction for their state taxes.
Republicans argued that the federal deduction is important for small business owners in the state.
“This bill removes a key deduction passed in federal law. It’s a deduction designed to level the playing field between large corporations and small businesses,” Rep. Brandi Bradley, a Littleton Republican, said.
But bill sponsor Rep. Emily Sirota, a Denver Democrat, countered that the bill just maintains the status quo in Colorado tax code.
“They still get this benefit at the federal level. In this bill, we’re not making tax policy change. We are simply extending our current tax policy,” she said.
The bill’s fiscal note estimates it will raise about $46 million in the current fiscal year and about $95 million in the next one.
The House has five more bills on its calendar for final votes today. It will likely then head into initial debate on the bills cleared through committee yesterday.









Amended AI bill proposes to delay implementation of 2024 law


By: Sara Wilson - Friday August 22, 2025 5:36 pm





House Bill 25B-1008, one of the dueling artificial intelligence bills introduced by Colorado lawmakers during the special session, was gutted during its House Appropriations Committee hearing on Friday afternoon to become a simple extension of the controversial 2024 law’s effective date.
The bill would now push implementation of Senate Bill 24-205 until October 2026, rather than February 2026. The change was approved on an 8-3 bipartisan vote and now heads to the full House for debate.
“That’s where we are, so that we as a Legislature can come back to this issue and have a proper discussion when have time during a session. Doing this during a special session is quite difficult,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, said. “I’m asking that we move out the date so we can do this responsibly during the next session.”

Colorado Democrats want to raise revenue for food assistance program during special session


By: Sara Wilson -  4:00 pm





Colorado voters could be asked this November whether the state can keep extra tax money to fully fund universal school meals and offset lost federal funding for food assistance programs.
The Legislature referred Proposition MM to the ballot during its regular lawmaking session earlier this year, seeking to raise more money for the Healthy School Meals for All program. Senate Bill 25B-3, being considered during the current special session, would tweak that proposition to allow any leftover money to cover costs associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.

Senate ends work for the day as House sets slugglish pace for bill debate


By: Sara Wilson -  3:55 pm





As of mid-afternoon on Friday, the Senate had adjourned and the House broke into committee work after moving through just two bills in floor debate.
Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill from Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, was originally scheduled for its appropriations committee hearing, but that is now delayed as sponsors work through possible amendments.  The bill has an approximate $7 million annual price tag to retain more employees in the Office of Information and Technology and Judicial Department.
The Senate will continue work on Saturday.
The other AI bill, favored by moderates and the governor, is set for its own appropriations committee hearing in the House later on Friday afternoon.
The House got through two bills for initial floor debate and voice votes in four hours. The chamber recessed around 2 p.m. for committee work, including for those four bills passed in the Senate on Friday morning.

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

The project is already 80% completed, with 45 of its 65 turbines in the water off Block Island’s coastline, Orsted, the Danish co-development company, said in a statement Friday[...]","The first turbine installed by Orsted roughly 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast and 32 miles southeast of the Connecticut coast is shown in September 2024. (Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)Revolution Wind, Rhode Island’s first large-scale offshore wind project, was put on ice by the Trump administration Friday, which ordered developers to immediately stop construction.
The project is already 80% completed, with 45 of its 65 turbines in the water off Block Island’s coastline, Orsted, the Danish co-development company, said in a statement Friday night.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, renewable energy, including offshore wind, has come under threat, with major setbacks and cancellations in federal approvals for new and ongoing projects. But Revolution Wind had stayed afloat, having already secured the last of its necessary state and federal permits two years ago. As recently as April, developers expected a 2026 completion date, after which it would begin power to Rhode Island and Connecticut. The 704 megawatt nameplate capacity, 400 megawatts of which was under contract for purchase by Rhode Island, would provide enough electricity to power 350,000 homes across both states.
Matthew Giacona, the acting director for the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which oversees federal permitting for offshore wind projects, cited Trump’s Jan. 20 memo indefinitely pausing federal reviews on offshore wind as the reason why the administration was stopping construction on Revolution Wind.
“In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas,” Giacona wrote in the letter to Orsted.
Orsted in a statement Friday night confirmed it was complying with the federal stop-work order while “evaluating all options” to proceed with construction.
“This includes engagement with relevant permitting agencies for any necessary clarification or resolution as well as through potential legal proceedings, with the aim being to proceed with continued project construction towards [a commercial operation date] in the second half of 2026,” the company said in a statement.
The company also noted the financial implications of the halt to construction. Like wind farm developers nationwide, Orsted has seen project costs rise amid supply chain slowdowns and inflationary price hikes. As part of its second-quarter earnings released on Aug. 11, Orsted announced it was seeking $9.4 billion from shareholders to help pay for another offshore wind project planned off the New York coastline amid “hostility” from the Trump administration.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Orsted, declined to comment beyond the company’s statement.

‘Unwarranted, unacceptable and bizarre’ 
The abrupt halt to construction prompted a wave of criticism from state and federal officials, who emphasized the project’s critical role in meeting state environmental mandates under the 2021 Act on Climate law, along with economic and energy affordability concerns. 
“The Trump administration’s stop-work order on Revolution Wind undermines efforts to expand our energy supply, lower costs for families and businesses, and strengthen regional reliability,” Gov. Dan McKee said in a statement Saturday. “This action puts hundreds of union jobs at risk by halting a project that is 80% complete—just steps away from powering more than 350,000 homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut. At a time when we should be moving forward with solutions for energy, jobs, and affordability, the Trump administration is choosing delay and disruption. We are working with our partners in Connecticut to pursue every avenue to reverse this decision. Revolution Wind is key to Rhode Island’s economic development, energy security, and long-term affordability for our residents.”
Without the project, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha warned the state’s requirement to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 was “dead in the water.”
“With the significant investments made in this project already and its obvious benefit to our economy and climate, the Trump Administration’s attempt to halt it can only be characterized as bizarre,” Neronha said in a statement. “Along with our neighboring states, we are evaluating our avenues to reverse it.”
Rhode Island’s federal delegation blasted the Trump administration, calling the order “unwarranted and unacceptable” in a joint statement. 
The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management did not immediately respond to questions regarding the timing of its notice, issued over eight months after the executive order it cites.
Two days earlier, on Aug. 20, attorneys for a Rhode Island nonprofit representing local fishermen asked federal regulators to suspend work on three area offshore wind farms — Revolution Wind, SouthCoast Wind and South Fork Wind — citing violations of federal safety and environmental protections. Parts of the petition were shared with Rhode Island Current. 
Marisa Desautel, a partner at Desautel Browning Law, which submitted the petition on behalf of East Farm Commercial Fisheries Center, said she received an email response that the petition was received, but no further communication. 
The fishing community has been at odds with offshore wind developers for years, railing against alleged threats to their livelihood and safety. In Rhode Island, the disputes have taken center state in reviews by the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, which gets a say in federal offshore wind projects within 30 miles of the state’s coastline. The CRMC has ultimately approved every offshore project to come before it, including Revolution Wind, though it has sought to set up guardrails and financial compensation for fishermen.

The behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters claims that Abrego is the target of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the government after he contested his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in Salvadoran prison in March, Abrego’s lawyers wrote.
Abrego was released Friday to await trial in January on human smuggling charges and returned to Maryland, where the sheet metal apprentice lives with his wife and children. His wrongful deportation to El Salvador in March has brought ongoing scrutiny to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.
In a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.


Abrego’s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would “of course, communicate the government’s proposal to Mr. Abrego” but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.
Abrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tenn. Within minutes of Abrego’s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency’s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.

The Trump administration has threatened the city over its sanctuary policies. City officials say some officers violated the policy by assisting in the arrests. (City of Rochester)The Trump administration is once again pressuring liberal cities and states to cooperate with deportation efforts, despite previous setbacks in court.
Attorney General Pam Bondi sent letters last week telling sanctuary states, cities and counties that “you better be abiding by our federal policies and with our federal law enforcement, because if you aren’t, we’re going to come after you,” she said in a Fox News interview.
Cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies generally refuse to assist with immigration raids or accede to requests for local jails to hold prisoners for deportation. Those that responded to Stateline’s questions about the letters said they were not inclined to change their positions about cooperation with immigration authorities.
“It’s the tactic of a bully. And the only way to deal with a bully is to let them know that they’re not going to intimidate you,” Rhode Island Democratic Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.
The Trump administration is attempting to force more cooperation with immigration arrests. But it suffered a serious court reversal on July 25, when a federal judge dismissed a sanctuary policies case against Illinois, Chicago and Cook County.
The state and local policies reflect a “decision to not participate in enforcing civil immigration law — a decision protected by the Tenth Amendment,” Judge Lindsay Jenkins wrote in an order now under appeal.
Bondi’s letters follow the Justice Department’s Aug. 5 release of a list of sanctuary jurisdictions including 12 states, the District of Columbia, four counties and 18 cities. That’s fewer jurisdictions than the 14 states and almost 500 counties and cities that appeared on an earlier list, which the agency withdrew after criticism that it included conservative counties that were fully cooperating with immigration enforcement.
The states on the new list are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington state. The list also includes some counties and cities in those states as well as in Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Mexico.


Other federal courts have issued injunctions to at least temporarily stop Trump administration from withholding unrelated federal funding from governments that don’t cooperate on immigration. Cities, counties and states have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s executive orders targeting sanctuary policies, including a February order that federal payments to states and localities must not “by design or effect, facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration, or abet so-called ‘sanctuary’ policies that seek to shield illegal aliens from deportation.”


“The executive orders are directing agencies to basically take a maximalist approach to putting pressure on local governments to cooperate with immigration [enforcement], even though they’re not required to do so by federal law,” said Jonathan Miller, one of the attorneys working on the California case for the Public Rights Project, a California-based group promoting civil rights protections for states and cities.
One city on the administration’s list was Rochester, New York, which disciplined some police officers for helping federal agents make a March arrest in the city. The city already faces a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration that prominently mentions the arrest of three men from Guatemala; one of whom has since pleaded guilty to re-entering the United States after a previous deportation.
A spokesperson for the city, Barbara Pierce, said in a statement to The Guardian that, “Nothing in Attorney General Bondi’s letter is new and none of it has legal merit.”
“The letter reiterates many of the frivolous arguments that the federal government has already made in its pending suit against the city of Rochester,” she added. “These same arguments were levied against the city of Chicago and were dismissed by the federal district court for the eastern district of Illinois nearly a month ago.”
Ally Sullivan, a spokesperson for Colorado Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, said in a statement that Colorado “is not a sanctuary state. The Governor continues to be frustrated by this mistaken and incorrect label.” In a televised interview earlier this year, Polis pointed out that Colorado fully cooperates with federal authorities on criminal matters. Immigration, he said, is a civil matter.
“In Colorado, we are improving public safety, apprehending dangerous criminals, cooperating with federal law enforcement on criminal investigations, and keeping our communities safe,” Sullivan said.
Nevertheless, Colorado faces a federal lawsuit brought by the administration over its alleged sanctuary policies. Polis signed a measure in May that limits local law enforcement’s communication with federal immigration authorities and restricts where federal authorities can operate within schools, child care facilities, hospitals and libraries without a judicial warrant.
Connecticut Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont in a statement said the state’s Trust Act, which the Trump administration has targeted as a sanctuary policy, was passed with bipartisan support and helps ensure local police concentrate on serious crimes. The Trust Act, passed in 2013 and expanded in 2019, limits information sharing and compliance with requests to detain immigrants for federal immigration authorities.
“Nothing about this makes Connecticut a sanctuary in any legal or practical sense — it makes our state one that upholds the Constitution, respects the rule of law, and prioritizes the safety and well-being of our communities,” Lamont said.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The ethanol industry won’t tell you to fill your vehicle with illegal fuel, but thanks to a long-term study of fleet vehicles in Nebraska, it now says your vehicle would be fine if you did.
Most of the ethanol-blended gasoline sold in the U.S. is 90% petroleum and 10% ethanol. The Trump administration issued an executive order in April allowing nationwide, year-round sales of E15, despite concerns that it worsens air pollution in some areas during the summer. The next administration could rescind it, so some farm-state lawmakers are pushing to codify E15 availability.
The leader of the Nebraska Ethanol Board said Friday that a 30% ethanol blend — approved by the EPA for use in flex-fuel vehicles, but not in others — is “the fuel of the future.” Flex-fuel vehicles can run on gas, ethanol, or any blend of the two.
A representative for South Dakota Corn, meanwhile, said a marketing partnership with KwikStar shows that teens are more likely to start their driving careers buying E15 if they see it as a way to save money for snacks. Typically, the more ethanol a fuel has, the cheaper it is.
Both speakers at the the American Coalition for Ethanol’s annual conference in downtown Sioux Falls pressed the idea that ethanol — and the corn markets that rely on it — can overcome consumer skittishness with the right message.
Nebraska study: Most cars do well with E30
Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board, backed his claims on 30% ethanol’s fuel efficiency with a presentation about a long-term study of its use in Nebraska state government fleet vehicles.
The first phase came in 2019, when 50 non-flex-fuel vehicles of various model years, all located in Lincoln or Omaha, filled up with either E30 or E15 for a year. The study required a waiver from the EPA, he said.

The results of the study’s first phase were published in a peer-reviewed paper in 2021, and showed that the vehicles using E30 got similar gas mileage, suffered no engine damage and produced fewer carbon dioxide emissions. 
Rhodes said the second phase of the study offers stronger proof still. Since 2023, 100 state fleet vehicles have used either E30 or E10 and the results have been similar. That phase used E10 because the fleet vehicles were used across the entire state, and E15 isn’t available everywhere.
Newer vehicles lost about one mile per gallon with E30, Rhodes said.
“For the older vehicles, 2003 to 2013, E30 had a better fuel economy,” Rhodes said.
After the presentation, Rhodes told Searchlight that “we shouldn’t take our eyes off the prize” of E15 to start pushing for the adoption of E30. Even so, he said, the fleet study shows that there’s a future for higher blends.
“This is a long term, forward thinking project, because we know that the data will have to lead,” Rhodes said. “The horse has to pull the cart.”
Ron Lamberty, the ethanol coalition’s chief marketing officer, said the Nebraska results are “the best study we’ve seen” to confirm a claim he’s heard for years from farmers: That they don’t lose mileage with E30.
“Even then, I was skeptical,” Lamberty said. “Are they saying that because they love ethanol, or is it true? Now we’ve shown it to be true.”
Lamberty stressed that he can’t recommend people use E30 in a non-flex-fuel vehicle, given its legal status. But he also said he’d be happy to see the EPA issue a fine to a driver for ignoring that advice, and for that driver to challenge the EPA, “because they would lose the case.”
“Then we’d have a legal judgment,” Lamberty said, to show that the fuel is safe to use.
Kwik Star partnership: Selling ethanol to young people
Ethanol’s cultural stock as an antidote to climate change and reducer of carbon emissions has fallen since its mainstream adoption decades ago.
Some studies performed by researchers outside the industry have suggested that the carbon intensity and water demands of corn cultivation cancel out the environmental benefits of ethanol. It’s been more than a decade since the Environmental Working Group lambasted the industry with a report called “Ethanol’s Broken Promise,” which accused it of causing the conversion of grassland to crops. Greenpeace opposes the U.S. biofuels mandate, which incentivizes the use of ethanol, citing similar reasoning. 
Ethanol backers have pushed back on such assertions.

Amanda Bechen, director of marketing and communications for South Dakota Corn, said last year’s marketing partnership with the convenience store chain Kwik Stop was part of a strategy to target the youngest generation of drivers, ideally before they develop opinions on ethanol.
“Fourteen-year-olds can drive,” Bechen said. “We want to make sure that they see this message and before they develop the behavior of not using ethanol, so we get them to understand that this is a fuel that they can use for the rest of their life.”
The “Fuel Up South Dakota” marketing campaign, which ran from last July through the end of June 2025, used splashy signs with taglines like “it’s okay to go low” at the pump to push lower-priced E15. Video ads encouraging young people to save their money for snacks were aired across social media, as well as during televised Summit League collegiate basketball games and on streaming video platforms.
Bechen visits high schools as part of her regular duties, and said teens tend to know little about the kinds of fuel they’ve often just recently begun to put in their cars. Gas is labeled by octane, but she said kids don’t usually know what the numbers mean. The number “87” corresponds to E10, “88” to E15. An “89” on the pump handle would signal a mid-grade fuel without ethanol.
Bechen told South Dakota Searchlight she’s heard teens say they pick “87” because it’s Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce’s jersey number, or “89” because it corresponds to the album “1989” from Kelce’s girlfriend Taylor Swift.
The Kwik Star promotion’s biggest day came on March 29. On that day, the campaign ran a promotion offering 88-octane E15 fuel for $1.88 a gallon, from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Bechen said it was “a landmark event, the largest single day of sales for unleaded 88 in South Dakota” for Kwik Star.
“Some stations did run out,” she said.

Sanchez Multi-Service Center in the Lower 9th Ward on Feb. 16, 2023. She joined other officials to announce the end of the Road Home program. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS – Mayor LaToya Cantrell made history — becoming the city’s first mayor to be indicted while in office — after federal prosecutors charged her Aug. 15 with multiple counts of wire fraud, obstruction of justice and lying to a grand jury.
The 11 counts specific to Cantrell stem from an investigation into her alleged affair with former New Orleans Police Department officer Jeffrey Vappie, who worked on Cantrell’s security detail prior to his retirement from the force and has also been federally indicted.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office alleges, in a 48-page indictment, that Cantrell and Vappie illegally used city funds to travel around the country together, falsely claiming that the expenditures were related to city business, then conspiring to cover it up. Federal investigators combed through 15,000 text messages sent between the two — and later deleted by Cantrell, according to the indictment — where they discussed their relationship and plan travel together.
What comes next?
With no political precedent to turn to in order to understand how the following months will play out, legal and governmental experts in New Orleans have relied on the rules set out in New Orleans’ Home Charter and similar incidents from other cities to inform predictions for the future.
“I don’t expect this as a legal matter to have any effect on her ability to be mayor of the city of New Orleans,” said attorney and Loyola Law School Dane Ciolino. “Now, as a practical and political matter, that’s another issue.”
Ciolino added that when Cantrell appears in court for an initial hearing and arraignment — which is now scheduled for Sept. 10 —  it is likely there will be restrictions placed on her movement as a condition of release, meaning that she will need to consult with a judge before engaging in any international travel, or perhaps even travel outside of the Eastern District of Louisiana.
“It won’t be any impairment to her doing her job,” he said. “She’ll just have to seek permission, which would be, I suspect, liberally granted to her.”
An in-office conviction would force Cantrell out
While it may be unlikely that Cantrell will go to trial before her second term as mayor ends in January, she would be forced to step down if she were convicted of a felony.
Under state law, public officials must be removed from office if they are convicted of a federal or state felony. Under the city charter, if Cantrell were to plead guilty or chose not to contest the charges, she would face immediate removal.
If a mayor pleads not guilty and is convicted after a trial, the city charter calls for an automatic, unpaid suspension until the conviction is finalized through the appeals process, at which time she would be removed.. If Cantrell were suspended but later made a successful appeal to overturn the conviction, she would receive back pay.
What happens after a mayor is removed from office?
The charter also states that if a mayor is removed or resigns with less than a year left in the term, the City Council must elect one of the two at-large councilmembers to fill the seat, in lieu of a special election. Helena Moreno and JP Morrell are currently the two at-large city council members, with Morrell currently serving as council president.
Morrell is running for a second term in his seat. Moreno, meanwhile, is actively running her own mayoral campaign and is thus far the front-runner in the race to succeed Cantrell. (The New Orleans municipal election will be held on Oct. 11, with a runoff — should it be necessary — set for Nov. 15.)
Moreno’s office put out a public statement the day that the charges were announced, saying that the mayor is entitled to the presumption of innocence and “a vigorous defense.”
Moreno’s statement mirrored many of her colleagues — neutral on the subject matter involved in the charges, choosing instead to reframe and discuss how to best serve the city. While Cantrell’s relationship with the City Council has been rocky throughout her second term, there have been no public calls for her to resign from members of the City Council.
“The announcement today reminds us of the need to let the justice system work in a fair, timely fashion and without regard to politics or preference,” Councilmember Oliver Thomas, who is also running for mayor, wrote in a statement. “These are critical times for our city to get back on track and to stay focused on building a city that works and thrives for everyone.”
Councilmember Eugene Green released a statement similar in content, adding that it was a difficult day for New Orleans.
“My focus will continue to be on moving New Orleans forward — ensuring the safety of our citizens, strengthening our neighborhoods, and meeting the needs of my constituents,” Green wrote.
No indication of stepping down
A similar saga unfolded in Nashville, Tennessee, in 2018 when then-Mayor Megan Barry — who, like Cantrell, was the city’s first female mayor  — had an affair with a city-employed security officer who travelled with her on the city’s dime.
Barry pleaded guilty to a felony and resigned from office immediately after. Her political career was short-lived in the aftermath of the scandal as she mounted an unsuccessful run for Congress then pivoted to write a memoir.
Cantrell has not made any public statements since the indictment was announced by prosecutors at a press conference. She skipped the launch of  Amtrak’s new train service from New Orleans to Mobile, where she was slated to be a guest speaker Aug. 16 but was back to work by Monday (Aug. 18).
Cantrell’s communications team did not respond to Verite News requests for comment about whether her governance plans will change in response to the charges. Cantrell’s attorney, Eddie Castaing, declined to comment on the charges. A spokesperson for the mayor’s office said in a statement sent to the press on Monday that the mayor is focused on doing her job for the city of New Orleans.

Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024. (Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Tennessee public school students this school year will receive less state per-pupil funding than private school students using the state’s new voucher program, drawing sharp criticism from public education advocates and Democrats who argue the state is prioritizing voucher participants at the expense of other students.
Tennessee will spend an average of $7,023 per public school student in the state’s education funding formula, compared to the $7,295 given to students participating in the new Education Freedom Scholarship program.
Public school students will still receive more public funds, though, due to local government contributions to the formula and separate federal funds.
The 2025-26 funding formula allocation numbers, presented in a state board of Education meeting last week, have drawn criticism from opponents of Gov. Bill Lee’s voucher plan that launched this summer.
Tennessee Education Association President Tanya Coats said Monday that vouchers “shortchange” public education and the TEA is “deeply concerned” the state is providing more per-pupil funding for vouchers than in per-pupil public education funding.

“This disparity makes clear that Tennessee’s leaders are prioritizing private school subsidies over strengthening the public schools that serve the overwhelming majority of children in every community,” Coats said. “Rather than closing resource gaps, the state is growing disparities by sending more money to private schools while public schools continue to struggle with overcrowded classrooms, outdated materials, and educator shortages.”
Tennessee law requires that public school students are funded at a higher amount than the voucher program.
The governor’s office and Tennessee Department of Education this week noted state and local governments must contribute to the formula, known as the Tennessee Investment in Student Achievement (TISA).
With local contributions, the average per-pupil TISA allocation is $9,810, more than $2,000 higher than the voucher amount. TISA funding increased by about 3% this year.
“The EFS scholarship amount is $7,295 and is fully state funded, requiring no contribution from local governments,” said Maggie Hannan, communications director at TDOE. “Moreover, the state has made unprecedented investments in public education during the Lee administration, totaling over $2 billion since 2019.”
The financial responsibility of local governments vary, with economic drivers like Nashville funding proportionally more of their local formula while the state shoulders more of the burden for smaller, rural counties.
Public school enrollment still dwarfs voucher participation in Tennessee. Tennessee estimates more than 966,000 children will be enrolled in Tennessee public schools this year, amounting to nearly $6.8 billion in funding from the state and nearly $2.7 billion from local governments.
The education department has blocked data requests and declined to answer questions about how many and which students have been accepted into the voucher program, but the program is limited to 20,000 participants this year.
Still, mechanisms in the law mean Tennessee will likely expand the program every year going forward by up to 5,000 new students, a move an EdTrust analysis found could cost the state more than $892 million in the first five years alone. 
House Democratic Caucus Chairman John Ray Clemmons on Tuesday criticized historic education funding levels in recent years and warned local governments would have to raise taxes to keep up with their local share.
“Bill Lee’s legacy will be destroying public education and undermining opportunity for every child in the state of Tennessee,” said Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat. “They have proven, time and again, to bend and stretch the law to fit their false narrative in support of these voucher scams to the detriment of public education across the state of Tennessee.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nearly a third of telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder had to go without buprenorphine because they had trouble filling their prescription at a pharmacy, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.
Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.
Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.
The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.
In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.
The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.
Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.
The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Pennsylvania also contributed. In their conflict of interest disclosures, some of the authors reported holding equity in Workit Health.

(Photo by Bun Lee/Getty Images)Southeast Alaska has not had any ferry service to the mainland road system in British Columbia since 2022 and for the five years prior to that, what it had was unreliable and spotty. This was despite some Alaskans voicing a strong preference for a ferry to Prince Rupert, B.C., over Bellingham, Washington.
However, efforts to restart a ferry to Prince Rupert have proven to be very problematic. The problems involve the repairs to the ramp and dock, plus a renovation of the terminal. Canada requires the use of steel made in Canada while the U.S. requires that the steel used for these repairs be made in the U.S. Neither country is willing to allow an exemption from the requirement. Since the dock, ramp, terminal and staging area is all on Canadian soil, it is reasonable that Canada would enforce her own rules on docks and ramps in her own harbors.
Another problem is that any foreign vessel that docks in Canada must be equipped and crewed to comply with the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Alaska has only one ferry that is SOLAS compliant, the Kennicott, which is assigned to serve the Bellingham-to-Haines mainline route. Renovation to add the necessary equipment for other ferries in the fleet to comply with the SOLAS requirement is very expensive and not in the ferry system budget.
Additionally, the ferry system lacks enough SOLAS-trained crew to operate a SOLAS vessel, so the Kennicott cannot dock in Prince Rupert even with the required equipment installed.
Alaska signed a 50-year nonexclusive prepaid lease on the use of the Prince Rupert ramp, dock, terminal and staging area in 2013, at a cost of $3.3 million plus ongoing costs for electricity, taxes and maintenance.
Hyder is a better location than Prince Rupert, in part because it would remove all the problems that have so far prevented restarting Prince Rupert as a ferry route. American steel could be used for the ramp and dock repairs. SOLAS rules do not apply for Alaska ferries to dock at a U.S. port. Our Alaska customs agent could wear sidearms for their own protection. Alaska would not have to sign a lease with a foreign government on the ramp, dock, terminal and staging area.
Use of Hyder rather than Prince Rupert would situate the dock, terminal and vehicle staging area on Alaska soil, owned by the state, instead of on Canadian soil, removing all the risks associated with contracts, leases and potential disputes with the Canadian government. Given the relationship the U.S. now has with Canada, this may be the biggest issue facing Alaskan efforts to restart a ferry route to Prince Rupert.
Another advantage to Hyder is that although it is slightly longer by sea than Prince Rupert, it is much farther inland than Prince Rupert, which is on the coast. Hyder is at the end of Portland Canal, about an hour and a half inland. It also avoids having to cross Dixon Entrance, which can be dangerous, with big seas and storm conditions. Portland Canal is calmer water than Dixon Entrance in a storm. The actual difference in distance is about 90 sea miles to Prince Rupert and 143 sea miles to Hyder. At an average speed of 14 knots, that is a trip of about 7 hours to Prince Rupert and 10 hours to Hyder, but landing in Hyder puts the traveler 1.5 hours farther inland than does Prince Rupert, without crossing into Canadian waters.
At present, the Alaska Department of Transportation has not indicated a preference for Hyder, but by setting a September deadline for a decision, the Alaska Marine Highway Operations Board has shown their desire to move forward to restore ferry services to Ketchikan and southern Southeast Alaska folks seeking a convenient and affordable way to access the British Columbia road system. After seven years of waiting, this is long overdue and would be more than just welcome. It would energize the economies of Southeast Alaska towns and villages, as well as provide access to families, friends and recreation across the north.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-23 12:39:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump administration halts CT offshore wind project,Jan Ellen Spiegel,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/23/revolution-wind-trump-administration-ct-offshore-wind/,"Revolution Wind has created about 1200 direct jobs in CT and Rhode Island and would generate  power to the equivalent of about 350,000 homes.","The developers of Connecticut’s only offshore wind project, Revolution Wind, were ordered by the Trump administration late Friday to stop construction immediately. 
The project is already 80% complete according to Ørsted, one of its developers.
It is designed to generate more than 700 megawatts of power — 305 megawatts to Connecticut and 400 to Rhode Island — and would provide power to the equivalent of about 350,000 homes.
This is the second time Trump officials have shut down an offshore wind project that was already under construction. President Donald J. Trump’s dislike of wind power is longstanding.
Friday afternoon, Ørsted received a letter from the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, ordering it to “halt all ongoing activities related to the Revolution Wind Project on the outer continental shelf.” It went on to say that this was to allow time for BOEM to address concerns that have arisen since President Trump’s inauguration day order to stop any new wind projects on federal properties and review all those underway.
Another part of the letter stated that: “In particular, BOEM is seeking to address concerns related to the protection of national security interests of the United States.”
Earlier in the week, the U.S. Commerce Department revealed it had opened an investigation the week before “to determine the effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components.” That announcement indicated the results could trigger steep tariffs or quotas “to protect national security.”
BOEM did not respond to emails or phone calls Friday night seeking further information about what the specific security issues were for Revolution Wind or whether the two investigations were related.
The BOEM letter to Ørsted also threatened further “corrective action” if the company did not comply.
Revolution has created about 1200 direct jobs in Connecticut and Rhode Island. Eighty to 120 of them, depending on the activity level at any given time, are at State Pier in New London where much of the onshore work is being done.
The onshore transmission work for Revolution Wind began in the summer of 2023. All federal and state permits were secured in November 2023 and full construction began in early 2024. Presently all of the offshore foundations are in place and 45 of the 65 wind turbines are installed according to Ørsted. Work is slated to be completed by the end of 2026.

In a lengthy statement on its website Ørsted said it “is complying with the order and is taking appropriate steps to stop offshore activities, ensuring the safety of workers and the environment.”
The statement also said; “Ørsted is evaluating the potential financial implications of this development, considering a range of scenarios, including legal proceedings.”
So is Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who said in a statement Friday night that “We are evaluating all legal options to protect Connecticut’s interests.”
“Trump wants to mothball billions of dollars in investment and cancel one of the best new sources of American-made, renewable energy. Trump and his enablers will own the resulting cost increases for ratepayers,” Tong said.
Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal pointed to the potential impact on electric bills as well. 
“The Trump Administration is canceling critical clean energy projects that would lower utility bills and have created good paying union jobs for our state’s workforce,” the Democratic senator said in a statement. “This arbitrary decision defies all logic and reason. Revolution Wind’s project was already well underway and employed hundreds of skilled tradesmen and women. This is a major setback for a critical project in Connecticut, and I will fight it.”
At the Conservation Law Foundation, which operates throughout New England, Kate Sinding Daly, the group’s senior vice president for law and policy said in a statement: “There is no evident legal basis for this, and it contravenes all common sense. Offshore wind represents the single most significant investment in clean, affordable energy for New England and this specious directive will not only deprive New Englanders of homegrown jobs but exposes us to higher energy bills and increasingly deadly extreme weather.”

Outrage was swift from a number of national groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council. Kit Kennedy, the group’s managing director for power called halting Revolution Wind “a devastating attack on workers, on electricity customers, and on the investment climate in the U.S.”
“This administration has it exactly backwards. It’s trying to prop up clunky, polluting coal plants while doing all it can to halt the fastest growing energy sources of the future – solar and wind power.”
Both have been targeted directly by the Trump administration in the recent reconciliation budget legislation. Their valuable federal tax credits are being eliminated along with other actions that will make them less financially worthwhile.
Only a handful of offshore wind projects remain in development, a sharp departure from the many the Biden administration had approved. It had been assumed those under construction would be safe, but in July the Interior Department announced that it would consider cancelling projects that were challenged in court. The next day, the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation filed suit on behalf of fishermen against a Massachusetts project – Vineyard Wind 1.
The first project stopped by the Trump administration was Empire Wind off New York, which was halted in April. That move was widely seen as a pressure tactic to get New York Governor Kathy Hochul to agree to allow a natural gas pipeline through the state. Hochul has said no deal was made.
That project was restarted after a month, but its developer, Equinor, came close to shutting it down and in the end the company indicated it cost them $1 billion.
Ørsted has had its own financial issues lately. Its stock nosedived earlier this month when the company said it would need more than $9 billion to help finance its only other offshore wind development, Sunrise Wind off Long Island.
American Clean Power CEO Jason Grumet posted online: “This is not the first time extreme partisan politics has derailed sound energy policy. The unfortunate message to investors is clear: the U.S. is no longer a reliable place for long-term energy investments,” he said.
Connecticut has had its own difficulties with offshore wind projects. A large, second project called Park City Wind was cancelled after inflation spurred by COVID and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused its developer, Avangrid, to pull out when its initial costs were no longer sustainable. In the last offshore wind solicitation at the end of the Biden administration, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection opted to forgo any new projects. 
In a statement Friday night, Commissioner Katie Dykes called the stop-work order on Revolution “deeply disappointing.”
“Losing this much capacity means higher costs and less reliability for families and businesses in Connecticut and across New England, at a time when we urgently need more affordable, domestically produced energy to strengthen our regional grid,” Dykes said. “Connecticut remains committed to an all-of-the-above approach to energy, of which offshore wind is a promising and important part.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Revolution-installed-turbine-082025-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-23 08:57:29.718683

President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.

The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.

‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”

Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.

‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
‘An unprecedented time’
State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
As partisan redistricting battles flare, Maine constitutional officers weigh in

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

She’s on call almost constantly in northeast Missouri’s Scotland County, where she cares for patients from their birth until their death.
As an osteopath practicing in a rural community, part of her job includes caring for patients throughout their pregnancies.
“I do inpatient hospital coverage,” Davis-Humes said. “I deliver babies and do women’s health. I do pediatric care, newborn care. I am in the clinic. I go to the nursing home.”
While her area hasn’t lost an obstetrics unit in recent years, Davis-Humes has seen the impact on the state as a whole as pregnancy care becomes more difficult to access.
Missouri has lost 11 obstetric units since 2009, with seven of those in rural parts of the state, a report from the University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center found. The closure of hospital obstetric units means women have to travel farther for their appointments and their deliveries.
As the units have closed, more parts of the state have fallen into maternity care deserts — areas without access to birth units or maternity care providers.
Based on 2023 data, Missouri is marked by more maternity care deserts than the nation as a whole. March of Dimes data shows that 41.7% of Missouri’s counties are classified as maternity care deserts, compared to 32.6% nationwide.
Part of the problem for rural providers? Medicaid payments. The government-sponsored health insurance plans do not reimburse obstetric care fully, meaning for every baby they deliver, the hospital takes a loss.
“Every hospital who does birth services loses money,” said Alison Williams, vice president of clinical quality improvement at the Missouri Hospital Association. Williams also leads Missouri’s Perinatal Quality Collaborative, a statewide task force dedicated to improving outcomes for moms and babies across the state.
In Missouri, about 40% of the state’s births were covered by Medicaid in 2023, KFF data shows.
As Medicaid cuts under President Donald Trump’s budget plan begin to materialize, anywhere from 130,000 to 170,000 Missourians are expected to lose their coverage over the next five years. The budget also changes how states can pay for Medicaid patients — and how much.
“We are going to be paid less,” said Craig Thompson, the CEO of Golden Valley Memorial Hospital in Clinton.
That could put rural hospitals with obstetric units at higher risk when it comes to continuing to offer their services, and will require more creative thinking from Missouri and its health care providers.
 Rural Missouri’s maternity care shortage 

Missouri’s health care challenges are compounded when it comes to maternity care. As health care services become more difficult to access, chronic conditions rise and lead to more complicated pregnancies.
Then, obstetric providers and care teams must be prepared to take on more high-risk pregnancies.
In Missouri, 68.7% of counties have a high burden of chronic health conditions and a high rate of preterm births, March of Dimes data shows, higher than the nationwide average. An estimated 45.5% of women living in Missouri had one or more chronic health conditions, compared to 37.8% nationwide.
“In general, you see more high-risk patients,” Davis-Humes said. “People are sicker, they’re more unhealthy, so we just see more patients that have more of these high risk conditions during their pregnancy.”
An added layer is the growing distance that rural women in Missouri must travel to get their care. Women living in maternity deserts — just over 40% of the counties in Missouri — have to travel 3.6 times farther than women living in areas with full access to maternity care.
That means things like prenatal care and regular checkups are even farther out of reach, and missing appointments raises the risk during pregnancy even more.
That’s showing up in Clinton and impacting how Thompson and his team think about maternity care. At their hospital, 63% of about 350 deliveries that happen every year are considered high-risk.
“Many Medicaid patients don’t have access to transportation, either they cannot afford transportation or there is no public transportation in rural Missouri,” Thompson said. “So without transportation access, people don’t have the ability to access that prenatal care, which then causes poor birth outcomes.”
And with high-risk pregnancies, soon-to-be moms in rural areas are drawn to more robust hospital systems with more speciality providers.
The downside to that, Williams said, is people who have the ability to travel to a larger hospital often take their commercial insurance with them, driving up the rate of deliveries that are covered by Medicaid for their nearby hospital and making it even harder to continue providing labor and delivery services.
“It creates an even larger, disproportionate share of Medicaid and vulnerable patients, or patients who don’t end up engaging in prenatal services,” Williams said.
As a hospital leader, Thompson and his team are committed to continuing to provide obstetric services in their hospital. But because so many of their births are covered by Medicaid and cost more than what they are paid, they rely on other services to cover that loss.
“If we were to look at those services on their own, they would be a significant financial drain to the system,” Thompson said. “We are kind of robbing Peter to pay Paul, to some extent.”
Plus, obstetricians and gynecologists, like most other medical providers, are looking for work-life balance, such as splitting their patient loads with multiple providers and other upsides that often come with working in a more populated area.
It can be difficult for rural providers to balance all of those needs, especially since monitoring labor and deliveries are so sporadic.
“If you have enough providers, you will likely have enough (patient) volume,” Williams said of rural providers looking to keep their birth units open. “The challenge is making sure you can maintain enough providers to where they have that work-life balance.”
 What do health leaders want to see for OB-GYN providers moving forward? 

As providers look to fill the gaps in maternal care, they’re leaning on innovative ways to ensure that every Missouri mother has access to adequate care.
For example, providers in Harrison County, which sits in northwest Missouri along the Iowa border, created a partnership with North Kansas City Hospital for labor and deliveries. Expecting mothers get prenatal care in the county, but travel to Kansas City for their deliveries. Afterward, patients are handed back to their providers in Harrison County.
Those types of partnerships are key to ensuring that mothers are followed every step of the way throughout their pregnancies, Williams said. Creating similar partnerships is one of the state’s goals moving forward.
“It’s important to have that good flow of prenatal records,” Williams said. “It’s important to have that connectivity, that handoff for the patient, so the patient feels like people know what’s going on with their care.”
The state is also focusing on recruitment and retention as part of the path to solving the problem. Davis-Humes mentors many aspiring doctors, who say that the workload of being on call constantly in rural communities is a deterrent for them.
“You’ve got to have people that are willing to come to an area and wear multiple hats, and also be willing to be called in in the middle of the night, too,” she said.
But she also wants to see more unique ways of encouraging rural providers to continue providing a service that makes them lose money.
“I think the state needs to put their money where their mouth is,” Davis-Humes said.
“We keep seeing all these birth centers close. We keep seeing that OB has a hard time making money … I think there should be some type of reward there,” she said. “You keep your OB center open, every year you get some sort of incentive from the state that says ‘Thank you … we’re going to help support you so you can continue to keep that OB unit open.’”
Although hospital executives are expecting to reassess their finances and the services they provide in the coming years as a result of Medicaid cuts, they are encouraged that they are seeing a new willingness to discuss the financial difficulties rural providers face.
“At some point, there has got to be real reform around reimbursement for rural health care services,” Thompson said. “We’re just not the same as our urban and suburban counterparts.”

The private company that employs the transportation workers locked them out on Wednesday after tense negotiations over a new contract with their union broke down.

Bus drivers and monitors for Windham Southeast Supervisory Union schools picketed in Brattleboro Friday afternoon in front of Vermont Academy School and Brattleboro Union High School as tense negotiations continue with their private employer. 
The student transportation workers, represented by the Vermont Teamsters Local 597 union, have been locked out of their place of employment since Wednesday by Travel Kuz, which has offices in Brattleboro and northern Massachusetts. According to its website, the company became affiliated in 2023 with Beacon Mobility, a firm with school bus companies nationwide.
“The employer is not letting anybody go to work until they agree to their terms and conditions, so they’ve locked us out to try to put pressure on the group,” Vermont Teamsters President Curtis Clough said in an interview.  
The school year begins for students in Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, like many others across the state, on Aug. 27. In addition to Brattleboro schools, the supervisory union also includes schools in Dummerston, Guilford, Halifax, Putney and Vernon. 
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters claimed in a press release that if the bar on bus drivers and monitors working continues into next week, its members are concerned it could mean that students enrolled in Windham Southeast schools will not have bus transportation. 
An email from Travel Kuz said the temporary lockout at the Brattleboro office was implemented earlier this week after no agreement was reached with the union, but that the lockout will not affect student transportation routes. 
The email from the company said that the union’s request would result in over a 40% increase in costs to the company, “an unrealistic burden under fixed school district contracts,” and that the company is prepared to meet with the union to find a “fair, balanced resolution.”
In addition to claims it cannot pay workers what they’re asking for, Travel Kuz has held back retirement matches and health care premiums and frequently failed to pay workers on time, Clough said. 
Teamsters Local 597 asked to open bargaining in February and the union’s contract expired in June, Clough said. Between May and July, there was a period of several weeks when negotiations were at a standstill because the company refused to meet with the union. It has been difficult scheduling a time to meet with companies to continue negotiations after their last bargaining session Aug. 7, he added. 
Teamsters Local 597 filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board due to Travel Kuz withholding a revenue contract document that the union requested and the lockout notice. This along with refusing to negotiate for weeks displays the “bad faith bargaining” of the employer, Clough said. 
Catherine Cleveland, a union member, said she was looking forward to her first day of school as a bus driver after receiving her certification in June. She worked as a bus monitor with the company before that, and said that she was injured on the job a year ago and is “still fighting workmen’s comp claims.” Beyond higher wages, Cleveland said she would like the company to demonstrate more appreciation for the work and responsibilities of bus drivers and monitors safely transporting students.
Cleveland said the children will be negatively impacted if the lockout continues even if the company sends out-of-state drivers and monitors to serve the Windham Southeast schools.
“They don’t know the children. They don’t know the schools,” Cleveland said, “A lot of them probably don’t know a lot of the areas, so even just being out driving a route is going to be a challenge.”
The Windham Southeast Supervisory Union superintendent could not be immediately reached for comment.

On Friday, United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher said famine in Gaza could have been prevented, blaming the Israeli government for systematically obstructing the flow of aid into the Gaza strip.
“It is a famine openly supported by some Israeli leaders as a weapon of war. It is a famine on all of our watch,” Fletcher said.
While Israel has justified severe restriction on aid entering Gaza by arguing the militant group Hamas has been stealing aid delivered by humanitarian groups, a New York Times report says the Israeli military never found proof for this claim.

He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Jeff Landry at a news conference Sept. 13, 2024, on the recovery from Hurricane Francine at Signature Aviation in Kenner. (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Sad. Disappointed. Not surprised.
They’re the first words that come to mind when reflecting on the indictment of New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, who faces 11 felony counts on federal charges of wire fraud, obstructing justice and lying to a grand jury. 
The investigation centers on how she allegedly denied and concealed her romantic relationship with Jeffrey Vappie, a member of her security detail, and used public dollars to pay for their extensive travel together. Vappie, who has since resigned from the New Orleans Police Department, faces separate federal charges for filing timesheets that indicated he was on the job while he was actually spending personal time with the mayor.
While it’s disheartening that yet another Louisiana politician has put themselves in criminal jeopardy, it should come as no surprise. The 44-page indictment (read it below) is basically a synopsis of several months of investigative reporting from our partners at WVUE-TV Fox 8 News. Their journalists obtained the publicly available security camera footage from Jackson Square that showed Cantrell and Vappie spending extended time together at the city-owned dwelling in the Pontalba Apartments.

The mayor has had many opportunities to justify her actions or even be contrite. She has instead steadfastly painted herself as a victim, despite a mounting paper trail that points to her complicity. She faces arraignment in federal court Sept. 10, and political observers expect her to serve out the rest of her term that ends in January.
Cantrell’s indictment comes 11 years after the conviction of former Mayor Ray Nagin, who accepted bribes from businessmen seeking city contracts. Nagin’s indictment followed his time in office, but his offenses occurred while he led New Orleans’ attempt to rebound from Hurricane Katrina. His crimes carried the added sting of someone taking advantage of their power while the city was at its most vulnerable.    
The current mayor’s downfall is disappointing for different reasons, namely when you consider her rapid rise from neighborhood organizer to city leader. After Katrina, she led a grassroots movement to revive the stricken Broadmoor community. Her track record and straightforward style helped the Palmdale, California, native overcome the “outsider” label some placed on her, despite having lived in New Orleans since her student days at Xavier University. 
While detractors bristle at her assertive public persona, Cantrell is a very impactful politician in one-on-one settings. Insiders say she can be firm when the situation calls for it – and sometimes when it doesn’t – yet she shows an empathetic side that endears her to diehard supporters. 
Cantrell embraced the nickname “Teedy,” a badge of affection used in local Black families, usually given to that aunt who doesn’t hesitate to tell it like it is. Even after critics weaponized the term to express their disdain for her, the mayor doubled down and made ‘Teedy” part of her social media branding.
Beyond the recent indictment, Cantrell is also connected to another federal investigation that has produced criminal charges. Electrical inspector Randy Farrell is accused of giving the mayor thousands of dollars worth of New Orleans Saints tickets, a free iPhone and lunch in exchange for firing a city official who was investigating permit approvals for Farrell’s business. Only Farrell and businessman Fouad Zeton, the alleged middleman between Farrell and the mayor, were targeted in that indictment, but charges against Cantrell in this case remain a possibility.   
Farrell has pleaded not guilty to bribery and wire fraud charges. Zeton, who positioned himself as a close ally of the mayor, has already admitted his guilt in yet another federal case. He filed a bogus insurance claim to recover damages for pricey art he said was stolen from his home. 
Even by Louisiana political scandal standards, the web of deceit is astonishing. And it’s simply too much to wrap one’s head around at a time when the city marks the immense tragedy that unfolded 20 years ago this week. The levee failures are yet another example of public officials letting down the public trust.
While the potential consequences for Cantrell would represent a win for accountability, there is no satisfaction in her undoing. Her story is the latest from a city rife with tales of squandered potential.

(Photo by 	Unaihuiziphotography/Getty Images)North Dakota won’t see any charter schools open this year, but state education officials are busy behind the scenes laying the groundwork for next year.
Lawmakers passed Senate Bill 2241 during the 2025 session that authorized public charter schools in North Dakota, leaving South Dakota, Nebraska and Vermont as the only states without a public charter school law.
Supporters of charter schools said they will give families more options and may be able to cater to different learning styles or interests. Bill sponsor Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, gave examples during the legislative session of charter schools around the country specializing in health care or building trades, dual language or STEM-education models.
“It expands education opportunities and provides a new way to promote innovation and offer more choice to families,” North Dakota Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said in an Aug. 5 statement.
Now the state Department of Public Instruction is developing an application process and drafting rules to license the new schools. A public hearing is expected before the end of the year.
The department has received some inquiries from teachers and organizations interested in establishing a charter school, said Arlene Wolf, director of school approvals and opportunity.
Charter schools will not be able to charge tuition or offer religious instruction, according to the new law. They will also not be able to discriminate based on ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender or income level, among other criteria.
The schools will receive state funding that follows the student. The funding is based on the state funding average, which is about $8,360 per student for 2025-26, according to the department. Charter schools also will be able to receive federal grants and private donations.
The law allows existing schools to become a public charter school if a majority of the parents of students support the change.
The Department of Public Instruction will be the sole authorizing authority for public charter schools in North Dakota, Wolf said. North Dakota plans to apply for federal grants to assist with establishing the new schools, she said.
House passes bill authorizing charter schools in North Dakota

“We want to make sure we are building the right process to ensure success,” Wolf said. “It just takes a little bit of time, but we’re certainly trying to do it right. Luckily, we had a lot of states that were ahead of us.”
State education officials have learned from other states that having a detailed application on the front end can save time during the permitting process, Wolf said. They’ve also learned the importance of having an in-person interview during a public meeting as part of the approval process, she said.
“What you really want to know is that they have the systems in place so when they open their doors, they are ready to go,” she said.
Charter schools will be held to the same standards as the state’s other public schools, Wolf said, and could face similar improvement guidelines if student performance falls into the bottom 10% of performing schools in the state.
“We don’t want to make anything difficult, but we definitely want to ensure that students are increasing in their outcomes,” Wolf said.
Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, an educator and public employee union, said it will be important that the rules that govern a school’s performance are the same for charter schools as they are for public schools.
ND United and other education organizations across the state will be monitoring the department’s rules process, he said.
“We’re also very interested to see what the governing boards of these charter schools end up looking like,” Archuleta said. “What qualifications should a person have for that sort of position? What level of professionalism is going to be expected of that governing body?”
He said the organization is worried that charter schools will be competing for funding against the public education system.
“The pie is only so big,” he said. 
Idaho, which established public charter schools in 1998, initially had opposition to the new schools, but now they have been embraced in the state, said Terry Ryan, CEO of BLUUM, an Idaho-based public charter school support organization.
Similar to North Dakota, opponents in Idaho warned that charter schools would mean the “death” of rural school districts, Ryan said. But that hasn’t been the case, he said.
Idaho now has 75 charter schools, representing about 10% of the total student population, Ryan said. 
The Idaho School Boards Association has become less hostile toward charter schools, Ryan said, even including charter school-specific learning sessions at its annual convention.
“I think we’ve evolved from this is ‘us against them’ to, really, we’re all in this together and the ultimate goal is to better serve our families and our children,” he said.

(Sebastian Gorczowski/iStock/Getty Images Plus)
Two big assumptions underlie President Donald Trump’s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion policies. The first is that discrimination against people of color is a thing of the past. The second is that DEI policies and practices discriminate against white people — especially white men — in what’s sometimes called “reverse discrimination.”
I’m a sociologist who’s spent decades studying race and inequality, and when I read the documents and statements coming out of the Trump White House, these assumptions jump out at me again and again — usually implicitly, but always there.
The problem is that the evidence doesn’t back these assumptions up.
For one thing, if discrimination against white Americans were widespread, you might expect large numbers to report being treated unfairly. But polling data shows otherwise. A 2025 Pew survey found that 70% of white Americans think Black people face “some” or “a lot” of discrimination in general, and roughly two-thirds say the same of Asian and Hispanic people. Meanwhile, only 45% of white Americans believe that white people in general experience that degree of discrimination.
In other words, white Americans believe that people of color, as a group, face more discrimination than white people do. People of color agree — and so do Americans overall.
In a second national study, using data collected in 2023, Americans were asked if they had personally experienced discrimination within the past year. Thirty-eight percent of white people said they had, compared with 54% of Black Americans, 50% of Latinos and 42% of Asian Americans. In other words, white Americans are much less likely to say that they’ve been discriminated against than people of color.
 
The ‘hard’ numbers show persistent privilege
These statistics are sometimes called “soft” data because they reflect people’s perceptions rather than verified incidents. To broaden the picture, it’s worth looking at “hard” data on measures like income, education and employment outcomes. These indicators also suggest that white Americans as a group are advantaged relative to people of color.
For example, federal agencies have documented racial disparities in income for decades, with white Americans, as a group, generally outearning Black and Latino Americans. This is true even when you control for education. When the Census Bureau looked at median annual earnings for Americans between 25 and 64 with at least a bachelor’s degree, it found that Black Americans received only 81% of what comparably educated white Americans earned, while Latinos earned only 80%. Asian Americans, on the other hand, earned 119% of what white people earned.
These gaps persist even when you hold college major constant. In the highest-paying major, electrical engineering, Black Americans earned only 71% of what white people did, while Latinos earned just 73%. Asian Americans, in contrast, earned 104% of what white people earned. In the lowest-paid major, family and consumer sciences, African Americans earned 97% of what white people did, and Latinos earned 94%. Asian Americans earned 117% of what white people earned. The same general pattern of white income advantage existed in all majors with two exceptions: Black people earned more in elementary education and nursing.
Remember, this is comparing individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher to people with the same college major. Again, white Americans are still advantaged in most career paths over Black Americans and Latinos.
 
Disparities persist in the job market
Unemployment data show similar patterns. The July 2025 figures for workers at all education levels show that Black people were 1.9 times more likely to be unemployed than white Americans. Latinos were 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed, and Asian Americans, 1.1 times.
This same white advantage still occurs when looking only at workers who have earned a bachelor’s degree or more. Black Americans who have earned bachelor’s degrees or higher were 1.3 times more likely to be unemployed than similarly educated white Americans as of 2021, the last year for which data is available. Latinos with college degrees were 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed than similar white Americans. The white advantage was even higher for those with only a high school degree or less. Unfortunately, data for Asian Americans weren’t available.
In another study, researchers sent 80,000 fake resumes in response to 10,000 job listings posted by 97 of the largest employers in the country. The credentials on the resumes were essentially the same, but the names signaled race: Some had Black-sounding names, like Lakisha or Leroy, while others had more “white-sounding” names like Todd or Allison. This method is known as an “audit study.”
This research, which was conducted between 2019 and 2021, found that employers were 9.5% more likely to contact the Todds and Allisons than the Lakishas and Leroys within 30 days of receiving a resume. Of the 28 audit studies that have been conducted since 1989, each one showed that applicants with Black- or Latino-sounding names were less likely to be contacted that those with white-sounding or racially neutral names.
Finally, a 2025 study analyzed 600,000 letters of recommendation for college-bound students who used the Common App form during the 2018-19 and 2019-20 academic years. Only students who applied to at least one selective college were included. The study found that letters for Black and Latino students were shorter and said less about their intellectual promise.
Similarly, letters in support of first-generation students — that is, whose parents hadn’t graduated from a four-year college, and who are disproportionately likely to be Black and Latino — had fewer sentences dedicated to their scientific, athletic and artistic abilities, or their overall academic potential.
These and other studies don’t provide evidence of massive anti-white discrimination. Although scattered cases of white people being discriminated against undoubtedly exist, the data suggest that white people are still advantaged relative to non-Asian people of color. White Americans may be less advantaged than they were, but they’re still advantaged.
While it’s true that many working-class white Americans are having a tough time in the current economy, it’s not because of their race. It’s because of their class. It’s because of automation and overseas outsourcing taking away good jobs. It’s because of high health care costs and cuts in the safety nets.
In other words, while many working-class white people are struggling now, there’s little evidence race is the problem.

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.
“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria, and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba, and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers a variable amount of monthly cash assistance through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A new stormwater permit meant to control runoff of polluted rainwater from state roads into state waterways is a “critical missed opportunity,” according to environmental groups, who say the new guidelines backtrack from previous requirements.
The five-year permit, issued Friday to the State Highway Administration by the Maryland Department of the Environment, sets a requirement of controlling runoff on more than 4,000 acres owned by SHA, which is backed up by $216 million in combined state and federal funding, officials said.
“This permit strengthens our ability to protect the Chesapeake Bay and the businesses and communities that rely on it, manage stormwater in overburdened areas, and make our state an even more desirable place to live,” Maryland Environment Secretary Serena McIlwain said in a statement Friday.
But advocates, from groups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said the new permit actually targets less acreage than the last five-year permit did, and it largely leaves it to the SHA to decide what methods it will use to achieve runoff control.
Instead of flexibility, the advocates were hoping the new permit would require more effective runoff control measures, like tree plantings and stormwater ponds that trap water before it reaches natural waterways. But the state highway system can utilize other methods to comply too, including street sweeping, stream restoration and pollution credits.
The advocates say those methods aren’t as helpful, in part because they don’t do as much to stop harmful nutrients from running off the streets. Environmental groups and scientists have also cast doubt on the efficacy of some stream restoration projects, which modify stream banks in an effort to curtail erosion.
“We wanted [MDE] to put a cap on … the things that are of lesser value, and a bare minimum on the important things — and they just didn’t do that,” said Evan Isaacson, a senior attorney with the nonprofit Chesapeake Legal Alliance, which represents clients in environmental litigation.
After last Bay cleanup plan fell short, new proposal aims to be flexible, data-driven

Isaacson added that he remains hopeful that state officials will take the feedback into account, and select the most efficient methods to meet the permit requirements.
SHA spokesperson Shanteé Felix said in a statement that the agency will “utilize a balanced approach of MDE approved strategies that are feasible within the current budget to meet the requirements of the permit.”
Matt Stegman, a staff attorney for the Bay Foundation who focuses on Maryland, said the advocates’ preferred methods also provide more lasting change.
“If you plant a tree, eventually it’s going to be there for decades, as opposed to if you sweep the street, you’ve got to come do it again next week,” Stegman said.
Kim Coble, executive director of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters, said in a statement Friday that she doesn’t feel as though the permit takes a strong enough stance to ensure that projects happen in communities near state highways dealing with pollution and flooding concerns.
“Unfortunately, this permit takes a minimalistic approach that fails to prioritize projects addressing climate resilience and water quality in communities most burdened by pollution,” Coble wrote.
But an MDE news release noted the new permit requires SHA to report back about environmental restoration efforts in communities “with environmental justice concerns,” meaning they’re considered historically underserved and overburdened by pollution. The permit also allows for “expanded collaboration” with scientists and other experts to improve data collection, and includes $2.5 million in new funding to perform flood risk studies.
As much as they find shortcomings in the new permit, environmentalists acknowledge it could have been worse: A draft version of the permit released last year was severely criticized.
The previous permit required that SHA take runoff control measures on 20% of its total acreage. The 4,000 acres in the new plan represent  15% of SHA land — but that’s better than the 11% goal in last year’s draft version.
MDE officials had called the proposed restoration of 11% of impervious acreage “consistent with” Chesapeake Bay restoration goals, but said they heard the feedback and agreed to raise the target to 15%.
“As part of these discussions, … SHA indicated a desire to lead by example based on the most recent State budgetary projections: increasing the … commitment to 15% during the next permit term. Thereby, reducing more pollutants from the stormwater sector toward the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay,” reads the permit document.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Isaacson said he’s frustrated that SHA is being asked to restore less acreage than in the prior iteration of its permit. Advocates say that stormwater runoff is one of the more vexing categories of pollution endangering the effort to reduce pollution in the Chesapeake, making improvements all the more important.
Computer modeling data from the Chesapeake Bay Program shows that pollution from “developed” lands, largely stormwater, has increased since bay restoration efforts started in 1985, while other sources, including agriculture and wastewater treatment, have improved their numbers.
These stormwater permits, which are also issued for other sectors and for counties in Maryland, have been the subject of legal challenges in the past. A 2022 suit by a number of environmental nonprofits challenging Maryland’s stormwater permit for industrial facilities is still underway.
It unclear if a legal challenge is in the future for Friday’s permit.
The new permit comes at a challenging time for the multistate effort to improve the bay. After falling short of goals for 2025, the bay states have released a revised agreement, with a range of deadlines five, 10 and 15 years in the future. The Bay Program is accepting comments from the public on that plan through Sept. 1.
Isaacson said Friday’s permit is an example of how lackluster decisions by the participating states can sour the overall effort to meet the cleanup goals.
“They can say all these great things about what they’re committing to in the new bay agreement,” Isaacson said. “When they actually have to do something, they don’t make great decisions.”
A 2023 report from the Bay Program’s Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee, indicated the need for a more targeted approach to so-called “non-point” pollution — pollution, like stormwater, that doesn’t come directly from a facility’s discharge pipe. The report argued that states should cluster pollution reduction practices in areas with the greatest potential to reduce runoff into the bay.
“That status quo has been random acts of restoration,” Isaacson said. “That’s the status quo that we seek to change.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mde-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 23:56:29.533174

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to a prison in El Salvador brought widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics, was released from a rural Tennessee jail Friday, five months after being detained while driving to his Maryland home.
Abrego was to be escorted by the U.S. Marshals Service back to Maryland, where he must report to pretrial services by 10 a.m. Monday, according to court documents. He will also be under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which could choose to detain him.
While the release “brings some relief … we all know that he is far from safe,” said Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego’s attorneys, in a prepared statement Friday. “ICE detention or deportation to an unknown third country still threaten to tear his family apart.”
A Maryland court order in a separate case requires that Abrego be given 72 hours notice if the government plans to send him to a “third country.”
An order filed Friday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee noted that “should Abrego be taken into ICE custody following his return to Maryland” the government “shall ensure that, while Abrego remains in ICE custody, he has access to his attorneys, both physically and via telephone, to allow Abrego to prepare for trial in this case.”

Abrego will also be subject to electronic location monitoring and placed in the custody of his brother, the order noted.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a social media statement, called Abrego’s release a “new low,” wrongly ascribing the decision to release him to a Maryland judge.
“Activist liberal judges have attempted to obstruct our law enforcement every step of the way in removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country,” the statement said. “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.”
But praise for Abrego’s release poured in Friday from Maryland officials, including Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) who called Abrego’s release a victory of due process for all. Del. Ashanti Martinez (D-Prince George’s) called Abrego’s release “proof that due process still matters inAmerica.”
Abrego, in a prepared statement released by the immigrants’ rights group CASA, thanked those who supported him and worked for his release, and called Friday “a very special day because I have seen my family for the first time in more than 160 days.”
Abrego, as the Tennessee court refers to him, was dispatched to El Salvador after being detained March 12 by ICE officers in Maryland, where he has lived with his wife and children and works as an apprentice sheet metal worker.
A government prosecutor later conceded his deportation was an error: Abrego, who entered the country illegally as a teen, was the subject of an immigration court order barring his removal to his home country of El Salvador, where he said he feared gang violence.
After being held for months in El Salvador, despite courts all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court ordering his returne, Abrego was returned to Tennessee in June to face human smuggling charges that prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop.
Abrego was neither cited nor arrested when he was pulled over by Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with nine passengers in his vehicle. Prosecutors now allege the stop was part of a human smuggling operation in which Abrego was paid to transport immigrants illegally in the United States to points around the country.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges. His attorneys petitioned to have the human smuggling charges dismissed, calling the case baseless and little more than “vindictive prosecution.” The federal judge in his case in Tennessee has yet to rule on that motion.

Like others who have worked on the case, Van Hollen said Abrego’s releases if far from the end of the fight.
“While I have no doubt the Administration will continue its attempts to undermine Mr. Abrego Garcia’s rights, we will continue fighting to see them maintained — because due process in this case does not end with his release,” Van Hollen said in a statement. “Mr. Abrego Garcia must continue to be allowed to defend himself in court, where the Trump Administration must make its case before taking any further action against him.
“This is a matter that’s greater than just this one case or one man – if one person’s rights are denied, then the rights of all of us are at risk,” he said.

(Photo by Lisa Phu/Alaska Beacon)The politically appointed board that regulates health care in Alaska voted unanimously Friday to recommend that the state restrict medical care for transgender youth in the state and approved a letter asking Alaska lawmakers to end access to abortion in the late stages of pregnancy.
On transgender care, the board approved a draft regulation that — if made final — would declare that providing gender transition care for someone younger than 18 amounts to “unprofessional conduct” equivalent to drunkenly practicing medicine. 
Someone violating that regulation could be subject to disciplinary action. In the most extreme cases, the board has revoked medical licenses after a discipline investigation.
The draft regulation is subject to a public comment period before becoming final or being amended.
In a separate action, the board approved a statement declaring that it does not believe that abortions late in pregnancy are “ethical medical practice” and advised Alaskans to lobby the Legislature to change state law.
Currently, access to abortion in Alaska is protected by a precedent set by the Alaska Supreme Court, which has declared that medical care is covered by the personal privacy clause of the Alaska Constitution.
Both actions come amid a push by Republicans nationally to restrict abortion and gender-affirming care for children. Twenty-seven states, almost all of which are controlled by Republican politicians, have enacted laws or policies restricting gender-affirming care for children.
Abortion restrictions are more common, with only Alaska, eight other states, and the District of Columbia, having no restrictions on abortion care.
Board member Dave Wilson, a commercial pilot who sits in a public seat on the board, said before the vote that the transgender care regulation came about because of public requests.
“This was brought to us as a concern by members of the public, and we acted on that. This is not politically driven. This is not politically motivated,” he said.
Next to Wilson’s image in the board’s Zoom meeting was Dr. Matt Heilala, a podiatrist who is a member of the board and a Republican candidate for governor.
All six of the board’s current members were appointed by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The board has eight seats, but two are vacant. All six sitting members are male; four are from the Matanuska-Susitna Borough and two are from Anchorage.
Under the draft regulation, medical providers would be acting unprofessionally if they provide “medical or surgical intervention to treat gender dysphoria or facilitate gender transition by altering sex characteristics inconsistent with the biological sex at birth, including but not limited to puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, mastectomy, phalloplasty, or genital modification to a minor under the age of 18 years old.”
The term “biological sex at birth” has frequently been used by Christian conservatives who believe gender is immutable and cannot be changed once assigned by birth.
That contradicts recommendations from most medical associations in the United States, which have defined gender dysphoria as a disorder that can affect children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example, has continuously supported access to chemical and surgical procedures to treat dysphoria and allow someone to potentially seek gender-affirming surgery.
Other countries, including the United Kingdom, have taken a different approach and have restricted gender-affirming care for children.
Since the start of President Donald Trump’s second term in office, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has also changed its policy to be against gender-affirming care for youths.
“Earlier in the year, we’ve seen a lot more study that is alarming,” Heilala said during Friday’s board meeting, “policy shifts across the world, and we have strong support of the governor on this. More than half of the states have either outright banned or curtailed this care. And I think it does need to be pointed out, a regulation is an opportunity and a tool to be used at the discretion of the board.”
He said that if the regulation is enacted, disciplinary sanction isn’t “an obligation … but it is an option.”
Public testimony on Friday was uniformly against the draft regulation.
Tom Pittman is executive director of Identity Inc., which offers gender-affirming care to minors in Alaska.
Speaking to the board, he said the proposed regulation “strips parents of their ability to work with trusted doctors to make the best decisions for their child. It shrinks the already fragile provider network and endangers children’s lives.”
Dr. Lindsey Banning, a licensed psychologist and the parent of a transgender child, said that the benefits of gender-affirming care are well-established.
“It’s quite simply the standard of care for trans folks that’s accepted by all major medical organizations in this country,” she said. “Blocking access to this care has devastating consequences on the health and well being of trans kids, dramatically raising (their) rates of depression, anxiety and suicide, and yet somehow we’re here watching this politically appointed medical board brazenly ask us to ignore the research and opt to politicize the healthcare choices of Alaskans.”
The draft regulation is expected to be vetted by the Alaska Department of Law, then would be published for a 30-day public comment period.

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)House Bill 25B-1008, one of the dueling artificial intelligence bills introduced during the special session, was gutted during its House Appropriations committee hearting on Friday afternoon to become a simple extension of the controversial 2024 law’s effective date.
The bill would now push implementation of Senate Bill 24-205 until October 2026, rather than February 2026. The change was approved on an 8-3 bipartisan vote and now heads to the full House for debate.
“That’s where we are, so that we as a Legislature can come back to this issue and have a proper discussion when have time during a session. Doing this during a special session is quite difficult,” Rep. William Lindstedt, a Broomfield Democrat, said. “I’m asking that we move out the date so we can do this responsibly during the next session.”

HB25B-1008, as introduced, would have required developers and deployers disclose to consumers if they are interacting with the technology, such as in a chatbot. Violations would have gone against the Colorado Consumer Protection Act. The bill also would have added the use of AI as a liability under the state’s anti-discrimination law. But now, however, the bill simply pushes the start date back on the 2024 artificial intelligence regulation.
That would give lawmakers over a year to find a policy solution that appeases the governor, tech groups, industry players and consumer advocates.
Rep. Michael Carter, an Aurora Democrat also sponsoring the bill, said Aurora Public Schools has warned him of a $1.5 million price tag to comply with the 2024 law. Carter also sits on the Aurora school board.
“That would give those school districts that time over the summer, when they’re not dealing with graduation or curriculum or kids, to actually implement whatever (we decide),” he said.
SB24-205 put regulations on the use of AI in the decision-making process for things like employment, school admissions and loan approvals. Companies and other entities will need to let people know when AI is used in those instances and allow them to correct any incorrect information. AI developers will need to predict and mitigate potential biases and misuses of their systems. The regulatory framework was the first of its kind in the country.
Polis wanted lawmakers to use the special session to adjust that law as businesses and other entities worry about the cost and feasibility of implementation in a few months. A delayed start date would punt those negotiations until next year.
Rep. Brianna Titone, an Arvada Democrat who sponsored the 2024 law, offered her own amendment to place the start date in May 2026. That would give stakeholders the rest of the year and a regular legislative session to rework the policy and would keep the parties in good faith at the negotiating table, she said.
“I don’t believe for one minute that we need extra time for rule making because I believe that everybody wants something different at the end of the day,” she said. “The October date is just too much slack, and I feel that in negotiation, if you give someone too much slack, they leave the room, go around the corner, cut the rope and run away.”
Titone is sponsoring Senate Bill 25B-4, which would adjust the existing AI regulation to require transparency about how a system works and whether it could be discriminatory if it is used to make consequential decisions. That bill stalled on Friday, when it was supposed to go through its own appropriations committee process.
The outcome is that lawmakers will now decide between pushing back the existing 2024 law to give more time for negotiations or adopt SB25B-4’s provisions.

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Homelessness is still on the rise in Washington, but data collected by the state Department of Commerce shows that the growth rate across much of the state slowed last year. 
This comes as the state has been spending billions of dollars in recent years to expand affordable housing and help transition people out of homelessness. The Department of Commerce data is from the 2025 Point In Time Count, an annual count of people experiencing homelessness on one night in January. 
Notably, the report did not include figures for unsheltered homelessness in King County, where Seattle is located. King County completes its full Point In Time Count in even-numbered years, which is why its unsheltered data was left out. 
Historically, King County accounts for roughly 50% of the total state unsheltered results, according to the Department of Commerce. Unsheltered homelessness refers to people living on the streets or in other public places.
On Jan. 30, the state count recorded 22,173 people who were homeless in Washington. 
Of the total, 33% were experiencing unsheltered homelessness and 67% were experiencing sheltered homelessness in locations such as emergency shelters or transitional housing, according to the Department of Commerce.
The total number of people counted as homeless is a 4.4% increase from 2024 and a 25% increase overall since 2022. The year-over-year increase is roughly in line with the 4.07% rise from 2023 to 2024, but well below the 14.8% jump between 2022 and 2023. 
While the Point In Time Count is a valuable tool for comparing states on a single night every year, it is not the most reliable assessment of homelessness, according to the Department of Commerce. Results are influenced by weather, shelter bed availability, number of volunteers, different methodologies used by counties, and other factors.
For more reliable data to complement the count, the Department of Commerce assembles an annual Snapshot of Homelessness report, which combines client information from three state agency data systems to provide a comprehensive estimate of the homeless and unstably housed population in the state. 
That report also found a continued but slowed increase in homelessness in Washington over the last year. The report counted 158,791 people in emergency shelters or unhoused in January 2025, a 2.2% increase from 155,356 in January 2024 and an 8.9% increase from 145,736 in January 2022. The data includes the King County figures.
Snapshot report data shows that homelessness in Washington actually decreased slightly between 2023 and 2024, dropping from 159,525 people counted in 2023 to 155,356 in 2024, but rebounded this year. 
Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn said the latest numbers are still too high and more action is needed to reverse the trends. 
“Too many people in our communities don’t know where they’re going to sleep at night, or if they’ll be safe when they try to rest,” Nguyễn said this week in a statement.
The Legislature invested about $1.8 billion over the 2025-27 biennium into housing and homelessness, including Commerce programs such as the Housing Trust Fund, Connecting Housing to Infrastructure, and adult, family, and youth homelessness programs.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/homeless-camp-seattle-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 20:57:05.333988

(Photo by Natalie Fobes/Getty Images)Editor’s note: This is the fourth installment of a four-part series on salmon. Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River. Part Two explored salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, showing the Pacific Northwest is entering extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape. Part Three explored the good work that has restored the Grande Ronde and Imnaha river areas, more so than any other salmon landscape in the Snake River Basin.
I conclude here this four-part reflection on salmon and steelhead extinction science, and extinction’s approach and effects for rivers and people in Washington and Oregon’s Snake River tributaries. The last words go to many I interviewed, after a few more from me.

I thank everyone who talked with me: Amy Jayne, Bobby Fossek, John Milbert, Kevin March, David Baum, Noel March, Rick George, Joe McCormack, John Appleton, Henry Roller, Kyle Bratcher, Tucker Jones, Ed Bowles, Emmit Taylor, Ryan Kinzer, and Jay Hesse. I thank Hesse, Kinzer, Jones and Kasey Bliesner for data, Kinzer and Pete Sandrock for map help, and a few anonymous reviewers. I thank Pam Conley and Mike Beaty for introductions that got me started, and ongoing advice. I am responsible for any errors.
More should have been interviewed but were not. Many threads worth following – the 30-year relationship of area ranchers with river restoration, for example – were not.  Nor was I able to talk with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation or the Grande Ronde Model Watershed. Since this story can’t be told without them, I have tried to fill in roles and some details from their websites. The Grande Ronde Model Watershed website is the best single place to get a feel for northeast Oregon’s river and water restoration story-in-progress.
I believe the word “extinction” no longer penetrates, publicly or politically, as it did 40 or 20 years ago. Nor do salmon numbers – dam counts, for example – because there are too many numbers.
Yet strong public and political awareness of the fishes’ dire condition is not optional if the lower Snake River is to be restored, so that Snake salmon and steelhead get their shot to restore themselves. Results on the Klamath, Elwha, White Salmon and other rivers strongly suggest that when salmon get that chance, they grab it.
(For the scientific case to restore the lower Snake, by removing its dams, I recommend a webinar by Russ Thurow. Thurow is a U.S. Forest Service emeritus fish biologist, and main architect of comprehensive research and data sets for salmon and steelhead in Idaho’s Middle Fork Salmon River. The link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhaXzrd6wk0&t=1058s)
The extinction threshold science is good, timely and action-focused. I also see its potential to show extinction in motion to people and leaders – in mapped, named places whose human-salmon stories can be told, and perhaps more deeply heard by those in government who represent the people and places.

When the Nez Perce Tribe releases its 2025 extinction threshold update, I hope salmon people studying it ask, can we show extinction risk in motion to Northwest people and leaders, year by year?
In 2022, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, forthrightly said, “we cannot under any circumstances allow the extinction of salmon to come to pass.”
But exactly that is underway. Can its pace and locations be shown to U.S. Sens. Murray, Maria Cantwell, Ron Wyden, Jeff Merkley, Jim Risch and Mike Crapo; to Northwest members of the U.S. House; to Govs. Tina Kotek, Bob Ferguson and Brad Little; and to Northwest people?
As I researched this article, the federal administration and its agencies began a retreat from their responsibilities, to many tribes and the Northwest, to restore salmon and steelhead that federal actions are grinding to extinction.
This retreat dishonors our nation, ignores what makes the Northwest a unique place on earth, and has 3 ½ years more to run. For at least that long, Northwest people, leaders and institutions must counter federal retreat with equally visible engagement and support for salmon.
This includes continued pursuit of public and political settlements to make Columbia and Snake River salmon, tribes and salmon communities whole, while keeping other river users whole or better. It’s not an easy pursuit.
But, when our nation shirks its responsibilities, who else but Northwest people, and our state, tribal and congressional leaders, must step in to fill the vacuum, with sustained action?
What if salmon and steelhead in your rivers go extinct?
I asked some of those I spoke with a hard question: What if sea-going salmon and steelhead in the rivers you know go extinct? Others have one more point to make about the situation or remedies.

Retired attorney and fisherman Dave Baum: “I used to try a case in Enterprise, get done at 5 or 6, drive to the Imnaha, 30 miles down to Cow Creek, to fish for steelhead. In October, I’d start the hike about 9 p.m. I used a head lamp and wore high top leather boots for rattlesnakes. I’d get to Eureka Bar on the Snake at 11 p.m, throw my bag out, and start fishing at dawn. I’d fish the Snake an hour or two, then fish back up the Imnaha to Cow Creek. Walking that canyon, its vertical walls, is like being in fairyland. To me, extinction would mean no fishing for steelhead.”
Ryan Kinzer is the Nez Perce Tribe research scientist coordinating development of the extinction threshold data: “We can see that in the 1980s, the Snake River populations showed significant variability. If one population was down, others were even or up. We started losing that around 2000. Now the populations are pretty synchronous in their decline.  That’s bad. It means the species is losing its ability to refresh its parts and repair gaps. The danger rises of losing them all at once in a catastrophic event or two. This has happened in California, and can happen here.”

	Retired acupuncturist and fisherman Kevin March: “I notice the habitat changes without salmon. The Wallowa River used to host freshwater mussels. Now I never see the shells. It’s a real sign of decline. The dead steelhead and salmon aren’t in the river anymore. We still have much more habitat in the ag valleys to re-connect. And, when the Elwha and Condit dams went, the fish came back. Just let them have the chance.”

	Fisherman and writer John Milbert, when he thinks about extinction, remembers Celilo Falls, the spectacular fishery drowned by The Dalles Dam in 1957. “We lived on the coast back then, but we drove back to eastern Oregon every year. I was always awake at night, so I saw Celilo Falls, and The Dalles Dam being built as we drove. I didn’t know what it meant, but it was interesting, all the lights and equipment. Then, on one trip, it was done. Where is Celilo? Where are the fish? What do the fishing people do now? I still think about it. If we lose salmon here, it’s the same thing.”
Ascension Center Director Amy Jayne: “Teaching the reality is part of our curriculum. I think we understand how devastating salmon disappearance would be. This is their land. Salmon are sacred to our Indigenous relatives, therefore to us too.  Extinction would be devastating. We want to have hope: a child finds a mussel, the water is cold, you can see the wonder. But we also have to face reality.”
Trout Unlimited river restorer Noel March: “Extirpation in northeast Oregon would be devastating.  To lose that wild connection, the living connection between the ocean and our inland rivers, would be profoundly sad. They’ve always been there for us, for the tribes and now for us all. Not returning the favor, and allowing them to slip away, would be a sad commentary on us.”
Joe McCormack, of the Joseph Band of the Nez Perce: “It’s a terrible loss for us. Without salmon, you strip tribal people of a large part of who we are. Our sustainability as a tribe rests on the shoulders of those Nez Perce in 1855 who secured our right to fish, in our treaty. Taking salmon away is like losing an arm, a leg, a heart.”

	Emmit Taylor, Nez Perce watershed program director: “Salmon is a first food. Water is first and salmon second in the long house. In our creation story, salmon came forward and offered their lives for the people. Salmon are the leader. The fishery is food and culture for tribal people.
“Think of the abundance there was in Wallowa Country: spring and summer Chinook, steelhead, coho, sockeye, lamprey, bull trout … They didn’t just feed us, they fed eagles, bears, trees. Today the watersheds and the people only have a small fraction of what was here 150 years ago.”
Ed Bowles, former Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife chief of fisheries and salmon adviser to Oregon governors: “Snake River salmon are facing extinction, population by population. But we also have evidence, from several sources including extinction threshold science, that intrinsic productivity is still there in these salmon and steelhead. It is NOT too late.  Oregon’s view, based on our best assessment of the science, is that we have two salmon generations, eight to 10 years, to restore the lower Snake. That one action isn’t all that’s needed, but it is the necessary cornerstone for recovery, and must happen soon. This urgency is heightened given the need to secure continuity of services that the lower Snake currently provides, prior to restoration.”
Caretakers of the Land’s Bobby Fossek: “Our culture was brought upriver on the backs of the salmon. If salmon are healthy, people are healthy. Salmon stood up for human beings, and the health of the ecosystem, for thousands of years. Their decline and loss is apocalyptic to me. It has happened so fast. We are seeing the effects of living as if the health of fish and rivers are irrelevant.”
And Nez Perce elder Elmer Crow: “We are the circle. That’s what life is all about. We take care of one another. So when we have someone in trouble, that’s when the rest of us have to step in.”

Aug. 22, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Lincoln neurosurgeon and former University of Nebraska Medical Center student regent announced his 2026 candidacy Friday for an open seat on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents.
Dr. Jeremy Hosein of Lincoln, 42, served as UNMC’s student representative in 2013 after having worked as a policy adviser for former Nebraska Govs. Mike Johanns and Dave Heineman. He also interned for former U.S. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and served in the 2018-19 class of White House fellows in the Trump-era White House Office of Legislative Affairs.
During his fellowship, Hosein advised U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and worked on national policy, from drug pricing to international public health security.

Hosein, a Papillion native, said he is running because the challenges facing students today demand vision, experience and a “proactive” approach to a future “designed by disruption.” He pointed to artificial intelligence and said NU and its students could “harness its power ethically and innovate in ways that benefit society.” 
“We must ensure that every graduate who leaves our university doesn’t leave just with a degree but with the skills, resilience and creativity to thrive in this new economy,” Hosein said Friday. “Preparing our students for the future is not optional. It’s our responsibility.”
The District 1 seat Hosein is running for is held by Regent Tim Clare of Lincoln, who has opted not to seek a fourth six-year term next year. He joins the race with Lincoln entrepreneur Brent Comstock, 30, who announced his candidacy in June.
NU Board of Regents District 1 includes most of Lincoln, as well as the surrounding communities of Emerald, Malcolm, Agnew, Raymond and Davey.
Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher briefly launched a regents campaign in July before suspending that effort this week, citing family obligations and a need to focus on his current role.
Regent priorities
Hosein said his priorities if elected would include integrating AI literacy and technology adaptability into all disciplines and creating a “Name, Image and Likeness” program for academics in addition to athletics. Such programs allow student-athletes to profit from their personal brand.

Asked by a reporter what an NIL for academics would look like, Hosein said NU has to change alongside athletics. He said there are “superstars” in medicine, engineering, agriculture and more nationwide who he wants to help recruit to NU with the same “fervor” as student-athletes.
Hosein said boosters are ready and that there is energy for such an endeavor. He envisions strengthening partnerships with business and industry leaders to carry out the program.
Hosein noted NU is facing a “fiscal crisis” that he said threatens its mission. He said the best measure of university success is how well graduates address real problems facing the state and country, so NU can’t “shortchange” students.
The neurosurgeon suggested AI could help with vacant NU positions and create efficiencies.
Student regent tenure
Hosein’s previous advisory role on the NU Board of Regents, as one of four students whose votes are nonbinding, included his advocacy to successfully fight tuition and room and board increases and advocate for health insurance benefits for students.

His service also intersected with Clare, then-NU Regent Jim Pillen, who is now governor, and then-UNMC Chancellor Jeffrey Gold, who is now president of NU.
In November 2013, at an emergency meeting to confirm Dr. Gold as UNMC chancellor, five regents and one student regent attended, including Pillen and Hosein. Regents promoted Gold to NU president beginning in July 2024.
Hosein remarked that his previous service fostered a friendship with Pillen that continues to this day. He said with a laugh that Pillen, who became a regent in 2013, tried to recruit him to be a neurosurgeon for Columbus, Pillen’s home.
Similar to Comstock, Hosein praised Clare, naming him a “fierce advocate” for NU. 
‘Exceptional Nebraskan’
Heineman, former Nebraska Chief Medical Officer Dr. Joann Schaefer and former State Sen. Suzanne Geist of Lincoln were among those joining Hosein’s launch event at the Nebraska State Capitol Rotunda on Friday, along with current and former students Hosein has mentored.
Heineman said Hosein would be an advocate for students and a strong supporter of faculty, who would emphasize NU’s “excellence in education” mission and fight for more research funding.
“Dr. Jeremy Hosein is an exceptional Nebraskan and the kind of young leader that we need on the Board of Regents,” Heineman said, adding Hosein recognizes NU is an “economic engine” for Nebraska.

Schafer, the longest-serving state chief medical officer, and the first woman in the role for Nebraska, said Hosein handled and demonstrated a broad understanding of complex health care regulations and health care generally, “from the ground up,” when the two worked together in the 2000s.
“He can make the landscape of health care better for our citizens and for this state and for the future students that attend the university,” Schaefer said. 
The Lancaster County Medical Society, Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and Nancy Montanez Johner — a former U.S. undersecretary of agriculture and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services director under Johanns — also endorsed Hosein. 
If elected, Hosein would be the second student regent since 1985 to return as an elected regent, following Regent Elizabeth O’Connor of Omaha, according to NU records.
‘Safeguard cherished institutions’
The NU board is currently 6-2 majority Republican, though the vast majority of votes cast are unanimous. The 6-2 split along party lines has occurred only once in the past seven years.
Races for statewide education boards are officially nonpartisan, meaning party affiliation doesn’t appear on people’s ballots. Hosein is a registered Republican, as is Clare, while Comstock is a registered nonpartisan.

Clare ran unopposed in 2014 and 2020 and won in 2008 with 58% of the vote. New district boundaries took effect in 2021 and match those of State Board of Education District 1, which in November elected newcomer Kristin Christensen. Christensen, a Democrat, won 58% of the vote.
Hosein said what sets him apart is his vision, experiences and connections to campus, including building relationships with students and others through his public service.
“I have been entrusted with addressing complex problems in high-stakes environments,” Hosein said. “That experience has taught me how to find solutions, build consensus and safeguard cherished institutions in difficult times.”
The top two vote-getters in May 2026 will advance to the November 2026 election.

(Photo by Joshua Duong)When I told my editor, a year ago, that dozens of fish had turned up dead near the Kensington gold mine north of Juneau, he immediately wanted to know: What kind of fish?
Just one or two pink salmon had died, I told him. Most of the fish were two other species: some trout-like Dolly Varden and numerous slimy sculpin.
“No one gives a s**t about sculpin lol,” Nat, my editor, texted me. 
The point was taken. 
A dozen dead king salmon? Fishermen would be in the streets of Juneau with torches and pitchforks. 
Slimy sculpin? I’m not sure I’d heard of them. Certainly, none had ever appeared on my dinner plate. 
We covered the fish die-off anyway — after all, 100 dead fish is 100 dead fish. But Nat’s comment got me thinking about why we value some species so much more than others. How much should we care about an animal that’s only a few inches long, barely has meat on its bones and holds approximately zero commercial, recreational, or subsistence value for humans?
 
Dozens of fish died near Alaska mine; months later, regulators haven’t determined what killed them

	A few weeks later, I joined a team of scientists studying salmon in British Columbia’s Taku River watershed, which drains into the ocean near Juneau. Walking along a gravel bar on the Tulsequah River — a glacier-fed tributary of the Taku located just across the U.S. border  — one of the researchers, Chris Sergeant, started gushing about a tiny, bottom-dwelling fish that sometimes shows up in his nets.
Sculpin, I learned, are beloved by a certain set of scientists. Particularly those, like Sergeant, who study streams near mines and other industrial projects.

	The fish, it turns out, are excellent indicators of water quality. They are, in science-speak, a “sentinel species,” helping detect pollution. 
Though their fanbase hasn’t expanded into the mainstream — Swifties still far outnumber sculpinites, I’m afraid — their popularity among scientists reflects a stark turnaround. Decades ago, sculpin were (rather unfairly) blamed for salmon declines by eating eggs and juveniles.
“Sculpin,” Sergeant told me, “are just cool fish.” 
“They are underrated. They are badasses,” he said.
Freshwater sculpin are not to be confused with some much larger and better known saltwater sculpin species — like the spiky red Irish Lord, whose face only a mother could love.

	Part of the scientific allure of sculpin is that they’re ubiquitous and mysterious at the same time. 
They are among the most common freshwater fish in Alaska, yet “most people don’t notice them,” said Chelsea Clawson, a Fairbanks-based habitat biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. 
Other fish in Alaska’s rivers roam widely. But slimy sculpin — one of three freshwater sculpin species in the state — have very small home ranges, often moving less than a kilometer in either direction from where they’re born.
“So their tissue chemistry — the metals they have in them — are very representative of that site,” Sergeant said. 
That makes slimy sculpin “super important” for environmental monitoring near resource development projects, Sergeant added.
Sergeant’s work focuses on rivers in British Columbia, near the Alaska border. But state biologists sample sculpin all across the state, next to both existing mines and proposed ones. The results shed light on the effects of operations on nearby rivers, and help researchers establish baselines before new projects are built.
In some streams in the Brooks Range — close to mining prospects at the end of the proposed 210-mile Ambler Road — sculpin are pretty much the only fish sampled by Clawson, the state biologist. 
Given their abundance, sculpin “can play an integral role in the ecosystem, both as a predator and as a prey,” said Roger Tabor, a longtime Washington state-based fish biologist and sculpin fan. They eat tiny insects and fish eggs, and they’re preyed upon by larger fish and birds.

	One of the more admirable traits of slimy sculpin, one scientist told me, is that they’re the only freshwater fish in Alaska known to show parental care.
Males dig little caverns beneath rocks. Then, females release eggs in the caverns, and the males fertilize and guard the eggs until their young hatch, said J. Andrés López, a biology professor at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and curator of fishes at the Museum of the North.
By contrast, salmon die after spawning, leaving fertilized eggs unattended. Grayling simply swim off.
You also probably wouldn’t want to plop a grayling or salmon into your little fish tank. 
Sculpin, though? They make “neat pets,” López said. “They look almost like fish-tank puppies.”
López knows from experience: His students used to keep a cold-water fish tank with sculpin and other native fish. 
“If you’re anthropomorphizing fish,” he added, “sculpin seem a bit more accessible than your standard trout.” 
Nat might have been justified last year in dismissing people’s concern for sculpin. But now I am sold on the value of the humble creature — and maybe you will be, too. At least you now know what kind of pet to get Nat for his next birthday.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)On Friday afternoon Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks announced it would be closing the entirety of the Jefferson and Big Hole Rivers to fishing beginning midnight Aug. 23.
Low streamflows were to blame for the closure, which will be until further notice, FWP stated in a press release. The Jefferson River has fallen below 280 cubic feet per second and the Big Hole below 100 cfs at Wise River and 150 cfs at Melrose. Once the river falls below those thresholds, the river is closed.
“With no precipitation forecasted for either river, angling closures are a necessary step to protect the fisheries in both rivers,” said Adam Strainer, Fisheries Division Administrator for FWP.
Both rivers were part of a study non-profit groups devoted to river health released earlier this year, essentially saying four rivers in the Jefferson River Basin were in deep trouble. River temperatures were consistently high to the point where they could kill fish within hours, the study showed.
That study also looked into oxygen levels in those rivers, with the data showing dangerously low levels at night. Algae blooms, which have been a problem across the state this summer, are one likely source of low oxygen levels.
Earlier on Friday, FWP also released information about a fish kill in Blaine County at the Faber Reservoir, “caused by low dissolved oxygen levels in the pond,” and called it a natural event. There was no danger to humans or pets and fish can be harvested from that pond.
Rainbow trout were the only fish to die in that kill, FWP said, noting it would look to restock the pond.
“This is probably due to rainbow trout needing higher dissolved oxygen levels than the smaller minnow species that also reside in the reservoir,” a Cody Nagel, fisheries biologist in Havre, said in the FWP release.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_7532-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-22 19:57:35.693851

Every year, copious amounts of plastic foam boxes are used to ship Alaska seafood.
Instead of using plastics that contribute huge amounts of carbon emissions in their manufacture and huge amounts to pollution after their disposal, could Alaskans use environmentally friendly local materials to ship fish and provide other insulation?

	A team led by a University of Alaska Anchorage professor is tackling that question.
Philippe Amstislavski, a professor of public health at UAA, and his colleagues have created an insulation box from a blend of cellulose and fibers from fungi. To him, it is an appropriate invention for Alaska, where he estimates that more than 1 million plastic foam boxes are used annually to hold fish.
“Our economy is dependent on seafood. And the ability to get fish to markets is really important,” he said. But while Alaskans value sustainable fish harvests, what about sustainable fish shipments? “How do we become materially independent?” he asks.
One solution, he believes, lies in materials that exist in abundance in Alaska’s boreal forest, including the woods on and near UAA’s campus: dead trees and fungi.
The key ingredient is mycelium, the fibrous, vegetative part of fungi. Mycelium creates a strong bond when it is weaved into web-like structures. Amstislavski and his team grow mycelium in their lab in cellulose foam created from wood pulp. The resulting material that, when dried, is durable, insulating and water-repellent. The growth process takes just days.

	For cellulose, they use spruce trees that have been killed by a beetle infestation that has spread over millions of acres in Alaska, including to trees outside the door to the UAA lab building where they work.
The work addresses a global problem with special Alaska significance.
Over its lifetime, Styrofoam and similar plastic insulating foam are carbon intensive.
The product itself is generally made from fossil fuels. Its manufacture uses the energy from more fossil fuels. Though lightweight, it must be transported over long distances to reach Alaska, which also requires fossil fuels. As it ages, plastic foam can release gases known as volatile organic compounds. When it breaks down into debris, the foam crumbles into increasingly small pieces, eventually becoming tiny microplastics swirling in the ecosystem that are difficult to see and nearly impossible to corral but create a big impact.
“It’s this whole, kind of perfect cycle of carbon emissions and pollution that they’re generating every time you use it,” Amstislavski said. “So how do you break it up? How do you challenge it? How do you create alternatives?”

Plastic impacts on Alaska
For marine- and fish-dependent Alaska, where disposal or recycling options are limited, plastic pollution is a serious problem, even in remote locations.
Microplastics from distant sources have become concentrated in high latitudes, brought north by ocean and atmospheric currents.
Climate change, which is amplified in the far north, has helped concentrate microplastics in the region because debris previously locked into sea ice or glacier ice is now being released through accelerated melt.
A study by Chinese researchers published earlier this year found microplastics in every single ice sample taken from Elson Lagoon in Utqiagvik, the nation’s northernmost community, and from every sample of Chukchi Sea ice taken nearby off the coast of Point Barrow, the spit of land extending north from town. An earlier study found microplastics in every sample taken from waterways in Anchorage, Alaska’s largest city, and in other waterways in Southcentral Alaska.
Microplastics have been found in the bodies of walruses harvested by Indigenous hunters in the Bering Strait region, in fetuses of spotted seals and in Alaska fish such as pollock.

	The abundance of plastic waste that has accumulated in Alaska is striking, said Amstislavski’s research assistants.
“I was driving to Eagle River, and I was looking at the side of the highway, and there was a bunch of plastic trash laying on the side,” said Davin Louangaphay, one of the technicians. “And I was, like, ‘Wow, there’s so much out there.’ And I feel like it’s just been increasing over the years as I’ve grown up.”
Eco-friendly boxes for Alaska seafood
The fish-box project is supported by a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The UAA team has partners on the Kenai Peninsula, including the Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies and seafood companies like Kachemak Bay Shellfish Growers Co-Op and Salmon Sisters.
The seafood industry partners are enthusiastic, said Alex Ravelo, a University of Alaska Fairbanks postgraduate researcher working on the project.
“Nobody likes Styrofoam. That’s the reality. Everybody’s well aware of how bad it is for the environment,” she said.
Results from a test conducted over the past winter and spring are promising.

The plastic foam used for insulation in Alaska and elsewhere has a big carbon footprint, from its manufacture to its disposal, and it creates widespread pollution that has become embedded in the marine food web.

	Prototypes of what the team has called “MyghtyBox” were built by Amstislavski, Ravelo and Davin. The Center for Alaskan Coastal Studies put frozen salmon, halibut, shrimp and scallops into them. The filled and sealed boxes were sent from Homer to New York, Kansas and Florida. In addition, a box with live Alaska oysters was sent to Minnesota.
All but one arrived safely and sufficiently chilled, according to federal safety standards. The exception was the shipment to Florida, which was delayed for three days after it was accidentally left on the hot tarmac.
The MyghtyBox project has yet to reach any kind of commercial stage. As of early summer, the number of constructed boxes totaled only about 30, Amstislavski said. Scaling up production is a challenge yet to be cracked.
Home insulation possibilities
The fish-box project is part of a larger mycelium-cellulose vision.

	A broad goal is to use this all-natural, all-Alaska foam for home insulation, particularly in rural areas. Housing there is notoriously expensive, overcrowded and unsuitable for the environment, especially as the climate continues to change.
Building new homes in rural Alaska is especially difficult because materials must travel over long distances to be used during short summer construction seasons. If materials don’t arrive in time, construction activities can be delayed for a full year.
Mycelium-based board could be a cheaper, faster-delivered, more convenient and higher-quality building material. In partnership with Amstislavski’s team, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory is investigating the possibility.
NREL researchers, operating at their site on the edge of the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus, have been testing different blends of cellulose-mycelium insulation.
There, at the site on the Cold Climate Housing Research Center campus, a mock cabin was set up as a mobile test lab, with panels of mycelium board of varying thicknesses, along with a section of currently used plastic insulation that served as a control. Performance has been measured at each of the panels.

	The project is about more than eco-friendly building materials, said Georgina Davis, an NREL research project manager working on the experiment.
Mycelium insulation could also address a quality problem that plagues Alaska homes, and particularly those in rural areas, where homes are old and weather-beaten: mold. The materials used widely in the Lower 48 can fare poorly in Alaska’s climate, Davis said.
“If you put two inches of foam around any house in Alaska, you’re going to create prime conditions for mold,” she said. “That’s wrecking a good percentage of homes in rural Alaska.”

The result of the NREL experiment are now being analyzed.
Interest in mushrooms began in the Russian Arctic
For Amstislavski, the journey to the Alaska cellulose-mycelium project has been something of a circle covering wide geographic and cultural distances.
He grew up in Russia, where his fishery biologist father worked in the Nenets region in theEuropean Arctic. There, as a young boy, he was immersed in Indigenous Nenets culture, which includes mushroom harvesting. There, mushroom harvesting is not just a pastime, but an important subsistence activity, especially in Soviet times, when other foods were scarce.
“I was lucky enough to be in a place with people who understood the landscape and the world, in a deeper, introspective way,” he said.

	After the Iron Curtain fell, he moved with his family to Israel, where he pursued a nursing career. He became interested in architecture, which led him to move to New York. Before he completed his architecture degree, he served as a first responder tending to victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center. That experience gave him first-hand knowledge of respiratory ailments and lung-damaging chemicals. It also further stimulated his interest in environmental health and its relationship to the built environment.
Amstislavski then earned a master’s degree from the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, where one of his mentors was Tom Siccama, an expert in fungi. “He knew everything about North American mushrooms,” he said.
He then got a Ph.D. in environmental sciences from the City University of New York and taught for a while at the State University of New York before being lured to Alaska. That happened when he presented his research at a circumpolar conference in Fairbanks in 2012, which led to a job as a state public health manager, a position involving travel to rural villages. He came to UAA in 2014, a position that enabled him to study in Finland in 2021 on a Fulbright scholarship.
Amstislavski and his team members are not the only researchers looking at fungus as a solution to plastic problems.
Oyster farmers in Maine, for example, have experimented with buoys made of mycelium. British fashion designer Stella McCartney in 2021 unveiled some faux-leather products crafted from mycelium. A Seattle company is developing a variety of products, from foods to construction materials, out of mycelium.

Alaska challenges
While mycelium development proceeds elsewhere, Alaska projects have some obstacles.
The University of Alaska does not have the type of well-connected business incubators that exist at universities like Harvard, though UAF’s Center for Innovation, Commercialization, and Entrepreneurship has supported the mycelium research.
Alaska, with its remote location and high shipping costs, lacks the type of well-developed manufacturing capacity that exists in most states. Manufacturing in Alaska is dominated by seafood processing, which provides about two-thirds of the sector’s employment, according to the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development.
A new challenge comes from Trump administration decisions to axe funding for environmental research and climate change work.
The $2.5 million U.S. Department of Energy grant awarded in 2023 for the building-insulation project at NREL will not be renewed, the team recently learned.
Funding for NOAA has been drastically cut, though impacts to its marine debris programs and services are yet to be determined.
The Trump administration has resisted attempts to curb plastic pollution, most recently putting up roadblocks that led to the collapse of negotiations on an international plastics treaty.
Amstislavski hopes that entities beyond the federal government, including the private sector, will step in to support mycelium product development.
Aside from its environmental benefits, mycelium could help build Alaska’s workforce, a subject of concern for state officials, he said.
“It’s an opportunity for interesting jobs that are meaningful to people that have positive impacts in the world,” he said.

(Kyle Pfannenstiel/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho has significantly reformed its public defense system since 2022. Now, the state Supreme Court will weigh whether the changes are enough to show the state is meeting its constitutional obligation to provide adequate representation or if it’s too soon to decide. 
Attorneys representing indigent defendants — those who are charged with a crime who cannot pay for their own legal representation — argued on Friday before the state’s high court in Boise that despite an entirely different system, the state still isn’t meeting its constitutional requirement.

The state’s system is being challenged by attorneys for the ACLU of Idaho and the law firm Hogan Lovells, who on Friday asked the Idaho Supreme Court to reverse a February District Court dismissal of the case, named Tucker v. Carlson. 
“We have never asked for a particular model of public defense; what we have asked for is that the state implement public defense in a way that passes constitutional muster,” Hogan Lovells Attorney Joe Cavanaugh told the justices.
The state argued that the reforms — which consolidated a fractured, county-based system for public defense into a state-funded Office of the Public Defender — are exactly what the courts and plaintiffs had been asking for in the case when it was filed a decade ago. 
“The new state system has addressed the issues that have been raised in this lawsuit. It’s really that simple,” said Joe Aldridge, an attorney from Scanlan Griffiths + Aldridge who argued on behalf of the state. 
 Idaho has overhauled its public defense system. The ACLU says it’s not enough. 

The ACLU of Idaho, in its December appeal to the state’s highest court, argued that the state reforms may have made the situation worse because it was followed by a mass resignation of public defenders across the state, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
‘Headed for a disaster:’ ACLU asks Idaho Supreme Court to order public defense system reform

As of Friday, the Office of the State Public Defender had 21 public defender openings, which included vacancies and new positions created by 2025 legislation to open four new offices in Jerome, Shoshone, Benewah and Elmore counties, Office of the Public Defender spokesperson Patrick Orr told the Sun. 
The changes made thus far were spurred by the original filing of the case in 2015, contending Idaho’s system was inadequate to guarantee people’s right to counsel under the Constitution’s Sixth Amendment. 
In 2022, the Legislature passed House Bill 735 so the state would fund all public defense rather than the counties. In 2023, the Legislature passed House Bill 236 to replace the Public Defense Commission with a new state agency, the Office of the Public Defender. 
The new public defender office fully transitioned into the new system in October 2024. 
Cavanaugh argued Friday in court that the reforms haven’t changed the “deficiencies on the ground” regarding low-income people’s access to adequate defense. He said that legislative reforms don’t relieve the courts of enforcing the Constitution.
“The Legislature’s had their shot, and has proven to have failed at that shot,” he said. “These issues are occurring right in the judiciary’s backyard.” 
The lawsuit is asking the court to declare the state of Idaho’s public defense system unconstitutional and to place an injunction on the state, requiring it to create a plan to fix the alleged deficiencies to bring the system into compliance with the constitution. The plaintiffs also ask the court to review and approve the plan and appoint an independent monitor to implement the plan.

Multiple justices questioned Cavanaugh about how the court could use the data included in the December 2024 filing regarding the alleged deficiencies in the state’s system, to determine how adequate it is now. 
“It just feels like the ground has changed so much that you would almost be forced to start over,” Justice Gregory Moeller said.

The lawsuit filed in December includes written testimony from attorneys and defendants who describe situations such as defendants arriving in court multiple times without an attorney present, despite multiple attempts to contact the state public defense office, the Sun reported. 
Cavanaugh argued that the data supplied looked at the issue on a statewide basis and wasn’t tied to any particular system. 
Aldridge, on behalf of the state, said it was too soon to make a determination that the new system was adequate, but that it met its obligation by putting in place a system “that was designed to promote constitutionally adequate indigent defense.” 
Moeller asked Aldridge if the state could show that the new system has made significant improvements. 
“At this state in time, nobody can say whether or not the new state system suffers from widespread, persistent structural defects … it’s simply too soon to make that determination,” he said. 
Aldridge said that it would take “probably a few years” before enough cases went through the new system to be able to determine if it was accurate, but that the new funding and oversight structure was designed to be the “state-of-the-art, gold standard.”

(Courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)As the days tick down to Ralph Menzies’ execution, anti-death penalty advocates said Friday that a firing squad leaves open the possibility for human error and potential suffering.
Menzies is scheduled to die on Sept. 5 for kidnapping and murdering Maurine Hunsaker in 1986 — he is still awaiting a ruling from the Utah Supreme Court, which is considering whether his dementia warrants a pause in execution proceedings for a new competency evaluation. 
If the execution does happen, it would be the fourth firing squad the U.S. has seen in 15 years, and just the sixth since executions resumed in 1977. 
Most of those have occurred in Utah, one of just two states to use the method since 1977. In fact, Utah became the first state to resume executions with the firing squad death of Gary Gilmore, who murdered two Brigham Young University students in 1976. 
With execution just weeks away, Menzies’ attorneys appeal to the Utah Supreme Court

Utah’s last firing squad execution killed Ronnie Lee Gardner, who was already facing a murder charge in 1985 when he was handed a gun in the Salt Lake City courthouse and fatally shot Michael Burdell, an attorney. 
In Utah, the firing squad is a five-person team of POST certified peace officers — they will fire a .30 caliber weapon from 21 feet, aiming at a target that’s placed over the inmate’s heart. One randomly chosen member will shoot a rifle with blank rounds, though none of the five officers will know who actually has the dud. 
Dr. Jonathan Groner, a retired surgeon and an expert on death penalty methods who examined autopsy pictures of Gardner, said the images raise questions regarding the efficacy of a firing squad. 
“We don’t have precise anatomic landmarks, but it’s clear the two lower bullets are way outside where the heart would be. So that’s a little bit unusual,” he said on Friday, showing pictures of the exit wounds on Gardner’s back. “It’s hard to tell where they went through, but I was surprised by seeing these exit wounds in these locations.” 
After examining pictures of the entry wounds, Groner said it’s “concerning that some of these bullets may not have gone to where the heart is.” 
“In theory, the firing squad execution shouldn’t be botchable, right? The people firing the guns are trained to fire guns, they’re 15 to 20 feet away, and they practice. So why some people seem to get it done right and some don’t, is an interesting thing,” Groner said.

This past year, South Carolina carried out the firing squad executions of Brad Keith Sigmon and Mikal Deen Mahdi, making the Palmetto State the only other state to use the method. Groner researched the executions “extensively” and believes there is a troubling difference between the two executions.
“You can look at the bullet wounds and they are very, very different,” Groner said, particularly for Mahdi, who was sentenced to death for murdering an off-duty police officer. 
“It is quite clear that he did not die quickly. I think every witness saw movement for a number of seconds,” Groner said. “So it seems possible that there is some sort of implicit bias in the execution process.” 
Randy Gardner, Ronnie Lee’s brother, has become a vocal opponent of the death penalty in the years since his brother’s execution, particularly the firing squad. Gardner said he doesn’t like calling himself a victim — instead, he prefers the term “collateral damage.” 
“I don’t condone what these criminals did, or what my brother did, and I don’t condone the state of Utah doing the same thing that he did,” said Gardner, calling the firing squad “vulgar and repulsive.” 
“The collateral damage that’s happened in the past is way beyond the initial execution,” he said. “It’s a failed policy … There is no humane way to execute a person, I’m absolutely against all forms of execution.” 
Another anti-death penalty advocate who spoke to reporters on Friday was Jennifer Herron, the oldest daughter of Maurine Hunsaker who was adopted and never actually met her mother. 
Herron said while Menzies has taken a lot from her, she still opposes his execution. 
“I don’t think it’s fair, and it doesn’t get us anywhere. It wasn’t that right for him to kill. Why should it be right for us to kill?” she said. “If we do execute him, we’re not allowing our society to rise above. We’re better than that.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 23:07:41+00:00,CT Mirror,Prison official offers to release part of video of J’Allen Jones’ death,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/ct-prison-death-jallen-jones-video/,An attorney for J'Allen Jones' family argued that removing any part of the video would leave out critical information about the day he died.,"An official from the Department of Correction testified in Hartford Superior Court on Friday that he would be willing to make public a portion of a video showing the death of J’Allen Jones at Garner Correctional Institution in 2018, as long as certain conditions were followed about how the video could be viewed.  
But Attorney Ron Murphy, who represented Jones’ family, argued that removing any part of the video would not do justice to Jones’ memory and would leave out critical information about Jones’ conduct the day he died. 
Jones died after being pepper sprayed, restrained, struck and forcibly moved by as many as 10 corrections workers. In August 2018, Jones’ mother and girlfriend filed a lawsuit against the Department of Correction. The family has been petitioning the courts for the release of the video, along with the ACLU and the Connecticut Examiner. 
At the Friday hearing, Jessica Jones, J’Allen Jones’ mother, pleaded with the judge to release the video.
“I want the world to see what happened to my child. He did not deserve this,” she said. 
She said she needed to see how he died.
“I am a grieving mother. My heart aches every day.” 
Superior Court Judge Claudia Baio did not rule on the motion Friday and said attorneys should file briefs on their arguments by October.
In 2019, both the state and Jones’ family members agreed to have the video sealed under a protective order. In 2020, the family members asked to overturn the protective order and allow the video to be viewed by the public. In their argument, they said that the state had required them to agree to a protective order if they wanted the video released. They said the state had cited “safety and security” concerns. 
“After viewing the video, and similar videos widely available on the internet, Plaintiffs are convinced that no such security issues exist,” the motion reads. 
The state’s assistant attorney generals argued in response that releasing the video “would severely impair the safety and security of DOC correctional facilities” and that the only reason the family wanted the video released was in order to “make extrajudicial, public statements about this pending case, which will certainly poison the jury pool and effect the Defendants’ right to a fair trial.”
Both the ACLU and the Connecticut Examiner have motioned to intervene in the lawsuit to release the video. A trial judge denied the ACLU’s motion, which they are appealing. The Examiner filed its motion earlier this month.

Last year, CT Insider reviewed a 350-page report by an investigator at the Department of Correction, which included still photos from the video, and described the events it showed.
Excerpts from the January 2019 report reviewed by CT Mirror indicate that the 31-year-old Jones was being transferred within Garner, in Newtown, for monitoring when correction officers told Jones that he needed to submit to a strip search. He resisted, “chanting, yelling and shouting incoherently.” Staff physically forced him onto a bed and removed his clothes. One of the officers gave him several knee strikes to the thigh, according to the report. 
A lieutenant sprayed Jones twice with pepper spray, and the officers put him into restraints. They covered his head with a “universal precaution safety veil” to prevent him from spitting on the correction officers. They also administered a combination of benadryl, the anti-anxiety drug Ativan and Haldol, an antipsychotic, the report states.
At that point, Jones became “less resistive,” and the staff moved him to a cell. A nurse found him unresponsive, and he was transferred by ambulance to Danbury Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. 
The investigator concluded that the staff’s use of force was not “excessive.” He noted that Lt. Gary Gray had tried to limit the use of force by other correction officers, stopping officers from holding Jones by the neck or putting their knees on his back, and explaining to Jones that the officers were “trying to control your actions so that you don’t hurt yourself.” 
Gray told investigators that he’d called for Jones’ head to be covered with the safety veil as a “precautionary measure” to protect staff from being spit on and that he’d had “no idea” that Jones was asthmatic when the chemical spray was used. 
But the investigator did say the officers had violated the department’s policy on use of force by failing to recognize when Jones stopped resisting and could not stand on his own. According to the report, it took 7 minutes and 16 seconds before the staff realized that something was wrong and began trying to revive Jones with CPR. 
In a motion for public access to the video filed in October 2024, the video is described as showing four correction officers, all weighing over 225 pounds, holding Jones down while Jones was “hog-tied and wearing the safety veil soaked in pepper spray.” The motion claims that the sound of Jones’ coughing from the pepper spray, and the change in his breathing — which turns “from labored to wheezing to agonal” — is audible in the video. And it notes the delay in the officer’s starting CPR.
“During those 7 minutes, the video shows J’Allen’s unconscious limp body flopping around while the COs moved him from the cell contaminated by the pepper spray to an uncontaminated cell,” the motion read. Attorneys for the state argued that the plaintiffs had not given any good reason why the order should be vacated. 
Court arguments
On Friday, William Mulligan, the deputy commissioner of operations and rehabilitative services for the Department of Corrections, divided the video into three separate phases: transferring Jones from his cell to the inpatient medical area, his time within the inpatient medical area, and transporting him from the inpatient medical area out to emergency medical services and an ambulance. 
Mulligan said the parts of the video where Jones was being transported throughout the facility showed door numbers and the locations of cameras and metal detectors. He said audio transmissions made by staff could also be heard. Knowing the locations of these things, Mulligan said, could make it possible for an inmate to figure out a way to escape from the facility. 
“Our overarching responsibility is public safety, and escape is our No. 1 concern,” Mulligan said. 
He said he was also concerned that incarcerated individuals could discover the identities of the staff involved in the incident, which could create negative encounters between those staff members and the incarcerated. 
Mulligan said he felt a “reasonable solution” would be to make the “second phase” of the video — the events in the inpatient medical area, the place where Jones was strip-searched, pinned down, pepper sprayed, struck and forcibly moved by corrections officers — available for members of the public to view but not distributed widely on the internet. Having the video readily available, he said, would make it possible for people to view the video repeatedly, note the location of things like cameras and metal detectors and get the information to incarcerated people. 
But Murphy pushed back, calling Mulligan’s fears “imagined.” While Mulligan said he was concerned someone outside the facility could view the video and give information to incarcerated people about the locations of cameras or metal detectors, Murphy questioned how, with the precautions required by the Department of Correction — opening and inspecting mail and monitoring phone calls and emails — the information could get in without being caught. He said it was unlikely that even with that information an inmate would be able to escape, given the security in the facility. 
Mulligan said they were only able to inspect a small percentage of the communications that incarcerated people received and that contraband does arrive into the facilities. 
Murphy said that removing the “first phase” of the video from the public would prevent people from seeing that Jones was “100% calm” as he walked from his housing unit to the inpatient medical area, countering the narrative from the Department of Correction that Jones had been “resisting.” 
He also said that leaving out the “third phase” of the video, which showed Jones being transported, unconscious, to emergency medical services and an ambulance, would prevent the public from seeing “the consequences of how J’Allen [Jones] was treated” when he was in the inpatient medical area. 
Murphy also questioned whether it would be possible for things like room numbers to be redacted from the video. 
Other members of the public who testified said they saw the release of the video as key for bringing accountability to the Department of Correction and the potential catalyst for policy changes within the prisons. 
Attorney Alex Taubes, who is representing the Connecticut Examiner, said the video was being used to protect the Department of Correction from having to face accountability for what happened. He argued that other videos have been released in the past and that releasing this video would not cause harm to anyone involved. 
Attorney Dan Barrett of the ACLU questioned how the video would reveal anything more than what had already been demonstrated in 800 pages of information and photographs that the department had already produced. He said the department would have a hard time proving that the need to conceal the video overrode the public interest. 
Several people referred to the release, in December 2024, of a video in the Marcy Correctional Facility in New York that showed corrections officers physically assaulting inmate Robert Brooks, who died the following day. Correction Ombuds DeVaughn Ward argued that there was an especially strong public interest in viewing the video of Jones’ death because at least one of the officers involved is still employed by the Department of Correction. 
Kevnesha Boyd, a mental health therapist who worked for six years in the Department of Correction, said the case reminded her of that of Carl “Robbie” Talbot, who died after being restrained, piled on by officers and pepper sprayed in New Haven Correctional Center in 2019. In February, the state of Connecticut settled the case for $3.75 million.

Mulvaney-Stanak, the Burlington mayor, called on the state for help with “complex and overlapping public health crises,” while one of Scott’s chief deputies said that “the city has made their bed.”

Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak called on Gov. Phil Scott this week to do more to help the state’s largest city respond to homelessness and curb public drug use. But Scott and his administration argued the city needs to be the one to step up first.
The back-and-forth across different forums underscored how some state and local leaders have been at odds over each other’s role in addressing persistent social and economic challenges that, while not unique to Burlington, have nevertheless subjected the city to statewide scrutiny.
“The city has made their bed, and they are going to have to ask for specifics to help turn the corner,” Jennifer Morrison, Scott’s commissioner of public safety, whose job includes overseeing the Vermont State Police, said at a press conference Wednesday.
At one point, the commissioner — who was Burlington’s interim police chief in 2020, when protests prompted city councilors to cut the size of the police force by attrition — characterized visiting the city right now as a “terrifying” experience, though did not explicitly say why she thought that. She had interjected during an exchange between Scott and a reporter from WCAX News.
“The problems in Burlington did not occur overnight. They will not be fixed overnight,” Morrison said. “And it requires that everybody commit to principles of accountability — shifting the pendulum back to the middle so that the use of public spaces is just as important for law-abiding people and businesses to thrive as it is for service-resistant people who make others afraid or commit crimes.”

The WCAX reporter had asked Scott, a Republican, what his administration was doing that could help Burlington address concerns raised at a Tuesday meeting the mayor’s office held with local business owners. According to WCAX, a number of attendees told Mulvaney-Stanak, a Progressive, that drug use and dealing in downtown was hurting their businesses.
Joe Magee, a spokesperson for Mulvaney-Stanak’s office, said the mayor’s response in that virtual meeting echoed what she wrote in an op-ed published in VTDigger last week. 
In that opinion piece, the mayor said Vermont municipalities “do not have the staff or resources to adequately respond” to what she called a combination of homelessness, substance use disorders and mental health crises. She said the governor’s decision to allow a sweeping round of evictions from state-sponsored motel rooms to proceed on July 1 — a move that specifically impacted families with children and people with acute medical needs — put more pressure on social services in and around Burlington.
In a statement to VTDigger Thursday, Mulvaney-Stanak also said she took issue with the governor’s and his administration’s comments at the press conference a day prior. 
“I continue to hope for stronger collaboration with the Governor and his team, and I was disappointed that they decided to take an adversarial tone in communicating to Burlington through the media,” the mayor said.
Scott said at the Wednesday briefing that he was not sure what additional help his administration would be willing to provide the city unless local leaders took steps to boost enforcement of existing laws, including cracking down on public drug use, he said. 
The governor acknowledged Burlington businesses were facing numerous challenges including a well-documented decline in Canadian tourism spurred by blowback from President Donald Trump’s sweeping trade war. But regardless of that and other factors, Scott said, it was wrong for the mayor to suggest his administration is not doing enough to help.

“I think it’s easy to blame others when some of your strategies are failing,” he said. 
Some Burlington leaders have called for the city to bolster local law enforcement, too. On Thursday, City Council President Ben Traverse, a Democrat representing Ward 5, wrote an open letter calling for a police presence “during all open hours” in downtown’s City Hall Park, which has become a hot spot for drug use and dealing. 
Traverse also called for the park to be cleared overnight — when it is closed — of people sleeping. That’s not allowed under city ordinances, though in reality, many people regularly use the park for overnight shelter.
Traverse wrote that his letter — which was sent by the city’s Democratic Party — was in part a response to recent news that a man died after being assaulted and injured near the park.
“I call on my friends in the Progressive Party, and all political persuasions, to join me in collectively building a more resilient Burlington by focusing on the issues voters elected us to tackle,” Traverse said in the letter, which was first reported by Seven Days. 
Traverse, who represents the city’s South End on the council, said in the letter he planned to discuss his requests at the upcoming council meeting on Monday.
In a separate email to Burlington residents Thursday, Mulvaney-Stanak emphasized that the city could not address what she called “complex and overlapping public health crises” on its own. The Progressive mayor urged her constituents to use a contact form on Gov. Scott’s website to make a plea for greater state support. 
“I am urging Vermonters to contact Governor Scott to tell him that municipalities and many of our local businesses are at a breaking point,” the mayor wrote, “and that it should be a State priority to develop a coordinated response to our collective public health, housing, and mental health crises.”

Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center shows turnover among election workers reached a new high in 2024. (Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on Aug. 22, 2025.
A botched robbery led to the shooting early Thursday morning that left a Canaan man dead and his girlfriend injured, according to police affidavits filed in court on Friday.
Witnesses told police that David Labrecque, 65, was shot and killed outside a home on Verna Court when he charged the gunman who had already shot his girlfriend, Jessica Lemay, 36, also of Canaan, according to the affidavits.
Labrecque was pronounced dead at the scence just after 4 a.m. on Thursday morning. Lemay, who was shot in the abdomen and the hand, was transported to Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, where she was able to tell investigators what happened.
The alleged gunman, Demtrius Drew, 30, of New Haven, Conn., and his two alleged accomplices, Jeffrey Mullins, 46, and Michelle Mullins, 48, were arrested later Thursday while attempting to leave a residence in a mobile home park off Sykes Mountain Avenue.
Drew entered a not guilty plea on charges of first-degree murder, second-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted assault and robbery with a weapon at his arraignment Friday afternoon at Windsor County Superior Court in Woodstock.
Jeffrey and Michelle Mullins, who the affidavit said until recently lived in Enfield, each pleaded not guilty on charges of aiding in the commission of first-degree murder and accessory to attempted assault and robbery.
According to police, Drew and the Mullinses, who had known each other for just weeks, concocted a plan to rob the home at 34 Verna Court, which they believed contained a significant amount of cash, and split the proceeds.
Around 2:30 Thursday morning, Jeffrey Mullins showed Drew the a path through the woods to reach 34 Verna Court from a motel on Route 4, according to the affidavit.
About an hour later, Jeffrey Mullins dropped Michelle Mullins off at 34 Verna Court with $500 in counterfeit bills with a plan to buy drugs, according to the affidavit.In an interview after her arrest, Michelle Mullins told police she was outside the house at 34 Verna Court speaking with Labrecque and Lemay when the shooting started, according to the affidavits.
In an interview at DHMC, Lemay told police that the gunman, identified by police as Drew, shot her in the stomach after emerging from behind a tent erected on the property.
Lemay told police Labrecque attempted to come to her aid but was stopped short when he was shot twice and killed, according to the affidavit. She tried to wrestle with the gunman afterward, but he pistol whipped her and shot her again, this time in the hand, she told police.
Michelle Mullins, who fled the scene after the gunfire, gave a similar account of the shootings, according to the affidavits.
The gunman also fled the scene, according to the affidavit. An occupant in the home called 911.
With information provided by witnesses, investigators were able to trace Drew and the Mullinses and their distinctive blue Dodge Charger to the mobile home at 77 Spring Circle, where police believed Drew had been staying.
Using security camera footage from nearby buildings and police surveillance, authorities were able to confirm that Drew and the Mullinses were inside the mobile home.
All three were arrested without incident later on Thursday outside 77 Spring Circle while preparing to depart in the Charger, according to affidavits.
Witnesses and security footage also placed the Charger at the hotel at the time of the shooting, according to the affidavits.
Judge Dickson Corbett ruled in Windsor County Superior Court Friday that there was sufficient evidence and threat to the public to detain the three defendants. Drew and the Mullinses appeared remotely from jail via video conference at Friday’s arraignment.
All three were ordered held without bail pending a full evidentiary hearing. Corbett also upheld conditions that the trio have no contact with each other or with others involved in the incident including Lemay, the property owner at 34 Verna Court and the individual who called 911.
During the arraignment, Windsor County State’s Attorney Ward Goodenough represented the state.

A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

Free.,Pentagon approves National Guard to carry weapons in D.C. as federal takeover extends,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pentagon-approves-national-guard-carry-weapons-dc-federal-takeover-extends,,"WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized the thousands of National Guard troops deployed to the District of Columbia to carry their weapons as they patrol the city, the Pentagon said Friday.Meanwhile, President Donald Trump said he is considering declaring a “national emergency” to keep troops in the nation’s capital for longer than the 30 days allowed under the law, and also said he’s eyeing the Democratic-led cities of Chicago, New York and San Francisco for additional military deployments.Carrying weapons would be a significant escalation in the show of force for the troops in the district.“At the direction of the Secretary of Defense, (Guard) members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our Nation’s capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,” a Defense Department official said in a statement to States Newsroom.The final decision will be made by Brig. Gen. Leland Blanchard II, who is the interim commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, and any coordination will occur with D.C. Metropolitan Police and federal law enforcement, the Defense Department official said.There are 800 D.C. National Guard members now in the district, joined by more than 1,260 members from six GOP states called to assist Trump’s federal takeover of the 62 square miles of the district that is home to 700,000 residents.National Guard members from the Republican-led states of Louisiana, Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia began arriving in the district this week.It’s unclear if the 2,060 National Guard members will carry their “service-issued weapons” while on duty or leave them in military vehicles.The change comes days before students in the district return to school.The Pentagon did not respond to States Newsroom's question on what type of weapons the National Guard members would be carrying, such as rifles or hand guns.Typically a standard-issue weapon for most of the U.S. military is a M4 assault rifle, which is a variant of the AR-15.More cities for military forceThe president told reporters Friday in the Oval Office that Chicago, New York and San Francisco could be next for military deployment, similar to the federal takeover of the district.“After we do this, we'll go to another location and we'll make it safe also,” Trump said. “Chicago is a mess…And we'll straighten that one out probably next. That’ll be our next one after this.”Because the district is not a state, the president has the sole authority over its National Guard members.State governors have control over their National Guard members, but the president earlier this summer federalized California’s National Guard to respond to immigration protests — a test case for use of the state-based military forces. The Guard has since left Los Angeles.Trump declared a “crime emergency” in the district on Aug. 11, even though violent crime in the district is at a 30-year low.The president also invoked the district's Home Rule Act in order to use the Metropolitan Police Department’s 3,400-member police force for immigration enforcement.National Guard troops have been sent to patrol Metro stations, the tourist-heavy National Mall and near federal buildings across the district.“The D.C. National Guard remains committed to safeguarding the District of Columbia and serving those who live, work, and visit the District,” the Department of Defense official said.Potential Trump declaration of ‘national emergency’It’s unclear how long the National Guard will remain in the district and the president Friday said he is considering declaring a “national emergency” to keep troops in the nation’s capital.Troops are currently staying in local hotels around the district, according to a Joint Task Force-District of Columbia spokesperson.“If I have a national emergency, I can keep the troops there as long as I want,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.Earlier Friday, Trump had said he was unsure of how long he would keep National Guard members in the district.“The big question is how long do we stay? Because we want to make sure it doesn't come back,” Trump said at another back-and-forth with reporters. “So we have to take care of these criminals and get them out.""On Thursday, Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in a district neighborhood known as Anacostia, where he addressed local and federal law enforcement officials as well as National Guard members.“You're incredible people,” Trump said. “You make the country run.”He thanked them for their service and had White House officials hand out hamburgers he said were cooked at the White House and pizza from a local restaurant.Louisiana Illuminator Reporter Wes Muller contributed to this story.",,,,2025-08-22 18:57:04.753672

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)The Joint Committee on Legislative Organization voted by paper ballot along party lines Friday afternoon to direct the Legislative Reference Bureau not to publish any rule that hasn’t gone through a review by the Legislature in accordance with Wisconsin law.
Republican lawmakers on the committee proposed a vote on the motion Thursday after Gov. Tony Evers told agencies to skip lawmakers in the final steps of the rulemaking process. There are 27 administrative rules, including one to address the state’s policy on gray wolf management, that Evers submitted to the LRB for publication. Of those, 13 have not been reviewed by a standing legislative committee and are yet to be published. 
It’s the latest step the administration has taken in testing the bounds of the recent Evers v. Marklein II ruling by the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The majority found in the case that the state laws giving the Joint Committee for Review of Administrative Rules broad powers to block administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
The statutes cited in the Republicans’ motion Thursday were not included in the Court’s ruling.
“We are following the law and maintaining the fundamental checks and balances of lawmaking,” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Irma) said in a joint statement about the motion on Thursday. “The governor is flagrantly disregarding the rule of law and egregiously abusing the power of his office.”
Evers’ spokesperson Britt Cudaback said Republicans were defying the law in an email Thursday. 
“Republicans are reaching new levels of lawlessness, whether it’s President Trump trying to take over Washington DC, Republicans in Texas trying to rig maps and elections in their favor, or Republicans in Wisconsin who appear poised to disobey decisions made by our state’s highest court,” Cudaback wrote in an email message. “Republicans are not above the law — they should follow the law like everyone else is expected to.”
The measure passed 6-4. Republicans on the committee, including Vos, Felzkowski, Senate Majority Leader Devin LeMahieu (R-Oostburg), Sen. Dan Feyen (R-Fond du Lac), Rep. Tyler August (R-Walworth) and Rep. Scott Krug (R-Rome), voted for the motion. Democrats on the committee, including Assembly Minority Leader Greta Neubauer (D-Racine) and Senate Minority Leader Dianne Hesselbein (D-Middleton), voted against it.

On July 9, the Iowa Capital Dispatch asked the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing for a copy of a private accreditation agency’s inspection report for the home health agency Compassion North America.
Compassion came under scrutiny earlier this year after the Iowa Board of Nursing presented evidence of falsified records, billing for services that were never delivered, and the employment of an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.

In response to the Capital Dispatch’s request for the documents, DIAL spokesperson Diane McCool said DIAL “does not receive” such records.
After the Capital Dispatch reported DIAL’s claim that it didn’t have the requested records, the Accreditation Commission for Health Care contacted the news organization and said that it had, in fact, provided DIAL with a copy of the documents via email on Sept. 16, 2024.
The Capital Dispatch asked DIAL again for the records. DIAL then acknowledged it had the documents but refused to release them, stating that it is not the “official” custodian of such documents.
Asked why the agency initially denied having the records, McCool said Thursday that “since the accrediting organizations are not required to send the survey reports to DIAL, the department didn’t expect that it would have the report.”
Her response didn’t indicate whether, after receiving the Capital Dispatch’s request for records, anyone at DIAL actually looked for the records or made any internal inquiries as to whether someone at DIAL might have them.
Because DIAL has never conducted its own inspection of Compassion North America, and because it won’t release its copy of the accrediting commission’s findings, there is no public record of any regulatory oversight of the home health provider, which was first incorporated in June 2017.
McCool has said DIAL is not investigating Compassion North America, despite the findings of the Board of Nursing and its investigator that the company appeared to have falsified records, billed for services that were never delivered, and employed an unlicensed nurse to provide patient care.
Those allegations surfaced at a disciplinary hearing for registered nurse M’balu Madlene Kebbie, who is married to Compassion North America’s CEO, Joseph Lemor.
A state investigator who reviewed the work schedules of Compassion employees as part of a board investigation allegedly found that the license of one of the company’s nurses had expired in January 2021 but she had continued to provide patient care in June and July 2022.
In addition, a comparison of Compassion’s billing records with the staff work schedule allegedly showed the company had submitted payment claims for services for which there was no corresponding documentation to indicate the care was provided. There were also payment claims for services provided by a registered nurse that exceeded 24 hours in a single day, the state investigator testified.
According to the board, Kebbie had no explanation for the irregularities in the nursing documentation — including instances where it appeared Compassion had billed Medicaid twice for some services.
Citing what it called Kebbie’s “lack of previous disciplinary history,” the board ruled that she could retain her Iowa nursing license subject to two years of probation. However, the board’s own records indicate that in 2012, it disciplined Kebbie for working as a nurse while her license was inactive.
Kebbie’s attorney has filed an appeal of the board’s recent decision in Polk County District Court, arguing the sanctions against her are “unreasonable, arbitrary, and excessive.” The state has denied any wrongdoing in the matter.
Lemor has said the state is engaged in a “witch hunt” with regard to Kebbie.  “We did not do anything improper,” he told the Iowa Capital Dispatch last month. “We have nothing to hide.”

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to a prison in El Salvador brought widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics, was released from a rural Tennessee jail on Friday, five months after being detained while driving to his Maryland home.
Abrego will be escorted by the U.S. Marshals Service back Maryland, where he must report to pretrial services by 10 a.m. Monday. He will also be under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which could choose to detain him. A Maryland court order in a separate case requires he be given 72 hours notice if the government plans to send him to a “third country.”
An order filed Friday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee noted that “should Abrego be taken into ICE custody following his return to Maryland” the government “shall ensure that, while Abrego remains in ICE custody, he has access to his attorneys, both physically and via telephone, to allow Abrego to prepare for trial in this case.”
Abrego will also be subject to electronic location monitoring and placed in the custody of his brother, the order noted.
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in a social media statement, called Abrego’s release a “new low,” wrongly ascribing the decision to release him to a Maryland judge.
“Activist liberal judges have attempted to obstruct our law enforcement every step of the way in removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country,” the statement said. “We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country.”
Abrego, as the Tennessee court refers to him, was dispatched to El Salvador after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Maryland, where he has lived with his wife and children and works as an apprentice sheet metal worker. A government prosecutor later conceded his deportation was an error. Abrego, who entered the country illegally as a teen, was the subject of an immigration court order barring his removal to his home country of El Salvador, where he said he feared gang violence.

He was returned to Tennessee in June to face human smuggling charges that prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. Abrego was neither cited nor arrested when he was pulled over by Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with nine passengers in his vehicle. Prosecutors now allege the stop was part of a human smuggling operation in which Abrego was paid to transport immigrants illegally in the United States to points around the country.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement that Abrego’s release shows the “legal system has worked its will and is upholding Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s right to due process.”
“While I have no doubt the Administration will continue its attempts to undermine Mr. Abrego Garcia’s rights, we will continue fighting to see them maintained — because due process in this case does not end with his release. Mr. Abrego Garcia must continue to be allowed to defend himself in court, where the Trump Administration must make its case before taking any further action against him.
“This is a matter that’s greater than just this one case or one man – if one person’s rights are denied, then the rights of all of us are at risk.”

Brereton Jones. (Cabinet for Health and Family Services)Masten Childers II, Kentucky’s hard-charging and sometimes controversial secretary of the state Cabinet for Health and Family Services under former Gov. Brereton Jones, has died. He was 75.
Friends said Childers, who had been diagnosed several years ago with Parkinson’s disease, died Thursday in Lexington following a decline in health.
“He was the perfect secretary of human services,” said Ruth Ann Palumbo, a former state representative from Lexington who said she had known Childers for decades and worked with him closely in the mid-1990s while he was cabinet secretary. 
Juvenile justice: ‘From nothing to something and then right back to nothing’

“He did so much for the commonwealth,” Palumbo said. “He did a lot of good for  this state.”
Tim Veno, a former top official at the cabinet, said Childers pushed key reforms in juvenile justice, nursing home and day care oversight, adult and child welfare and Medicaid — all housed within the sprawling agency he ran until December 1995.
“He had a lot of accomplishments over the years,” Veno said. “Obviously the reforms didn’t last but they lasted a pretty good while.”
Veno and Palumbo said they were notified late Thursday of Childers’ death by his family members and others close to him.
Childers told the Kentucky Lantern last year he was very proud of a 1995 consent decree he helped negotiate with the U.S. Department of Justice to reform the state’s problem-ridden system of centers for juvenile offenders and was deeply disappointed to learn federal officials were again investigating reports of abuse of youths that had resurfaced in recent years.
“If our consent decree had been followed, we would not be talking about this,” he said in the 2024 interview.
An ‘intense individual’
While credited with shaking up operations at the state’s largest agency and enacting important reforms in human services, Childers, a lawyer who had worked in state government through several administrations, was known for his table-pounding, shouting, mercurial style around staff.
The Frankfort State Journal once reported that Childers “throws the best fit in Frankfort.”
“He was an intense individual and sometimes very hard to work for,” Veno recalled. “I quit on him a couple of times.”
But Veno said Childers would implore him not to leave the cabinet, once showing up at his apartment to make the request in person.
“I would get over it,” said Veno. “I’d go back to work and he’d treat me well for a while but there were some wild times. He would throw staplers, kick trash cans.”
Some outbursts, Veno said, were born of frustration over the nature of the cabinet’s work which generally was lurching from one human service crisis to another — sometimes involving death or injury to children and adults under the cabinet’s watch.
“He in many ways inherited a cabinet that’s on fire,” Pat Mulloy, who served as finance secretary in the Jones administration, said in a 1994 interview in the Courier Journal. “He’s got to put the fires out and figure out how to rebuild.”
But despite the conflict, his top staff formed a close bond and continued to meet for lunch occasionally in the years after Childers left the job as secretary when Gov. Jones term ended in 1995.
“That team we had in place, he thought we had a close connection, and we did,” Veno said. “He was a great leader, smart as a whip, was very passionate and did a lot for the people of the commonwealth.”
Frankfort ‘hillbilly’
A cigar-smoking, suspender-wearing afficionado of Brooks Brothers suits, Childers — a native of Pikeville — persisted in referring to himself as a “hillbilly” and “country lawyer.”
Veno recalled reports Childers occasionally lit up a stogie at work — despite a ban on smoking in state buildings — prompting an inquiry from a reporter as his tenure as secretary was winding down at the close of the Jones administration.
Childers had a ready response for the reporter, Veno recalled.
“He said, ‘We are doing an investigation as we speak. We are close to identifying a perpetrator and I can assure you he will no longer be here on Dec. 12,’” Veno said.
(Dec. 12, 1995 was the day Paul Patton was inaugurated as the next governor, succeeding Jones).
  Childers earned a reputation as a difficult boss. Nonetheless, he stayed close with former colleagues who got together for occasional lunches.

Childers was born into a well-off Pike County family. His father, Masten Childers, was a wealthy coal operator and his mother, Velma, was a prominent Republican who caused a stir when she crossed party lines to support Jones, a former Republican running for governor as a Democrat, according to a 1994 Courier Journal profile.
Childers said he became a Democrat in 1977.
Before becoming CHFS secretary under Jones, he held several government jobs.
Childers served as deputy finance secretary under former Gov. Julian Carroll and chief of staff for Martha Layne Collins when she was lieutenant governor.
After earning a law degree in 1983, Childers served as a law clerk for former state Supreme Court Justice James B. Stephenson, Childers’ former neighbor in Pikeville, according to the Courier Journal profile.
He first joined the health services cabinet as general counsel in 1992 before Jones named him to the top job as secretary.
After he left government, Childers returned to private law practice, Veno said.
But he stayed in touch with friends and former colleagues, most recently at his 75th birthday party in July at the Lexington Club, said Palumbo, among those who attended.
By then, Veno, who also attended, said Parkinson’s Disease had taken its toll on Childers’ health, commenting, “Now he’s not struggling and suffering.”

U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra and state Rep. Taylor Collins signed and sent a letter to the Iowa Board of Regents Friday, to be distributed to University of Iowa President Barbara Wilson, Iowa State University President Wendy Wintersteen and University of Northern Iowa President Mark Nook, to make sure DEI is dead on their campuses and fire anyone who claims otherwise.
“Last May, Governor (Kim) Reynolds signed legislation eliminating the DEI bureaucracies at our Regent Universities. In January of this year, President Trump signed an Executive Order ending DEI efforts in the federal government,” the letter stated. “From Des Moines to Washington, D.C., clear messages have been sent to our institutions of higher education to end these radical programs.”

The letter brought up specific instances of videos appearing to show UI employees talking about changes to DEI and ways that they’re working around restrictions. At the time the UI announced it was launching “an immediate and comprehensive investigation” into the incidents and would take corrective action if necessary.
A video also surfaced involving the former director of the ISU Center for LGBTQIA+ Student Success discussing compliance with the law while finding loopholes to get around them. The university said in a statement there was no timestamp on the video, and judging by the discussion and where the video was shot, it was taken before universities were required by the board of regents to come under compliance with anti-DEI legislation.
Both the LGBTQ+ center and director position were eliminated in December 2024, according to the statement.
According to the letter sent by Feenstra and Collins, “currently many of these employees are on paid administrative leave, enjoying a taxpayer funded vacation.” The UI did not respond Friday afternoon to questions about the status of investigations or whether employees are on leave.
Collins said in an interview earlier this month the UI had lost a lot of his and other lawmakers’ trust after they learned of the incidents, and he told Wilson in a previous letter she needed to send a strong message that DEI is no longer welcome on campus.
“Clear and decisive action from each of you is the only way we can ensure that DEI is DOA in the State of Iowa,” the Friday letter stated.

Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, speaks to the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 22, 2025, in Sioux Falls. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — The United States can win the “AI race,” but not without the infrastructure and data centers necessary to develop the emerging technology, U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson told members of the Greater Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce on Friday.
The artificial intelligence race is a competition between the United States and other countries, including China, to dominate the technology. Johnson, a South Dakota Republican, painted a bleak future economically and democratically if the U.S. doesn’t win. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in July to facilitate construction of data centers with incentives including loans, grants and tax breaks.
Data centers are massive facilities needed to house servers and other computing infrastructure required by AI.
Data center official says other states offer better incentives than SD

Johnson said he is “befuddled” by blanket opposition to economic development, including data centers and other large projects. He said South Dakota leaders need to be “visionary” and bring new industries to the state “or we are saying that our children will have diminished opportunities.” That, Johnson said, is “absolutely unacceptable.”
“It’s un-American and it’s not at all capitalist,” he said.
While it’s important for community members to ask questions, not all projects should be rejected outright, he added.
“I think there is a great opportunity for us to do as President Trump has said and to win the battle for AI,” Johnson said. “We cannot do it if the only answer in front of us is, ‘No, always no.’”
Johnson is South Dakota’s lone U.S. representative and is running for the Republican nomination for governor in 2026. The other two declared Republican gubernatorial candidates are Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden and South Dakota House Speaker Jon Hansen. Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden is also expected to run.
There are no massive data centers in South Dakota, but there are proposals to build them. A multi-billion-dollar data center was proposed for Deuel County earlier this year. Earlier this month, the Sioux Falls City Council took a step toward allowing construction of a new data center between Sioux Falls and Brandon. Two South Dakota electricity providers, Black Hills Corp. and NorthWestern Energy, announced a merger this week and cited future demand from data centers as a reason for the deal.
Representatives with both of the data center projects have said they might not land in South Dakota without competitive incentives from the state. The state Senate narrowly rejected legislation in February that would have provided tax refunds for data centers.










I think there is a great opportunity for us to do as President Trump has said and to win the battle for AI. We cannot do it if the only answer in front of us is, ‘No, always no.’


– U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota


Opponents to the legislation cited concerns about tax fairness if the state offers incentives for companies to build in South Dakota, as well as concerns about water and energy demands to operate and cool data center systems.
Johnson said the projects create new jobs for South Dakotans who have the skills to run the operations and are “good customers” to utility companies, because they provide a steady demand for energy and can run on generators when there is too much demand. But he said the projects are threatened by opposition that goes beyond the philosophy of “Not In My Backyard.” 
“Forget the NIMBYs, we’ve got BANANAs: ‘Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anything,’” Johnson said. “It is a disease that’s metastasizing.”
In an interview with South Dakota Searchlight after the public discussion, Johnson said communities and states “need to step up” and present incentives that “work for the community and state.” He said building data centers could also generate new property taxes that would lessen the burden on other property taxpayers, which is a focus of the Legislature this year.
“If we want to reduce property taxes, we need to grow the property tax base,” Johnson said. “Obviously there is some role for government efficiency, but that’s not going to get us as far as we need.”

Jim Pillen's plans for a new ICE detention facility in Nebraska,"State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, at center speaking. Aug. 22, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Governor’s Mansion was a bit busier than usual on Friday. 
Roughly 150 protesters gathered outside the mansion Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen sometimes calls home to protest his plans for a new Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility at a state prison in the southwestern part of the state. State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha spoke to the protesters, saying she needs to “be stronger so I can advocate for my immigrant community.”
“Much has changed in our country since January,” Juarez said. “President [Donald] Trump is pursuing his goal of removing undocumented immigrants from our country without due process.” 
Trump, throughout his 2024 presidential campaign, posted on social media promising voters what he called “the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History,” after the Biden administration saw illegal border crossings spike at the end of 2023 and start decreasing last year. Trump has said he is pursuing the deportations to “keep our families safe.” Pillen has said of the facility, “Government’s most important job is to keep us safe.”
The governor is following a similar political playbook on the rollout of the facility.

Nebraska has seen an increase in ICE activity this year. Glenn Valley Foods in Omaha faced an ICE raid in June, which sparked protests in Omaha and Lincoln. In July, ICE announced it had arrested an MS-13 “kingpin” hiding in Omaha. 
Juarez called the Glenn Valley Foods ICE raid a “political stunt to create fear and divisiveness in South Omaha and beyond.”  
“We must use our position of power and privilege to protect our immigrant neighbors,” she said Friday. “We must use our position of power and privilege to protect our immigrant neighbors.”

The Governor’s Office has said any “backlash to this initiative is politically motivated” and that “Nebraskans spoke loud and clear last November and demanded order at the border.” 
Four of the state’s five Electoral College votes went to Trump in the 2024 presidential election. Most Republican state senators reached by the Examiner in recent days have said they support the new effort in Nebraska. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.
A Papillion United Methodist pastor, Rebecca Hjelle-Penner, said while most of Nebraska went to Trump, “not all Nebraskans voted for that.” 
“I don’t think that people … [or] I hope that people didn’t think this is what would happen,” Hjelle-Penner said. “That would break my heart to think that people would be so angry with their neighbors that they would decide it’s worth doing this to each other.”
While state lawmakers are “learning on the go” about Nebraska’s plan to transform its McCook Work Ethic Camp from a rehabilitative center for young men to a migrant detention facility, Pillen told NewsNation this week that the facility is “ready to roll.”
McCook city officials, in a statement, said it was out of their hands because the Work Ethic Camp is on state-owned land, but that they “are confident in the direction” the city and Red Willow County are heading.  
Nebraska Appleseed, a group that advocates for the needy and immigrants, touted a petition on Ujoin, an advocacy website, has received roughly 12,000 signatures telling Pillen “no” on opening the facility, adding, “This is not who we are.” 
National, state-by-state ICE expansions come as recent polling suggests a majority of Americans now disapprove of Trump’s handling of immigration, though most Republicans still support it. Recent polling indicates a shift in people’s attitudes from last year, when more Americans supported less immigration and stricter immigration enforcement. 
“I wonder now if they would reconsider the way that they did vote,” Hjelle-Penner said.

Here’s an update on some of the large fire incidents across the state.
 Bivens Creek and Cloudrest

Two fires burning in the Tobacco Root mountains continued to grow this week, both with 0% containment, according to a Friday morning news release.
  A fire map for the Bivens Creek and Cloudrest fires.
Northern Rockies Complex Incident Management Team 6 is managing both fires, which are burning about 15 miles northwest of Virginia City. 
The focus is currently on the Bivens Creek fire, which was listed at 2,219 acres on Friday morning. The nearby Cloudrest fire was listed at 1,733 acres. Acreages can change — usually due to overhead imaging of a fire, which provides more accurate mapping — but those flights do not always happen every day.
Fire crews were looking to protect residences in South Meadow Creek and areas south of the Bivens Creek incident. Crews were looking to strengthen fire lines on the west side of that fire and aerial resources were being used in that area. Firefighters were using bulldozers on the east side of the fire and were hopeful to make progress in that area on Friday.
There were 392 personnel assigned to the Bivens Creek fire and 48 on the Cloudrest fire. On the Cloudrest fire, crews were looking to protect a community south of that blaze. Winds, which were mostly pretty calm statewide this week, were a concern for the two Madison County fires.
“By utilizing the natural features of the rocky terrain, firefighters will continue constructing fire line connecting these features to prevent spread down the valley towards homes and the community of Pony,” a press release for the fire stated. “Fire crews will scout and identify new primary and secondary control lines in the Indian Creek drainage, where the fire made some headway yesterday.”
Friday’s situation report from the National Interagency Fire Center showed the Bivens and Cloudrest fires as costing nearly $5 million combined to suppress to date. Fire costs are shared by state and federal governments and are divided at the end of the year.
 Windy Rock and Devil Mountain

Two fires burning 15 miles northeast of Drummond were listed at 1,957 acres and 0% contained on Friday.
  Windy Rock fire map.
The state Department of Natural Resources and Conservation’s County Assist Team is managing both fires as one incident. There were 366 personnel assigned to the fire on Friday, including four helicopters and 11 engines. It has cost about $4.6 million to suppress so far, according to the daily national fire briefing.
Air tankers were dispatched to the fire, with a Friday morning briefing saying they were effective ​​in limiting spread to the northwest of the Devil Mountain Fire. This allowed ground crews to move in for direct suppression efforts on Friday.
A public meeting for the fire is planned for Helmville Community Center, at 7 p.m. on Friday, Aug. 22.
The fires were lightning caused, burning timber and grass, mainly lodgepole and mixed conifer at higher elevations. There’s a heavy dead and down timber component and no recorded fire history in the area, a fire briefing said. It also described some fire behavior as “extreme.”
 Knowles

Burning six miles east of Paradise, the Knowles fire was listed at 2,075 acres and 0% containment.
That fire is being managed by Northern Rockies Incident Command Team 9. There were 236 personnel on the fire, but getting aerial resources “continues to be challenging due to escalating demands across the region.”
Residences are threatened and Sanders County has an pre-evacuation notice for residents in the McLaughlin area.
“The northwestern corner is being assessed for options to insert more crews and equipment to establish control lines,” a press release from the fire said. “There is still direct action to protect the residences on that side of the fire.”
The fire started in grass and moved to timber. It’s cost about $1.8 million to suppress.

 Sandbar 2

A lightning-caused fire 15 miles east of Lincoln was at 242 acres and 0% containment on Friday.
There were 131 people assigned to the Sandbar 2 fire and it is being managed by Northwest Complex Incident Management Team 8. Helicopters were involved in fire efforts, a release for the fire said.
No evacuation levels are currently in effect for the fire, which is burning through timber. Crews were busy laying down hoses and strengthening lines around the fire. That fire was listed as having cost about $900,000 to suppress to date.
Corral Creek
A fire managed by Lolo National Forest and burning six miles southwest from Frenchtown was listed at 221 acres and 0% containment.
It was discovered on Aug. 20, according to fire officials.
Progress on the fire was made Thursday, though windy conditions were a concern on Friday. Dozer lines and hand crews were working on the southern and western flanks of the fire.
 West Fork

A 421-acre fire discovered on Aug. 19 was under investigation and 5% contained on Friday. It’s being managed by the Forest Service and 47 people are working the fire.
The fire does not pose a threat to Big Sky, a media release said, and is located 23 miles northwest of West Yellowstone in Custer Gallatin National Forest near the Beaver Creek Forest Service cabin.
Hebgen Lake was being used for firefighting efforts and the Forest Service warned people to stay away and not use drones. Drones are illegal to fly in areas of active firefighting because the risk mid-air collisions and crashes.

(Photo via Getty Images)New Mexico residents pay thousands of dollars each year because of the state’s crumbling road infrastructure, state transportation officials told lawmakers Friday. 
With the number of acceptable roads declining and the cost of fixing them outstripping funds, the state transportation secretary says New Mexico may need to raise existing taxes or create new ones to fund road projects.
Presently, the state has $5.6 billion worth of needed but unfunded transportation projects, according to the state Department of Transportation’s presentation to the Transportation Infrastructure Revenue Subcommittee at its meeting in Silver City.
The percentage of New Mexico roads in acceptable condition dropped from 75% in 2011 to 69% in 2023, the presentation states.
Deteriorating roads result in drivers paying an average of $2,074 annually, for vehicle maintenance, congestion and safety costs, according to the data. That figure is even higher in the Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Las Cruces areas.
To pay for the $5.6 billion in unfunded projects, New Mexico will likely need some combination of changing the way the state distributes its tax on vehicle sales; increasing existing taxes and fees; or creating new ones, such as delivery surcharges or road user charges, Transportation Secretary Ricky Serna told the committee.
DOT doesn’t receive recurring funding from the Legislature, Serna said, and when lawmakers do give the agency money, it comes with a three-year deadline attached, which, if not met, can be clawed back and used for other purposes.
The agency tried to address these problems with a piece of legislation in this year’s session that would have raised the state’s weight-distance tax on commercial traffic and vehicle registration fees, and created a new electric vehicle surcharge, Serna said. The state House of Representatives unanimously approved that bill, but it died in the Senate in the session’s final week.
Another way the state could generate revenue would be to raise its 17-cent per gallon gasoline tax, Serna said. A one-cent increase would generate approximately $6.6 million in annual revenue, DOT Chief Economist Michael Morrison told the committee. Lawmakers haven’t changed the tax since 1996 when they lowered it from 20 cents per gallon, Morrison said. 
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque) suggested that it would be cheaper for drivers to pay more per gallon of fuel rather than for the expenses resulting from deteriorating roads like new tires, for example.
“It’s just been, in my opinion, a failure of government not to incrementally and reasonably increase the gas tax over the last 30 years,” Maestas said.

The Legislature referred Proposition MM to the ballot during its regular lawmaking session earlier this year, seeking to raise more money for the Healthy School Meals for All program. Senate Bill 25B-3, being considered during the current special session, would tweak that proposition to allow any leftover money to cover costs associated with the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
“This measure ensures Colorado continues to step up where the federal government is stepping back,” bill sponsor Katie Wallace, a Longmont Democrat, said ahead of the vote on Friday morning.
The bill passed through the Senate on party lines. It now heads to the House.

The universal school meal program is funded through limited income tax deductions on households earning $300,000 or more annually, approved by voters in 2022. The program has been more expensive than anticipated during its first two years, however, and there was a nearly $56 million budget shortfall for the program last year.
Lawmakers then referred a pair of propositions to this year’s ballot to raise more revenue and keep more money than originally allowed. Proposition MM would raise about $95 million more annually. About 200,000 tax filers, or about 6% of filers in Colorado, would be impacted. Proposition LL, which wouldn’t be impacted by the bill, would let the state keep about $13 million that would otherwise be returned to the impacted tax filers.
SB25B-3 would allow SNAP to benefit from that proposition if it passes. Funding for the food assistance program is threatened by the federal budget law passed by Republicans in Congress in July, to the tune of $50 million per year in new administration costs and between $90 million and $120 million starting in 2027 for new state match requirements, according to Abby McClelland with Food and Energy Assistance Division in the state’s Department of Human Services.
SNAP assists about 617,000 Coloradans with $120 million in benefits per month, McClelland said.
“The minimization of SNAP in (the federal bill) is cruel, and what we are asking the voters is to please allow any money overage that we might collect for Healthy School Meals for All, after HSMFA is fully funded, to go to SNAP to cover the shortfall,” bill sponsor Sen. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, a Commerce City Democrat, said during its Senate committee hearing on Thursday.
Republican Sen. Lisa Frizell, a Castle Rock Republican, countered that the state needs to find ways to run SNAP more efficiently to save money.
“If I were reading the lines on (the new federal law), I’d think that maybe they’re suggesting states need to be more efficient with how they administer this program,” she said. “This is an important program to those Colorado citizens who are most vulnerable, but are we doing the best job at administering this?”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Nearly a third of telemedicine patients with opioid use disorder had to go without buprenorphine because they had trouble filling their prescription at a pharmacy, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Network Open this month, surveyed 600 telemedicine patients across five states: Florida, Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Texas. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved buprenorphine for treatment of opioid use disorder. The drug reduces a patient’s cravings for opioids and reduces the likelihood of a fatal overdose.
The most common reason that patients had trouble was that buprenorphine was unavailable at the pharmacy, followed by coverage-related issues and the pharmacy’s hesitancy in filling a telemedicine prescription.
Previous research has shown that some pharmacists, fearing scrutiny, hesitate to dispense buprenorphine, which is a controlled substance. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services say people with opioid use disorder “who need buprenorphine [should be] able to access it without undue delay,” the authors note.
Roughly half of the patients who participated in the survey were covered by Medicaid. A majority of patients had been in treatment for at least six months, and half lived in rural areas.
The analysis didn’t find statistically significant differences between patients in rural and non-rural areas. But the authors noted that the study only surveyed participants from those five states, and results might be different in other ones.
In general, they noted, patients living in rural areas might have a harder time finding buprenorphine and other opioid use disorder drugs at a pharmacy because there are fewer pharmacies in rural areas.
The study underscores recent data suggesting a lack of access to opioid use disorder medication. An analysis released last year by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2022, only a quarter of people with opioid use disorder received recommended medications. About 4% of U.S. adults have opioid use disorder.
Other research has shown many pharmacies lack buprenorphine. Two studies found that between 42% and 51% of U.S. pharmacies did not have buprenorphine in stock, and availability varied widely across states.
The JAMA Network Open study was led by Workit Health, a telemedicine addiction treatment app that operates in four of the states included in the survey. Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, and Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine in Pennsylvania also contributed. In their conflict of interest disclosures, some of the authors reported holding equity in Workit Health.

They need to be prepared for service cuts.",John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/transportation-infrastructure/50000-students-rely-on-septa-in-philadelphia-they-need-to-be-prepared-for-service-cuts/,"Without a budget deal, SEPTA will cut services across all buses, subways, and trolleys by 20% starting on Sunday.","People ride SEPTA articulated bus in Philadelphia. (Courtesy of Getty Images)As Philadelphia students prepare to return to school on Monday, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is advising them to make a plan since service cuts are set to go into effect over the weekend.
“We never wanted to be in this situation,” SEPTA General Manager Scott Sauer said during a press conference on Friday. “Taking away service is at odds with everything that we strive to do at SEPTA.”
“Our hope is that the coming days will see progress in Harrisburg toward a long-term sustainable funding solution for public transportation,” he added. “So that this disruption for our customers, our city, and region will be as brief as possible.”
Without a funding package approved by the General Assembly, SEPTA has warned for months that they would have to proceed with service cuts and fare increases. Starting on Sunday, the authority will cut service across all buses, subways and trolleys, by 20%. Reductions in regional rail will follow on Sept. 2. Fare increases are also slated to go into effect on Sept. 1.

A second wave of major service cuts would follow in January, if state funding is not approved for mass transit services across the commonwealth.
SEPTA serves about 800,000 people daily across the Philadelphia-region. More than 50,000 students in middle school and high school rely on it daily to get to school.
“Service reductions will impact students, just as they will all of our riders,” Sauer said.
“This weekend, we encourage students and their families to review the service plan that we have on SEPTA.org to see how the cuts will impact them,” Sauer advised. “Map out their travel to and from school.”
In preparation for the service cuts, Sauer said that SEPTA attempted to “take away as many pain points” as they could, and noted that with some bus routes being eliminated, there will be alternate services nearby, although more walking and transfers may be necessary. Extra time will be needed for riders, they said, as they get used to these changes.
The authority will have ambassadors stationed at transit hubs to assist riders with questions.
SEPTA Transit Police Chief Charles Lawson said the agency has a school safety plan in place, like years prior. However, he acknowledged the looming service cuts have provided some changes.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
SEPTA will increase staffing during student travel, Lawson said, by “virtually doubling” the available staff when the bulk of students are traveling on the system, assign video patrols to locations where they don’t have active police presence, and increase their focus on bus service and bus routes.
“We are entering the school year planning on increasing police presence along about a dozen routes throughout the city,” Lawson said.
He noted that police officers will be on buses along those routes.
A new addition, Lawson said, will be a daily morning check-in call with school police. He also encouraged the use of the SEPTA Transit Watch app for students to report anything they see that makes them feel unsafe.
Sports fans were also advised about the looming service cuts since the Philadelphia Phillies have a game on Sunday – the first day for the reductions to be in effect.

Where do things stand with the state House and Senate?
Mass transit funding has been front and center during the seven-plus week budget stalemate.
The state House, led by Democrats, has advanced legislation on multiple occasions that would fund mass transit agencies, along with roads and bridges. Their most recent effort was House Bill 1788, authored by Rep. Sean Dougherty (D-Philadelphia), which would provide $600 million to mass transit and roads and bridges, while also increasing accountability on the transit agencies and public-private projects.
The Senate, led by Republicans, responded by passing a proposal that would provide about $300 million to the state’s mass transit agencies for the next two years. This proposal would also take money from a fund for public transit to spend on roads and bridges. The House Appropriations Committee rejected this measure.
Democrats and Republicans find themselves at odds over how much should go towards mass transit agencies like SEPTA and where that money should come from.
In response to a question on Friday, Sauer said that SEPTA has a need for operating dollars and capital dollars.
“So taking from one pot to get to the other is not a sustainable solution,” Sauer said. “It could be a quick fix, I suppose. But that’s for them to decide. But we need to focus on the moment and the moment right now is on service.”
If the General Assembly were to reach a deal over the next 48 hours, Sauer said, SEPTA would do “everything” in their power to put as much service back on the street as fast as they can.

“But it will be very difficult for us to restore service in a manner that the customer would be used to,” Sauer said. “There’s a lot of back end systems that are in play to provide both information and safety of the operation that we would have to go in and manipulate to get it back onto a normal schedule.”
“So, while I won’t rule out that the possibility exists to go back to some semblance of normalcy by Monday or Sunday, as the clock ticks forward, it gets more and more difficult to do that,” he added.
In addition to SEPTA changing services due to the ongoing budget impasse, other agencies and human services providers are also sounding the alarm.
On Friday, the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania sent a letter to lawmakers saying that without a state budget, “counties may have no choice but to raise property taxes and cut services – directly impacting taxpayers due to state inaction.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEPTA-Bus-2025-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-22 17:56:51.237944

(Photo courtesy of Eastern Iowa Community Colleges)Eastern Iowa Community Colleges has launched a new program in partnership with private companies to bolster workforce pipelines and give students a fast path to skilled employment.
The community college system announced in a news release this week nine students will start classes next week in the first cohort of the process technician certification program, housed at the DeWitt Career Advancement Center.
The non-credit certificate will take nine months to complete, with students participating in both instruction and hands-on training to learn about process equipment and instrumentation, applied chemistry, workplace safety and more.
Leallen Ehlers, engineering technology business development and training specialist at EICC, said in the release that the program, and the collaborative work he conducted with staff at companies ADM, 3M and LyondellBasell, will hopefully meet the needs of local industries and employ students close by.

“Many of these students might have left the area for work, but this program gives them the skills and opportunity to stay here, build careers, and contribute to the strength of our local economy,” Ehlers said in the release.
Each of the students in the program’s first cohort received a $3,500 scholarship and were offered guaranteed interviews for jobs with the partnering companies after graduation, according to the release.
Ehlers said in the release planning for the program began after the college system heard concerns from local businesses about the lack of trained process technicians, and the curriculum has been crafted to meet industry demands and “serve as a model for future training.”
Jobs students who complete the program will qualify for include process technician, manufacturing technologist and quality control specialist, the release stated, positions that people usually need as many as seven years of manufacturing experience to qualify for.
According to the release, students ready to start classes next week were drawn to the program because of its quick timeline, industry connections and path to a stable, rewarding career.
“It’s really exciting,” said 18-year-old Shyanna Bogle, a Camanche resident included in the first program cohort. “I thought it would be great to learn more about this industry and have a positive impact in the community.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to a prison in El Salvador brought widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics, was released from a rural Tennessee jail on Friday, five months after being detained while driving to his Maryland home.
Abrego will be escorted by the U.S. Marshals Service back Maryland, where he must report to pretrial services by 10 a.m. Monday. He will also be under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which could choose to detain him. A Maryland court order in a separate case requires he be given 72 hours notice if the government plans to send him to a “third country.”
An order filed Friday by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee noted that “should Abrego be taken into ICE custody following his return to Maryland” the government “shall ensure that, while Abrego remains in ICE custody, he has access to his attorneys, both physically and via telephone, to allow Abrego to prepare for trial in this case.”
Abrego will also be subject to electronic location monitoring and placed in the custody of his brother, the order noted.
Abrego, as the Tennessee court refers to him, was dispatched to El Salvador after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Maryland, where he has lived with his wife and children and works as an apprentice sheet metal worker. A government prosecutor later conceded his deportation was an error. Abrego, who entered the country illegally as a teen, was the subject of an immigration court order barring his removal to his home country of El Salvador, where he said he feared gang violence.
He was returned to Tennessee in June to face human smuggling charges that prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. Abrego was neither cited nor arrested when he was pulled over by Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with nine passengers in his vehicle. Prosecutors now allege the stop was part of a human smuggling operation in which Abrego was paid to transport immigrants illegally in the United States to points around the country.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.
U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, said in a statement that Abrego’s release shows the “legal system has worked its will and is upholding Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s right to due process.”
“While I have no doubt the Administration will continue its attempts to undermine Mr. Abrego Garcia’s rights, we will continue fighting to see them maintained — because due process in this case does not end with his release. Mr. Abrego Garcia must continue to be allowed to defend himself in court, where the Trump Administration must make its case before taking any further action against him.
“This is a matter that’s greater than just this one case or one man – if one person’s rights are denied, then the rights of all of us are at risk.”

More than a thousand people were expected to seek free dental, medical and vision care at the two-day event in the rural and financially struggling area of western Virginia. RAM provides free medical care through mobile clinics in underserved, isolated, or impoverished communities around the country and world. As health care continues to be a contentious issue in America, an estimated 29 million Americans, about one in 10, lack coverage.  An estimated 27 million people — or 8.3 percent of the population of America- were uninsured, according to a report from the Census Bureau.  This rate is considerably high in rural and poorer parts of the country. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.












 I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard. 


–  David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote




But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
Two lawmakers quit New Mexico Redistricting Task Force

 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Rural residents will be hardest hit by looming health insurance premium increases, according to a new report. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

(Via Florida Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles)Florida election officials and voting rights advocates want to get the word out now that if you’ve renewed or replaced your state driver’s license or state ID in the past year, that could affect your ability to vote by mail or have your signature on a petition ballot be counted.
The change in policy started more than year ago. Beginning on July 31, 2024, the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles began implementing legislation that requires the distinguishing numbers assigned to a driver’s license or identification card to include at least four randomly generated numbers. The agency says the change was done “to improve security and safeguard individuals’ identities.”
That change means that when voters go online to apply for a vote-by-mail ballot, they could encounter error messages if their driver’s license information is out of sync with the information they supplied when registering to vote.
“The main problem is that information isn’t being forwarded to supervisor of elections or local elected officials, and that becomes an issue mainly for vote-by-mail voters and those signing petitions, because more recent laws have made strict requirements for ID numbers,” said Brad Ashwell, Florida director for All Voting Is Local.
While officials want to get this information out to voters now, well in advance of the next elections, this issue can potentially affect voters in Tampa right now who are applying for vote-by-mail ballots. The city is conducting a special election for a city council seat on Sept. 9.
“If a voter has a new DL number and has not updated their voter registration information with that new number and then they try to use the new DL number to verify an online mail ballot request, the online form will not be able to match those numbers,” said Gerri Kramer, chief communications officer with the Hillsborough County Supervisor of Elections.
Kramer adds that her office has not received any complaints so far from voters experiencing this problem, although requests to obtain mail-ballots for domestic voters only began earlier this week. She added that voters can also verify their online requests with the last four digits of their Social Security numbers if they have that on file from a voter registration application.
“The main thing that the voters need to know is if they have renewed or replaced their driver’s license in the last year, they need to call their supervisors and update their registration,” Ashwell said. 
Update records
Gretl Plessinger of the Florida Department of State said that her agency encourages voters to keep their information up to date, “but an old driver’s license number should not prohibit a person from voting either by mail or in person with a driver’s license that is not expired.”
She added that if the latest Florida driver’s license/state ID number is not in the voter’s record, the supervisor “must update the voter’s record with the number that the voter provided. Once that number is verified, and all other required information is submitted, the voter may obtain a ballot to vote.”
The problem also pertains to registered voters who sign ballot initiative petitions. The measure passed by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. DeSantis earlier this year (SB 1205) now requires that those signing such petitions must provide their Florida driver’s license number, Florida identification card number, or the last four numbers of their Social Security numbers.
The legislation requiring that applicants for new or renewed driver’s licenses or ID cards passed in 2022. The provision regarding the “distinguishing number” assigned to an original, renewal, or replacement ID card was scheduled to begin on Nov. 1, 2023. However, the Department of Motor Vehicles and Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles  did not begin to implement the law until the end of July 2024.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)The state of North Dakota and the U.S. government have entered settlement negotiations in a yearslong lawsuit over Dakota Access Pipeline protest costs. The development comes after the executive branch indicated it would appeal a $28 million dollar judgment handed down by a federal trial court this spring.
Attorney General Drew Wrigley on Friday confirmed that the state and federal government have been in talks about a potential settlement for weeks. He said he could not share further details, but that he appreciates that both sides are open to having a dialogue. 
South-central North Dakota in 2016 became the site of a major protest against construction of the oil pipeline, which crosses underneath the Missouri River’s Lake Oahe reservoir just north of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. The tribe started the demonstrations out of concerns that the pipeline poses an environmental threat, intrudes upon unceded Sioux Nation territory and has desecrated sacred cultural sites.
Federal government appealing $28M award to North Dakota for pipeline protest costs

The main protest camp was located on federal land managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The state filed suit in 2019 against the federal government, arguing that the Corps had directly caused the demonstrations to grow in size and intensity by allowing protesters to use its land.
The four-week trial included testimony from two former North Dakota governors — Doug Burgum and Jack Dalrymple — as well as Native American activists, law enforcement and experts.
More than a year later, U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor issued a nearly 120-page order finding the Army Corps at fault for negligence, public nuisance and civil trespass claims.
The executive branch in June filed a notice that it would appeal Traynor’s decision to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.
Now, the parties are trying to settle. The state and U.S. Department of Justice filed a joint request with the 8th Circuit earlier this month asking the appellate court to pause the case in the meantime.
The court on Aug. 11 granted the request and directed the parties to file a joint status report by Sept. 10 providing updates on how the negotiations are going.
North Dakota’s lawsuit requested $38 million from the federal government. Traynor ordered the executive branch to pay $28 million since the U.S. Department of Justice previously gave the state $10 million as compensation for the protests.

(Photo courtesy of Peninsula School District)When the Peninsula School District implemented one of Washington’s first bans on cellphones in the classroom two years ago, Keyna Houston said it could not have come soon enough.

“I was like, ‘thank the Lord,’ ” the Gig Harbor High School English teacher, told Gig Harbor Now and the Kitsap Sun last year. “Finally, I don’t have to fight this battle on my own.”
Unsurprisingly, teachers had by far the most positive reaction to these policies. They reported less stress, better ability to manage their classrooms and social benefits for their students, according to new research out of the University of Washington.
The unpublished study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, offers the first systematic look at how teachers, parents and students in Washington feel about these policies.
 Put your phones away

Districts moved to curtail phone use in recent years, after reporting unprecedented levels of disruptive behaviors and worsening mental health among students following their return from the pandemic closures. Following Peninsula’s lead, all schools in Kitsap County enacted some restrictions over the last year.
The Washington Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction said 53% of districts in the state will have a policy restricting cellphone access in place by the start of the school year; 31% of districts require students to put away devices for the entire school day.
UW researchers surveyed more than 5,000 students, 220 teachers and 480 parents across six districts, including Peninsula, said lead author and assistant psychology professor Lucía Magis-Weinberg. She studies how adolescence has been altered in the digital era.
Students were less enthusiastic about the bans, with the vast majority saying they did not perceive an impact. According to Magis-Weinberg, 70% of students said the policies had “no impact” on their ability to pay attention, as opposed to 20% who said it had a positive impact. A majority also said it had no impact on their well-being.
Survey results did not seem to indicate that students though cellphone bans made things worse.
“That was very surprising to me,” Magis-Weinberg said of the findings. “I would have expected them to be against the policies and to be quite negative about them.”
 Open questions about cellphone bans

How effective are these bans at achieving their prescribed goals, and what type of restrictions are most effective? Those questions remain open.
Nobody doubts that phones can be a big distraction, so when implemented well these bans can encourage better habits, Magis-Weinberg said. At the same time, each district needs to tailor them to its needs and ideally create policies with input from students and staff.
Both students and teachers prefer consistent application of these restrictions, with administrators providing rules that are aligned between teachers and classrooms. When schools leave decisions about phones up to teachers, “no one likes that,” Magis-Weinberg said. It tends to pit teachers against one another.
Removing phones in isolation was not enough to promote social interaction, researchers found. Schools still need to introduce alternative ways for students to connect, through activities or games.
Bans also did not appear to produce huge improvements in academics or mental health outcomes. But Magis-Weinberg said they seem to have introduced incremental improvements, particularly for teachers.
 Better digital habits

These policies allowed teachers to shift from “referee to coach,” she said. They can now encourage better digital habits rather than taking punitive actions against students.
“Anything that helps teachers be less stressed, feel more effective and changes the relationship from policing to actually having time to teach and connect with students, I think that’s important,” she said.
Middle school teachers also reported that students seemed more relaxed and had returned to more “goofy” and “playful” behavior. Students had become too concerned with how they were perceived, teachers reported. Fear that someone would record or take a picture of them changed how they behaved.
“Even if a school is not implementing a ban,” she said, “I think it’s a clear takeaway that (schools) should really be very very strict about recording.”

(Gavel photo by Getty Images; seal courtesy the State of Iowa) A central Iowa lawyer is appealing a disciplinary commission’s findings that she is “a danger to the public,” lacks a basic understanding of the law and was “basically fleecing” her clients through inflated legal bills while peddling an “outlandish conspiracy theory” about corruption among the judiciary.
The Grievance Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court says Clive attorney Valerie Cramer has taken “advantage of vulnerable and unsophisticated clients” and now displays “an utter lack of remorse or contrition.”
The commission is recommending that Cramer’s law license be revoked by the Iowa Supreme Court, stating that her “billing practices and deceptive conduct puts the public at risk of further harm.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Cramer, who has been licensed to practice law in Iowa since 2003, said Friday the commission’s findings are untrue, but declined to elaborate.
The disciplinary case stems from a complaint filed by the Iowa Supreme Court Attorney Disciplinary Board in November 2024. That complaint, which recently became public after the Grievance Commission issued its findings in the matter, alleges numerous ethics violations related to Cramer’s competence, client trust accounts, billing for legal work, and false representations made to the court.
In one case, Cramer represented the estate of a recently deceased central Iowa man in a civil trial. Throughout the trial, the board alleges, Judge David Porter attempted to guide Cramer in laying the foundation for exhibits and testimony, and at one point adjourned court for one day so Cramer could better prepare for the proceedings.
During the trial, Cramer allegedly admitted to Porter she did not fully understand certain court rules and didn’t understand certain legal issues surrounding a surprise witness she intended to call. At the time, Porter cautioned Cramer that her actions came “dangerously close to trial by ambush.”
Later, Cramer expressed frustration with her inability admit certain pieces of evidence, to which Porter responded, “While I certainly appreciate that you are struggling to see how you can admit any evidence, it’s not as though that was unforeseeable. It was entirely foreseeable … You are a licensed attorney who is representing a client at this point, and it’s your responsibility, not mine, to explain to you how you get evidence in.”
The court ultimately entered a $110,000 judgment against Cramer’s client in that case, according to court records.
Allegations of overbilling for legal work
The disciplinary board has also questioned numerous legal fees Cramer charged to the estate involved in that case, noting that she claimed to have spent several hours preparing and filing a series of single-page Iowa State Bar Association forms; to have spent almost half an hour reading a form that consisted of a single sentence; and to have spent 1.25 hours reading a single-paragraph motion.
“Cramer knowingly misrepresented in her billing statements that she spent time filing documents,” the board alleges.
At a hearing on Cramer’s requests for payment of the fees, a probate judge remarked, “Honestly, I am horrified by this billing situation, and I don’t say that lightly. I really don’t. This was a simple estate. With one complicated matter.”
Cramer later filed an amended billing statement, adding and omitting certain expenses, changing the dates and descriptions of certain tasks and billing for work performed by an assistant at the rate of $95 per hour, the board alleges.
The probate judge later denied Cramer’s request for fees above and beyond the ordinary. In one court order, the judge stated that “Ms. Cramer’s filings in this matter are extremely troubling, and the court finds that Ms. Cramer’s claims related to the funds held by her law firm in regard to this estate lack nearly any credibility. The court does not make this finding lightly or accuse counsel of misconduct without good cause.”
Cramer alleges judge was ‘very nasty’
Cramer filed an appeal in the case. In her appeal, Cramer referenced herself as “the estate attorney” and asserted that Judge Porter had been “very nasty” toward her during the civil trial.
“At the beginning of the trial, the judge was angrily yelling and scowling at the administrator and the estate attorney,” Cramer alleged. “The estate attorney has PTSD and this yelling and scowling scared her … It was the most unfair trial the estate attorney has ever witnessed.”
Cramer claimed Porter’s “raging and screaming” triggered her post-traumatic stress disorder and left her terrified. She also claimed Porter later “had his court reporter change the transcript” of the proceedings. “The court reporter was probably afraid of losing her job if the judge gets mad,” Cramer alleged.
As part of the appeal, Cramer also accused Judge Katie Ranes, who handled the probate case related to the estate, of improperly filing an ethics complaint against her, asking “Is this honest? Is this retaliation for the appeal?”
“Cramer’s statements regarding Judge Porter’s conduct were knowing misrepresentations or were made with reckless disregard as to their truth,” the disciplinary board alleges. The board also alleges Cramer falsely accused Ranes of telling Cramer’s client she should fire Cramer.
In one of her court filings, Cramer argues that in addition to Porter, other judges have had their court reporters alter transcripts of court proceedings and “no one will do anything. The court reporters are afraid of the judges. And myself, the attorney who is objecting, looks like a crazy person and my clients suffer. Is this the new justice in Polk County, Iowa?”
Commission cites competency issues, overbilling
In December 2024 and January 2025, the Grievance Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court presided over a hearing on the disciplinary board’s charges against Cramer.
With regard to the trial involving the estate, the commission found that Cramer had “demonstrated a significant lack of expertise, experience, and knowledge in litigation and trial practice.” The commission noted that even though the case was being decided by a judge and not a jury, Cramer had filed jury instructions in the case — instructions the commission said “would have been woefully inadequate if it were a jury trial.”










These were not errors or miscalculations. These were attempts to mislead the court in order to collect an inflated amount of fees.


– Grievance Commission of the Iowa Supreme Court, referring to alleged overbilling by Valerie Cramer


The commission also concluded that Cramer “did not understand fundamental issues relating to evidentiary rules” and “did not understand basic issues, such as authentication, foundation, hearsay, offers of proof to preserve issues for appeal, the timely disclosure of potential witnesses, or the consequences of having failed to disclose evidence.” Judge Porter, the commission found, “had to explain basic concepts of relevance” to Cramer.
As for the legal fees Cramer charged in the probate case, the commission concluded that she “engaged in egregious overbilling” by billing her client “highly inflated amounts for certain tasks” and by “double-billing and triple-billing” for some legal work. She also “billed for work she did not do and for proceedings that either did not occur or which she did not attend,” the commission stated.
“These were not errors or miscalculations,” the commission found. “These were attempts to mislead the court in order to collect an inflated amount of fees.”
Handling of teen’s case called ‘abhorrent’
The commission also concluded that it found Cramer’s claim that Porter and Ranes were dishonest and corrupt to be “very troubling,” noting that “there could not be more serious allegations against a judge.” Although Cramer “knew her allegations were false,” the commission stated, she claimed there was a “code of silence” among Iowa judges.
Cramer, the commission stated, “continued to allege this bizarre conspiracy theory even at the (disciplinary) hearing.” Her only motive, the commission said, appeared to be an effort “to cover up incompetence and fraudulent billing practices.”
The commission singled out Cramer’s actions in one particular probate case in which Cramer’s client was an 18-year-old woman administering the estate of the grandmother who had raised her.
The commission said it was “particularly bizarre” that Cramer refused to withdraw as the teen’s legal counsel, even after the young woman had hired a new attorney who appeared in court on her behalf.
Cramer “was going against her client’s wishes in order to pursue a self-serving agenda — collection of more attorneys’ fees,” the commission concluded. “When (Cramer) actively fought against her dismissal as counsel, her motive was a purely selfish one — her ongoing attempt to collect inflated fees.”
In that case, Cramer also failed to pursue a request for fees the teenager could have collected from the estate as its administrator — all so Cramer could “pursue her own attorneys’ fees with reckless abandon,” the commission concluded. Cramer also filed a small claims lawsuit against the teenager to collect additional fees, which the commission called “an attempt to intimidate and harass” her former client.
The commission called Cramer’s actions in that case “abhorrent” and “reprehensible,” adding that it was concerned that in her probate cases Cramer “was basically fleecing these limited estates of all their assets and leaving the beneficiaries with next to nothing.”
Commission: Corruption claims are ‘preposterous’ 
The commission noted that it had expected Cramer to appear at her disciplinary hearing and argue that her PTSD had contributed to her imagining that judges were conspiring against her.
“Unfortunately, quite the opposite occurred,” the commission stated. “At the hearing, (Cramer) doubled-down on most of her previously espoused bizarre conspiracy theories” and introduced medical opinions stating she was fit for duty as a lawyer.
As a result, the commission said, it had no choice but to conclude that Cramer’s “preposterous” conspiracy theories and her “disparagement of the judiciary and its staff, her lying to attorney colleagues, and her attacks against her clients were all done on purpose.”
In recommending that the Iowa Supreme Court revoke Cramer’s law license, the commission stated that should the court find such an action to be inappropriate, it recommends an alternative sanction of an indefinite license suspension with no possibility of reinstatement for three years.
Cramer is currently appealing the commission’s findings of fact and recommendations.

The proposed sale, worth $2.4 billion, was announced in January by Aquarion’s owner, Eversource, and is currently under review by the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority. 
In his comments on Friday, Tong echoed the concerns of other critics of the deal who have pointed to the higher rates paid by RWA customers along with the fact that publicly-owned utilities — unlike those held by for-profit companies — do not have their rates set by PURA. 
“This transaction is a costly loser for Connecticut families who simply cannot afford higher water bills right now,” Tong said in a statement. “This is about Eversource wanting to offload Aquarion because they didn’t get the multimillion-dollar rate hike they demanded. Don’t be confused by the complicated legal maneuvers. This is an end run around PURA to double bills, and it should be rejected.”
In filings made to PURA earlier this year, utility officials projected annual rate increases for Aquarion customers of between 6.5% and 8.35% over the next decade, followed by more modest increases in subsequent years. 
A spokesperson for the RWA referred comment on Friday to Eversource. 
In a joint statement issued on behalf of both entities, Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said that Tong’s claim that the deal would cause water rates to “double” was inaccurate. 
“Regardless of ownership, any future rate changes for local water customers will be a function of the costs of significant investments needed to meet federal and state environmental regulations, including remediation of forever chemicals in our water supply — an issue that Attorney General Tong and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have strongly supported for years,” Ratliff said. 
PURA held a series of evidentiary hearings on the proposed sale last month, and is expected to reach a final decision on the sale in mid-November.
The deal would create a new quasi-public, nonprofit entity, the Aquarion Water Authority, to take over the company’s existing service area based mostly in Fairfield and Litchfield counties. Together with the New Haven-based RWA, the two entities would serve more than one-third of all water customers in the state.
Proponents of the deal have argued that it would place the water utility under local control, resulting in greater long-term stability and efficiencies due to its relationship with the RWA.
Ratliff said that the utilities have presented an analysis to PURA showing that the sale would save customers money over the next decade under authority ownership due to reduced costs and access to lower interest rates.
“The RWA has a longstanding track record of strong performance and industry-leading reliability providing safe, high-quality drinking water to residents and businesses in the state thanks to its sound management and financial stewardship,” she said. 
In his letter sent to PURA on Friday, however, Tong criticized RWA’s governing structure — known as the Representative Policy Board — for its history of approving rate increases. In addition, he said it was “problematic” that the board has the power to appoint members of the Office of Consumer Affairs to advocate on behalf of water customers.
“This structure not only lacks actual independence, but it also fails to inspire confidence in consumers that their voices can be heard,” Tong said. 
If regulators do decide to approve the deal, Tong said that they should add stipulations preventing transaction costs from being passed along to ratepayers, along with reforms to the authority’s rate-making process. 
The sale itself was authorized as a result of a law passed during a special session last year that enabled the RWA to place a bid on Aquarion. 
After the proposed sale was announced earlier this year, two Republicans from Aquarion’s service territory attempted to repeal sections of that law to block the sale — though their effort was unsuccessful.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/saugatuck.jpg,,,2025-08-22 16:57:02.907670

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) will be back at its Providence headquarters on Monday, an agency spokesperson has confirmed. 
That’s because the building at 101 Friendship Street is no longer home to a pair of bats who briefly became tenants of the office’s second floor last week.
“Early this week, our pest control vendor’s wildlife experts searched the building carefully,” Barb Francella, a DCYF spokesperson, said in an email Friday afternoon. “They found neither any additional bats nor signs of bat activity.” 
A bat spotted on Thursday, Aug. 14, was captured that same day by pest control. A subsequent sighting of another bat on Sunday led to union pressure from SEIU Local 580, which represents roughly 300 of the 460 workers in the building. DCYF leadership decided to move to remote work arrangements on Monday morning, temporarily shuttering the Friendship Street office.
Francella said a contractor will be visiting the site Saturday to safeguard the building against further flying intruders.
“After a detailed inspection of the building and possible entry points, DCYF requested that the building landlord hire a contractor to block spots identified as probable entry points for a bat,” Francella said. 
The bats swooped in at an inopportune time, as SEIU members have recently urged the state not to renew DCYF’s lease due to recurring health and safety concerns with the building’s age and quality. The possibility that the bats might leave behind guano, or excrement, exacerbated union members’ concerns about air quality in the building. Guano can cause a typically mild, but sometimes severe, respiratory illness called histoplasmosis.  
Francella said in her email that the building has been treated to a deep clean.
“A professional cleaning staff performed an impact cleaning, including wiping down outside doors and walls around the doors; open spaces on horizontal surfaces; dusting of light fixtures, air diffusers and door frames; scouring and disinfecting bathroom fixtures; and washing trash receptacles and partitions on all floors,” Francella wrote.
Francella confirmed in a Wednesday email that the bat captured last Thursday, Aug. 14, tested negative for rabies at the state health department lab. According to the testing report, a Big Blue Bug Solutions technician retrieved the critter near the rafters in a second floor conference room. Although the bat was healthy, rabies testing requires brain tissue, so the animal was euthanized first.
The bat spotted on Sunday — the one that prompted office workers’ evacuation from the building — appears to have escaped. 
“Experts from the Rhode Island Department of Health and wildlife specialists believe the bat seen on Sunday night was the result of accidental entry and likely flew out of the building on its own,” Francella said.
Matthew Gunnip, the president of SEIU Local 580, said in a Friday email that the union “remains deeply concerned about the health and safety of our members working at the 101 Friendship Street office.”
Gunip alleged that DCYF had sent mixed messages to union workers about whether the building is safe to reenter. He shared pictures and information from one worker who arrived Thursday at the office and later reported eye irritation, rash and a headache. In an email to DCYF leadership, Gunnip claimed that the worker was told by a doctor she was “reacting to something she either inhaled or touched at the office today,” and was prescribed steroids and an antihistamine for treatment. Gunnip asked for a complete list of cleaning substances and chemicals used in the office this week.  










Early this week, our pest control vendor’s wildlife experts searched the building carefully. They found neither any additional bats nor signs of bat activity.

The State Properties Committee was set to consider and vote on a 10-year renewal of the office building’s lease on July 22. While the lease ends Nov. 30, the committee needed to approve the lease by the end of July. Union pushback led the panel to hit pause on the process while it awaited the results of an air quality test. The test would provide valuable data, committee members thought, since poor ventilation has been one of the most common complaints from union members. 
A week later, on July 29, the properties committee punted the deadline further down the road again, and proposed a public hearing be held so the panel could hear input from union members.
Department of Administration spokesperson Karen Greco confirmed in an email Friday that the public hearing has not yet been scheduled.
Staff members of Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office sit on the properties committee and expressed concern on July 29 that the lease renewal needs to be carefully considered given worker concerns. In a statement to Rhode Island Current earlier this week, Neronha himself echoed the want for a public hearing to give “adequate opportunity for input from those who work there every day” before the state puts fresh ink on the lease.
“When Rhode Island workers raise valid concerns about working conditions, we have an obligation to listen and act if necessary,” Neronha said. “We will be keeping a close eye on this situation and look forward to participating in the public hearing when it is scheduled.”

(Getty Images)The federal government has picked a side in an ongoing battle that has pitted West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey and the state health department against the state Board of Education over religious exemptions to the state’s school compulsory vaccination law.
In a letter dated Thursday, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights said West Virginia should accept religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccine requirements, siding in favor of an executive order from Morrisey.
The letter was addressed to health departments in the state that participate in the Vaccines for Children program, a federal program that provides vaccines for children whose parents cannot afford them. 
Officials warn that health departments that participate with VFC must comply with applicable state laws, including those that deal with religious or other exemptions. 
Morrisey’s executive order from January is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which states that “no state action may burden a person’s exercise of freedom of religion, unless doing so is essential and is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.” Morrisey argues that the state’s school vaccination law must be read alongside the religious freedom bill to allow religious exemptions. 
In the letter, federal health officials agreed. 
“West Virginia is a participant in the VCP6 and receives $1.37 billion from the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services each year as the federal Medicaid contribution,” Paula Stannard, director of the Office for Civil Rights, wrote. “Therefore, West Virginia is obligated to ensure that its [Vaccines for Children] providers comply with applicable state laws like EPRA, which requires recognition of religious exemptions from West Virginia’s Compulsory Vaccination Law.”
It’s unclear what weight the letter carries. Health departments do not enforce the state’s school vaccination law. 
A spokesperson for the HHS Office for Civil Rights told West Virginia Watch Friday that the letter “is not a notice of investigation, and it makes no finding on compliance.” 
In a statement Friday afternoon, the state Board of Education said the agency is aware of the letter, but noted it was not addressed to the board. The letter has no impact on the board’s position that the current compulsory school immunization law does not contain a religious exemption, the statement says.
“The WVBE will stay the course in its pursuit of legal relief from the West Virginia Supreme Court regarding compulsory immunizations and religious exemptions,” the statement said. “This Board will continue to uphold its duties as outlined in the West Virginia Constitution and laws as established by the West Virginia Legislature.”
In a news release Friday, West Virginians for Health Freedom praised the letter, calling it a formal confirmation that the state must allow religious exemptions. 
“We appreciate [HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.] and the Trump administration’s attention to this matter,” Dr. Chanda Adkins, president of West Virginians for Health Freedom, said in the news release. “The recognition of religious exemptions is a fundamental cornerstone of the religious liberty upon which our nation was built. Yet, many West Virginia children have recently been unjustly denied access to the free public education guaranteed to them. We are hopeful that this letter from the Office for Civil Rights will reaffirm and protect the rights of conscience for families across our state moving forward.”
The group urged families who believe their religious rights are being violated to file a complaint with the HHS Office for Civil Rights. 
The state Department of Health did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. 
The state Board of Education and the state Department of Health have been at odds over the vaccination law and Morrisey’s executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions to the state’s vaccination laws. 
West Virginia has some of the strongest school vaccination requirements in the country. It’s been one of five states that have not allowed religious exemptions for the shots. Morrisey issued the executive order requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office.
Despite the Legislature rejecting a bill that would put the exemptions in state code, Morrisey has not rescinded his order.
The state Board of Education has instructed county school boards not to accept religious exemptions. A Raleigh County circuit judge last month ruled in favor of three families who sued the school board for not allowing them to attend school with a religious exemption. The preliminary ruling was limited to allowing only those students to enter school. 
Meanwhile the Board of Education has filed notice that it plans to appeal to the state Supreme Court over the Raleigh County ruling. 
In a separate lawsuit, two parents of immunocompromised children are suing the West Virginia Department of Health in Kanawha County Circuit Court for granting religious exemptions. The families are represented by the ACLU of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice. 
Earlier this week, state Attorney General J.B. McCuskey filed a motion asking for the two cases to be consolidated and considered together.

(Screenshot from Newport Police Department body camera recording)A Rhode Island state prosecutor recorded on body camera footage telling Newport police officers they were going to regret arresting her will be placed on unpaid leave, the Attorney General’s office confirmed Friday.
Special Assistant Attorney General Devon Hogan Flanagan will begin her unpaid suspension starting Monday, pending a review of her Aug. 14 arrest outside the Clarke Cooke House on a misdemeanor charge of trespassing.
It’s still undetermined how long the review will take and how long Flanagan will be off the job, Timothy Rondeau, spokesman for Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office, said.
Police say Flanagan, 34, had refused to leave the Bannister’s Wharf restaurant and bar with a friend after officers responded there around 10 p.m.
She is scheduled to be arraigned in Newport District Court before Judge J. Terence Houlihan Jr. on Wednesday, Aug. 27, according to online records. She had been on paid leave from her $112,920-a-year job since the incident, Rondeau said.
Video by police body cameras shows Flanagan arguing with officers and repeatedly saying, “I’m an AG.” The video went viral, with 772,000 views as of Friday afternoon after NBC10 WJAR posted it Aug. 18 on its YouTube page.
“You’re arresting an AG,” Flanagan said as she entered a police cruiser. “You’re going to regret this.”
During the recorded interaction, Hogan repeatedly asks officers to turn off their body cameras, insisting it’s required under state policy.
“Protocol is that you turn it off,” she told officers. “It’s a citizen’s request that you turn it off.”
But the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association said Flanagan was incorrect about the regulation adopted by the AG’s office in 2022. Association President Thomas Oates III, chief of police for the city of Woonsocket, said state policy allows officers to turn off their cameras when speaking to a witness or a victim of a crime.
“The policy does not allow for an officer to turn off their camera at the request of a suspect,” Association President Thomas Oates, chief of police for the city of Woonsocket, said in a statement.
Newport police follow a similar body camera policy, which bars recording if a witness or victim asks not to be filmed and the situation isn’t confrontational. The policy also notes that consent to record is not required.
In an interview with WPRO’s Gene Valicenti on Tuesday, Attorney General Peter Neronha called Flanagan’s conduct “inexcusable” but said she appeared remorseful when they spoke after her arrest.
“Look, she’s put me in a bad position, she’s embarrassed herself, humiliated herself, treated the Newport Police Department horribly,” Neronha said. “She’ll take responsibility for her conduct, and then we’ll go from there.”
Neronha added that there would be a “strong sanction” for Flanagan’s conduct.
“I have the responsibility to protect the office, obviously, and the work,” he said.
Such a response was not enough for Rhode Island GOP Chairman Joe Powers, who blasted Neronha in a statement issued Wednesday.
“Isn’t it the Democrats who constantly cackle, ‘No one is above the law’? Well, now it’s time for them to put up or shut up,” Powers said. “If they truly believe their own rhetoric, this assistant AG should be fired immediately.”
Rhode Island Current reached out for comment to Clarke Cooke House, where an employee referred the inquiry to a Bannister’s Wharf representative, who declined to comment.
Flanagan’s LinkedIn profile has been taken down. She worked for the AG’s office since 2018 and was assigned to the appellate unit of the criminal division, Rondeau confirmed.

Rural residents will be hardest hit by looming health insurance premium increases, according to a new report.  (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)A combination of Trump administration policies will make health care coverage more expensive for people who purchase plans from health insurance marketplaces — and rural residents will be hit the hardest, according to a new analysis.
Researchers from the Century Foundation say Trump administration policies — especially its refusal to ask Congress to extend Biden-era tax credits that are set to expire at the end of this year — will boost out-of-pocket premiums by 93% in the 32 states that allow the federal government to operate their Affordable Care Act insurance marketplaces. New rules and tariffs will have a smaller impact.
Rural county residents in those states will see an increase of 107%, while residents of urban counties will pay 89% more, according to the analysis by the Century Foundation, a left-leaning research nonprofit.
Insurers participating in the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are proposing a median premium increase of 18% for 2026 — the biggest jump since 2018 and 11 points more than the growth from 2024 to this year. That bump would come on top of the increase resulting from the expiration of the tax credits and the other policy changes.
About 2.8 million people who are enrolled in marketplace plans in the 32 states live in rural counties, including 776,000 adults between the ages of 55 to 64 and more than 223,000 children, according to the Century Foundation.
“Rural residents tend to be older. They may be more likely to have chronic illness at the same time,” said Jeanne Lambrew, director of health care reform at the foundation. “It costs more, both because they have somewhat greater needs and less access to health care.”
Millions will see rise in health insurance premiums if federal subsidies expire

The researchers calculated that average annual premiums for rural residents will increase by $760 — 28% more than the expected average increase for urban residents. States where rural enrollees are expected to see the highest cost increases are Wyoming ($1,943), Alaska ($1,835), and Illinois ($1,700).
Many of the states with a large number of rural residents have chosen not to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, meaning many people who earn between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty level, between $15,650 and $21,597 for an individual, get their coverage from an insurance marketplace, Lambrew said.
Of the seven states where 10% or more of rural residents are enrolled in marketplace plans (Alabama, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Wyoming), only two — Nebraska and North Carolina — have expanded Medicaid.
State officials in Pennsylvania recently advised residents who use the marketplace that they should closely examine the plans that are available.
“This year, even more than previous years, Pennsylvanians should consider shopping around to find the best plans to meet their individual needs, at a price that makes sense for their current financial situation,” Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys said in a statement released at the beginning of this month.
Lambrew said the increases will force many people to forgo insurance altogether.
“It’s harmful for those individuals in terms of their own health and life expectancy. It’s harmful for our providers, because they’re now dealing with people who are sicker and in the wrong settings, and it’s kind of expensive for our society,” Lambrew said.
“We know health insurance matters, so having these large potential increases on uninsured Americans is distressing.”

(USACE)Wetlands in the New Orleans area harmed by the now defunct Mississippi River Gulf Outlet are a step closer to getting a much-needed restoration, though officials have yet to secure the money needed for the extensive work. 
Gordy Dove, Coastal Restoration and Protection Authority chairman, and Col. Scotty Autin, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers New Orleans district, kicked off the official design phase for restoration efforts. The project will include marsh creation, shoreline repairs and flood protection upgrades “as soon as funding becomes available,” Autin said in a CPRA news release. 
The CPRA has set aside funding for data collection before the start of engineering and design work on top priority projects, while the Army Corps is responsible for securing federal dollars for construction. 
Top priorities include building protection along Lake Borgne between Alligator Point and the Rigolets to restore storm resilience for coastal communities. The project also looks to add more than 35 miles of new shoreline and protection from Bayou Dupre around Proctor Point, from Lake Pontchartrain to Bayou Chevee, and along the southeast shore of Lake Borgne.  
The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet was first opened in the 1960s as an alternate shipping channel for interstate coastal commerce. It heavily affected wetlands around Orleans and St. Bernard parishes with saltwater intrusion and erosion, most notably during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. MRGO provided a funnel for storm surge that compromised levees, resulting in catastrophic flooding in the Lower 9th Ward neighborhood  
Congress authorized the Army Corps to restore the ecosystem and damaged habitat in the affected areas in 2007 in the Water Resources Development Act. 
“Today’s signing marks a long-awaited step forward,” CPRA executive director Michael Hare said in a news release. “The communities impacted by the MRGO have endured decades of damage. Now it’s time to get to work protecting our coast and restoring vital ecosystems.”
Design will follow directives laid out in the hundreds of pages that make up the Army Corps ecosystem restoration feasibility report, finished in 2012. The report calls for oyster reef restoration, shoreline protection and various wetland revitalization efforts. 
“This agreement marks a major step forward in restoring areas that have suffered from erosion, saltwater intrusion, and storm damage tied to the MRGO for far too long,” Dove said. “We are grateful for our strong partnership with the Corps and the federal commitment to fully fund this work.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-22-at-3.06.41 PM-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-08-22 16:57:02.907670

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
In a flurry of filings, state and nonprofit organizations have asked federal courts to dismiss lawsuits brought against Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act, a first of its kind law demanding fossil fuel companies pay for their pollution.
Those lawsuits, filed by the federal government, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute, a lobby for oil companies, and 24 red states led by West Virginia, claim the Vermont law interferes with federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and punishes fossil fuel companies while raising costs to consumers. 
Last week, Vermont filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuits. The state argued the act does not conflict with federal law, regulate fossil fuel emissions or punish fossil fuel producers. Rather, it will look at the costs to the state of companies burning fossil fuels and will allocate a portion of those costs to those companies to help the state finance adaptation efforts under climate change.
The White House, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the West Virginia attorney general’s office did not respond to a request for comment by the time of publication. The American Petroleum Institute directed VTDigger to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce because the group is the lead litigant in the case, according to spokesperson Justin Prendergast.

The international scientific community overwhelmingly agrees that climate change is largely caused by the burning of fossil fuels. The warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and can produce more rain in shorter, heavier bursts, and a warmer ocean can fuel stronger hurricanes. Those conditions can lead to more flooding, like those that inundated Vermont in 2023 and 2024, and again in July 2025. Hotter temperatures can also cause more extreme wildfires, contributing to human health risks in far flung places, like the wildfire smoke that hung over the state this summer. 
“Our community has been enormously impacted by the climate crisis,” said Grace Oedel, executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, an organization that supports sustainable agriculture, in a statement issued Friday. “This law helps Vermonters deal with the fallout by funding critical climate adaptation projects, and we are committed to defending this law that will help so many of our farmers and community members navigate these extreme challenges.”
Along with the Conservation Law Foundation, an advocacy group based in New England, Oedel’s group backed up the state by asking federal courts to dismiss the lawsuits Friday. The pair of nonprofits were granted the legal authority to intervene in the lawsuits earlier this summer. The Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental group focused on legal action, is providing support for their work through its attorneys. 
“Let’s be clear: this law is not a sweeping effort to regulate global greenhouse gas emissions,
punish fossil fuel companies, or set federal policy on climate change,” Kate Sinding Daly,
senior vice president for law and policy at the Conservation Law Foundation, said in a statement. 
The Climate Superfund Act imposes a one-time payment on fossil fuel companies for their emissions between 1995 and 2024. The model is called “polluter pays” and empowers the state to demand payment from polluting companies whose extraction or refining of fossil fuels caused at least one billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions over the last two decades. It’s based on science that connects the increase in greenhouse gas emissions to specific events like the increase in temperatures over time, or a disaster like a hurricane or a flood. 
A group of nine economists made an additional filing Thursday arguing the lawsuits didn’t properly reflect the impact of the law. Not a party to any lawsuit, they are academics who study how government policies affect markets and well-being. They include professors who have taught at Columbia, Princeton, Stanford, Yale, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California-Berkeley. One was the former chief economist of the World Bank, another co-founded the social entrepreneurship center at Middlebury College, and a third chairs the economics department at the University of Vermont.
The group submitted an amicus brief, a legal document that provides additional information to help courts make decisions. They argued the one-time fee on fossil fuel companies demanded by the law wouldn’t impact states or consumers. 
That’s because those “fixed costs” are based on past pollution, the economists argued. The potential fee doesn’t impact the costs of future production, or how the companies choose to shift those current or future costs onto customers, they said.
Such a law is different from one that concerns future emissions, like a carbon tax applied to oil companies for every barrel of oil produced, or a liability case that asks an oil company to stop activities that contribute to climate change, the economists wrote. In their arguments against the superfund law, plaintiffs alleged economic harm to the tune of “hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars,” but the economists say this is “implausible.” 
“Based on recent performance, such payments are unlikely to threaten these companies, given that the one-time payments may represent only a fraction of a liable company’s profits for a single year,” the brief states. 
While the state and federal backlash against the law came just months after President Donald Trump took office, the timeline for demanding payment from fossil fuel companies is still years away. The state treasurer’s office isn’t required to submit a cost report until January 2027. Rules for determining costs will be filed in January 2028, and the state plans to issue final cost recovery demands to oil giants by July 1, 2028. 
The Department of Justice argued in its suit that Vermont is attempting to “usurp the power of the federal government by regulating the national and global emissions of greenhouse gases.” 
That lawsuit comes as the federal government simultaneously tries to rid itself of such regulations by rolling back emissions standards and attempting to overturn the “endangerment finding” that determined in 2009 that greenhouse gases threatened public health.

(Photo by U.S. District Court of Montana)A campaign treasurer and compliance officer who worked for Democratic candidates and progressive-aligned political committees pled guilty to three counts of wire fraud in a scheme that embezzled more than a quarter of a million dollars from victims.
The Montana U.S. Attorney’s office charged Abbey Lee Cook, of Helena, with three counts of wire fraud for allegedly obtaining money and property “by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises,”  and transferred them into accounts controlled by herself and through her business Abbey Lee Cook and Associates, LLC between September 2021 and November 2024.
Each count of wire fraud carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine and three years of supervised release. 
However, according to a plea agreement Cook reached with the U.S. Attorney’s office, the federal government will recommend a “low-end guideline sentence” and will not recommend jail time. Cook also agreed to pay $253,000 in restitution to the victims. 
Calls and messages to Cook and her legal representatives were not returned by publication time. 
Cook worked as treasurer for numerous Democratic campaigns during the 2024 election cycle, and also provided contract financial and compliance services for candidates and political committees. In some of her roles, she had access and control of bank accounts for the various individuals and entities she worked for.
According to court filings, Cook defrauded six unnamed victims out of a total $253,059.

Cook “embezzled funds from various individuals and entities that employed her by fraudulently transferring money for personal expenses, in whole and in part, none of which were authorized. Moreover, the total amount of money that Cook transferred from these candidates and entities was not accurately contained on her filings with COPP despite the requirement to do so.”
While the victims in the federal case are anonymous, financial filings with the Commissioner of Political Practice show Cook is recorded as having worked for the following candidates and committees in recent years: Rep. Zooey Zephyr, D-Missoula; Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman; Jeremiah Lynch, who ran for the Montana State Supreme Court; Ben Alke, the Democratic candidate for Attorney General; Montana Senior Vote Action Fund; Planned Parenthood Advocates of Montana; Montana Conservation Voters Action Fund; Montanans for Election Reform Action Fund; the Montana Democratic Party and Carol’s List.
Zephyr and Neumann confirmed they will be filing formal complaints with COPP regarding Cook’s actions while working as their campaign treasurer. 
“With the federal case still pending, I don’t want to comment at this time,” Neumann said via text message on Thursday. “Based on Abbey’s conduct while she was treasurer for my campaign, I will be filing a formal complaint with COPP. What I can share beyond that is I was the one who raised the red flag.”
During Zephyr’s first campaign for the Legislature in 2022, she served as her own treasurer, but brought on Cook during the most recent election cycle. She told the Daily Montanan that Cook was recommended by other members of the party. 
During 2024, Neumann had noted discrepancies in financial filings and alerted Zephyr, who was also working with Cook. 
“What I would say is now that the federal indictment is out, I will be making a formal complaint against Ms. Cook to the COPP,” Zephyr told the Daily Montanan. “While I do not know every victim of Ms. Cook, I know that there were several. I knew that we were working with FBI to make sure they had everything they needed.”
Zephyr told the Daily Montanan she believes her campaign is one of the victims listed in the federal documents. 
The listed victims range from having $1,600 to $88,209 defrauded by Cook’s scheme, though the actual amount Cook personally received is unknown. 
The U.S. attorney’s filing lists the three counts of wire fraud specifically applied to two victims’ accounts — a $3,000 and $15,000 transfer from one, and a $3,000 transfer from another.  
COPP Commissioner Chris Gallus told the Daily Montanan that as of Friday, one complaint from Neumann been filed against Cook this week. But he had experience meeting with Cook previously regarding communication issues with her compliance work and filing reports with the Commission.
Once complaints are filed, Gallus said the commission will investigate them and if found sufficient, can refer violations to the county attorney or prosecute them as commissioner. Violations of COPP reporting provision can lead to a fine of $500 or three times the amount of unlawful action, according to Montana Code. 
“We’ll always apply facts to the law and take the approach that’s fair and vindicates the citizens of Montana and protects their interests,” Gallus said. “If a complaint reveals (contributions) were not used for the purposes intended, we’re going to pursue them vigorously and get to the bottom of that.”
One of Cook’s confirmed victims was the Montana Senior Vote Action Fund, which is overseen by the advocacy group Big Sky 55+, though the two groups have separate boards.
“On August 14th of last year, Abbey Lee Cook took $18,000 from the Montana Senior Vote Action fund account without permission. Staff demanded it back as soon as it was discovered, a few days later. When it was clear it was not going to be returned, we terminated her contract and sent a demand letter to return it, which she never responded to,” Trent Bolger, Executive Director of Big Sky 55+ said in a statement. “There is a legal process that will play out in the future, and we hope that justice will be done.”
Another group that had issues with Cook was Montana Conservation Voters, which contracted with Cook to do financial compliance work for their Montana Outdoor Values Action Fund. 
According to interim Executive Director Renee Kelley, staff learned of alleged misfilings Cook had made to the Federal Election Commission in 2024. 
“There was no direct theft by Abbey Cook from what we discovered,” Kelley told the Daily Montanan. “What we did find is she lied to us about her work on our compliance reporting. Because of that, we immediately fired her.”
FEC filings show that Cook filed a quarterly report late, and then lied to committee staff claiming the website was experiencing technical issues. The political action committee was fined and paid a $12,372 penalty for the late filing.
“This has been a gross betrayal of the hard work and mission-driven principles of our organization. We believe the actions of Abbey Lee Cook & Associates, LLC, should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. For our part, MCV immediately terminated our relationship with her when issues first came to light, and we have cooperated at every step with the relevant agencies to help bring her to justice,” Kelley said in a statement. 
Phone calls and emails to additional candidates and committee that worked with Cook, including Jeremiah Lynch and Ben Alke, were not returned by publication. 
A spokesperson for the Montana Democratic Party said there were no irregularities in the contracted work done for the party in 2023 and MDP was not involved in the FBI’s investigation. 
Montana Wild’s executive director told the Daily Montanan Cook briefly did contract work for their political committee in 2022, and there were no issues with her work then. 
Cook’s arraignment and change of plea hearing is scheduled for Sept. 9 in the federal courthouse in Great Falls. 
Cook worked as a legislative aide in Montana during the 2015 session, according to her LinkedIn page, and with the Greater Yellowstone Coalition for several months in 2015 and 2016.
From 2017 through 2020, she worked for the campaign of former Democratic U.S. Rep. Max Rose in New York’s 11th District. 
In 2023 she moved to Helena and, with her husband, reopened The Windsor Ballroom, an event space on Last Chance Gulch, according to an Independent Record article. 
The Windsor was used by many political entities, including the Montana Democrats, for hosting events and fundraisers.
This article has been updated to reflect that a complaint against Cook has been officially filed with COPP.

(Photo Andrew Kitchenman/Alaska Beacon)I am leaving the Alaska Beacon on Friday, after serving as its editor for three years, to pursue a new opportunity in Philadelphia. I leave with a strong sense that Alaska – and this outlet – can have a bright future. 
I flew to Juneau on Jan. 17, 2016, two nights before the start of the legislative session, with little but the clothes on my back and in my bags. I was starting work in what I consider one of the best journalism jobs in the country, the state government reporter for the state’s public media outlets. KTOO and Alaska Public Media gave me a chance after I spent 16 years at news outlets — and all of my life until then — on the East Coast.
It was an eventful time to become a political reporter in Alaska: The collapse of oil prices in October 2014 had left the state budget reeling, and the coming legislative session was the first to fully grapple with that fact. The top priority for then-Gov. Bill Walker was to pass a long-term plan to balance what the state spends with what it brings in. Alaskans were passionate about the debate’s outcome.
I immersed myself in oil economics, the governance of the U.S.’s largest sovereign wealth fund and methods to find the sun in the winterlong shadows Mounts Juneau and Roberts cast over downtown Juneau. 
I had been part of one of the country’s largest capital press corps in Trenton, New Jersey, but I was deeply impressed with the smaller but mighty group covering the Alaska Legislature. 
And Alaskans responded to our reporting. I repeatedly had the experience of people who I had never previously met thanking me on the street for my work – once when a driver stopped their car alongside me as I walked down Juneau’s Main Street. I doubt many public radio reporters have similar experiences outside of Alaska. 
The reporting news outlets did in Juneau had an immediate effect on the conversations Alaskans had with their elected officials. Compared with New Jersey, Alaska political parties play a much smaller role in mediating between legislators and constituents. When lawmakers hear someone call in during public testimony from a community they represent, they visibly perk up. This isn’t always the case elsewhere. And this responsiveness is apparent in the access many public officials give to reporters, knowing constituents will read or listen to their reporting. 
The budget crisis wasn’t resolved in 2016. Or in 2017. Or, really, in any year since. Alaskans are genuinely conflicted over how to prioritize their support for government services including public education; the long-term future of the Alaska Permanent Fund; the size of the Permanent Fund dividend; and opposition to new taxes. 
While Alaskans have been conflicted over state policy, they have not lacked access to information about it. Public radio in the state has been uniquely strong, serving small communities with dedicated journalists. The state’s newspapers, from the Anchorage Daily News to the Nome Nugget, are models of what reporters can still do even within economic constraints. 
After covering nearly seven full legislative sessions and several special sessions for public radio, TV and websites, I received a second and equally exciting opportunity in Alaska journalism. The national nonprofit States Newsroom hired me as the first editor of the Beacon. 
And since May 11, 2022, the Alaska Beacon has been welcomed by Alaskans as a news source, with the mission of connecting the state’s residents with their state government. 
While the Beacon is going strong, it’s a troubled time for Alaska’s news media. The federal support that’s been an underpinning of public radio and TV has ended. Many Alaskans have stepped forward to support public media, but the scope of the dilemma is vast. I’m deeply concerned about the future of my former colleagues serving Alaska communities. 
Part of what is so important about news organizations is that they are much larger than one journalist. When Alaskans support the Beacon – or become public media members or newspaper subscribers – they’re investing in a sustainable free press as a bulwark of democracy. 
I’ve told my three co-workers – Corinne Smith, James Brooks and Yereth Rosen – that the Alaska Beacon’s future is brighter than its past. And I believe this because of the support Alaskans have offered since the launch. Please consider the value the Beacon brings to Alaska and make a donation. Readers’ support makes it possible that the Beacon will cover the state government without fear or favor, and inform Alaskans about the state’s economy and environment; education; health; and criminal and social justice long into the future.
Nine and a half years after I arrived amid a budget crisis, Alaskans are still weighing the direction of their state. I leave Alaska with a sense that it can overcome its challenges. That’s because I’ve gotten to know Alaskans — risk-taking, open, strengthened by communities built over more than 10,000 years — in a way that is difficult in less vast but more populous states. I continue to love Alaska and am eager to see what Alaskans make of the state’s future. 
Thank you to everyone who’s given me time since 2016. I look forward to seeing some of you the next time I visit.

Public services are worth paying for, residents told lawmakers who are considering additional tax reform. 
The post Homeowners urge Wyoming lawmakers to skip further property tax cuts appeared first on WyoFile .","Having lived in Wyoming for most of her life, Casper resident Laurie Longtine described to lawmakers Thursday the many ways public services have shaped her lived experiences. 
The Natrona County Library, for one, is a place Longtine said she’s visited since she was a young child. She can remember watching county fair parades from its steps. 
After she graduated from Natrona County High School, Longtine said she earned degrees from Casper College and the University of Wyoming. 
These days, Longtine often walks the city’s pathway system, which could be glimpsed from the Basko Building where the Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee was meeting. 
“And now that I have a little more gray in my hair, I’m a regular person who goes and uses my senior center,” she said.  
Longtine was one of about two dozen homeowners who attended the meeting Thursday to urge lawmakers against further property tax reductions. She and others worry those reductions will lead to a further decline in the tax revenue that pays for local services.
“Property tax is how we pay for the things we value,” Longtine said. “It is a responsibility we accept as part of being a caring member of our communities. It is a part of how we take care of each other.” 
Not far from the center is Highland Cemetery, where Longtine said her nephews are buried. 
“Their graves are maintained by property tax dollars,” she said.

Property taxes fund public services. After lawmakers voted to cut residential property taxes by 25% earlier this year, local governments across the state have been cutting services in the face of reduced revenue. 
Casper, for example, made up for the loss of $1.8 million by cutting seasonal park staff in half, leaving four full-time positions unfunded and reducing irrigation, fertilization, snow removal and other parks and trails maintenance. 
Since the Joint Revenue Committee made property tax issues its top priority ahead of the 2026 session, lawmakers are now considering more drastic measures including overhauling how homes are valued and abolishing property taxes altogether in favor of raising other taxes. 
But some who spoke Thursday advised against more dramatic measures. 
“I urge you, please, be responsible, be boring,” Lisa Jamieson, a Casper homeowner, told the committee. 
“Don’t defund and destroy our institutions. I think what’s important to people like me is, I would like for our communities to remain nice places to live, and I’m willing to pay taxes to keep that going,” Jamieson said. 
Different opinions
Local government officials — from sheriffs and firefighters to community college and special district representatives — warned lawmakers about the consequences of blanket property tax cuts. 
That kind of opposition makes sense, Nate Martin told the committee Thursday. 
“They’re the ones who spend the money,” said Martin, executive director of Better Wyoming, a community organizing group. 
“The people I have with me today … are not people who have day jobs that spend property tax revenue,” Martin said. “They’re homeowners. They’re taxpayers. They’re voters.” 
Alongside the meeting attendees, about 240 more Wyomingites emailed the committee, Martin told WyoFile. 
It was an unusual development for a committee that has historically heard support for property tax cuts from homeowners. 
“I am appreciative for listening to your opinion. It’s an opposite side of an opinion, for example, that I typically hear at the door, which is, ‘Our property taxes skyrocketed, and I’m worried about losing my home,” committee co-chairman Rep. Tony Locke, R-Casper, said. “But both sides of the conversation have to be heard.”
How we got here 
It was surging home prices that first sparked the Legislature’s recent interest in property tax reform. And after lawmakers took a cautious approach in the 2023 session, residents demanded further action, contending they otherwise risked losing their homes. 
Since then, a slate of bills have made it into law.
“And then something shifted,” Martin told the committee. “It seems that politicians figured out that they could use property tax cuts as a campaign issue and sell it to voters as free money with no consequences.”

Committee co-chairman Sen. Troy McKeown, R-Gillette, pushed back. 
“I kind of took offense to one comment made that the only reason we cut property taxes to get elected and we’re dishonest and crooked,” McKeown said. “I would challenge any of you to run for the Legislature and come tackle this monster. You treat us like we don’t care, but I’m telling you, we do. And we’re not looking at tax cuts, we’re looking at changing it the way it’s done.”
In June, the committee voted to draft a bill to eliminate property taxes altogether after lawmakers created a confusing web of exemptions. If passed by the full Legislature and approved by voters, the proposal would eliminate all property taxes — residential, commercial, industrial and personal — which accounted for the largest tax stream in Wyoming in the 2024 tax year at $2 billion. To account for such a revenue loss, lawmakers floated raising sales tax. 
Economists often characterize sales taxes as regressive because people with lower incomes spend a larger percentage of their income on goods that are subject to such a tax. 
The committee is also considering changes to exemptions already on the books. One draft bill would eliminate the eight-month residency requirement for one exemption, a second would remove the sunset date for another. 
One thing the committee has not done, however, “has looked at who’s paying which taxes in the state,” Jackson Democrat Rep. Liz Storer said at the meeting. 
“When we talk about what we did in June, the idea of getting rid of property taxes and instituting a sales tax, we really do need — and I would encourage all of us — to look at what that means for who’s paying those taxes,” Storer said. “I think that is a significant shift from the upper class to the lower class.” 
The average cost of a house in Wyoming is around $400,000, Storer said, which means the average homeowner is getting a $335 tax break thanks to the current exemptions. 
“But a property that’s over $10 million is getting a tax break of over $13,000 when you look at the combined exemptions that we have passed in the last two years,” Storer said. “So please do understand who’s paying what taxes and who’s really getting a break.” 
At publishing time, the committee was set to continue its property tax discussion late Friday afternoon with the expectation that consideration of some bills would be delayed to its November meeting.

Article Summary

The regional Methodist Church conference in central and southern Illinois has purchased billboard space where a Proud Boys billboard once stood.
The church’s message is designed to promote love and tolerance instead of hate and division.
A recruiting billboard for the Proud Boys extremist group was removed this week following a public outcry in Clinton County.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

BREESE, Ill. — In response to the uproar over a Proud Boys message displayed on a billboard near Central Community High School, the United Methodist Church has a simple message: “Hate Divides, Love Unites.”
The church purchased billboard space in the same location as the Proud Boys sign, which was removed this week. It paid $2,100 for the next four months.
“It’s part of our ministry,” said Paul Black, director of communication ministries for the Springfield-based Illinois Great Rivers Conference, which represents 650 United Methodist congregations and about 100,000 members across central and southern Illinois. “One of the focuses for the denomination is eradicating racism, and when you read about this group, there’s no doubt there’s cause for concern.”

The Proud Boys sign, which went up late last week and came down Tuesday, stood along Old U.S. Route 50 and St. Rose Road, about 1,000 feet from the school’s entrance. It appeared to be a recruiting tool for the group, listing a local phone number that went to a full voicemail and featuring its logo alongside the slogan: “Faith, Family, Freedom, Brotherhood.”
The Proud Boys have been designated a hate or extremist group by organizations including the Southern Poverty Law Center and were tied to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.
Lamar Advertising, which manages the billboard’s ad space, declined to say who purchased the Proud Boys message. The company removed it after a Clinton County Board meeting Monday night where dozens of residents spoke against the sign, and the board unanimously passed a non-binding resolution denouncing hate.
Bucky Miller, of Aviston, who helped organize community turnout for the board meeting, said he was relieved to hear about the Methodist sign. He and his wife, Laura Thoman, are raising two children, ages 6 and 4, and they were particularly disturbed by the sign’s placement near a school.
The new message, he said, “embodies what our community and Clinton County as a whole is all about.”
Black said the design for the new billboard comes from a campaign first launched by the Missouri Conference of the United Methodist Church. The campaign began after a private citizen erected a similar sign near a Confederate flag flying along a busy road at the Lake of the Ozarks. The church eventually took over funding for that billboard and has since expanded the effort, putting up signs in several locations throughout the state.
Kim Jenne, director of connectional ministries for the Missouri Conference, said other Methodist conferences across the country, including in Ohio and North Carolina, have also adopted the “Hate Divides, Love Unites” message in places where local communities have reported extremist activity, though she was not aware of any other Proud Boys billboards.

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation to a prison in El Salvador brought widespread public scrutiny of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown tactics, was released from a rural Tennessee jail on Friday, four months after being detained while driving to his Maryland home.
Abrego is expected to be escorted back to Maryland by a private security firm and report for pretrial supervision, according to conditions sought by his attorneys approved by a federal magistrate in Nashville. He will also be under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which could choose to detain him. A Maryland court order requires he be given 72-hours notice if the government plans to send him to a “third country.”
Abrego, as the Tennessee court refers to him, was dispatched to El Salvador after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Maryland, where he has lived with his wife and children and works as an apprentice sheet metal worker. A government prosecutor later conceded his deportation was an error. Abrego, who entered the country illegally as a teen, was the subject of an immigration court order barring his removal to his home country of El Salvador, where he said he feared gang violence.

He was returned to Tennessee in June to face human smuggling charges that prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. Abrego was neither cited nor arrested when he was pulled over by Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with nine passengers in his vehicle. Prosecutors now allege the stop was part of a human smuggling operation in which Abrego was paid to transport immigrants illegally in the United States to points around the country.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

In her new role, Jenner will continue to lead the state's K-12 education department, as well. (Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Commission for Higher Education voted unanimously Friday to appoint Secretary of Education Katie Jenner as the next commissioner of higher education, further cementing Gov. Mike Braun’s plan to streamline oversight of education from kindergarten through college.
Jenner will assume the role Oct. 11, succeeding Chris Lowery, who is stepping down after more than three years in the position. She will simultaneously continue leading the Indiana Department of Education and serve in Braun’s cabinet.
“I’m just so thrilled to continue serving the state of Indiana and ensuring education across K-12 and higher education is as aligned as possible for our students, parents and families and our state ahead,” Jenner said after the vote, held in Indianapolis.
Commission leaders noted that existing higher education staff will remain in place, and that any structural changes would require legislative action.

Dan Peterson, the CHE board chair, said the move provides “continuity, clarity and consistency” across the state’s education vertical. 
“There’s so much interaction already between K-12 and higher ed, from dual credit to the college core to 21st Century Scholars,” Peterson said. “Those programs are only as effective as the ability of students and parents to really understand how to take advantage of those opportunities. So this move … makes a ton of sense.”
Lowery, who began preparing his transition “months ago,” praised the choice.
“Katie Jenner has been a good friend for more than a decade … this is someone whose life is devoted to education,” he told commissioners at the Friday meeting. He called the consolidation “a logical next step” after Braun created a more “unified” education structure in state government earlier this year.
Combining two roles
But not all commissioners were immediately comfortable with the merger of K-12 and higher education oversight. 
Board member Pepper Mulherin said she wasn’t yet sold on combining the two roles but ultimately voted yes.
“I love the work that Secretary Jenner has done with K-12 education,” Mulherin. “I’m not one for blurring the lines … I’m still struggling. I still like K-12 as its own entity, versus higher education.”
Jenner said her immediate focus will be listening and learning before making any changes.
“My first priority is to dig into some of the good things that the commission has going on right now,” she told reporters after the vote. “We’re not going to spend time admiring the problem. We’re going to really get after solutions, and we’re going to move quickly to do everything we can to support Hoosiers.”
She also acknowledged Indiana’s ongoing challenge to increase college-going rates, especially for low-income, Black and Hispanic students. 
“Educational attainment really matters,” Jenner said. “It matters for a person’s social and economic mobility.”
Getting more Hoosiers to college
She pointed to the state’s high school redesign work — overhauling diploma options and increasing opportunities for juniors and seniors to earn industry-recognized credentials or college credit before graduation — as a way to give students a head start. 
Indiana’s college-going rate drops again, dipping to 51.7%

“It really changes the game for our people, because they don’t have to just wait until after high school to get started,” she said. “We can start to ensure we’re targeting and working with students as early as possible to make that connection, quite frankly, a lot more effective than it is today.”
Jenner additionally addressed concerns that the new Indiana diploma will push more students directly into the workforce rather than college. She said the state must do more to demonstrate the value of higher education and ensure programs lead to meaningful opportunities.
“Indiana’s college-going rate, like our country’s, has been in a decade of decline,” she noted. “I wholeheartedly believe if we keep doing the same things on repeat, we’re just going to continue with those status quo numbers.”
She maintained that partnerships between high schools, colleges and employers will be critical to boosting college enrollment, too. 
Lowery said he and Jenner will work together in the coming weeks to ensure a smooth handoff. 
“It’s a privilege to do this, and it’s a privilege to get to do it with roughly 50 people on the staff,” he said. “Helping her know more of those details, answering anything I can with her, (and) trying to help make it just as smooth and set up for the kind of success that our state deserves.”

(Photos by Andrew Harnik/Getty, Gage Skidmore, and C-SPAN)Trump administration officials last month bashed the federal judges who ordered Alina Habba off the job as New Jersey’s top federal prosecutor, and they did it again Thursday when U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann ruled Habba’s reappointment was “unlawful.”
“We will protect her position from activist judicial attacks,” Attorney General Pamela Bondi said on social media, in announcing plans to appeal.
Habba weighed in too, vowing on Fox News: “We will not fall to rogue judges. We will not fall to people trying to be political when they should just be doing their job, respecting the president.”
Brann, though, doesn’t fit neatly into the narrative of Trump allies who deride him as an Obama appointee driven by politics to remove Habba as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney.
He’s a longtime Republican and member of the conservative Federalist Society and the NRA. While former President Barack Obama named him to the federal bench in 2012, his nomination was part of a bipartisan deal, which is common in states where senators are from both parties. (Brann, whose court is in Williamsport in northcentral Pennsylvania, was tapped to take the Habba case because of a venue change.)
During his confirmation hearing, then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, called him “probably the most Republican judicial nominee from the Obama White House.” Pat Toomey, Pennsylvania’s Republican senator from 2011 to 2023, described him as “a longtime conservative Republican whom I know to be a fair and unbiased jurist.”
Brann himself told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee that the most important attribute of a judge is “complete impartiality in the application of the law to the facts before the court.”
“A United States district judge should be fair, impartial, cordial, timely, calm, and dignified,” Brann said. “I believe that I possess the appropriate temperament to effectively serve as a federal district judge.”
He acknowledged he had “basically conservative views,” but that politics would not have a place in his courtroom — and should not, to protect public confidence in the courts, he told the senators.
“I have, I think, fairly firm political views on a variety of issues,” Brann said. “My job is to factor that out, and I think that is actually the most difficult role as a judge, frankly, to not bring your own personal views to bear, because, frankly, what confidence would the public have ultimately if you did that? I mean, they would think this person should not really be a judge, they do not have the temperament, they do not have the wisdom to be a judge.”
He added: “I hope that I would ultimately have those traits on the bench, and I give you as much assurance as I can that that is what I would seek to do.”
Confirmed in December 2012, he took the bench in Pennsylvania’s Middle District in January 2013 and became chief judge there in 2021. When he started, Williamsport had been without a full-time federal judge for several years, according to WNEP-TV.
Previously, Brann, a native of Elmira, New York, had been a private-practice attorney for two decades in Bradford County, a largely rural, mountainous area that borders New York.
“I’m a country lawyer,” Brann told the TV station.
Brann has been in Trump supporters’ crosshairs before.
In November 2020, he dismissed a lawsuit in which the Trump campaign tried to delay the certification of election results in Pennsylvania. That decision briefly turned him into a media darling among liberals, with Philadelphia magazine gleefully reporting that Brann “absolutely eviscerated” Trump’s effort to overturn the election.
Last week during oral arguments in the Habba case, Brann seemed keen to consider the challenge to Habba’s authority, noting repeatedly over four hours of questioning the “interesting” issues the case raised. He also wryly hinted that he fully expected the blowback that his ruling generated on Thursday.
“I have a feeling that someone is going to be unsatisfied with my ruling,” he said.

Building a new natural gas pipeline from Pennsylvania to New York would not make electricity in New England more affordable or reliable, experts say, despite the Trump administration’s push to revive a project that stalled out years ago.


Environmental advocates object to the construction of more gas infrastructure at a time when much of New England is trying to wean itself off fossil fuels, but there are economic concerns as well. Industry insiders say the proposed Constitution pipeline would do little to get more gas to New England power plants and could raise costs for both generators and consumers.


“There certainly is an increasing demand for energy, particularly electricity,” said Jeremy McDiarmid, managing director and general counsel for national industry group Advanced Energy United. ​“But the narrative that natural gas is going to somehow create a big downward pressure on electricity and energy bills is just not proven out in the data.”


U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin breathed new life into that narrative in a Boston Globe op-ed published this month. The piece advocates for the approval of the Constitution pipeline, a proposed 125-mile project that would transport gas from the fracking fields of Pennsylvania into New York, on the grounds that it would save New Englanders money.


It’s the latest in the EPA’s shift away from its historical mission of safeguarding environmental and public health and toward slashing regulations with the goal of ​“unleashing American energy” and lowering costs for residents. Since President Donald Trump took office, the agency has announced plans to end the $7 billion Solar for All program that funds solar projects for low-income households, eliminate the Energy Star label for energy-efficient appliances, and strip itself of authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

The Constitution pipeline is not a new project. Federal regulators initially approved it in 2014, but New York rejected the project’s water-quality certification in 2016. Legal battles ensued, and in 2020, energy development company Williams dropped the proposal.


Then, in May, the Trump administration lifted its stop-work order on a major offshore wind project under construction off Long Island’s coast, claiming the move was part of a deal in which New York’s Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul agreed to reverse the state’s long-standing opposition to natural gas pipelines. Days later, Williams declared it would resurrect plans for two pipelines: Constitution and the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, a shorter line that would mostly run underwater off New Jersey and New York.


In his Boston Globe piece, Zeldin traces New England’s soaring electricity prices — the highest of any region in the continental U.S. — back to an inadequate supply of natural gas to the area’s power plants. The Constitution pipeline would transport more gas into New York, where it could be exported to its neighbors to the East. More gas would mean more reliable power generation and lower electricity prices, Zeldin contends.


It has the ring of a plausible argument. New England’s power producers are heavily dependent on natural gas — 55% of the region’s electricity came from gas-fired plants in 2024 — and leadership at regional grid operator ISO New England has pointed to lack of gas supply as a concern for reliability as demand on the system grows. At the same time, the Trump administration’s hostility to offshore wind has slowed or sidelined several developments that states like Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts were counting on to boost power supplies in coming years.


“While there are a tremendous amount of ambitions around large-scale renewable energy, we have really struggled to make that operable,” said Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade group that represents the region’s electricity producers.

Piping more gas up from Pennsylvania’s ample supplies could seem like an economically sensible way to bolster the grid in light of these facts. The reality is far more complicated, however, say advocates and experts.

The major problem is that the pipeline wouldn’t actually bring much, if any, new gas into New England, Dolan said. The Constitution pipeline would terminate in Schoharie County, New York, where it would connect to pipes that already carry gas into New England. That existing infrastructure is the true bottleneck, he said.


The pipes into and around New England are ​“narrow and limited,” so bringing a higher volume of gas into New York doesn’t mean more can flow throughout the neighboring region. There are no plans in the works to alleviate those constraints, and the models for funding such projects make it highly unlikely there will be any proposals for pipelines into or within New England in the near future, Dolan said.


“I am not aware of any large-scale gas supply projects into New England today,” he said. ​“Until there is a way to increase that, I struggle to see how Constitution changes anything meaningful for us.”


Furthermore, multiple New England states are enacting plans to transition away from natural gas for home heating and appliances. In late 2023, Massachusetts regulators laid out plans for transitioning gas utilities toward clean energy, with the explicit goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. In May 2025, Maine opened an investigation into the future of its gas utilities. These efforts could reduce demand for natural gas for heating, freeing up some supply for power plants, Dolan said.


Even if new pipelines increased New England’s gas supply, that influx of fuel would be unlikely to consistently lower prices in the long term, experts said. Despite the appealing logic that more supply leads to lower costs, natural gas prices are inherently volatile and susceptible to influence by global events. In 2022, for example, the wholesale price more than tripled from its 2020 level, hitting $6.45 per million British thermal units, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Last year, the average price was $2.20; next year it is forecast to hit $4.30, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.


“The region is already over-reliant on natural gas,” said Sarah Krame, staff attorney with the Sierra Club’s environmental law program. ​“That is why we have seen volatile and skyrocketing gas and electricity bills in recent years.”


A better solution to both price and reliability worries, said advocates, would be to build a system that simply requires less gas.


That would mean relying on a diverse portfolio of options that includes solar, offshore wind, battery storage, energy efficiency, and demand-response programs. Such resources could be coordinated to create virtual power plants — a collection of geographically distributed resources that can work together to supply power to the grid and reduce demand. Not only do these networks emit less greenhouse gases than fossil-fueled plants, but their components can be built more quickly and cheaply, McDiarmid said.


This approach already had a chance to prove itself this summer, when solar and storage worked together to lower peak demand during a heat wave that saw temperatures hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit around the region, noted Amy Boyd Rabin, vice president of policy and regulatory affairs at the Environmental League of Massachusetts.

Abrego is expected to be escorted back to Maryland by a private security firm and report for pretrial supervision, according to conditions sought by his attorneys approved by a federal magistrate in Nashville. He will also be under the supervision of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which could choose to detain him. A Maryland court order requires he be given 72-hours notice if the government plans to send him to a “third country.”
Abrego, as the Tennessee court refers to him, was dispatched to El Salvador after being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Maryland, where he has lived with his wife and children and works as an apprentice sheet metal worker. A government prosecutor later conceded his deportation was an error. Abrego, who entered the country illegally as a teen, was the subject of an immigration court order barring his removal to his home country of El Salvador, where he said he feared gang violence.
He was returned to Tennessee in June to face human smuggling charges that prosecutors say are tied to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. Abrego was neither cited nor arrested when he was pulled over by Tennessee Highway Patrol officers with nine passengers in his vehicle. Prosecutors now allege the stop was part of a human smuggling operation in which Abrego was paid to transport immigrants illegally in the United States to points around the country.
Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Federal solar tax credits that once covered 30 percent of project costs are being phased out. For farmers, that can mean fewer opportunities to use agrivoltaics to offset rising costs and keep farmland in production. 
The post Cuts to federal solar tax credits send Mass. farmers ‘scrambling’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","NATE TASSINARI OWNS a 145-acre farm in western Massachusetts that has been in his family for three generations. His farm supplies hay and corn to the cows in the dairy farm his cousins own next door.
When he bought the land nine years ago from his grandmother, his intention was to keep farming the land at a time when farmland is disappearing across the state. But the business was in the red.
Tassinari found a way to make his farm profitable by installing 249 kilowatts of solar panels that are just high enough to allow him to continue growing hay under them. His solar project – which he calls Million Little Sunbeams – came online in 2020.
He sells all of the electricity produced to the grid and makes between $30,000 to $40,000 every year. The solar panels don’t really impact his hay production except for adding about eight extra hours of work to navigate around the solar panels, which require the use of smaller equipment.
This concept – which pairs solar panels with crops or livestock on the same land to harvest sunlight for both energy and food – is called agrivoltaics or dual-use solar. 
For Tassinari, the agrivoltaics project makes it more possible for him to keep his farmland in agricultural production. He uses the money he gets to buy equipment like tractors and invest in the farm.
Federal tax credits for solar, which have covered 30 percent of the cost of installing solar projects, helped Tassinari build his first project.
Farmers across Massachusetts are struggling financially – as shown by the loss of more than 100,000 acres of farmland since 1997 due to rising land prices, an aging farmer population, costly equipment, and climate-related weather challenges – making federal solar tax credits essential to the viability of agrivoltaics projects that farmers might consider as an option to preserve farmland.
But the federal tax bill that President Trump signed in July eliminated these tax credits. Projects must begin construction by July 4, 2026, or commence operations before 2028 to still get the incentive before the credits are completely phased out. 
Tassinari is building a second agrivoltaics project on his land. He’s going to be able to start his project within the window to still receive the tax credit, and says he’s lucky that he is in that situation.
“That tax credit is definitely the thing that makes the project work financially,” said Tassinari. “I was already under a contract, and I was doing it before the budget bill passed, so I’m okay. But I think a lot of other people who are in similar spots are scrambling right now to get things started before the end of the year, so they don’t lose those tax credits. Because otherwise it doesn’t pencil.”
Proponents of agrivoltaics say that the revenue from solar can help preserve farmland while also meeting the clean energy needs of the state. But without the federal tax credits, the outlook is grim for agrivoltaics projects that won’t be able to break ground before the credits are taken away.
The Trump administration also cancelled $3.4 million in grant funding through which schools and low-income families could access food from local farms – a lifeline for farmers who could count on the grant as steady revenue. A land conservation program to protect farmland, forests, and wetlands that would have brought $20.8 million to the state was terminated by the administration in June. Farmers have also struggled to access grants for the climate resilience projects from the US Department of Agriculture, as the administration has frozen and unfrozen funding.
Some farmers see solar farms as competition for agricultural land, but many are beginning to look to agrivoltaics as a means of staying afloat and preserving their land as farmland, according to Iain Ward, the head of Solar Agricultural Services, a company that connects farmers to options for agrivoltaics.
“Most farmers are in silent desperation to stay in existence,” said Ward. “Agrivoltaics is truly a farmland conservation technique. We revitalize the farm by giving farmers a chance to make a steady income that reduces the risks.”  
Massachusetts was the first state to offer financial incentives for agrivoltaics. As part of the state program designed to make solar economically viable, agrivoltaics projects receive an extra 6 cents per kilowatt hour. In June, the state bumped up that amount to 8 cents per kilowatt hour for program year 2025. 
“President Trump’s new law will significantly increase customer energy bills, disrupt critical energy projects needed to meet rising demand, and cost hundreds of thousands of jobs across the nation, while also undermining an important source of revenue for farmers,” said Department of Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony in an emailed statement. “Our administration is working hard to lower energy costs for people and businesses, but President Trump and Congressional Republicans are taking us backward.”
Even with the increased state incentive, some agrivoltaics projects in the pipeline are already being cancelled.
Jake Marley, the owner of agrivoltaics solar development company Hyperion Systems, said his company has had to cancel four agrivoltaics projects, which would have totaled 2.7 megawatts in energy, following the changes to the tax credits.
Hyperion and other agrivoltaics companies like BlueWave are solar developers that work with farmers and landowners to design, finance, and install customized solar arrays that are most conducive to preserving agricultural production on farms. They also oversee construction, maintenance, and monitoring of the dual-use system.
Agrivoltaics solar arrays tend to cost more than traditional solar development because they typically need to be taller and therefore require more steel. 
“It’s incredibly disheartening to see the potential negative impact of this rollback of the investment tax credits,” said Jesse Robertson-Dubois, the director of sustainable solar development at BlueWave. “Taking away a part of the capital that is available for building a solar array makes it much much harder for all solar arrays, but even more so for agrivoltaics arrays.”
There are currently 12 agrivoltaics projects in operation across the state in Carver, Plympton, Plymouth, Rochester, Hadley, Monsoon, Grafton, Douglas, Dighton, Palmer, and Haverhill. The earliest project was Tassinari’s Million Little Sunbeams, and the most recent project – in Douglas – began operating in June of this year. 
There are 10 more agrivoltaics projects in the pipeline that have already qualified for the state incentive but haven’t begun operating yet. These projects – if they have already broken ground or are operational by December 31, 2027 – will likely go forward. There are two projects that are currently under review by the state, and those will have longer timelines, which might prevent them from qualifying for the federal tax credits.
Agrivoltaics is a growing industry, but it’s still in its early stages in the state and across the country – and there are some farmers who don’t consider it a viable option because of questions about how solar panels on farms affect different types of crops. Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst have been conducting studies on the impacts of agrivoltaics on crop productivity and farm economics since 2021. 
“Our research has uncovered that there are still a lot of unknowns here,” said Dwayne Bregger, the director of the UMass Clean Energy Extension, who noted that there is nationwide interest in agrivoltaics. “Solar developers are strong advocates for agrivoltaics and have had some success. … But to some extent, everybody sort of still considers this somewhat of a grand experiment of how this actually works out for the farmers and for agricultural production.”
The Trump administration delivered another blow this week to solar on farms by disqualifying certain wind and solar projects from two loan programs for rural development. 
Kate Daniels, the northeast regional director at the coalition for community solar access, said that with the cuts to solar at the federal level and the uncertainty around what will come next in terms of solar policy, the state’s incentive program is going to be all the more important.
“When the federal tax credits disappear, there is a larger gap towards being able to make solar projects economic,” said Daniels. “In a post-federal tax credit environment, there are a number of ways in which the states can lead and make sure that solar is still a sustainable industry and still delivering on affordable energy for all ratepayers in their states.”

The Trump administration is fast-tracking the process after it had stalled due to a bankruptcy by the Antelope mine's previous owner.
The post Feds reactivate 440-million-ton coal lease application in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin appeared first on WyoFile .","The Trump administration is advancing another federal coal lease in Wyoming, potentially opening access to 440 million tons in the Powder River Basin. 
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management issued a final environmental impact statement Friday for the proposed West Antelope III coal lease-by-application project, spanning some 3,500 acres in Campbell and Converse counties.
The lease was originally proposed in 2015 by Cloud Peak Energy, which operated the Antelope mine at the time. But the company filed for bankruptcy and eventually sold to the Navajo Transitional Energy Company, which allowed the lease application to remain in limbo until the firm reactivated the process with the BLM earlier this year. 
The size of the lease — 440 million tons — is substantial. The Antelope mine extracts 20-25 million tons annually, according to the company. It’s the third-largest coal mine in the nation in terms of production, federal records show.
Earlier this month, the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement approved the West Antelope II South Tract Mining Plan Modification for the same Antelope mine, which will add another 14.5 million tons of reserves. Together, the two leases would add about 18 years of mining to the life of the mine.

Environmental groups say the administration is moving too quickly on both leasing actions at the Antelope mine, as well as a proposed “mining plan modification” at the Black Butte mine in southwest Wyoming. 
“At Black Butte, they’re pushing through an [Environmental Impact Statement] in 28 days, which is absolutely insane timing — and it sounds like it’s going to be a similarly fast timeline for [the] Antelope [leases],” said Emma Jones, associate organizer for the Sierra Club’s Wyoming Chapter. “There’s no way that you can have an appropriate amount of real public engagement in such a short timeline.”
The BLM noted in a press release Friday that the West Antelope III coal lease application will move quickly under direction of the Trump administration’s Unleashing American Energy and Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry executive orders. A public hearing on the matter is scheduled for Sept. 3.
Coal advocates, however, say it’s about time the federal government sped up approvals for the coal industry.
“We are pleased to see the administration moving expeditiously!” Wyoming Mining Association Executive Director Travis Deti told WyoFile via email.
The agency has scheduled a public hearing regarding “the project’s fair market value and maximum economic recovery” from 6-8 p.m., Sept. 3, at the Wright Town Hall in Wright.Go to the BLM National NEPA Register for additional information and planning documents.

That’s provoked deep concern among some local and state officials who don’t see how they would have the funding or background to handle a sudden natural disaster.“We want to wean off of FEMA and we want to bring it down to the state level,” Trump said in June. “We're moving it back to the states so the governors can handle it. That's why they're governors. Now, if they can't handle it, they shouldn't be governor.”

Trump’s FEMA Review Council, a 12-member board led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has until mid-November to write a report detailing its recommendations for the president.But, as Noem has noted several times during the group’s two public meetings, Congress holds authority over FEMA and would need to sign off on any major changes.Lawmakers, some of whom have spent years working on federal emergency management issues, aren’t waiting for the review council’s report to get started.House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Sam Graves, R-Mo., ranking member Rick Larsen, D-Wash., Florida Republican Rep. Daniel Webster and Arizona Democratic Rep. Greg Stanton released their bill in late July, before the review council held its second meeting. It does not aim to eliminate FEMA.“FEMA is in need of serious reform, and the goal of the FEMA Act of 2025 is to fix it,” Graves wrote in a statement. “This bill does more than any recent reforms to cut through the bureaucracy, streamline programs, provide flexibility, and return FEMA to its core purpose of empowering the states to lead and coordinating the federal response when it’s needed.”Separately, a U.S. House spending committee is recommending a substantial boost in FEMA funding for the next fiscal year.Make FEMA a Cabinet-level agency?Stanton said during an interview with States Newsroom on Wednesday the Transportation Committee’s bill  “recognizes the challenges we have learned from past disasters; that sometimes the rules and regulations in place make it very difficult for victims of natural disasters to get the help that they need, whether it be housing or even financial assistance.”The legislation, he said, focuses on four broad improvements:Making FEMA a Cabinet-level agency instead of housing it within the Department of Homeland Security;Emphasizing mitigation projects that lessen the impact of natural disasters;Streamlining processes that have become too complex over the years; andAdding flexibility so states can choose the type of housing or other support that best helps their residents following a natural disaster.Stanton does not support Trump’s inclination to eliminate FEMA, arguing the federal government should help when local and state governments are overwhelmed by the scale of a natural disaster.

“That's the whole point of it, that Americans help our fellow Americans at their point of greatest need,” he said.But Stanton added he’s willing to read through the FEMA Review Council’s report once it’s released and work with its members to improve the agency.“I'm open-minded,” Stanton said. “If they have good ideas that actually will strengthen FEMA, I'm all ears.”The bill, while a sign of bipartisan progress in an increasingly polarized Congress, still has several steps to go before reaching Trump’s desk. To gain his signature, lawmakers may need to blend in some of the review council’s recommendations later this year.A handful of outside groups, including the National Emergency Management Association, sent the committee a letter applauding the bipartisan group for its work so far but hinting they expect changes in the coming months.“We recognize and appreciate that the legislation is part of an ongoing effort to modernize FEMA and ensure its programs reflect current and emerging challenges,” the four organizations wrote. “In that spirit, we also await the work of the FEMA Review Council and understand that its recommendations may inform refinements to the legislation.”'We're going to have to turn to our own resources'The review council’s two public meetings so far haven’t included much debate. The members have mostly shared general statements about grievances with FEMA and issued some warnings for state governments that rely heavily on the federal government.Phil Bryant, former Republican governor of Mississippi, said that states should prepare to begin spending much more on natural disasters.“We’re going to have to turn to our own resources,” Bryant said. “States are going to have to develop that emergency response fund, take some of their rainy day funds or funds that they may want to use for musical events and put it into disaster recovery.”Larger states or those with strong economies may be able to absorb some of the cost that the federal government has carried for years, but other members of the council have cautioned their colleagues against going too far.Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin said the committee will need to clearly explain what costs state and local governments will be responsible for and which will be covered by the federal government.He also highlighted the challenges of completely reshaping FEMA while it’s in the middle of responding to natural disasters ranging from hurricanes to wildfires to tornadoes.“We’re going to be changing the tires on this car while this car is barreling 100 miles an hour,” Youngkin said.

Jane Castor, mayor of Tampa, Florida, signaled the panel’s recommendations should take into consideration that many small or rural areas won’t be able to raise the amount of funds they’ve received from FEMA.“The locals should be prepared to respond to these incidents in the immediate aftermath,” Castor said. “But as was stated before, there are some — London, Kentucky, and Asheville, North Carolina — (where) this is probably the first time that they’ve probably experienced anything like this. And so we have to be there to help them through the worst of their time.”Noem has been blunt in her assessment of FEMA, calling the agency ""disastrous"" and “incompetent.”She’s also been clear that Trump doesn’t expect incremental changes but an entirely new approach to how the federal government responds to natural disasters.“The president’s vision is that FEMA would not be in the long-term recovery model,” Noem said. “He wants the state and local governments and emergency management directors to lead response immediately when something happens in a state or jurisdiction and for us to be in a supporting role; a financial role that would be there much in a state block grant model.”A wary eye on Trump panelLocal and state officials throughout the country are keeping a close eye on the Trump administration's review council, wary of the implications a loss in federal disaster response would have on local and state governments.Houston, Texas, Controller Chris Hollins said on a call with reporters in August the city has typically put away between $25 and $30 million for natural disasters with the expectation that FEMA would help with additional costs.After Trump proposed eliminating FEMA, Hollins began encouraging city leaders “to take a broader look at what's going to be necessary to be self-reliant. But that's an incredibly tall task.”“If we're all on our own, it's going to put our individual finances in an extreme state of turmoil, because we're either going to have to tax our citizens and our residents at extremely high rates to have enough money to be prepared, or we're going to intentionally roll the dice and run the risk of being unprepared when these moments come,” Hollins said. “And you know, both of those are unacceptable predicaments.”

Minnesota Auditor Julie Blaha said on the same call that some communities will need years or even decades to build up the type of reserve needed to cover just one major natural disaster.“In a small town it's going to be pretty hard to put away millions of dollars, and by the time you can get a reserve of millions of dollars, you are likely to have another disaster,” Blaha said. “The only way to respond to that, you have to go into debt, and you have again increased costs.”Two committees and a funding boostCongress has a two-track system for determining the size and scope of federal departments like FEMA — authorizing committees, which set policy and generally determine each agency’s mission, and the appropriations committees that provide funding through annual bills.The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s bipartisan bill represents a significant step on the authorizing side. But the legislation still has to make it through committee debate, the House floor and the Senate before it could reach Trump’s desk.Separately, the House Appropriations Committee released a partisan bill earlier this summer that would provide a robust $31.8 billion for FEMA during the next fiscal year, $4.5 billion higher than the agency’s current spending level.During debate on the legislation, Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz proposed an amendment that would have blocked any federal funding from being used to eliminate FEMA.“Yes, FEMA needs fixes but FEMA helps all of our communities and we can make it better and should be making it better without killing it,” Wasserman Schultz said. “The states cannot handle the responsibilities of FEMA in the aftermath of a storm on their own. That is simply not possible.”

Republicans opposed the amendment, arguing the spending panel shouldn’t do anything that would tie the hands of the review council, the authorizing committees, or Trump.Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice sharply criticized FEMA during debate, saying the agency “isn’t working anymore” and has “become bloated.”But Bice also made the point that federal funding is necessary, saying she was trying to address issues within her district “where FEMA hasn’t paid for disaster debris removal for two years.”“These communities cannot afford the huge costs of debris removal for two years or more when FEMA doesn't pay them, reimburse them for the services that they have provided,” Bice said. “This can’t continue.”Dems say Congress in chargeDemocrats on the committee, including Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer, urged their GOP colleagues to support the amendment, pressing for any changes to FEMA to be made solely by Congress.“If FEMA needs reforming, and I may certainly agree with that, we are the reformers,” Hoyer said.

North Carolina Republican Rep. Chuck Edwards, who represents Western sections of the state devastated by Hurricane Helene, said he opposed the amendment because he wanted to see a complete overhaul of FEMA — though he appeared to back the idea that lawmakers should decide what changes and when.“There are few people in this room that have more up close and personal interaction with FEMA over the last eight months than I,” Edwards said. “Up until Sept. 27, FEMA was nothing more than a line item on a budget for me. Since Sept. 27, I’ve very much been getting an education.“I can tell you that FEMA needs major reform and Congress is best suited to do that.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-08-22 15:56:42.102844

With enough coordination, education, planning and proactivity, New Mexico can eliminate traffic deaths and no longer rank as the deadliest state for pedestrians, a state transportation official told lawmakers Thursday. 
Amy Whitfield, who is spearheading the New Mexico Transportation Department’s “Target Zero” initiative, laid out the many factors contributing to the state’s place atop the list of deadliest states for pedestrians, an unwanted designation it’s had for years. 
“We do not believe that any traffic fatality is acceptable in our nation. And it’s not just a phrase. It’s not just a goal. It is something that we can do,” Whitfield told lawmakers on the interim Transportation Infrastructure Revenue Subcommittee. “We can reach this goal. We can get to zero traffic fatalities.”
Pedestrians in New Mexico died at a rate of 4.97 per 100,000 residents in 2023, the most recent year for which federal data is available, according to the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. 
Dark highways, fast cars, few sidewalks — and more pedestrian deaths

That’s much higher than even the other top states for pedestrian fatalities: Those states ranking between second and fifth all had between 3.2 and 3.7 deaths per 100,000 residents. 
According to the federal data, New Mexico has topped the list since 2016 and been in the top five since at least 2012. 
Between 2012 and 2023, 933 pedestrians were killed in crashes in New Mexico, according to the data.
In 2023, the Legislature passed a memorial creating a “Target Zero” initiative that envisioned zero vehicle-related deaths or serious injuries by the end of 2030. It recommended the Transportation Department create a position like Whitfield’s to craft a plan and propose changes to the state’s Motor Vehicle code, among other undertakings.
Whitfield on Thursday presented lawmakers with tools and procedures the department is developing to eliminate traffic deaths by 2050, both on states the road owns and on local roads. 
One local road — Central Avenue in Albuquerque — has six of the top-10 most dangerous intersections in the state. Central and Louisiana in the International District is the most dangerous, according to Whitfield’s presentation, and much of the conversation Thursday involved how the state has been working with city officials to prevent pedestrian deaths there. 
In 2024, 25 pedestrian crashes occurred at Central and Louisiana, where transient pedestrians often linger near the Albuquerque Rapid Transit stop. Whitfield said solving the problem at the state’s most dangerous intersection requires a mix of traffic-calming measures like pedestrian-enabled crosswalks; educational and social outreach; and improved emergency response to ensure traffic injuries don’t end up being fatalities.
DOT Secretary Ricky Serna also said the state has installed wrought iron fencing and other landscaping on land it controls to encourage pedestrians onto city-owned property like sidewalks,, which enables the city, if necessary, to use its authority to clear people for their safety.
“They can move you on to the public right-of-way, and then city ordinance will allow us to get you out of there. That’s been kind of the hope,” Serna said. “Some of the struggle that we wrangle with there is, some of those public spaces are being used as access points to services, meaning that you may have a shelter or you may have a community organization that identifies that [intersection] as where they’re convening.”
Whitfield reported progress at that particular intersection, encouraging lawmakers to drive through the intersection and make note of what the city has done. 
“They’re really putting in some exciting things: Some pedestrian HAWK beacons, some calming patterns, some things that they know are going to have an impact,” she said. “And so they are working on those engineering strategies that we’re encouraging all local governments to really engage in.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_1029-1-1024x838.jpg,,,2025-08-22 15:56:42.102844

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Surrounded by a golf course, large offices and industrial buildings in West Valley City, researchers, physicists and engineers of Nusano, a nuclear technology company, are working on a radioactive form of elements that could become solutions in cancer therapies, aerospace, clean energy and the internet — radioisotopes.
In a ribbon cutting ceremony at that spot Thursday, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said it was “a  momentous day,” one that would mark the beginning of an innovation hub where cures for cancer can emerge.
“We know they’re miraculous,” Cox said about radioisotopes. “We know they do incredible things like targeting cancer without destroying other parts of the body, which is the miracle that we all wanted. But they’re very expensive to produce at scale.”

The facility, according to the company, will have a deep impact on domestic radioisotope production at scale by combining universities’ research and their own particle acceleration technology to build a safer and more efficient platform to manufacture multiple radioisotopes.
The new building has been under construction for about three years. It’s built to last 40 years and, with the help of almost 700 cement pillars that are about 70 feet deep, is projected to deviate less than one millimeter in the case of a 7.0 earthquake, Chris Lowe, CEO of Nusano said on Thursday.

John Dahlstrom, executive vice president of the Wasatch Group, the building’s developer, said he hopes the Nusano site becomes the core of a “medical innovation technology center,” attracting radioisotope users in their development of drugs against cancer.
“We’re already getting others who are going to be using radioisotopes in their drugs to locate here. We have three or four that have already committed, and we have several others who are looking at this opportunity and making the commitment,” Dahlstrom said. “This is really the start of what we see as a hub for innovation here in Utah, innovation around the production of radioisotopes.”
Nusano’s program for stable isotopes, which are non-radioactive forms of atoms, would also help the company to have a fully domestic supply chain at scale, Lowe said, diverting imports from Russia and other countries.

The company also has technologies to separate matter without a lot of restrictions, Lowe said, which, among many uses, would allow a more efficient mining of rare earth minerals.
“I’ve been back and forth to D.C., to the State Department, to the White House, four times in the last 45 days,” he said. “I think they’re equally blown away by the technology and our ability to scale.”
The company is also planning to scale high-assay low-enriched uranium, or HALEU fuel. But that will be done not off West Valley City’s Stonebridge golf course — where Nusano’s home is — but at Hill Air Force Base in northern Davis County.
“We will scale it in a manner that we can replenish, one, our national stockpile that was given away years ago,” Lowe said. “Two, all of these (small modular reactors) and various versions of different reactors that are coming online, their scale doesn’t happen without us, because our approach is actually about 200x more efficient than the Department of Energy at scale, apples to apples.”
Cox commended the company’s work, saying it will not only be an essential component of future generations of cancer drugs, but also reduce the country’s reliance on foreign suppliers, especially in the advanced processing of critical minerals. 
“We would rather do it right here at home, and even the production of HALEU fuel, which is so critical to our ambitions to reinvigorate the nuclear industry here and the next generation of nuclear reactors here in the state to clean up our atmosphere and provide abundant energy resources,” Cox said.

Whether those are political and religious opinions or delusions was the question posed to a Greenville County judge during a two-day hearing that concluded Friday.
Bixby believes he is competent and wanted to talk directly to a judge to argue his innocence.
In the courtroom Friday, he said he did nothing wrong in gunning down two officers during a daylong standoff over a planned road widening that would take a piece of the Bixby family’s Abbeville property.
A jury found Bixby guilty of killing Sheriff’s Deputy Danny Wilson and Constable Donnie Ouzts and recommended a sentence of death in 2007.
“They keep saying victim, victim, victim,” the 58-year-old told Judge R. Scott Sprouse. “They are not victims. A perpetrator has never been a victim.”
Bixby believes his conviction was illegal because it didn’t follow his reading of the Constitution, which gives treason as the only reason for the death penalty, he said. He believes prosecutors and judges conspired against him to bury evidence. And he believes that if he can get his thoughts in front of the right court, then he will leave prison.
Wearing a green jumpsuit, glasses and a frown, Bixby took notes during the experts’ testimony, nodding in agreement when they listed his beliefs and shaking his head when they called those same beliefs false.
“I’m just tired,” Bixby told the judge. “I’m absolutely, positively tired. There’s no meat in this (case). This shouldn’t have gone on as far as it has, and if it had been dealt with, my filings, since day one, I would’ve been free anyway.”
During his 11-minute address, Bixby mostly complained about perceived legal injustices in his case.
His arguments highlight the “bizarre beliefs” that make him incompetent for execution, defense attorney Joshua Snow Kendrick argued.
Bixby is out of normal appeals. He was among inmates expected to receive a death warrant when executions resumed last September, but the state Supreme Court paused his case long enough to determine whether he’s competent.

Along with his beliefs about the legal system, Bixby thinks patterns he finds in sequences of numbers hold special meaning to him. And he thinks God protected him from bullets during the 2003 shootout, claiming the blood of Christ was on his clothing afterward, Kendrick said.
All four psychiatrists who testified agreed that Bixby met the federal bar for competence, which says an inmate must understand what their execution means and the link between their crime and the punishment.
But South Carolina’s law is looser than the federal test. An inmate must be able to “rationally communicate” with their attorneys and understand the court proceedings, according to precedent set by the state Supreme Court.
Bixby can communicate with his attorneys. The question is whether he’s rational when he does so.
The substance of his unshakeable beliefs is so far removed from reality that his attorneys can’t speak to him about his case or get any new information from him that they might use for appeals, Kendrick said.
“What you have heard is a person who’s going to communicate with his attorneys, who will be nice to them sometimes, but that’s not the question,” Kendrick said. The question, he said, is whether Bixby’s lawyers can do their job effectively, which is “not going to happen,” Kendrick said.
Prosecutors, however, argued that Bixby’s beliefs are odd but not delusional.
Experts for both sides agreed that many of Bixby’s beliefs align with so-called constitutionalists, who believe the Constitution is the only valid law, and sovereign citizens, who denounce the government altogether. Bixby himself hasn’t identified himself as belonging to any particular political group.
A psychiatrist hired by prosecutors said lots of people find patterns in numbers. Take, for example, people with lucky lottery numbers who believe they’ll one day win the jackpot, said Richard Frierson.
If other people have the same line of thinking, Bixby isn’t necessarily irrational, prosecutors said.
“Where do you draw the line as to how many people have to believe something before we consider it mental illness?” Frierson said.
Many of Bixby’s beliefs seem to have come directly from his parents. His mother received a life sentence for planning the ambush. His father, who also shot at officers, was found unfit to stand trial because he had developed dementia. Both died in custody in 2011.
Time alone on death row has allowed Bixby to dig his heels in on the belief system his parents imparted, Frierson said.
After years of homeschooling, Bixby is relatively uneducated, which made him more susceptible to believing conspiracy theories. He listens to radio stations and reads blog posts that affirm his belief system, Frierson said.
Attorneys say inmate who killed 2 officers in 2003 shootout can’t be legally executed

Various psychiatrists have diagnosed Bixby with narcissistic personality disorder, a mental condition that causes a person to believe themselves to be the center of the universe. That likely led to Bixby’s beliefs becoming unshakable, since he thinks he’s the smartest person in any room, said Richart DeMier, a psychiatrist Bixby’s defense team hired to evaluate him.
Bixby also has some paranoia that might affect his functioning, as well as post-traumatic stress disorder from childhood trauma, which wasn’t specified, and his father getting shot during the standoff, psychiatrists said.
None of the psychiatrists who testified had ever found a person incompetent because of a personality disorder alone. Often, patients deemed incompetent have a condition that affects their memory, such as dementia, or some form of psychosis, which makes them unable to comprehend what’s happening or what will happen if they die, they said.
A personality disorder tends to be a strongly held worldview a person had shaped during a person’s childhood. Bixby has a particularly severe personality disorder, psychiatrists agreed. Rarely are personality disorders so severe that they make a person incompetent, experts said.
Bixby’s personality disorder impaired him enough that he couldn’t face the death chamber, DeMier said. Frierson and Donna Maddox, the court-appointed psychiatrist who evaluated Bixby, disagreed.
Bixby has shown symptoms of psychosis in the past. Once, during a particularly stressful period, he told a psychiatrist he was having visions of billboards that read, “Bixby for sheriff,” and that he caused his attorney’s skin to peel, Maddox said.

During Maddox’s most recent visits with Bixby, including a conversation Friday morning ahead of his hearing, he no longer had those delusions, she said.
He seemed capable of having a rational conversation, even if he didn’t always choose to cooperate with his attorneys, Maddox said.
He understood the facts of his case, that a jury found him guilty, that he will almost certainly die if the judge finds him competent, and why he was in court this week, said assistant attorney general Joseph Maye.
“He understands all of those things, and not only does he understand them, but he understands the law enough to be angry about the fact that they’re being presented, because he disagrees with them,” Maye said.
The roughly eight-hour hearing over two days concluded without Bixby getting his wish of being freed.
Attorneys on both sides will have two weeks to submit proposed orders for Sprouse to consider. Sprouse will have 30 days to make his decision, though either side could appeal, bringing the case back to the Supreme Court.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4277-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 15:56:42.102844

JB Pritzker signed the final two bills from the spring session Friday, giving his approval to more than 430 bills approved by lawmakers this year.
The final bills signed Friday are designed to improve access to abortion medication even if the federal government revokes permission for a certain drug. The governor signed a bill earlier in the week prohibiting students from receiving municipal tickets for disciplinary infractions.
The General Assembly sent 436 bills to the governor’s desk this year, with Pritzker signing all but three of them. Pritzker issued a pair of vetoes to Senate Bill 246, which would have allowed nonprofits to participate in the state’s investment pool, and House Bill 2682, a crisis assistance measure that had duplicative language in a bill Pritzker previously signed.
Pritzker also issued one amendatory veto to House Bill 2568 because a portion of the bill was written into the wrong section of state law. Lawmakers can decide whether or not to accept the change when they reconvene in October.
Abortion medication access
Illinois will allow health care professionals to prescribe certain medications over the next decade even if the federal government revokes approval for a drug under House Bill 3637.
The bill stipulates that any medication that had U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval prior to 2025 and remains approved by the World Health Organization will remain legally accessible in Illinois even if the FDA revokes approval of the drug. The law would remain in effect through 2034. It was primarily aimed at protecting providers of abortion mediation.
The bill expands “shield law” protections to all Illinois health care workers to protect them from prosecution in other states or disciplinary action in Illinois for providing health care that is legal in Illinois but may not be legal in other places.
“As an anti-woman, anti-science, authoritarian administration invades our privacy, Illinois is holding the line and we are fighting back,” Pritzker said at a news conference in Champaign.
The Trump administration has planned to review the FDA’s authorization of mifepristone, a leading abortion pill.
General Assembly Republican opposed the bill, arguing the state should not ignore the FDA’s guidance about medications.



Pritzker also signed House Bill 3709, an initiative of a group of University of Illinois students that requires Illinois colleges and universities to provide students access to contraception and abortion medications at campus pharmacies and health care centers beginning this school year.
“These services will now become more easily available from a source that young women can trust,” Pritzker said.
No municipal fines for students
Municipalities in Illinois may no longer issue fines, fees, tickets or citations to students as a form of school-based discipline under a new law signed Wednesday.
Senate Bill 1519, sponsored by Sen. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago, took effect immediately and is intended to close a loophole in a 2015 law, which prohibited schools from issuing fines for disciplinary infractions.
A 2022 investigation by ProPublica and the Chicago Tribune found that schools were getting around that law by referring students to local law enforcement for offenses such as truancy, vaping, fights or other infractions. The investigation also found Black and Latino students were fined at disproportionate rates.
The law does not apply to delinquent or criminal behavior. It also does not apply to traffic, boating, or fish and game laws.
“Our schools should be places of learning and growth — not entry points into the justice system,” Villa said in a statement. “When we treat student behavior with fines and tickets, we fail to address the real issues and risk derailing a young person’s future.”
The new law also requires school districts that employ school resource officers to have a memorandum of understanding with their local law enforcement agency to ensure SROs are properly trained and do not use fines or tickets for disciplinary infractions.

This massive budget increase comes directly from taxpayer dollars and further expands the SLCPD’s surveillance capabilities even after a recent news story exposed the SLCPD for taking electricity from Rocky Mountain Power customers in order to operate their street cameras throughout the city. The SLCPD claims to use drone surveillance for limited purposes, such as checking the scenes of accidents or crimes and searching for wanted or missing persons. Notably, they claim that drones are not used to monitor peaceful protests or private property. However, the Salt Lake Community Bail Fund investigated the SLCPD’s use of drone surveillance and found that this practice is leading to major violations of constitutional rights through oversurveillance. 
Oversurveillance of unsheltered people
While the police department claims to use drone footage only in areas where alleged crimes have occurred, they fail to disclose that drone cameras also capture footage all along their path to and from each location. This happenstance footage allows the police to unnecessarily pursue more low-level crimes that are rarely enforced due to negligible negative impacts. This oversurveillance disproportionately affects unsheltered people who are already overtargeted by police. With the recent passage of HB0312, Utah can now hold unsheltered people in jail without bail for misdemeanor offenses such as loitering, camping, and riding TRAX without a ticket. Classifying these actions as offenses is an unjust practice known as quality-of-life policing. This type of policing is unjust because it punishes people simply for trying to survive poverty. Quality-of-life policing is also ineffective at reducing homelessness and only makes it harder for unsheltered people to get connected with services that could allow them to eventually find consistent housing. 
Misuse of drone footage to target protestors
The Salt Lake City Police Department states that they do not monitor peaceful protests using their drone program. However, this information is inconsistent with recent court cases demonstrating that the SLCPD authorizes drone surveillance of protests simply for things like marching or not having a permit — both of which are First Amendment protected activities that do NOT justify the use of drone surveillance. Across the U.S., records of police departments show police regularly using drone surveillance to locate and arrest protestors in direct violation of First Amendment rights. The use of drone surveillance against protestors is a blatant attempt by the police to silence and intimidate protest movements. 
Racist facial recognition
In recent years, police departments have also gained access to facial recognition algorithms which are often utilized in drone surveillance footage, which allows the police to identify potential suspects within their facial recognition database. These facial recognition databases are often constructed from government photographs like driver’s licenses. The algorithms typically lack public transparency and demonstrate regular efficacy and racial bias concerns. 
One of the first cases of wrongful arrest based on these inaccurate face matching algorithms was the case of Robert Williams, who was arrested in front of his entire family based on a blurry image fed into a facial recognition algorithm that falsely identified him as the suspect. This case has emphasized that an algorithm match should not be used as the only evidence for an arrest, which has been echoed by countless researchers studying this topic. Just because someone is the best match in a collection of images available to the police does not mean that they committed a crime. The misuse of drone footage through flawed and racially biased facial recognition reinforces the systemic racism within the criminal legal system by continuing to disproportionately lead to the arrest and incarceration of Black people. 
Conclusions
In short, the use of police drone surveillance against the public is clearly a harmful misuse of public funds enabling the police to violate basic constitutional rights. The Salt Lake Community Bail Fund will continue to advocate for the complete shutdown of the SLCPD drone surveillance program as it is regularly being misused to harm the public.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Drone-monitoring-barbed-wire-fence-on-state-border-or-restricted-area.jpg,,,2025-08-22 14:57:15.638999

(Photo by Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado Legislature is meeting in a special session to address a nearly $800 million hole in the state budget. Work began on Thursday morning and is expected to last through the weekend.
After Republicans in Congress passed the federal tax cut and spending bill in July, Colorado’s estimated tax revenue collections shrunk by about $1.2 billion for the current fiscal year, which began July 1. Most of that is a loss of corporate income taxes.
Colorado has to have a balanced state budget, so lawmakers must figure out a way to get backed to a balanced bottom line. The Democratic majority in both chambers, alongside Gov. Jared Polis, plan to do that by dipping into the state’s reserves, cutting program spending and passing an array of tax laws to eliminate some deductions and loopholes.
In his call for the special session, Polis also allowed bills on health insurance premiums and artificial intelligence regulations. A controversial AI law is set to go into effect next February and it has been a longtime goal of Polis and moderates to tweak it before then.
Legislative action is live-streamed and archived on the General Assembly’s website.

Senate gives initial OK to 4 bills on first day of special session


By: Sara Wilson - Thursday August 21, 2025 9:03 pm





By the end of Thursday, the Colorado Legislature made it through the bulk of their committee work for the special session and the Senate gave its initial approval to four bills. Tomorrow morning, the Senate will have formal votes on those bills and the House will begin floor debate on its own set of bills.
The bills the Senate considered on second reading were:

Senate Bill 25B-1: This bill sets a process for the governor to notify and consult with the Joint Budget Committee on mid-year spending cuts needed to overcome a revenue shortfall, like the ones he is poised to do soon after this special session. The governor would be able to suspend and cut state funding, and therefore need to meet with the JBC, if the reserve needs to be tapped by up to 2% of the General Fund budget, or if that reserve is projected to dip below $1 billion.
Senate Bill 25B-2: This would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from organizations that provide reproductive health care, namely Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from.
Senate Bill 25B-3: This changes a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Senate Bill 25B-5: This bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to the state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.

The Senate still needs to take up Senate Bill 25B-4, the artificial intelligence bill focused on transparency and disclosure. That bill, backed by progressive lawmakers and consumer advocates, would require notification when people interact with AI and allow people to request information about how AI influences important decisions related to things like employment or school admissions. It awaits a hearing in the Appropriations Committee.
Over in the House, committees gave approval to the series of Democrat-backed tax policies. The chamber will start debate on them tomorrow. Those were:

House Bill 25B-1001: This would permanently extend a requirement that high-income taxpayers add back their qualified business income federal tax deductions when calculating their Colorado taxable income.
House Bill 25B-1002: This bill would expand the list of countries that the state considers to be tax havens.
House Bill 25B-1003: This would repeal a tax incentive for insurance companies that have at least 2.5% of their domestic employees in Colorado.
House Bill 25B-1004: This would allow qualifying companies to pay certain state taxes early at a discount.
House Bill 25B-1005: This bill would repeal a provision in state law that allows retailers to keep 4% of their sales tax collections, as a way for the businesses to cover the cost of collecting the taxes.

A House committee also signed off on House Bill 25B-1006, which would loan $100 million from the Unclaimed Property Trust Fund to prevent major health insurance premium increases.
House Bill 25B-1008, the dueling AI bill, also cleared its committee even with some Democrats voting against it. That bill would require companies to tell consumers when they are interacting with AI and fold the technology into the state’s existing anti-discrimination and consumer-protection laws. Bill sponsors removed a provisions that would have only allowed the attorney general, not consumers, from suing developers and deployers that violate consumer-protection laws.
Both HB25-1008 and HB25B-1006 need to pass the Appropriations Committee.
Democrats, who make up a majority in both chambers, also killed Republican-backed bills in committee on Thursday. The entire House State, Civic, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee agenda, for example, was made of Republican bills that died.

Lawmakers back off plan to pause Colorado’s wolf reintroduction program


By: Chase Woodruff -  5:16 pm





Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.

Republican-backed artificial intelligence bills killed in committee


By: Sara Wilson -  4:13 pm





Both Republican-backed bills on artificial intelligence died on the first day of the special legislative session, as Senate Bill 25B-8 and House Bill 25B-1009 did not make it through their respective committees.
“Because of the pace of the special session, I did not have the time I needed to refine the language for the standard our small businesses deserve,” Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican, told the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee before he asked members to vote against his bill.
His bill would have narrowed the definition of “consequential decision” in the state’s forthcoming artificial intelligence law to include decisions related to employment or public safety. The Senate bill, backed by Republican Sen. Mark Baisley of Woodland Park, would have broadly prohibited discrimination using any technology.
Lawmakers are considering changes to the state’s artificial intelligence law, which was passed in 2024 and is set to go into effect next February, at the behest of Gov. Jared Polis. The technology business community worry about implementation of the law, which sets rules for companies that use AI in their decision making, while consumer rights advocates say the law it gives necessary guardrails for technology that can inform life-changing decisions.
The Legislature will likely debate and vote on two competing AI-related bills backed by Democrats. Legislation from the sponsors of the 2024, Senate Bill 25B-4, law would strip the law to become essentially a disclosure policy. The other bill, House Bill 25B-1008, would extend existing civil rights laws and consumer protections to AI and require notice if a consumer is interacting with AI in some circumstances.
The Senate bill passed its committee earlier this afternoon. The House bill’s committee hearing was ongoing as of 4:15 p.m. on Thursday.









Colorado Senate committee approves bill to fund Medicaid reimbursements for abortion providers

The Colorado Senate Health and Human Services committee on Thursday approved a bill to use state money to fund Medicaid reimbursements for reproductive health care providers that have recently faced federal funding cuts.
Senate Bill 25B-2  passed the committee on a party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. The bill was introduced because of the “enormously negative impact” of the federal Republican domestic policy law on Coloradans seeking abortion services and other reproductive health care, bill sponsor Sen. Jeff Bridges, a Greenwood Village Democrat, said. The law, which President Donald Trump signed in July, blocks certain abortion providers from receiving Medicaid funding.
The bill would require the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing to use state funds to reimburse health care providers that are prohibited from receiving federal Medicaid reimbursements. The non-partisan Legislative Council Staff estimates the bill would cost the state a maximum of $4.4 million during the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.
Jack Teter, the vice president of government affairs for Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, said 991 appointments had to be canceled in the days after the federal law went into effect. Planned Parenthood’s operations are now in limbo, Teter said, while challenges to the law’s provision affecting abortion providers move through federal courts.
“We can’t keep canceling people’s appointments and then trying to bring them back again,” Teter said. “It’s not sustainable and it’s not fair to our patients. This bill allows the state to cover the difference for the Medicaid reimbursements and ensures we don’t have to close our doors to those patients.”
During the committee hearing, dozens of Planned Parenthood volunteers and reproductive rights advocates sat in the audience, wearing pink clothing and showing their support for the bill. Teter said PPRM expects more than 150 supporters of the bill to come to the Capitol throughout the special session as the bill moves through the Legislature.
“We sent out a call to action to our incredible activists across the state, and people are showing up,” Teter said. “It’s awesome.”

Special session on Colorado budget woes gets underway

The Colorado House and Senate gaveled in for the special session shortly after 10 a.m. After some procedural business, the chambers recessed to start committee work for the first introduced bills.
Earlier this morning, the caucuses laid out their priorities in separate press conferences.
“We’ve got our work cut out for us. We’re back to address a $1 billion budget shortfall thanks to Trump and Republicans in Congress — $1 billion that should be invested in Colorado, for Colorado, but instead is for tax breaks for corporations and the ultra wealthy,” Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, said.
The Republicans were less optimistic.
“When we walk away from this session, the Democrats will have increased taxes. The Democrats will have done nothing to cut General Fund spending — that’s the $700 million we’re in the red — and the Democrats will not have rebalanced the state’s budget,” Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican, said.
In addition to finding solutions to that revenue shortfall, Gov. Jared Polis tasked lawmakers with addressing health insurance premium costs, tweaking the state’s artificial intelligence law and shoring up food assistance program funding.
Committee work will begin around 11:30 a.m.

The bill was sponsored by Senate President James Coleman, a Denver Democrat, and Sen. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat, who introduced an amendment prior to the vote. The amendment changed the reserve threshold in the bill from the originally proposed 2%, to the current version of 3%.

The sponsors pushed for the bill as a way for the JBC and the governor to partner on mid-year spending cuts during revenue shortfalls, like the cuts Gov. Jared Polis is poised to make after the special session. 
All Senate Republicans, as well as four Democratic senators, voted against the bill.
Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, a Denver Democrat, was one of the no votes, and said he had “a lot of concerns with this bill.”
“The unintended consequences, that I feel that we’re seceding a lot of power to the governor, accountability and responsibility,” he said. 
Senate Bill 25B-2, which would allow the state to pay for Medicaid services from reproductive health care organizations, including Planned Parenthood, that the federal government has withheld Medicaid money from, made it through the Senate in a 23-12 party-line vote, with Democrats in favor. 
Democrats also passed Senate Bill 25B-3 on another party-line vote. The bill would change a referred ballot measure in November to ask voters if the state can use extra money collected for universal school meals to also cover costs related to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
The bill was proposed after President Donald Trump signed the federal Republican tax break and spending cut law in July, which shifted some of the cost burden of SNAP onto states. 
“While our congressional delegation has failed, where they’ve decided to let families and vulnerable people go hungry, Coloradans, in their impeccable wisdom, are stepping up,” said Democratic Sen. Katie Wallace, one of the bill’s sponsors. 
Senate Bill 25B-5 received bipartisan support in the Senate with a vote of 32-3. The bill would reallocate about $260,000 from the wolf reintroduction program to a state health insurance fund. It was amended in committee on Thursday to still allow the capture and release of wolves this winter.
Democratic Senators Lisa Cutter, Tom Sullivan and Katie Wallace were the three no votes. Sullivan cited concerns over the process by which the bill was amended as to why he voted against it.

Dan Innis and progressive organizer Karishma Manzur have announced campaigns.
Manzur, an Exeter biomedical scientist, announced her candidacy in the Democratic primary Wednesday. As a researcher, Manzur studied Alzheimer’s disease and epilepsy. Politically, she’s perhaps most known for op-eds she’s written in outlets like the New Hampshire Union-Leader, the Concord Monitor, and the Bulletin about topics like the war in Gaza and the rise of hate groups in the U.S. She has no previous experience in elected office, but has volunteered with New Hampshire Peace Action, Open Democracy, and the state Democratic Party Rules Committee. 
Manzur has been a staunch defender of Palestinian human rights and opponent of Israel’s actions in the war in Gaza. However, her campaign launch video focused on the struggles of low-income Americans and her own childhood growing up as an immigrant in a working-class family. 
“In the richest country in the world, we have to ask: Why are millions of Americans still struggling just to survive?” she said in her launch video.
In the Democratic primary, Manzur will face U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who became the first candidate in the race in April. Her campaign thus far has not made any direct attacks on her opponent.
Innis, who represents District 7 in central New Hampshire, jumped into the Republican primary in July. He serves on the national board of the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization for gay conservatives, and previously unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District in 2014. Outside of politics, Innis is a farmer and a business professor.
Innis is one of two Republicans in the primary so far. Scott Brown, who represented Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate from 2010 to 2013 before moving to New Hampshire, announced his candidacy for the seat in June.
Innis has tried to frame himself as a strong ally of President Donald Trump and attacked his opponent Brown as not being sufficiently conservative or pro-Trump. However, he’s spent much more time attacking Pappas by trying to characterize him as a “radical liberal” and linking him to national Democratic figures, such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. He’s spoken at length about keeping transgender girls out of female sports and has called on New Hampshire to redistrict mid-decade — like Texas and other states — to create a map more advantageous to Republicans.
“President Trump needs another fighter in the U.S. Senate, and Chris Pappas will only be a fighter for the radical left,” Innis wrote in a recent post. “Pappas votes 94% with AOC and Nancy Pelosi, backing policies that put our adversaries first and make New Hampshire weaker.”

In a 261-page opinion in a lawsuit brought against the state by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President […]","The Alabama Senate chamber on Tuesday, June 6, 2023. A federal judge Friday ruled that Alabama's Senate map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and said a remedy should include a majority or near-majority Black Senate district in Montgomery. ((Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector))A federal court ruled Friday that Alabama’s current state Senate district map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, banning voting laws that discriminate based on race.
In a 261-page opinion in a lawsuit brought against the state by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, said to remedy the situation, the Alabama Legislature must draw a new Senate district in the Montgomery area.
“As the Legislature considers such plans, it should be mindful of the practical reality, based on the ample evidence of intensely racially polarized voting adduced during the trial, that any remedial plan will need to include an additional district in the Montgomery area in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it,” she wrote.
Manasco said the plaintiffs had shown that another majority-Black district could be drawn in Montgomery. She rejected a claim from plaintiffs that state Senate districts drawn in the Huntsville area violate Section 2, writing that the plaintiffs had not shown that they could draw a “reasonably configured district” in the Huntsville area where Black voters would constitute a majority.
Should the court’s decision be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and state legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s 2021 congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, leading to an odyssey that in 2023 resulted in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.
It was not immediately clear Friday if the state would appeal the ruling, though it twice took the congressional case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Messages seeking comment were left Friday for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall; Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen and Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.  Messages were also left with Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, and Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, both of whom represent Montgomery in the Alabama Senate.
Alabama NAACP President Banard Simelton said in a phone interview Friday that he expects the state to appeal the ruling, but is grateful the court is looking at the state’s district maps.
“I think in the bigger picture, it reflects the overall redistricting plan for the state of Alabama was discriminatory. We’re glad that the courts are seeing it for what it is, a discriminatory redistricting plan,” Simelton said. “We will continue to fight for redistricting on the state level, as well as in  municipalities and places like that.”
It was also not immediately clear when maps might be redrawn, should Manasco’s ruling be upheld. A federal court in 2017 ruled that 12 of Alabama’s 105 House districts violated the Voting Rights Act and had to be redrawn. The Legislature did so during that year’s regular session. The Legislature in 2023 drew a new map in a special session; the court rejected the map as unresponsive and ordered its own. Manasco, who ordered new maps be put in place for the 2026 elections, scheduled a status conference for next Thursday.
The plaintiffs claim that the districts in Montgomery and Huntsville dilute Black voting power in the state in violation of the VRA by unconstitutionally packing Black voters into particular districts.
The Alabama chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the fight is not over.
“We are pleased that the court recognized the injustice in Montgomery and is requiring Alabama to fix its unlawful redistricting. While we are disappointed that Black voters in Huntsville will continue to be denied fair representation, the fight is far from over,” said Davin Rosborough, ACLU’s voting rights project deputy director.
The ruling said the court will draw the new districts if the Legislature does not do so in time for use in coming elections.
In both the congressional and Alabama Senate lawsuits, federal judges have noted that voting in Alabama is racially polarized, with white Alabamians tending to support Republicans and Black Alabamians tending to support Democrats. Courts have found that earlier maps allowed Black Alabamians, who make up 27% of the population, to have little practical ability to elect their preferred leaders.
The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month asked plaintiffs in a Louisiana redistricting case to brief them on whether majority-minority congressional districts, the most common method of ensuring minority representation in the U.S. House of Representatives, are constitutional. Ruling them unconstitutional could affect recent decisions about Alabama’s districts.

(Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

A federal judge Friday ruled that Alabama's Senate map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and said a remedy should include a majority or near-majority Black Senate district in Montgomery. ((Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector))A federal judge ruled Friday that Alabama’s current state Senate district map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, banning voting laws that discriminate based on race.
In a 261-page opinion in a lawsuit brought against the state by the Alabama State Conference of the NAACP, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, appointed by President Donald Trump, said to remedy the situation, the Alabama Legislature must draw a new Senate district in the Montgomery area.
“As the Legislature considers such plans, it should be mindful of the practical reality, based on the ample evidence of intensely racially polarized voting adduced during the trial, that any remedial plan will need to include an additional district in the Montgomery area in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it,” she wrote.

Manasco said the plaintiffs had shown that another majority-Black district could be drawn in Montgomery. She rejected a claim from plaintiffs that state Senate districts drawn in the Huntsville area violate Section 2, writing that the plaintiffs had not shown that they could draw a “reasonably configured district” in the Huntsville area where Black voters would constitute a majority.
Should the court’s decision be upheld, it would be the second time in four years a federal court found Alabama’s 2021 congressional and state legislative maps to be racially discriminatory. A three-judge panel that included Manasco ruled in 2022 that the state’s 2021 congressional map did not give Black voters a proper opportunity to choose their preferred leaders, leading to an odyssey that in 2023 resulted in a new congressional map with a majority Black district in west Alabama and a near-majority Black district in the southern Black Belt.
It was not immediately clear Friday if the state would appeal the ruling, though it twice took the congressional case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Messages seeking comment were left Friday for Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall; Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen and Senate Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.  Messages were also left with Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, and Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, both of whom represent Montgomery in the Alabama Senate.

Alabama NAACP President Banard Simelton said in a phone interview Friday that he expects the state to appeal the ruling, but is grateful the court is looking at the state’s district maps.
“I think in the bigger picture, it reflects, the overall redistricting plan for the state of Alabama was discriminatory. We’re glad that the courts are seeing it for what it is, a discriminatory redistricting plan,” Simelton said. “We will continue to fight for redistricting on the state level, as well as in  municipalities and places like that.”

Ron DeSantis and state law enforcement officials Friday touted a recent immigration crackdown in the Panhandle. 
Hours after U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered “Alligator Alcatraz” shutdown within 60 days, DeSantis appeared in Panama City, flanked by federally deputized Florida Highway Patrol troopers who participated in a concentrated crackdown on unauthorized immigration. 
Federal judge halts operations at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’

According to the governor, the operation featured FHP and federal agencies “targeting illegal aliens with criminal records, fugitives, and repeat immigration violators.”
Across three days, 45 troopers and 20 federal personnel in Escambia, Santa Rosa, Walton, Okaloosa, Holmes, Bay, Washington, and Jackson counties apprehended nearly 200 people, DeSantis said. 
The operation, still in process during the news conference, included 37 who’ve previously received final removal orders but had not appeared in court and eight who had been deported before and re-entered the United States, DeSantis said. 
“This operation sends a clear and uncompromising message: We will not tolerate lawlessness in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said. 
People the officers encountered “have fled, resisted arrests, and even physically assaulted officers,” DeSantis said. 
Dave Kerner, director of the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, said local law enforcement’s willingness to house federal inmates has made troopers’ jobs easier. 
“Before we would have to drive hours and hours to a federal facility. That effort alone has allowed us to apprehend hundreds upon hundreds of more illegal immigrants in just a couple days,” Kerner said. 
DeSantis called the task the Panhandle Immigration Enforcement Operation. 
“Moving forward, we don’t have a fancy title or operation title. We had Operation Tidal Wave. We don’t have those anymore because the reality, governor, is, at your direction, this is the way that it’s going to be,” Kerner said. 
Also at the news conference was Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, State Board of Immigration Enforcement Director Larry Keefe, and Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles Col. Gary Howze.

Court ruling
In addition to shutting down the immigration detention facility within 60 days, Williams ordered no new detainees sent there. 
Williams mentioned extensive harm to the Everglades and that the state did not conduct an environmental assessment or issue an environmental impact statement, citing the National Environmental Policy Act. 
“We got news last night that we had a judge try to upset the apple cart with respect to our deportation and detainee processing center down in South Florida at Alligator Alcatraz,” DeSantis said. 
The state has already filed an appeal to Williams’ ruling. 
“This was not something that was unexpected. This is a judge was not going to give us a fair shake. This was preordained. Very much an activist judge that is trying to do policy from the bench. This is not going to deter us,” DeSantis said. 
Williams was appointed by former President Barack Obama. 
“We knew the minute this judge got the case, we knew exactly what she was going to do,” DeSantis said.

A graduate of Jenkins High School and the University of Kentucky, she was active in the UK Alumni Association and her Letcher County community. Quintissa Sherri Peake, who turned a life-altering diagnosis into a lifelong mission, died Aug. 15, at the age of 44. 
Known across Kentucky as an advocate for blood donation and for others fighting sickle cell disease, Peake leaves a legacy of strength and perseverance both in her health advocacy, community contributions and devotion to her faith and family. 
“Quintissa’s impact on this community is a consistent reminder to learn more, advocate for yourself and others, and to defy the odds,” said her friend and executive director of Appalshop, Tiffany Sturdivant. “She was a champion for this community and region.”
The anatomy of Kentucky’s blood supply, and why more need to donate

Peake led a life rich in faith, family and friendship. Born in Neon in Letcher County, to Steve and Rosa Osley Peake, Peake is remembered as a devoted daughter, sister, cousin and aunt; as an invested community member; and as a dear, supportive friend. She is survived by her parents, as well as her two sisters, Latesha Osley and Kaitlyn Peake, and nieces and nephews: Sienna, Kynedi, Alyvia, and Stephen. 
Peake was born into a large extended family of aunts, uncles and cousins. She was intentional about staying in touch with relatives and connecting through family stories and history, said her cousin, Ayanna Peake. She lived out her faith in service to others, Ayanna Peake said, and that always included her family. 
“Family was the essence of who she was. She loved fiercely and was fiercely loved by others and by God, and her life was testimony to what that looked like.” 
 ‘A sickle cell warrior’

Diagnosed with sickle cell disease at 11 months old, Peake’s experience with the disease compelled her to become an advocate for blood donation and sickle cell awareness. Sickle cell disease — also called sickle cell anemia — is a group of inherited disorders that affects the movement of red blood cells throughout the body, and can cause serious medical issues. 
She shared stories of the childhood ambulance rides from the mountains of Southeastern Kentucky to hospitals in Lexington and Louisville, of the family, friends, doctors and health care providers who supported her along the way, and of the blood transfusions that saved her life. In her lifetime, she received more than 500 blood donations. In interviews, she called herself a “sickle cell warrior.”

Peake was employed at Kentucky Blood Center as a donor support specialist from 2009-2013 and remained a devoted volunteer, said Eric Lindsey, director of media and branding for the Kentucky Blood Center. 
“She was one of our finest champions,” Lindsey said.
He recalled a video shoot scheduled in Louisville in the days following the July 2022 flood that devastated East Kentucky and damaged the Peakes’ home. Despite the disaster, Peake showed up in Louisville, three hours away, to appear in the commercial. 
“That’s who she was,” Lindsey said. “She was someone who wanted to help other Kentuckians.” 
Her faith allowed her to show up even when she wasn’t feeling well, said her cousin Ayanna Peake. “She did things even when she was not 100% but she still persisted and did what she needed to and what was in her heart to do,” Ayanna Peake said. 
After graduating from Jenkins High School, Peake earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Kentucky. She was a longtime volunteer with the UK Alumni Association, serving as a member of the association’s Leadership Advisory Council, a past member of its Board of Directors, as well as a former Fayette County Alumni Club and Lyman T. Johnson Constituent Group volunteer. In 2012, she was awarded the UK’s Joseph T. Burch Young Alumni Award. 
“She loved the University of Kentucky and wanted to leave it better than she found it,” said Jill Smith, executive director of the UK Alumni Association. “Our volunteers loved working with her and respected her. She was a little bit quiet, but people listened when she spoke. She had no enemies.”

After returning to live in Letcher County, Peake became involved in her local community. She served on the Appalshop board of directors and the Cowan Creek Community Action Group board, as well as the Hemphill Community Center. With Cowan, she led the annual Martin Luther King Jr. Breakfast. “Quintissa was moving this work forward in all the right ways,” Cowan leaders posted online this week. “In her honor, with her spirit, we will continue this important work.” 
Earlier this year, Peake was awarded the East Kentucky Leadership Foundation’s Carolyn Sundy Award for her community leadership. The award recognizes an East Kentuckian who has made an extraordinary contribution to understanding, inclusion and social justice in the region.
Recently, she worked at the Center for Rural Strategies as a Rural Assembly Fellow, focusing on health advocacy. Teresa Collins, who worked with Peake at Rural Strategies, said Peake had a welcoming nature that made everyone feel at ease. 
“She was genuinely interested in people and how she could help make everyone’s life better. She loved her family beyond measure,” Collins said. “I will miss her terribly. The world is a bit dimmer without her light.”
Yet that light lives in those she inspired. Her legacy, says friend and colleague Sturdivant, is raising awareness for sickle cell anemia, driving effective conversations around social and economic development for better opportunities and livelihood for local community members, and being an amazing daughter, sister, auntie, and friend.
“Never letting anyone or anything hold her back,” Sturdivant said. “Strength and perseverance rooted in love. That is the legacy she leaves to all of us.”

In Sublette County, a felony animal cruelty charge has stirred feelings of gratitude, but also trepidation that another dark, hate-filled period is on the horizon.
The post A divided Wyoming community, reeling from a tormented wolf and deluge of threats, braces for Cody Roberts’ prosecution appeared first on WyoFile .","PINEDALE—Kari DeWitt knew she was signing herself up for unpleasant times by talking with a journalist. But the 14-year Sublette County resident, office worker and mother of three, did just that, sharing words in support of Cody Roberts. 
“By saying this to you, I will get death threats,” Dewitt said Thursday from a shaded picnic table outside of the public library. “I’m going to have to live with the repercussions of this through Christmas.” 
Next came the words she worries will spur the harassment. 
“Cody is not a psychopath,” DeWitt said. Roberts, she said, is a “good dad.” 
“He did something incredibly stupid while drunk. It’s so bad. I get how bad it is,” Dewitt added. “But I almost feel like the response is as bad. Threatening to rape his daughter is as bad to me as what he did to that poor wolf.” 
Roberts, a 40-something owner of a local trucking company, tormented a gravely injured wolf — an animal he allegedly struck with a snowmobile until “barely conscious” — in a way that attracted global ire.

In February 2024, he posed for photos while holding a beer alongside the wounded animal, its jaw bound with tape. Later, he brought the animal to the Green River Bar in nearby Daniel, where the tape was replaced with a muzzle and the wolf was strapped with an electronic shock collar, images from the night show. In one widely circulated image, he even leans over and kisses the wolf. Officials haven’t commented on how the wolf died, but WyoFile was told the animal was shot behind the bar. Roberts has never commented publicly on the incident.
The scorn was further inflamed by what critics see as the leniency of his punishment, a $250 discretionary fine issued by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department for possessing wildlife. 
But that wave of anger and outrage didn’t just slam into Roberts. It’s tough to overstate the scope of the threats and harassment that subsequently rained down on the 9,000-resident county, which is dotted by historic ranchland and economically driven by gas-drilling and tourism. It occupies a mountainous, sagebrush-strewn swath of Wyoming that’s objectively stunning.

“Our emergency management person, Jim Mitchell, went on special duty just to deal with the backlash,” DeWitt said. “Our sheriff’s office had to assign a whole person to deal with it. And then our schools went on enhanced precautions.” 
“It had died down,” she added, “and that’s the hard part of this.” 
DeWitt, and many others in Pinedale, worry the fury and disruption to normal life is soon to return due to a grand jury’s indictment of Roberts. The charge, of felony animal cruelty, could potentially culminate in a trial that casts another intense spotlight over the community.

Albert Sommers, a cattle rancher and former Wyoming speaker of the House, understands DeWitt’s concerns. After Roberts’ actions with the wolf became public in early 2024, he defended Roberts’ character, calling him a “decent guy,” in a WyoFile interview. 
“I had calls all hours of the day and night,” Sommers recalled Thursday. “Nasty, nasty things.”
Still today, he said, “people are afraid to talk.” 
But not everyone. On a Thursday walkabout along Pinedale’s main drag, Pine Street, a WyoFile reporter and photographer approached a dozen or so locals to gauge the community’s views on the advancing prosecution of Roberts. Most agreed to talk, and even put their names to their reactions, expressing a wide spectrum of feelings. Some shared a desire that the incident, which gave Sublette County a black eye, would just go away. Others were grateful for the indictment, seeing it as a step toward justice. Yet others felt conflicted. 
Longtime Sublette County resident Ricky John Chamberlin took a break from a midday beer and cigarette at the Corral Bar to weigh in. Roberts, who he knew as long ago as middle school, has a history of making a public mockery of captured animals, he said. 
“He’s done this before, with a coyote,” Chamberlain said. “I know this isn’t the first time that he’s done something with wildlife.”

Taking injured animals into establishments as a “novelty” to take photos of and impress friends is behavior that the Pinedale carpenter called “a bunch of shit” and “fucked up.”   
“Torture an animal after you ran it over with a snow machine?” he said. “I believe in animal cruelty. I have a dog.” 
Chamberlin’s also of the mind that the Wyoming Game and Fish and Sublette County “dropped the ball” in their initial response to the incident. In the aftermath of Roberts’ wolf stunt, he was reportedly “going around town telling people it was worth” the $250 fine. Wardens had the option of issuing steeper penalties, requiring a court appearance that could have culminated in jail time, but declined to do so. 
Early on, Sublette County Sheriff K.C. Lehr contended he didn’t even know about the episode until a month later when it blew up in the media. 
But Chamberlin also wasn’t convinced that Roberts deserves jail time. And he chalked up Sublette County Prosecuting Attorney Clayton Melinkovich’s successful effort to charge the Daniel man with a felony as being politically motivated. 
“I think he’s doing a little bit more for reelection,” Chamberlin said.

Incidentally, Melinkovich had answered a question about the same allegation minutes earlier outside the Sublette County Circuit Court building. Grand juries, by nature, can deflect the blowback that can come with charging controversial crimes, because it’s 12 jurists — not the prosecutor — ultimately making the decision. 
Melinkovich maintains that politics — and the vociferous outcry from advocacy groups — had nothing to do with it. 
“I raised my hand to do this job, and part of that job is to prosecute all crimes that occur in Sublette County,” he said. “I’ll tell you this, it wasn’t to take a target off my back. The reality of the situation is that the investigation stalled because of a lack of willingness for people to speak.”

Before the grand jury, just one eyewitness from the bar, out of 30-plus people who stopped by the Green River Bar on Feb. 29, 2024, cooperated with the investigation. Melinkovich guessed it wasn’t because they all condoned Roberts’ behavior. Rather, he speculated it was related to the avalanche of harassment and “people not wanting to be publicly doxxed,” harassed and threatened.
Nevertheless, no one would talk save for the whistleblower who reported the incident. 
“That law enforcement investigation stalled,” Melinkovich said, “and the only way to keep it going was to convene the grand jury.” 
Melinkovich couldn’t discuss the proceedings or evidence presented — it’s sealed and confidential under state statute — but he said publicly at the case’s one-year mark that the delays were because of forces out of his control. A third-party lab took many months to process an undisclosed piece of evidence, and just as the results came in, a heinous murder occurred within his jurisdiction: Big Piney resident Dakota Farley was shot and killed with a compound bow. 
“My attention was drawn to that homicide case, understandably,” the county attorney said.

After Roberts was indicted this week, the news spread widely, with headlines even in the New York Times. In the first 24 hours, Melinkovich didn’t experience any personal blowback to his prosecution’s advancement. Just the opposite. 
“I’ve heard support locally from individuals that I know and don’t know,” Melinkovich said. Emails have come in expressing gratitude from overseas, he said, and over the course of a 12-minute interview, the attorney received three supportive text messages “from around the state.”
Plenty of Pinedale residents are glad Roberts has been charged, and they aren’t afraid to say it. 
“He needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent,” Bob Swanson, a local builder, said outside the Sublette County administration building. “I’m not a big animal activist, by any means. I’m just a normal guy. There’s obviously a lot of people in Daniel that thought that was OK and acceptable, and I disagree.” 
The Pinedale Roundup editor Cali O’Hare, who’s faced a notably tumultuous month — her newspaper abruptly closed, then was purchased and  reopened — said that she thinks the indictment is a step in the right direction for Sublette County, which has been cast in a “real negative light.” 
“I think it was meaningful to a lot of Sublette County residents that this go through the proper channels, and the proper process, to confirm either his innocence or guilt,” O’Hare said from her office Thursday. “A lot of people that I’ve heard from and talked to, they really felt like all of Sublette County has had to pay the price for his actions — and then lack of accountability, and lack of remorse. They were sort of caught in the crosshairs just by virtue of also living here.”

Harassment and threats haven’t flooded Sublette County only because of out-of-state activist types. O’Hare’s dealt with it too, and been open about it. Out to lunch with fellow journalists in the wolf fiasco’s wake, she noticed a man who wouldn’t stop staring. 
“Finally, he got his check,” O’Hare recalled. “He came over and he looked at me and said, ‘Eat shit, you fucking libtard.’” 
The newspaper editor tracked down the man’s name. “I found that, in fact, he’s been very vocally in support of Cody,” she said. 
Covering the legal proceedings in the months to come will be “super hard” for O’Hare, who isn’t looking forward to it. 
“But I will say that, in light of the last two weeks … it’s a privilege for me to get to be here and continue to tell that story,” she said, noting the community’s brush with becoming a news desert.

Some residents are ready for that story to be done. Heather Bixler, a 14-year resident, bemoaned how the Sublette County Sheriff’s Office can’t post on Facebook a year-plus later — even for an innocuous event like Mother’s Day — without attracting bitter comments about Cody Roberts. 
“We don’t support what he did,” Bixler said. “It’s also the time where we need to move on.” 
The same heavily trolled Facebook page includes a comment, posted below a public safety message about Pine Creek flows, suggesting that Sublette County will never move on. 
“Cody Roberts’ name will forever taint this county,” a faceless Facebook user posted. 
Pinedale retiree Fran Korfanta, a 45-year resident, welcomed the grand jury’s indictment of Cody Roberts, and agrees that her community may never recover.
“The decision was a long time coming, but too late — there should have been more done initially,” Korfanta said along a Pine Street sidewalk. “I don’t think the blemish will ever go away for this area. It will always be there.”

The state’s prison and parole workers are currently represented by the Vermont State Employees’ Association, which handily overcame a challenge from a different out-of-state union in 2021.

An out-of-state union is vying to represent Vermont Department of Corrections staff.
The National Correctional Employees Union filed a petition with the Vermont Labor Relations Board on Thursday requesting an election. In its filing, the union reported more than 30% of unionized Vermont correctional staff had shown a desire to be represented by the new union.
The labor relations board will need to verify that claim and would then schedule an election. To change unions, a majority of the corrections unit would need to vote to make the switch.
This isn’t the first time an out-of-state union has attempted to usurp the Vermont State Employees’ Association by seeking to represent Vermont’s prison and parole workers. In 2021, the New England Police Benevolent Association filed a similar petition. Corrections staff later voted by a nearly two-to-one margin to remain in the state employees’ union.
The Department of Corrections declined to comment.
The National Correctional Employees Union petition was filed by Giovanna Peruzzi, who works as an organizer for the union in Vermont. She previously worked as a Vermont corrections caseworker and for the Vermont State Employees’ Association.
In an interview Friday, Peruzzi said the organizing campaign began in earnest early this year. The appeal of the out-of-state union, which represents over 50 local branches across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, is its focus specifically on corrections, she said. Its staff all have experience working in the industry.
“Corrections is a field unlike any other,” Peruzzi said. “It affects your home life, your family, unlike any other work that is out there. Correctional officers are forgotten about. They do a lot of the same functions as other first responders without any of the recognition.”
Leading up to the union election, Peruzzi said the National Correctional Employees Union team will continue visiting Vermont correctional staff.
“I’m not sure this campaign will be successful,” she said. “I’m hopeful. I feel there’s good energy on the ground and people are looking for new representation.”
The Vermont State Employees’ Association is not perfect, its Executive Director Steve Howard acknowledged in an interview. But the union has a strong track record of representing prison and parole staff and working with Vermont’s state administration, he said. He pointed to $30 million in additional compensation over three years the union secured for corrections staff, as well as a new retirement plan that allows employees to retire earlier.
“We’re going to keep making our case that we are the powerful Vermont union that has a record of success,” Howard said. “(The National Correctional Employees Union) wants to build a massive empire. As soon as they have our members’ dues, they will be on to the next state. We’re not going to do that.”
The current contract for corrections unit staff expires next summer, and bargaining for a new contract began last week, according to Howard.
The primary issue for corrections workers is addressing the department’s staffing crisis, Howard said, a challenging problem for any union to address. But the difference he drew between the two unions is that VSEA has the experience and power to negotiate with the Vermont state government.
“We’re not afraid to speak truth to power, and we’re not afraid to take on the administration,” Howard said. “So I think our members will make the right decision.”

While South Dakota farmers in parts of the state can expect bumper yields due to good weather this season, he said, “commodity prices are in the tank.”
“Input costs are at an all-time high, and the margin for farmers across South Dakota is upside down,” added Thune, a Republican.
Increasing demand for agricultural products through opening markets and trade is a component to improving profitability for farmers, Thune said. South Dakota exports about 60% of its soybeans.

But export markets to some countries like China and in southeast Asia have slowed in recent months as President Donald Trump’s trade and tariff policies play out. The American Soybean Association sent a letter to Trump this week saying that soybean farmers can’t survive a “prolonged trade dispute” with China – the country’s largest soybean customer.
South Dakota Soybean Processors CEO Tom Kersting boasted about another option for South Dakota soybean farmers in the wake of tariffs: the High Plains Processing plant expected to open in mid-October near Mitchell.
Kersting participated in a panel discussion on Wednesday about the new plant before South Dakota’s congressional delegation took the stage. The $500 million plant is expected to process up to 37 million bushels a year – roughly 16% of the state’s 2024 soybean production, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data.

The processing plant will include a refining operation and offer byproducts such as soybean meal and hulls as well as lecithin, which has uses ranging from food to lubricants.
The plant aims to fill growing demand in the U.S. for biofuels, Kersting said. The processing plant will offer “more stability in an uncertain future,” Kersting told South Dakota Searchlight after the presentation.
“This will kind of take the place of that export problem and uncertainty out of the marketplace that farmers are facing right now,” Kersting added. “We’re there every day. These export customers come and go.”
South Dakota Soybean Association President Kevin Deinert told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel discussion the operation will allow producers to become less dependent on whole soybean exports to China. Local processing will encourage more use locally, Deinert said, and open markets to other countries.
Kersting added that the processing plant is the first of its kind in South Dakota, with equipment to process seeds from other plants like camalina, canola and sunflowers. Canola and camelina seeds have up to 40-45% oil content, versus the 18-22% present in soybeans.
“Whatever the market demands or takes, we’ll make the most of our money,” Kersting told attendees. “This flexibility was driven off of the increasing demand, not just in the U.S. but globally, for vegetable oils.”
That demand is for biofuels that have “transformed oil markets.” A decade ago, most soybean oil went into food, but about 46% of soybean oil in 2022 and 2023 went toward biofuel production.

Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds said during the policy panel that “the jury is out” on whether tariffs will help or hurt agriculture. If trading partners who normally buy farm and ranch products impose retaliatory tariffs, then that’s a concern.
On the other hand, the tariffs or trade deals arising from tariff threats could force countries to increase their imports of U.S. goods. Some countries in the Pacific Rim are interested in purchasing U.S. ethanol because of the tariffs, Rounds said. That means “at least part of the ethanol that we’ve got right now is going to benefit from those tariffs being imposed,” Rounds said.
“We’ve absolutely got to be adding value to every single product we’ve got here in South Dakota,” Rounds said. “That means running it through as many times as we can. The ethanol plants have got to be able to maximize as much as they possibly can.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_5179-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said groups challenging a 2013 law banning assault weapons and a second gun control law enacted a decade later could not show that the guns they are still able to possess, including several semi-automatic handguns, are not sufficient for self-defense purposes.
The 2nd Circuit also said public interest favors allowing the ban.
The appeals court said the Second Amendment lets legislators implement targeted regulations designed to protect residents and their children from experiencing tragedies like the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 26 lives.
The ruling came at an early stage for two lawsuits brought by individuals and gun rights groups. It upheld a Connecticut judge’s ruling that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood that they would win their challenge to block enforcement of the laws while the lawsuits proceed.
Several lawyers who represented plaintiffs in the litigation said in a statement that the ruling “ignores the U.S. Supreme Court’s clear and specific directives, and elevates ideology over constitutional rights. The Supreme Court must put a stop to our courts treating the Second Amendment as if it were not part the Bill of Rights.”
Hannah Hill, vice president for the National Association for Gun Rights’ legal wing, a plaintiff in the lawsuits, said the 2nd Circuit judges displayed an “utter disregard for multiple Supreme Court precedents.”
She said the decision “almost reads like a bingo card for how many ways they can trample on all of those precedents.”
“This is not the end. We’re going to keep fighting,” she said, adding that the Connecticut litigation is one of several efforts in multiple states that gun advocates hope to eventually get the Supreme Court to address.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a release that he has “no illusion that today’s clear decision will stop the gun lobby’s relentless campaign to flood our communities with ever more deadly weapons.
“We will not back down, and we are going to fight with everything we’ve got to keep these weapons of war off our streets, out of our schools, and away from our families,” he said.
Joshua Perry, an attorney who is now in private practice but worked on the case when he was Connecticut’s solicitor general, said the ruling was “a comprehensive, important win for the people of Connecticut.”
He added: “We showed that the Constitution doesn’t leave us defenseless against the menace of gun violence.”
In a decision written by Circuit Judge John M. Walker Jr., the appeals court said the proliferation of unusually dangerous weapons has “led to a frequent, growing, and extremely lethal threat to public safety, actual and widely perceived” that the authors of the Constitution could not have imagined.
“And such incidents remain distressingly frequent,” it said. “The Founders faced no problem comparable to a single gunman carrying out a mass murder in seconds.”
The 2nd Circuit, based in Manhattan, said it joined all five other federal appeals courts that have addressed the issue by upholding the ban.
In doing so, it said it recognized “a historical tradition of regulating unusually dangerous weapons after their use in terror or to perpetuate mass casualties.”
It noted that the development of the Thompson submachine gun in 1918 and its subsequent use by gangsters in mass shootings, led to the National Firearms Act of 1934. That law prohibited ownership of machine guns, submachine guns, and short-barreled shotguns.
“Historical legislators regulated these unusually dangerous arms, like here, after observing the regulated weapons’ unprecedented lethality. They did so, like here, to prevent the use of these especially dangerous variants of otherwise lawful types of weapons in further acts of mass homicide and terror,” the judges wrote.

Restoration of Lynn’s waterfront has developers closing in on city’s South Harbor,Hallie Claflin,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/housing/the-new-seaport-district-restoration-of-lynns-waterfront-has-developers-closing-in-on-citys-south-harbor/,"
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions and has been a key part of the city’s ongoing growth and economic revitalization plans. But affordable housing advocates have raised concerns about the kind of development that Harbor Park has attracted - comparing the South Harbor to Boston's wealthy Seaport District.
The post The new Seaport District? Rest[...]","DESPITE BEING a waterfront city of over 100,000 people, much of Lynn’s coastline has been inaccessible to residents for decades due to environmental hazards. But thanks to a new park, residents can now enjoy a view of Lynn Harbor that had been obstructed by garbage for decades.  
The Lynn Harbor Park finally opened to the public in July after a years-long environmental remediation effort. Spanning 22 acres, the park sits on a failed municipal land-fill – once a plant that used coal to produce gas for lighting, heating, and cooking – that was close to collapsing and releasing waste into the sea. The lot had been vacant for 40 years.  
The project – led by Charter Development in collaboration with the city and the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs – created long-desired green space along the scenic waterfront in an area of Lynn once considered untouchable.  
“Our hypothesis was that if we resolve the environmental liabilities at the core, that that would create confidence, and it would create action that would then attract follow-on investment,” Charter’s founder and president Robert Delhome said in an interview.  
The waterfront is one of Lynn’s major attractions and its development has been a key part of the North Shore city’s ongoing growth and economic revitalization plans. As the Harbor Park project neared completion, investors came flocking to the South Harbor. But affordable housing advocates in Lynn have raised concerns about the kind of development the park has attracted.  
Since the project’s start, two major waterfront housing developments have been established on abutting parcels of land – one of which is the largest private investment in the city’s history.  
Samuels & Associates is planning to build 850 units of much-needed housing and 26,000 square feet of commercial space for restaurant and retail use on the South Harbor site at 830 Lynnway. It will also include an eight-acre public park and promenade. Crews are expected to break ground next summer, according to Mayor Jared Nicholson’s office.  
The Lynn City Council approved a $45 million, 20-year tax break for the Boston-based developers at the end of 2023. Samuels & Associates agreed to designate 10 percent of the units affordable for residents making 60% or less of the area median income (AMI). But local advocacy groups like Neighbor to Neighbor and Lynn United for Change raised concerns about the 900,000-square-foot project’s level of affordability.   
As of 2025, the 60% AMI limit – a measure set by the federal government and used by housing programs to determine eligibility for deed-restricted affordable housing – for a family of four in the Boston-Cambridge-Quincy Metropolitan area, which includes Lynn, is just over $99,000. Lynn’s median homeowner household income of $85,892 is more than double the median renter household income of $34,096. 
But Gabe Cohen-Glinick, an organizer from the Lynn chapter of Neighbor to Neighbor Massachusetts, a social and economic justice group, said 85 out of 850 units isn’t nearly enough to address the need for affordable housing. 
In addition to the 850-unit development, new construction at the former Lynnway Mart Indoor Mall and Flea Market property began in 2022, where 550 “luxury” apartment units have been built on the South Harbor waterfront by Connecticut developer Post Road Residential. “The Shipwright” began leasing this year, and one-bedroom units start at $2,525 per month.  
Local housing activists have compared the development of South Harbor to the technology-driven redevelopment of Boston’s wealthy Seaport District, which has resulted in a mostly high-income, white neighborhood on a previously underutilized waterfront.  
“The vision for the South Harbor feels to us somewhat similar to the nature of Seaport, which is pretty exclusively for mostly young, single adults who are making a high amount of income to live there,” Cohen-Glinick said. “Sort of to create this more trendy, hip, younger, sleek, chic area of development.”  
There is less than one deed-restricted affordable housing unit for every four eligible households in Lynn, according to a 2021 Metropolitan Area Planning Council housing report titled “Housing Lynn: A Plan for Inclusive Growth.” At that time, the city needed 15,405 more affordable housing units just to meet the needs of current residents.  
The report also established that nearly half of Lynn’s residents were at risk of being priced out of the city, with 42% of households qualifying as housing cost burdened, meaning that they spend over 30% of their income on housing.  
But the MassINC Policy Center’s 2024 Gateway Cities Housing Monitor report found little evidence to support fears that extensive gentrification is taking place in Gateway Cities from newcomers driven out of high-cost Boston. Apart from Everett, Malden, and Revere, the report found that those moving into Gateway Cities – largely driven by immigration – have lower incomes than those already there.

The city is expected to receive approximately $120 million in taxes over the next 30 years from the 850-unit development. The property currently generates $60,000 in property tax revenue per year.  
“There’s an urgency around meeting the housing crisis that doesn’t feel as much of a priority as bringing in development money,” Cohen-Glinick said. “The city needs more money. It’s great to have a park. At the same time, the most pressing thing, if you talk to 99% of Lynn renters, is not enough affordable housing.” 
Mayor Nicholson said making the growth on the waterfront inclusive has been a top priority for the city, and that the 10 percent affordability is consistent with the city’s expectations for the contribution of private projects to affordable housing inventory. Private projects can only bear so much affordability until the project is no longer financially feasible.  
“This project will provide much-needed housing, including affordable housing, good jobs targeted to Lynn residents,” Nicholson said in a statement. “The affordable units will have a preference for Lynn residents, and the public park and retail space will make this site into a destination for any Lynn resident, which is critical to making sure growth on the waterfront benefits our community.” 
He added that there are several other 100 percent affordable, publicly funded projects in the works. In 2022, the city of Lynn created an Affordable Housing Trust Fund that has helped to create and preserve affordable developments. Cohen-Glinick argues that while helpful, these projects are slow and limited. 
Charter Development has completed over 50 landfill remediation projects over the last 30 years, according to Delhome. Their brownfield redevelopment expertise helped them tackle the problems at the site, which had seen development stalled for decades. Coal tar contaminants – remnants of the gas plant – were among the hardest to remediate, and capping and covering the failed landfill required a large volume of regulated soils and sediments to be imported.  
“The Harbor Park helped to catalyze almost a billion dollars’ worth of investment on the waterfront, while still creating green space for the residents that are already there,” Delhome said.

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
‘Nowhere else to go’
B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
‘Already stretched’
According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Planned Parenthood is again challenging South Carolina’s ability to remove its clinics from Medicaid’s provider list for non-abortion health care services.
The nonprofit’s filing Thursday marks the latest in a seven-year-old case stemming from Gov. Henry McMaster’s 2018 executive order that sought to ban all Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood’s two clinics in the state.
The order never took effect. Planned Parenthood immediately sued, and the lawsuit blocked the directive as the case bounced back and forth in the courts. A ruling in June by the U.S. Supreme Court seemed to settle it and, on Thursday morning, South Carolina was officially given permission to carry out the order.
Within hours, Planned Parenthood filed a new challenge. It wants the courts to consider a different argument and is seeking to again block the order while the amended complaint plays out.
McMaster’s spokesman called it “nothing more than a desperate, last-gasp attempt to relitigate an issue that has already been decided.”
“The U.S. Supreme Court has made clear that South Carolina has the right to exclude abortion providers from our Medicaid program,” said Brandon Charochak.
But Planned Parenthood contends the nation’s high court didn’t directly address the state’s ability to exclude the provider. The ruling involved who sued. Justices ruled Medicaid patients don’t have the right to sue to see their doctor of choice.
The new filing removes the patient from the complaint.
Rather than sue on someone’s behalf, Planned Parenthood’s new filing argues the state is violating the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause by unfairly targeting the nonprofit.
The case is not about abortion — not directly, anyway — but whether South Carolinians can use their Medicaid health coverage at Planned Parenthood for services such as breast and cervical cancer screenings, birth control, and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.
“What started as a crusade against abortion has devolved into an even greater assault on essential, preventive care,” Paige Johnson, President and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, said in a statement. “The cost of this political attack will be the health and well-being of hardworking South Carolinians — cancers will go undetected, STIs will go untreated, and people won’t have the birth control they need to plan their futures.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img_3704-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

Phil Murphy Friday direct regulators to expand community solar generation and offer incentives for large-scale battery storage plants.,"The new laws signed by Gov. Phil Murphy Friday direct regulators to expand community solar generation and offer incentives for large-scale battery storage plants. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Gov. Phil Murphy signed two bills meant to boost renewable energy generation in New Jersey on Friday, as tightening supply and surging demand push electricity prices to record levels with even more hikes on the horizon.
The first bill allows state energy regulators to register an additional 3,000 megawatts of community solar capacity, while the other would create an incentive program to stand up 1,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030.
“Today, there are roughly 650,000 homes throughout the Garden State that are powered by solar energy. With these bills, we’re going to increase that number to 1 million homes by 2028,” Murphy said during a bill signing at a union hall in Lawrenceville. “That’s an increase of over 50% in just three years. That means cheaper, cleaner energy for tens of thousands of New Jerseyans at a faster pace than ever before.”
Democratic and labor officials praised the expansion of community solar, which allows homeowners and businesses to invest in nearby small-scale solar farms to receive credits on their power bills.
Community solar is meant to provide solar access to individuals and firms that are unable to access rooftop and other solar systems because they rent, occupy a multi-unit building, or lack roofs that can host a solar system.
New Jersey’s solar capacity has more than doubled under Murphy’s two terms as governor, rising from 2.4 gigawatts to 5.2 gigawatts, and its boosters said community solar delivers guaranteed savings for those enrolled.
“Over 28,000 New Jersey residents are subscribed and are saving money through the community solar program due to the guaranteed bill savings of at least 15%,” said Christine Guhl-Sadovy, president of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.
The state’s foray into battery storage would be its first, and New Jersey officials are hoping to make the state a leader in the field. Though battery storage plants do not generate electricity themselves, they can store power generated at points of low demand and release it when demand is high, easing price peaks.
To apply for the incentives, storage projects must have a completed interconnection agreement, or developers must have conducted certain interconnection studies with PJM, the states’ grid operator, and be expected to be operational by Dec. 31, 2030.
Eligible plants could receive up to $10 million in incentives, at a rate of $100,000 per megawatt. Those awards would be paid over 15 years, with the first payment due only after a project becomes operational.
Some experts have urged the state to pursue storage projects because they come online faster than other types of generation. Nuclear plants, for example, can take a decade to build. Some storage projects have been stood up in less than two years.
Incentives would initially be funded by $60 million in revenue from the state’s societal benefits charge, a roughly 3% surcharge on energy bills used to fund energy assistance, clean energy, and social programs, among other things.

“This money is not money that’s being added to the rates of ratepayers. You don’t want the solution to be part of the aggravation to our citizens,” said Sen. Bob Smith (D-Middlesex), the storage bill’s prime Senate sponsor.
The push for new generation comes as New Jersey and the 12 other states on PJM’s grid, along with others throughout the country, see surges in electricity prices driven mostly by artificial intelligence data centers’ mammoth electricity demands. Officials have approved bill credits and deferred a portion of some electricity bills to ease the impact of rate hikes.
Democratic officials have blamed PJM for being too slow to connect renewable projects to its grid, while Republicans have charged Murphy’s wind-heavy energy agenda is to blame.
Among other things, PJM’s rules prioritize projects with higher effective load-carrying capacity, a generation type’s ability to produce electricity at times of peak demand. Because they cannot operate at night and in adverse weather conditions, solar projects have by far the lowest rating on that scale — 8% for fixed-tilt and 11% for tracking solar, compared to 50% to 70% for storage projects and 60% to 78% for various gas types of plants.
The state’s offshore wind projects are stalled or abandoned after adverse economic conditions and a hostile regulatory posture at the federal level that has seen offshore wind leases and permits paused or withdrawn.
The federal government’s resistance to renewables could stall the investments officials hope the bills signed Friday would spur.
Provisions in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act require renewable projects to begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be in service by Dec. 31, 2027, to be eligible for two types of tax credits, one that pays a fixed amount for electricity generated and another that offsets capital investments for some projects.
The federal bill also made changes to program rules that will make it more difficult for projects that meet the time bar to qualify for credits.

(Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)ATLANTA — Here comes another Florida Man.
A Florida resident already sits in the White House, surrounded by many top aides and federal officials who hail from the Sunshine State. 
On Friday, the Republican National Committee unanimously voted to elevate state Sen. Joe Gruters, a long-time supporter of President Donald Trump who has a strained relationship with Gov. Ron DeSantis, to the post of RNC chair.
In a brief acceptance speech, Gruters thanked Trump for his support and focused on party unity, stressing that the future “isn’t about one person.”
“The midterms are ahead, where we must expand our majority in the House the Senate and continue electing Republicans nationwide, and then we march towards the presidential election where the stakes cannot be higher,” he said. 
“The Democrats want open borders, socialist policies, and weak leadership. We want strong families, secure communities, and American greatness. That’s why we must unite, innovate, and work harder than before.”
Gruters, a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida who has served as RNC treasurer, was hand-picked by Trump after RNC chair Michael Whatley announced he was stepping down to run for a U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina.
Whatley, who introduced Gruters to the gathering, credited him for turning Florida from a purple to a red state. Gruters led the state party from 2019 to 2023 as the number of Republican voters surpassed that of Democrats.
In an interview with the Florida Phoenix Thursday, Gruters said his main focus is to help Trump maintain majorities in both the House and Senate during the mid-term elections.
“I’m 100% completely focused on supporting the president, his mission, his vision, and making sure that we’re successful in midterms,” Gruters said.

Gruters takes the reins as Trump pushes for the elimination of mail-in voting and while rival states controlled by Republicans and Democrats engage in tit-for-tat redistricting, especially Texas and California. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been pushing the state Legislature to look at drawing a new congressional map. His party already controls 20 of Florida’s 28 congressional seats.
“We don’t need redistricting to hold on to the majorities in the House and Senate,” Gruters said. “We’re going to win because the president is committed to winning. I think that we have the right messaging. I think we have the right coalitions.”
Gruters plans to remain in the Florida Senate while heading the RNC and said he was therefore barred against discussing any redistricting effort in Florida. The Florida Constitution includes “Fair Districts” amendments that say legislators cannot redraw maps for partisan gain. Some Florida Republicans have maintained that they could gain several seats if they make changes to existing districts.
 ‘Gold standard,’ ‘golden ticket’

On mail-in voting, Gruters called Florida’s system, which allows it, the “gold standard.” It’s a position DeSantis also takes.
But Gruters did not question Trump’s push to get rid of it. He also said the RNC would be “aggressive” with litigation to preserve “election integrity.”
“We’re here to make the president successful,” Gruters said. “And I think what the president’s looking for is to make sure that we protect the vote.”
While Gruters and DeSantis share the same position on Florida’s mail-in voting, the men routinely have been at odds.
Gruters was one of a minority of Republicans in the Legislature who endorsed Donald Trump over DeSantis early in the GOP presidential primary in 2023. Gruters in the 2024 election supported Amendment 3 to legalize recreational marijuana, while DeSantis aggressively and successfully lobbied for its defeat. Gruters sponsored legislation quashing governors’ oversight of immigration policy that the Legislature passed in January but DeSantis vetoed.
Gruters’ elevation to national leadership will have ripple effects in Florida’s elections. He says he’s got Trump’s endorsement, a coveted “golden ticket” that he could have cashed in had he continued his planned run for state chief financial officer. DeSantis recently appointed another state senator, Blaise Ingoglia, to that Florida Cabinet post.
In appointing Ingoglia, DeSantis criticized Gruters as insufficiently conservative for GOP voters. He told reporters in July, “If George Washington rose from the dead and came back and tapped me on the shoulder and said, ‘Will you appoint Joe Gruters CFO?’ my response would be ‘No.’ “
Gruters insisted during the interview that he would have prevailed in a primary against Ingoglia had he pushed ahead.
“At the end of the day, I had the president,” Gruters said. “People don’t like this comment, but I had the golden ticket. And I’m sure George Washington appreciates the fact that I’m going to be chairman. If he was alive, he’d be cheering for me as chairman of the party, because we’re  going to win and we’re going to win big.”

The president first called for Cook’s resignation earlier this week, after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice on Wednesday, accusing Cook of falsifying bank documents and property records “to acquire more favorable loan terms,” for properties in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta, Georgia.
Now, both Trump and Pulte are bolstering their attack on Cook, with Pulte posting documents to social media on Friday accusing Cook of misrepresenting her Atlanta property as her primary residence while listing the same property for rent. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Alongside Cook, Pulte has made referrals against New York Attorney General Letitia James, who secured judgment against Trump for misrepresenting his assets in financial statements, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), who served as the lead prosecutor in Trump’s first impeachment, accusing all three of mortgage fraud. In another post on Friday, Pulte said he would be making referrals against two additional individuals.

A spokesperson for the Board of Governors had no additional comment to share, referring the Michigan Advance to Cook’s previous remarks on the allegations. 
“I learned from the media that FHFA Director William Pulte posted on social media that he was making a criminal referral based on a mortgage application from four years ago, before I joined the Federal Reserve. I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” Cook said in a statement Wednesday evening. “I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”
Trump’s call for Cook’s resignation comes amidst his ongoing fight with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, with the president demanding Powell cut federal interest rates.
Under the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, members can only be removed by the president “for cause.” 
Cook was nominated to fill an empty seat on the Board of Governors in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden. She was confirmed for an additional, full term in 2023, which will expire on Jan. 31, 2038.
Cook is the first Black Woman to serve on the board, previously serving as a professor of economics and international relations at Michigan State University and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. 
Cook has also served as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under Democratic former President Barack Obama from 2011 to 2012 and as a senior adviser on finance and development in the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of International Affairs from 2000 to 2001.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/trumpjohnsonmay202025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

The $2.5-billion Steel Dynamics aluminum mill is visible from one window and the airport from another. Just down the road are the Airbus factory that has built 1,700 helicopters, the 400-acre PACCAR site that churns out engines and Stark Aerospace, which was awarded a $61-million defense contract last year. These are companies that Joe Max Higgins and his team have helped bring to the area. 
“It’s in the middle of the kingdom,” said Higgins, the CEO of Golden Triangle Development LINK. “I mean, you can just look. It’s all here. You can just walk around and see everything.”

The headquarters was previously located on Main Street in Columbus. But Higgins said that the agency has wanted to move to a more central location for a while. The new headquarters sits on land owned by the Golden Triangle Regional Airport, which is run by all three counties. 
LINK  is the regional economic development organization for the three-county area known as the Golden Triangle. It is funded by the three county governments and private backers. This melding of public and private interests was represented at Tuesday’s opening event by the attendance of public officials and business leaders.
The event honored Bobby Harper, a former member of the board of directors, who was instrumental in acquiring private funders to support the organization. 
“We could not be here today without Bobby’s work,” said Higgins at the opening ceremony.
The three counties now work together on economic development but it wasn’t that way when Higgins started. At first he was just working for Lowndes County.

“I was real slow to embrace the regionalism stuff. I just always believed that the only way you win is to tear everybody’s face off,” said Higgins. “That’s still true, but I will tell you that once we put the three counties together, I found out that I had more bullets for a gun, more resources, more places for people to live, more opportunities, and more money.”
Higgins is legendary for his economic development efforts, even outside of Mississippi. He’s been negotiating deals for the Golden Triangle since he was recruited from Arkansas in 2003. Since then his team has brought in over $10 billion in capital investment and over 10,000 jobs.

In the process, Higgins has developed a national profile for bringing in manufacturing jobs to the region. This has included profiles on 60 Minutes and in The Atlantic. 
Even as more manufacturing moved out of the U.S., the Golden Triangle has continued to invest in manufacturing. And it’s not slowing down.
The group is working on finding a company for its fifth “megasite,” a 1,400-acre piece of land that can accommodate a large scale industrial operation. The organization recently announced a $90-million aluminum processing facility is in the works close to their new headquarters. 
“The guy that grabs a hold on a tiger. The Tiger starts running. What do you do?” Higgins responded when asked what the next 20 years of development in the Golden Triangle would look like. “Do you let go and the tiger eats you up, or hang on and you don’t know where you’re gonna end up? I think you hang on, and so I think that’s what we’re gonna do.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/22095555/MG_8131.jpg,,,2025-08-22 13:57:29.049289

Jason Crow of Centennial, both Democrats, held a town hall on Aug. 21, 2025 at Smoky Hill High School in Aurora. (Photo by Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline) Two of Colorado’s Democratic members of Congress held a town hall at an Aurora high school Thursday, speaking to a crowd of about 500 people as the Colorado Legislature convened for special session to cope with a billion-dollar state budget gap.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet and U.S. Rep. Jason Crow of Centennial answered constituent questions about concerns with artificial intelligence, environmental protection, bipartisanship and preserving democracy, among others at a town hall at Smoky Hill High School in Aurora in Crow’s district. 
Crow said the Republican tax and spending cut bill Trump signed into law in July poses a “tremendous threat to the lives and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people that we represent.” He called the measure — known as H.R. 1, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — “the worst piece of legislation that we have ever voted on.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The Colorado Legislature is currently in a special session to address a $1.2 billion hole in the state budget the federal legislation created, because Colorado’s income tax code automatically mirrors changes at the federal level.
All four Republican members of Colorado’s congressional delegation voted in favor of the bill. All four Democrats in the House and both of Colorado’s Democratic U.S. Senators voted against it.
Concern with actions from the Trump administration was a common theme among town hall attendees. Paul Stedman, a 72-year-old Aurora resident wearing a shirt with the American flag that read “pro-America, anti-Trump,” asked what can be done to “preserve this democracy that I’ve enjoyed and felt like it was safe for all these years, and now I don’t feel that it is.”
Crow said citizen oversight will help elected officials remain aware of ways the federal government is overstepping, as they can let their members of Congress know when they have problems with their federal benefits or agencies they interact. 
“It’s getting harder to do oversight in the federal government because of the blockades, because of what this majority has allowed to have happen with this administration, so citizen oversight is becoming very important,” Crow said. “We must build a coalition of pro-democracy, patriotic Americans who are willing to stand up, even if we disagree on policy, and says, ‘No, not on my watch. We will defend this democracy, we will fight for the fundamentals of it.’”
Instead of asking a question for the Democrats to answer, one constituent asked both Crow and Bennet to do more to call out President Donald Trump’s lies, and said town halls are for communicating concerns to their elected officials, “not a rally for politicians.” She both should use their national platform to speak out more against the president’s actions and words. 
Call for AI regulations
After a constituent asked what is being done to increase federal research spending on AI and to encourage safe and responsible deployment, Crow said “we’re not remotely ready for it as a society.” 
Crow said AI can be an important tool, but the lack of regulation of AI is concerning. He also said it could lead to “one of the greatest workforce displacements in history,” estimating AI may replace up to 20% of the workforce. 
“We haven’t seen anything like that since the Industrial Revolution,” Crow said. “It could cause major upheaval, and we have to get ready for that retraining, that re-skilling, that transition for a lot of folks.”
Both Bennet and Crow agreed that AI also presents national security concerns and would like to see the U.S. lead a convention or treaty to establish guardrails against AI with other major world leaders.
“We are at the cusp of a technological revolution on the scale of software or the internet, and we don’t know on the front end how all that is going to go,” said Bennet, who is running for Colorado governor in 2026.
Colorado passed a first-in-the-nation sweeping AI regulation in 2024 to set anti-discrimination guardrails for businesses that use the technology in decisions on consequential matters such as loans, employment, insurance policies and school admissions. Colorado state legislators are considering four bills to modify that law during the special session currently underway.
‘He’s lost my support’
A group of people stood outside of the high school holding a Palestinian flag and handing out flyers with information on funding the federal government has sent to Israel and campaign contributions both Bennet and Crow have accepted from pro-Israel lobbying groups. During the event, staff for Crow and Bennet escorted out a small group of people who interrupted to ask about their support for Israel, a scene that has recurred at Democratic town halls in Colorado and across the country. 
Centennial resident Kimberly Roy and her son Adan, who is a senior at Smoky Hill, have campaigned on Crow’s behalf since he first ran for office, Kimberly said. But at the town hall Thursday, Kimberly came with a Jason Crow-branded t-shirt and Adan with a bunch of yard signs in hand that they wanted to return to him because “he’s lost my support.”
Bennet and Crow, she said, showed a “complete disregard to the people who brought up the genocide going on in Gaza, where babies are being shot and killed with our weapons.”
“They said, not only nothing, but they kicked them out and did not address the issue,” Kimberly said. “That is the moral litmus test of our time, and they failed.”
“I value these pieces of plastic far less than I value the lives of children,” Adan said while holding Crow’s campaign signs. “I’m hearing a lot of excuses or inaction against banal evil.”
Recent reports estimate about quarter of the population in Gaza is experiencing famine and more than 60,000 Palestinians — including almost 19,000 children — have been killed by Israeli military since Israel’s intense bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza began after Oct. 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel. Israeli leadership announced plans to completely seize Gaza and forcibly displace about a million residents in early August, which Bennet released a media statement condemning. 
“I’m heartbrokenly disappointed. I thought he had courage, and what he is showing right now is cowardice,” Kimberly said of Crow. “There are babies and children dying today that if he said something, he can make a difference, and he is not addressing it because it’s politically hard.”
Kimberly said she would have wanted to see Crow and Bennet speak less and listen more to the concerns constituents at the town hall wanted to share. She heard “a lot of self-congratulation” from the two Democrats touting their accomplishments in Congress, but that given the “perilous state” the country is in, “this is the time to be humble and listen to what they need to be doing better, not try to sell us on what they’ve done that’s good.”
Aurora resident Sandra Parker-Murray said she wished Crow and Bennet would have addressed the people who were escorted out after interrupting to ask why they continued to approve sending money to Israel. 
“I felt like they should have given those people the opportunity to ask those questions,” Parker-Murray said. “Why are we sending so much to Israel for genocide, and then our children here are hungry?

Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard. 


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — County treasurers must correctly calculate and distribute the payments made by public utilities in lieu of paying property taxes. They also must correct any mistakes they make, the Nebraska Supreme Court ruled on Friday.
Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr., who was the treasurer at the time in Douglas County, overpaid the Omaha Public Schools, the City of Omaha and Douglas County from payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) funds in 2021. His name is on the case that sorted out the duties of local treasurers.

But Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke’s opinion makes plain that its aim is to clarify some confusion a lower court ruling left over whether county treasurers had the duty and ability to fix such funding mistakes they make as part of their ministerial duties.
At stake is sorting out potentially millions of dollars in annual payments county treasurers distribute to school districts from the utilities that provide electricity statewide. 
“The ministerial duty is one imposed on the treasurer to distribute the PILOT funds based on the exact formula adopted by the people and required by the Legislature,” Funke wrote. “In requiring that the treasurer distribute the PILOT funds in a specific manner, it must be … that the treasurer’s duty is only accomplished when he or she has facilitated that exact and particular distribution.”
The high court also clarified that Omaha’s Westside Community Schools was well within its rights to file a second legal bid to recoup the funds it was not paid from 2019 through 2021 after a lower court vacated the initial case on a technicality. 
A state audit that spurred much of the legal action found that in 2021 Westside was underpaid by $3.7 million and that schools in Elkhorn and Ralston were underpaid by more than $4 million. Omaha Public Schools, the audit found, received about $5.6 million too much. The City of Omaha received $4.4 million too much. And Douglas County received $2.7 million too much.

The court case avoided assigning specific amounts owed. 
Lawyers for the Omaha school district had argued that the law was murky on whether the treasurer could collect funds overpaid to districts, based on the previous formula calculations, an argument the state Supreme Court rejected.
“Westside has met its burden of proving that it is entitled to the PILOT funds it did not receive,” the ruling states.
Ewing has previously defended his office’s mistake, describing it as an inherited interpretation of state law that the Douglas County Treasurer’s Office had used for six decades. Ewing’s opponents in the mayor’s race made an issue of the payments during his successful bid to unseat incumbent Mayor Jean Stothert. 
Westside, OPS and Ewing had no immediate comment Friday.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”
‘Clear message’
The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

Two groups in the Inland Northwest are bringing together people of various faiths to find common ground and unite around social justice projects despite their different beliefs.
Providing housing for people facing homelessness, providing food and other basic necessities for residents and ensuring all people are afforded human rights are key priorities for Faith Leaders and Leaders of Conscience of Eastern Washington and North Idaho (FLLC) and Moscow’s Interfaith Council.

The groups comprise multiple faith traditions, including Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Baha’i and Unitarian Universalist congregations, and several Christian denominations.
“The variety of faiths in this area is really extraordinary,” said the Rev. Gen Heywood, pastor of Veradale United Church of Christ and convener of FLLC.
 Faith Leaders and Leaders of Conscience advocates for policy changes for people who are low income

FLLC organizes vigils to collectively overcome racism, poverty and ecological violence, Heywood said. The group is organized around the agenda of the Poor People’s Campaign, which advocates for policy changes to meet the needs of poor and low-income people. In addition to vigils, participants sign letters to the editor and letters of condolence to draw awareness to these issues.
Crucially, FLLC’s vigils are not protests, and the spiritual and non-spiritual leaders who attend are not there to yell or shame others. They are there to grieve. Recent vigils have centered around the golden rule, the ethical principle of treating others how you would want to be treated.
“I want people to see our shared common humanity,” Heywood said. “And it becomes a problem when some people don’t believe other people have the rights that come with being fully human.”
FLLC participants gathered at U.S. Rep. Michael Baumgartner’s Spokane office on July 8 to discuss his vote for the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which was passed into law on July 4.
Heywood said FLLC will exist as long as it fills a need in the community.
 Moscow Interfaith Council connects people in need to community resources

Pastors and representatives from congregations in Moscow meet monthly to discuss issues related to faith and social justice, such as how religious institutions can house and support people in need who pass through town, said Annette Bay Pimentel, communications director for the Moscow, Idaho, Stake of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
The council connects people in need with one of the religious institutions or local nonprofits, such as Sojourners Alliance or the Latah County Human Rights Task Force, said Walter Hesford, an Interfaith Council member representing Emmanuel Lutheran Church.
The Interfaith Council also distributes information to its respective congregations about community programs like food drives, Pimentel said.
“As people of faith, we are concerned about the needy and people in crisis,” she said. “No single person or congregation or faith tradition has all of the answers. So it’s valuable for us to be part of community-wide solutions and remember the work we’re doing isn’t limited to our congregation.”
 Family Promise partnerships spur other projects

The Palouse River Ward of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wanted to participate in Family Promise of the Palouse, a nonprofit organization that supports homeless families — but the congregation could not host families in their building.
The Unitarian Universalist Church of the Palouse had a building and some volunteers, but needed more hands for every week they hosted Family Promise, up to six times a year.
“It was like night and day when they started helping us,” said Nancy Nelson, a volunteer organizer and UUCP member. “They’ve made it so much easier, and they’ve been a delight to work with.”
Moscow churches collaborate to create book nook for North Idaho school children

Wards in the Moscow Stake have been paired with other congregations for Family Promise for around 10 years, Pimentel said. Many of those congregational partnerships have expanded to take on other community service projects, including building a new family library at the Russell School Community Hub.
The library will be a space for children to relax and read while their siblings shop for clothes at the Community Hub. Then, they can take books home with them for free.
The Palouse River Ward and UUCP both value education, reading and access to books for children in need, said Ken Faunce, chair of the UUCP social justice committee.
“Even though our faith is not exactly the same, we share an immense amount in common,” Faunce said. “That’s [a desire] to help people, help the community, make people’s lives better. We may disagree on details, but we have that as the core.”

 Year-round collaborations

UUCP also partners with St. Mark’s Episcopal Church for Weekend Food for Kids, a program that provides free meals every Friday during the summer, he said. In conjunction with Moscow School District’s free summer lunches served Monday through Friday, this ensures children have meals every day of the week.
The wards in the Moscow Stake join with other congregations for an interfaith choir that performs concerts around Christmas and Easter, said Ricki Martin, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
“I just think there’s so much good in the world and so many negative things going on, I just love to be able to focus on the things that are good,” Martin said.

Free.,FBI raids Maryland home of Trump critic John Bolton,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/fbi-raids-maryland-home-trump-critic-john-bolton,,"WASHINGTON — FBI agents raided the home and office of former Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, a one-time adviser to President Donald Trump who has become a frequent critic of the president, to investigate Bolton’s handling of classified documents, according to multiple media reports.The raid on a former Trump adviser’s house represents an escalation from the Justice Department in targeting critics of Trump, whom he vowed to go after should he return to the White House for a second term.Speaking to reporters Friday, Trump said he was not briefed on the raid of Bolton’s house in the wealthy suburb of Bethesda, Maryland, and office in Washington, D.C., according to White House pool reports.But the president noted his longstanding feud with his former adviser.“I'm not a fan of John Bolton,” Trump said. “He's a real sort of a low life. He could be a very unpatriotic guy. We're going to find out.”Earlier this year, the president revoked the security detail for Bolton, who served as Trump’s national security advisor from 2018 to 2019 and as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the George W. Bush administration in 2005 and 2006.Following his time in the Trump administration, Bolton, who was an important member of the Bush administration’s national security team that favored active military involvement in the Middle East, emerged as a chief Republican foreign policy critic of Trump, authoring a 2020 book that blasted the president and widened the public rift between the two men.Bolton has not been charged with a crime and is not in custody, according to The Associated Press, which cited a person familiar with the matter.The first Trump administration launched an investigation into Bolton to probe if he improperly used sensitive information in his book.

When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.
But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

,California,2025-08-22 16:55:00+00:00,CalMatters,"For California high-speed rail to succeed, part of the Central Valley will have to wait",Yousef Baig,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/california-high-speed-rail-strategy/,"In a new report for the Legislature, the California High-Speed Rail Authority's top executive seems to be betting that a blunt conversation and different funding strategy could convince lawmakers to back a new direction for the project.","Since Gov. Gavin Newsom’s first State of the State address six years ago, California has stopped pursuing a high-speed rail system that actually connects the Bay Area to Southern California, as was promised to voters in 2008. And in that void, politicians, pundits and a mostly partisan minority of voters howled and cried boondoggle, discounting the new focus — building only the Central Valley segment — in the same breath.
In a project update for state lawmakers released Friday, the California High-Speed Rail Authority unveiled the latest ridership and revenue projections for the Central Valley line and several other potential routes. The new data — the project’s first in two years — paints a harsh picture of an unprofitable bullet train, beset by too few riders in the state’s agricultural heartland, and costs for upkeep that would dwarf the money it makes unless it expands.
Authority officials have previously acknowledged that the 171-mile Merced to Bakersfield line would require a subsidy to operate, a point often drowned out in the narrow debate that surrounds the project. Authority CEO Ian Choudri, now one year into the job, seems to be betting that a blunt conversation and new funding strategy — free of government aid — could convince lawmakers to endorse a new direction.
But there’s a potential catch: It only might be feasible if the project is allowed to put the northernmost extension to Merced on hold.
Salvation for high-speed rail apparently lies in Gilroy, the world’s garlic capital, and its potential to connect Silicon Valley to the Central Valley — or even as far south as Palmdale — by 2038. As the southern terminus for the Caltrain system, the agrarian city has long been considered high-speed rail’s best chance of reaching San Francisco.
It’s a bold vision worth supporting, despite the significant technical, legal, regulatory and political hurdles. Choudri, who has previously worked on high-speed rail in France and Spain, appears dead set on ending the project’s reliance on fluky government grants and attracting private investors, as many foreign bullet trains have done. 
“I was not coming here to just say, ‘What is authorized to build?’” Choudri said in an interview. “I was here to give a scheme that works for the entire high-speed rail network — that we committed to do since the inception of this program. So I had to look at other opportunities as well.”
Those opportunities could hollow out some of the promises made to the Central Valley, where local officials are planning and designing train stations, revitalizing senescent corridors and hoping a new artery to Silicon Valley can reel in lucrative new industries. High-speed rail has captured the imagination of historically neglected neighborhoods, such as southwest Fresno, inspiring support in the unlikeliest corners of California’s conservative farm belt.
But retooled analyses show the Merced-Bakersfield line would generate as much as 2.2 million annual rides — just one-third of the yearly trips estimated in the last update for lawmakers two years ago. Passenger revenue similarly plummeted in the newest calculations, generating $55.6 million each year, a far cry from the $156 million presented in 2023. 
Over a 40-year period, authority officials estimate running the Merced-Bakersfield line would result in a $3.8 billion loss. The initial segment currently faces an $8.6 billion funding gap to reach Merced, with costs for the Central Valley phase growing roughly $1.8 billion from the last estimate, now totaling $36.8 billion. 
On a more promising note, the new report estimates high-speed rail could eventually be profitable for California, earning as much as $98.1 billion over four decades. But that would require reaching existing train lines in Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties. 
The most ambitious and rewarding route would cost $87.1 billion. As for the dream of a 500-mile bullet train that marries downtown San Francisco to L.A., that appears to be off the table, at least for now.
Latest projections put Merced at risk
Statewide, a wide majority of Californians still support high-speed rail, especially among registered Democrats and independent voters. That doesn’t mean construction hasn’t been painful, as residents and businesses along the project’s path, from Madera to Fresno to Bakersfield, will tell you.
But it’s Merced that may be cast aside in the pursuit of the project’s larger ambitions. As the home to the newest campus in the University of California system and the “gateway to Yosemite,” Merced has been a seminal player in the high-speed rail discussion. But the authority has also lacked the funding to complete the design work, acquire the land and extend the construction beyond the 119-mile segment well underway.
The report published this week makes it clear that the only viable path is west to Gilroy and south to Palmdale, where the system can connect with Caltrain in the Bay Area and Metrolink and the High Desert Corridor in Southern California. There, the authority could try to piggyback on the enthusiasm for Brightline West, the privately funded high-speed train linking L.A. to Las Vegas later this decade.
In every scenario the authority put forward, the value of extending north to Merced was outweighed by insufficient ridership and expensive maintenance. 
Of course, the California Legislature and governor would first have to authorize the change, including lifting a $500 million spending cap on work outside the Central Valley. But the latest forecasts make it unmistakably clear what direction the project needs to go.
For Merced Mayor Matthew Serratto, to have the city pushed out of the initial segment would squander the time and effort local officials and many others have invested. Businesses in the project’s path, including a grocery store, homeless shelter and more, have been forced to relocate. 
“I think the majority of people are probably gonna say ‘good riddance,’” Serratto said, noting the community’s animus for the project. “But I think a lot of people, too, are gonna say one — especially those in government — we’ve been planning for this for a long time. And two, we recognize that this is potentially a major benefit to our area. So yeah, there’s going to be disappointment.”
The need for contagious urgency
As determined as Choudri is, he will need a lot of things to go his way.

The most urgent is convincing the Legislature to back Newsom’s 15-year cap and trade extension, a long-running program that allows major polluters to pay for their emissions through a market system of auctioned credits. The market operates independent of the state’s general fund, and has provided about $1 billion each year for the project.
The governor’s proposal would help high-speed rail sustain that amount until 2045, solidifying the only funding stream the project has had apart from the $10 billion bond voters backed in 2008, and federal grants, which have been completely upended under President Trump. Unlike most transportation projects, the state has covered the vast majority of funding, accounting for almost three-quarters of the budget.
Cap and trade is key to attracting private investment, Choudri said, and represents the primary funding source for closing the Central Valley budget gap. Without it, the project is at risk of collapse. 
That’s not to mention the $4 billion grant the White House clawed back this year. California has sued to force Trump to return the funds. The Republican president did the same thing over a $1 billion grant in 2019, before the Biden administration returned the money two years later.
And that’s just the funding part. In the report, the authority spells out a wishlist of regulatory exemptions, streamlined permitting and help getting outside players, such as courts, railroads, utility providers and local agencies, to move with some sense of urgency.
This is a lot to ask of a state that moves as fast as a horse and buggy when it comes to the things it needs. High-speed rail has always been a token of the self-styled ambition California boasted for generations — even as the state enacted laws and regulations that make aspirations of this scale seemingly impossible.
Choudri is not Californian, which gives him a fresh view of things. He clearly believes in the transformational power of a project that can reshape the state’s economy and unlock a higher living standard for countless households. 
That makes him the ideal candidate to overcome what his predecessors couldn’t, or be the scapegoat if the wheels fall off.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/102023-High-Speed-Rail-LV_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-22 12:58:01.148980

DemasAs the state budget process stretches on, members of the Michigan Public Transit Association are calling on Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and legislative leaders to ensure any deal they may reach on road funding includes support for public transportation services. 
Alongside federal and public funding, Michigan’s public transit systems receive funding from the state based on their eligible operating expenses. In a report released earlier this week, the association warned Whitmer’s proposal of $226 million for local bus operations would result in the lowest reimbursement levels for transportation agencies in the state’s history, continuing a trend of underfunding. 
“Public transit is no longer a luxury; it’s an essential service that Michigan voters strongly support,” John Dulmes, the association’s executive director, said in a statement. “Without necessary funding, local transportation systems across Michigan will be forced to cut routes, reduce service hours and eliminate jobs. This will be disastrous for Michiganders, limiting their ability to get to work, attend school, or travel to necessary medical appointments.”

According to a survey of 31 transit agencies – roughly a third of the number of providers in the state – demand for public transit has increased, with 75% of agencies surveyed reporting an increase in ridership. 
Providers are also seeing an increase in costs, including employee wages and insurance costs, with expenses increasing between 25 and 50% over the past four years. 
While the report noted the largest increases in demand were for medical trips, employment-related trips and school, providers were also considering cuts amid rising costs. 
According to the survey, 69% of agencies had either considered or moved to reduce driver and mechanic hiring. Another 69% of agencies had either considered, or taken efforts to reduce their days or hours of operation. 
Additionally, 92% of providers said they were concerned about depleting their funds or reserves, with the report noting several agencies were relying on a few years of remaining savings to maintain current services.
Should they receive additional funding, 84% of transit providers surveyed reported that they would prioritize expanded services, including longer hours of service, reduced wait times for senior and workforce rides and better use of technology to deliver rides more efficiently.

(Photo courtesy of Evan Cantwell/George Mason University)George Mason University has been found in violation of federal civil rights laws, the U.S. Department of Education announced Friday, citing unlawful hiring and promotion practices. 
Over the past two months, President Gregory Washington and GMU have faced mounting questions after the Department of Education and Department of Justice launched four federal investigations. Two of those involve alleged racial discrimination in employment, while another examines the school’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices. 
The Education Department said Washington was notified of a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin, in institutions receiving federal funds. The university has 10 days to resolve the violations, which the agency said stem from “illegally using race and other immutable characteristics in university practices and policies, including hiring and promotion.”
Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said Washington’s effort to expunge “the so-called ‘racist vestiges’” from GMU’s campus led to a university-wide campaign that imposed unlawful DEI policies. 
“You can’t make this up,” Trainor said. 
“Despite this unfortunate chapter in Mason’s history, the university now has the opportunity to come into compliance with federal civil rights laws by entering into a Resolution Agreement with the Office for Civil Rights,” he added. 
“In the last seven months, this much is clear: The Trump-McMahon Department of Education will not allow racially exclusionary practices — which violate the Civil Rights Act, the Equal Protection Clause, and Supreme Court precedent — to continue corrupting our nation’s educational institutions.” 
Washington will be required to issue a statement affirming that GMU will conduct all recruitment, hiring, promotion, and tenure decisions in compliance with Title VI. He must also ensure the university disseminates information to the campus community explaining how to file a discrimination complaint, according to the announcement.
The resolution further requires the university to review and revise its policies and documents on hiring and promotion to comply with Title VI. GMU must also maintain records demonstrating compliance and make them available to the federal government upon request. 
Some in the GMU community feared Washington would lose his job amid the ongoing investigations. Instead, after a three-hour closed session, the Board of Visitors unanimously approved a 1.5% state-approved salary bonus for him.
In a statement, the Board of Visitors said it is reviewing the proposed resolution steps and takes the matter seriously.
“We will continue to respond fully and cooperatively to all inquiries from the Department of Education, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. House of Representatives and evaluate the evidence that comes to light,” the board said. “Our sole focus is our fiduciary duty to serve the best interests of the university and the people of the commonwealth of Virginia.”
The next board meeting is scheduled for Sept. 25.

A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.

The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”

‘Clear message’

The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

Ebenezer D. Bassett represents integrity. He represents New Britain at its best.,"There’s a street in New Britain that runs alongside Central Connecticut State University, a university defined by education, ambition and pride. But the street, commonly known as Paul Manafort Drive, tells a different story — a story of scandal, federal crime and political shame. Its name doesn’t represent the spirit of this city anymore. 
It’s time to change it. 
The Manafort name is a stain on New Britain’s landscape. Although the street was originally named after Paul Manafort Sr., a former mayor, the public’s perception of the name has been dominated by his son, Paul Manafort Jr., the former Trump campaign chairman who was convicted of fraud. In 2018, Mayor Erin Stewart added “Sr.” to the sign to clarify the namesake. But as Councilman Carlo Carlozzi Jr. rightly pointed out at the time, “adding ‘Sr.’ does not take away the scandal of the Paul Manafort name.” 


Paul Manafort Jr. has admitted to fraud and illegal foreign lobbying. He has been convicted of witness tampering. He spent nearly two years in prison before being released to home confinement in 2020. He was pardoned by President Trump that year, but that doesn’t necessarily restore public trust in him. Manafort had agreed to cooperate with the Mueller investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 election, but he lied to federal prosecutors. His record is not one of public service; it’s one of deception and legal disgrace. So why keep the Paul Manafort name, even with the “Sr.” attached, on a public street?   

Shaniyah President
Instead, the city has a powerful, inspiring alternative: Ebenezer D. Bassett. A graduate in 1853 of what is now Central Connecticut State University, Bassett was the first African American diplomat in U.S. history, appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant in 1869. He was also the first Black student to attend and graduate from CCSU — in just one year.  
Ebenezer D. Bassett represents integrity. He represents history. He represents New Britain at its best. Nine members of the city’s Common Council voted in 2018 to rename the street Ebenezer D.C Bassett Way. But Mayor Erin Stewart vetoed it.  
The city council has stopped pursuing the name change. I think that it’s worth revisiting. This isn’t about partisanship. It’s about character. And it’s about whom and what we choose to celebrate. 
Paul Manafort Jr. may be back working with some people in President Trump’s circle, but that doesn’t mean the Manafort name belongs in our circle. Let’s make room on our street signs for leaders who earned their honor, not those who were pardoned for dodging it.

Then-Gov. Haley Barbour, understanding the necessity of a well-organized, coordinated effort to clean up and plan to rebuild the coastal counties for the long-term future, tapped one of the state’s most successful business leaders Jim Barksdale to chair a special commission.

James L. Barksdale
Barksdale, then 62 years old, had recently sold his company Netscape to AOL. He accepted the appointment to lead the entity tasked with deciding how hundreds of millions in federal and state recovery funds would be spent. Just a few days after the storm hit, he and his wife Donna flew from Jackson to the Coast, where they spent the first few months of their marriage living on the top floor of a casino resort in Biloxi while Jim led the commission.
Notably, leaders across the country have praised him for his service and modeled it in other post-disaster recovery efforts.
To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the storm, Barksdale sat down with Mississippi Today to recount his time leading the Governor’s Commission on Recovery, Rebuilding and Renewal in the fall of 2005.
Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Mississippi Today: Where were you when the storm hit 20 years ago, and what were you doing both professionally and personally? What did your life look like when the storm hit?
Jim Barksdale: It’s interesting because I was in a strange place. Donna and I had just gotten back from our honeymoon. We got back here around the first of August, and the storm hit the end of August. So the storm hit about three weeks after we got back. We later continued our honeymoon a couple years later, but the storm definitely delayed all that. I was here in Jackson. I’d retired here after I sold Netscape to AOL. I was on probably five or six different corporate boards and commissions around the country, but other than that, I was able to take on the job.
MT: How long was it after the storm that you got to the Coast?
JB: Maybe a couple days after the storm hit, Haley Barbour and Leland Speed, who was his economic development director, called me and asked me if I’d come meet them. I met with them, they asked if I’d lead the effort, and less than a week later, we were on helicopters flying down there. One thing I remember from flying over the damage down there, which was extensive and just so incredible to see, was the smell of the beach down near Gulfport. They had these refrigeration warehouses for chicken poultry products waiting to be exported. They were all still there rotting and had not been cleaned out. Even from a few hundred yards above it, it smelled like we were on the ground. It was awful. 
Up and down the Coast, it really looked like an atomic bomb had gone off. People say that all the time, but there’s no other way to describe it. There was really no way to get around. The National Guard had roads blocked off except for first responders and residents. Getting around the debris and the roadblocks was just about impossible unless you had some level of clearance.
We got down there, and the place we lodged ourselves was in a hotel called the Isle of Capri. The front of the building was all busted open from the storm surge and wind with all the slot machines showing. They were working hard to get the slot machines emptied out before they got robbed. The first two or three floors of the high rise building were obliterated by the storm, but somehow the elevator worked to take us up to the room they gave us, which was on the top floor. The room was nice. It wasn’t touched. We had power and water. Up there, unless you looked down at all the mess and debris and the collapsed bridge over the bay, you wouldn’t have known anything had happened.
MT: How long were you and Donna there?
JB: Oh, three or four months on and off. We came back here (to Jackson) a few times and would head back down, but it was about three or four months we lived down there — until right around the first of the year (January 2006).
MT: Was it a surprise or was it unexpected to get the call from Gov. Barbour to head up this commission?
JB: It was a total shock. I didn’t really know Haley. I’d met him before, but we were not close at all. Haley had asked me to be his finance chairman when he first ran for governor (in 2003). Not too long before then, he had said some things publicly about me and the Microsoft hearings that really irritated me, and I turned him down. I hadn’t really talked to him again until he called me about Katrina recovery.
When I went to meet with him and Leland Speed, they asked if I’d lead the commission. I said, “Now look, is this because you’re being a statesman or is it for revenge over turning you down as finance chairman?” He laughed and didn’t really answer the question, but he told me that he thought I was highly qualified to lead a comprehensive effort like that, so I accepted. I was happy to serve the state in that way. Donna and I had just been married, and she calls it our “Category Five Honeymoon.”
Later, Haley and I got to be good friends. He’s still a good friend of mine.
MT: It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years since the storm, but looking back on the work of the commission, what are some of your proudest accomplishments during your time as chairman and what y’all were able to do in those first few months?
JB: The thing I’m most proud of that we were able to accomplish is that we brought so many people of the Coast together to help them build plans for the future, and we gave them hope for their communities. Really, the most important thing we did was give them hope in such a difficult moment in time.
You know, as a group, we came in with this idea that the best way to get started was just get everybody involved, to get everyone busy. There was so much to consider. It may sound simple, but just getting started as quickly as we did was something to be very proud of.
We started these charrettes, or small working groups, as a way to get a lot of people involved in one project. We got the mayors involved as the leaders and some others involved, and let me tell you, it worked. They worked their cans off. The mayors were there every day, night and day. It was literally 24 hours for them. You’d go in at 2 o’clock in the morning, and there would be all the mayors in there working with their teams. We had architects and engineers flying in from literally all over the world helping us. There were architects from Italy that came, people from England that were part of the royal planners, Prince Charles’ team. It was amazing how many people from all over the world came and would just drop a team of people. We had renowned experts who were there to meet with the leaders of every Gulf Coast town and have them lay out their dreams.
We had a wonderful group of people, smart and hardworking who were there to transform these cities across the coastline. There wasn’t really anything for them to do except work — they obviously couldn’t go out and eat, couldn’t go out and have fun or anything, so they just worked. We fed them all there at that hotel, used their big ballroom to be the meeting places, and they broke off in the subcommittees in smaller rooms.
We divided the volunteers up in groups for each different community. If I remember correctly, there were 11 communities on the beach at that time. And we came up with some marvelous ideas for how to pull this place, to put it back together and take it into the future. Not all of them were implemented. Some of them were visions and dreams and so forth. Some worked, most didn’t. But they got some version of them working just about everywhere. That would be another thing I was proud of.
I’m also proud of the dozens of town halls we had during that time. I went to every one of them along with the local people. We would just sit there and answer questions from the citizens. And a lot of them were hard questions that we, quite frankly, didn’t have all the answers to. I think by the end of the meetings, people for the most part liked and appreciated the fact that we were there and being transparent and trying to answer all the questions. They were all scared and worried about the future, and we tried hard to make them feel heard and let them know we cared and were working very hard on their behalf.
I think we formed 11 committees run by some of Mississippi’s finest people — people who were mostly from the southern part of the state. We learned a lot from those meetings, and I remember there were a couple where people got up and cussed us, but it was really helpful for us to listen and apply what we heard to our planning.
MT: You’ve focused so much of your life and personal philanthropy on public education. I know that a big focus for you during your time leading the commission was getting schools back open. Can you talk about that?
JB: We knew we had to get the kids back in school. It was so important because if schools weren’t open, parents would move away. The storm hit right at the start of the school year, and many of these buildings were just totally washed or blown away. So we came up with the idea to have two schools running in one school building, for example. We’d have a morning school and an afternoon school. If there was a school building standing, we’d get kids from other schools to meet there for half a day just to get them back in the classroom somewhere. For the buildings that got destroyed in some cases, we brought down a bunch of house trailers to serve as temporary schools.
We reopened the last public school on Nov. 12, 2005. That was the day that New Orleans reopened their first public school. In New Orleans’ defense, they had decided that they’d use the storm as an opportunity to change everything over to charter schools. So they had to get the legislation done and do all that work, but the problem was that delayed getting kids back into classrooms. The children didn’t get into school nearly as quickly, most of them probably until after the first of the year (2006). Also, the Mississippi Coast didn’t lose as many people as New Orleans did. But we were very proud of how quickly we got classrooms and schools reopened.
MT: And I know there was a huge focus on housing for the thousands of people who were displaced and had nowhere to go.
JB: If I remember correctly, we lost about 4,000 housing units during the storm. Of course that’s counting homes, apartments, anywhere else a family could live, but we lost 4,000 housing units. We lost a whole group of Section 8 houses. We lost several big apartment buildings, and then we lost a lot of single family houses. The houses, in most cases, were just moved totally off of their foundations. They just floated away. You’d drive up on them and they looked like they were perfectly fine, but you’d look a little closer and see that they were sitting on dirt 50 yards from the foundation.
We spent a lot of time getting temporary housing built up and set up all over the place, just to get people somewhere they could live and survive. I could never get my head around exactly how we were going to build 4,000 units. But amazingly, within a few months, we had 4,000 units available at least temporarily. And after five years, we had 8,000 permanent new or rebuilt units available. I don’t think all of them were brand new, but they were good units. They were, in most cases, better and stronger than the 4,000 on average that we had lost. I would not have believed that.
MT: You’ve done a lot of really important things over the course of your life and career. With this experience, in particular, how did it stack up for you? What are some of the things that have stuck with you personally over these 20 years?
JB: I was proud to play a more individual role in some things, and I learned a lot from working with so many smart people. One of the best examples of that is after we’d gotten a big pot of money to rebuild the bridge over Biloxi Bay between Biloxi and Ocean Springs.
We got a design, a big curving design so you could take the ships under it with their masts to go to Trinity Yards and build yachts up there. But we wanted to do it at as little cost to people as possible. We had the money, and all we needed was the approval of the two mayors. So we had a meeting down at the Biloxi City Hall. There were a lot of people in there from representing the towns and architects and the builders and so forth, and it quickly became obvious during that meeting that we just weren’t going to get the mayor of Ocean Springs (Connie Moran) to sign off on a bridge design that didn’t have a walkway going alongside the bridge. The plan we’d drawn up for lower budget reasons didn’t have any architectural features on the bridge, it didn’t have any landscaping. That was the way we kept the price down. It was going to cost $9 million more or something like that to do those three things.
The mayor of Biloxi (A.J. Holloway) kept saying, “Look, we don’t want to go back and ask for more money. We got this all federal money, we’ve got it now, we don’t want them to pull any back, let’s just rebuild the bridge at a base level and get it back open.” He also kept arguing that nobody would use a walking trail over the bridge anyways, that it’d be too steep to climb, the climate was too hot, that we didn’t need it. Mayor Moran was strong, I give her credit. She was adamant that the walkway was necessary.
People started leaving because they didn’t think we’d find a resolution, and I asked the mayors, “Why don’t we go in another room here?” We got the mayors and the highway commissioner in a side room together. I forget who else was in there, maybe a couple more people. I looked at them and said, “We can make this decision right here. Now, Connie, your point is you are not going to accept this design unless it has these features, and A.J., you’re not going to accept the design if they modify it unless they come up with more money to pay for it.” I said, “Look, here’s the deal. I’ll either get or give the $9 million myself. You have my personal commitment to that.” We all shook hands and went back out and announced that we’d agreed to the design with the walkway.
The funny thing was the next morning, Butch Brown (the executive director of the Mississippi Department of Transportation) called me and he said, “Yeah, Jim, we’re not going to make you give that $9 million. We found the money in the budget somehow.” You know, in business, sometimes it’s just a matter of getting everyone in a room and coming up with creative solutions. That was an example of that.
A very funny part of this story is that I was down in Biloxi for the 10th anniversary of the storm. A.J. Holloway was there. He came over to me and he said, “Jim, I’ve got a terrible cold, but I had to come down here just to see you. He says, “You realize this, but that bridge right now, that’s the most popular thing going on in this side of town. There are hundreds of people who walk over that bridge every day, they ride bicycles and everything.” He said he had even walked over it some. He said, “I just want you to know that I was wrong and I’m willing to eat crow.”
That was just one story of many, but it just shows you how important it was during that time to just find ways to bring everyone together and get buy-in from a lot of people with varying interests.

According to the Environmental Protection Agency, at least 45% of the nation’s tap drinking water is estimated to have one or more types of PFAS. State data show that at least 171 public water systems in 96 cities in Massachusetts have contaminated water that exceeds the state’s limit.
The post “They’re in everything:” Massachusetts lawmakers explore soluti[...]","As the risk of toxic forever chemicals grows, a handful of Massachusetts legislators and advocates are looking for solutions to the complex problem.
Last week, a group of Massachusetts lawmakers, agency officials, and advocates visited Maine to speak with well owners and farmers who have been impacted by the contamination of forever chemicals and learn more from Maine about how to deal with the problems they create.
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS or forever chemicals, are widely used, do not break down over time, and can end up in the air, soil, and drinking water. Found in food packaging, household cleaning products, cooking products, cosmetics, firefighting foam and biosolids – human-waste-turned-fertilizer that comes from wastewater treatment plants – PFAS can cause medical problems like decreased fertility, developmental delays and effects in children, and increased risk of some cancers and obesity.
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, at least 45% of the nation’s tap drinking water is estimated to have one or more types of PFAS. State data show that at least 171 public water systems in 96 cities in Massachusetts have contaminated water that exceeds the state’s limit.
“Something that we’re really grappling with is the knowledge that these chemicals, they’re in everything, they’re industrial, they’re in municipal wastewater,” said Representative Steve Owens of Watertown, who was a part of the delegation’s trip to Maine.
Maine is one of the leaders in PFAS regulation in the country.
In 2021, Maine was the first state to pass a law banning the sale of products intentionally containing PFAS. Last year, the state lowered the rate of the PFAS allowed from 20 parts per trillion in drinking water to the federal standard of four parts per trillion starting in 2027. The Massachusetts standard is 20 parts per trillion.
Massachusetts leaders hope to understand Maine’s “learned lessons” in handling their PFAS problem, said Senator Jo Comerford of Northampton. She said one of her biggest takeaways from the trip was that Maine farmers asked for PFAS regulation and that their input was crucial in crafting legislation.
“It was important to find out how [Maine] navigated the balance between protecting farmers, protecting the food supply, and protecting public safety,” Owens said.
Forever chemicals are commonly found in everyday products, making it difficult to stop their usage. Maine made exemptions last year to its landmark PFAS legislation to allow certain products to contain the chemicals when their use can’t be avoided, such as lab equipment, medical devices, human and animal medications, and vehicle equipment.
In a statement, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection said that addressing PFAS is a “top priority” for the Healey administration. Last week, Gov. Healey signed a law phasing out the use of forever chemicals in firefighting foam.
In February, Comerford proposed a law that would make farmers immune from lawsuits and civil liability for any damages caused by PFAS found on their farms and establish a fund for farmers who suffered PFAS-related losses. The proposed Agricultural PFAS Relief Fund would allocate money to farmers to test their soil, water, and agricultural products for chemicals and help them with the costs of adopting new standards.
“I believe farmers are not liable at all for this, and we have to be maximally supportive to farmers as one piece of this larger PFAS puzzle,” she said.
Owens also proposed a law earlier this year prohibiting the use and sale of biosolids, a step Maine has taken. Banning biosolids from being used as agricultural fertilizer, Owen notes, would prevent PFAS from being put back into the food chain and from polluting the environment.
While it is a renewable source, Owens claims biosolids can be taken out of the farming process because it is “not as nutrient-rich a source” as organic fertilizer and contribute to PFAS contamination. 
Owens’ bill is only one part of the puzzle when it comes to biosolids. If biosolids are not being used as fertilizer, they could end up in landfills, which also adds them back into the environment. Currently, there is no solution for completely eliminating them.
“We want to do our part to reduce how much of this gets into our food supply, and we want to do it in a way that doesn’t punish our farmers for testing it in the first place,” Owens said.
While these bills make their way slowly through the legislative process, forever chemicals continue to contaminate the environment. Legislators say it is an urgent problem, but working quickly to enact new policy may cause its own set of problems.
“Everything has to be planned for, and that was one of the big lessons of Maine,” Comerford said. “Because it’s so important that we get it right.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — State health officials have declared the measles outbreak over in southwest Kansas, where dozens of cases affected mostly unvaccinated children.
The Kansas Department of Health and Environment announced Thursday that no new cases have been reported or confirmed in the past 42 days after cases peaked at 87. Health officials announced in March the first case of measles in Kansas since 2008.
“The end of the recent outbreak does not mean the threat of measles is over,” officials said in a Thursday press release. “Since there are many ongoing outbreaks of measles in North America and around the world, it is possible that there will be additional cases of measles introduced into Kansas this year.”
Eight people were hospitalized as a result of the outbreak. Children made up more than 80% of cases, and more than 90% of cases involved people who were not vaccinated against measles. Officials urged Kansans to ensure their families’ vaccinations are up to date, especially as the school year begins.
The outbreak most affected Gray, Haskell and Stevens counties. Gray County residents had the highest number of cases with 29 infections. Vaccination rates among kindergarteners have been decreasing overall in each of those counties, with marked decreases in measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccinations.
In Gray County, MMR vaccination rates decreased by 10 percentage points between the 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 school years, according to data from KDHE. In Haskell, there was a 14 percentage point decrease, and in Stevens County, a 15 percentage point decrease. The MMR vaccine is the most effective defense against measles, health officials said.
KDHE officials said state and local health departments will continue to monitor for cases. Janet Stanek, KDHE secretary, said she was grateful to the public health, health care and laboratory professionals who played a part in dealing with the measles outbreak.
“Your compassion, skill and unwavering commitment to keeping our communities safe did not go unnoticed and are appreciated beyond measure,” she said.

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”
‘Clear message’
The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s state lawyer picked a fight this week with the Department of Social Services over the agency’s handling of a $79 million pool of opioid settlement money.
Attorney General Marty Jackley wants the bulk of the dollars to land in Sioux Falls and Rapid City for addiction treatment, and says he’ll ask lawmakers to disband the state’s opioid settlement oversight committee if its members disagree.
But the Department of Social Services — the agency designated as the settlement money manager by the Legislature — says neither city has applied for opioid grant money, and the current pool of available funding isn’t as large as Jackley asserts. 
The department also said Jackley did not reach out about his concerns before holding a press conference on the topic Wednesday in Sioux Falls.
Jackley spoke to reporters that day from a lectern at Sioux Falls City Hall, flanked by Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken and Rapid City Mayor Jason Salamun.
SD uses portion of opioid settlement funds to distribute overdose prevention kits

The opioid money, split 70% for the state and 30% for local governments, will arrive in chunks over the next 18 years. It comes from a series of nationwide settlements with the makers and sellers of the opioid painkillers that contributed to a spike in drug addiction and overdoses. 
The state has collected $31.5 million of its share of the settlement dollars since 2022, Jackley said Wednesday, and he asserted that state government has spent almost none of its share.
That’s not accurate, according to Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff. The $31.5 million figure is the total amount received since 2022. What’s left right now is about $17 million, because $14 million has been spent or obligated.
The Sioux Falls and Rapid City areas have both gotten a significant chunk of the money, the statement said. That’s because 30% of the dollars are distributed directly to local governments, which are then required to tell the DSS, on an annual basis, how the money is spent.
Last year alone, the statement read, the cities of Sioux Falls and Rapid City and the counties of Minnehaha, Lincoln and Pennington got a combined $3.9 million in opioid settlement money.
“As of Dec. 31, 2024, over $3 million of those funds were reported to the state as unspent,” Althoff’s statement said.
Cities and counties will need to report how they’ve used their local shares for 2025 by Jan. 31, 2026.
Local governments can also ask for additional money by requesting grants, paid for from the state’s 70% share, Althoff said. Sioux Falls and Rapid haven’t asked for extra.
Jackley: Spend the money now
Jackley argued Wednesday, however, that the two major cities would be best suited to decide where the money goes.
Using the money to bolster existing addiction treatment options, Jackley said, “presents that opportunity for us to be able to get ahead of the problem, to address the crisis” of drug addiction.

The settlement money is received and managed by the Department of Social Services, but its uses are overseen by the state’s Opioid Advisory Committee. 
The advisory committee’s public plan for settlement dollars puts a large portion of the money into an interest-bearing account for distribution as grants. That’s the wrong approach, Jackley told reporters this week. 
It could also cause the state to lose 15% of the settlement dollars, he told reporters in Sioux Falls, because the settlement agreement dings states that place money in an endowment.
“Why would we want to lose 15% of $79 million?” said Jackley, who later told Sioux Falls Live’s Patrick Lalley that he’d be concerned that lawmakers would raid the fund for purposes beyond opioid programming, such as property tax relief.
The national settlement specifies that no more than 15% of any states’ dollars can be spent on administration of the funds, and that 85% must go to opioid-related programs. 
The Department of Social Services, in its statement, maintains that the state has not used the dollars for an endowment that would pay for things outside of opioid crisis mitigation.
The law that created South Dakota’s fund for opioid dollars says the money can “only be used for purposes relating to opioid abuse treatment, prevention, and recovery programs.”
On Thursday, Jackley said he’d spoken with DSS officials about the fund, who allayed his concerns.
“I commend DSS’s commitment to not place the funds into an endowment, which is a disfavored use under the settlements,” Jackley said. 
Even so, his Thursday statement doubled down on criticisms of the speed of disbursements from the state’s share of settlement money.
“In the three years since DSS has administered the fund, it has reported expending only $634,000 of state funds on opioid remediation, and we must act now to address the addiction crises of today,” Jackley said in a follow-up statement Thursday, citing the 2024 annual report on the fund.
The DSS did not offer a detailed breakdown of its own opioid fund spending, but spokeswoman Emily Richardt said Thursday that the department has distributed around $1.6 million so far, all in grants to local organizations. The $634,000 figure Jackley cited from the last annual report is short 15 months of spending. The next annual report is expected to be released within the next few months.
A statewide needs assessment, set to be completed by next spring, is meant to guide state-level spending beyond the local grant awards.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Mayors: Needs are great
Avera’s juvenile treatment center is one example of the kind of treatment infrastructure that needs help in Sioux Falls, Mayor Paul TenHaken said at the press conference. It has eight beds and “they’ve been full since they opened,” he said, citing a conversation he had with health system representatives on Tuesday.
“The need there is great,” said TenHaken.
He also pointed to the city’s mental health and addiction triage partnership with the county and health systems known as The Link.
“It takes several million dollars every year from the city and the county and our health care systems to run, and so dollars are needed,” TenHaken said.
State committee plans needs assessment for remainder of $54 million in opioid settlement funds

The Department of Social Services, in a statement sent Thursday, noted that a total of $825,569 in the Sioux Falls area’s local share of opioid money had been reported as dedicated to the Link through 2024.
In a statement sent Thursday, TenHaken said the city intends to spend its remaining local allocation of opioid funds for The Link.
“Based on guideline interpretations on how funding can be spent, the city plans to have all anticipated balances spent by 2036, which is intended to support The Link’s Opioid Response Program,” the statement said. 
The statement did not address the question of a lack of grant requests from Sioux Falls for portions of the state-managed share of opioid dollars.
TenHaken’s Rapid City counterpart referenced similar operations in that city at Wednesday’s press conference. Salamun said addiction often fuels crime, and that it tears up families and communities even when it doesn’t.
“So many of us know people who battle with addiction to whatever it may be, and we know it destroys lives,” Salamun said, pointing to his own family’s experiences. “It is the true enemy.”
Salamun, in a Thursday statement, did not address his city’s unspent funds. 
“The question is not whether some of the opioid settlement dollars have been distributed, but how we can use them more effectively,” the statement read. “We commend the state’s efforts so far and believe that allocating these funds more strategically toward effective treatment and rehabilitation could have a greater impact.”
Jackley said he wants to offer treatment “before people are convicted of a drug felony,” and said that allowing the mayors to make connections can make that happen quickly.
He also said he’s willing to work with the opioid committee on the plan, but that he’s ready to ask lawmakers to dissolve it if the group continues to bank settlement dollars instead of spend them.
Jackley: Committee framework unfortunate
South Dakota first signed on to the opioid litigation during Jackley’s first term in office, which began in 2009. He left the post in 2019, after a loss to Kristi Noem in the 2018 GOP gubernatorial primary. By the time he’d returned to the Attorney General’s Office, in 2023, lawmakers had designated the Department of Social Services as the opioid money administrator and passed legislation creating the advisory committee.
On Wednesday, Jackley said he’d have fought to maintain control of the money, had he been in charge at the time. The office of former Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg supported the 2022 bill that put the dollars in the care of the department and committee.
Even as Jackley said the money should’ve been managed by the attorney general, he said he understood why lawmakers created an oversight committee.
“When you’re talking north of $79 million, perhaps it makes sense that there’s additional oversight over the attorney general,” he said. “ I’m respectful of that, but I’m passionate that these dollars need to get to use now.”
DSS: Press conference misleading, inaccurate
Althoff’s statements, sent on Wednesday evening and Thursday afternoon, contradicted Jackley. Beyond saying that money had been allocated to local governments, it said the attorney general had misstated the amount of money the state has received so far.
The proposal from Jackley for a Sioux Falls and Rapid City opioid money disbursement “appears to be for $31 million from a fund that has $17 million,” Althoff’s statement said.
He said the money already spent using the funds, for efforts like a $350,000 investment in 20,000 overdose-reversal kits and overdose follow-up programming, is making a difference.
“South Dakota continues its trend of low rates of opioid prescriptions and the lowest rate of deaths by opioid overdose due, in part, to this comprehensive work,” the statement said.
Althoff said his department “stands ready” to work with any local government that needs help battling opioid addiction.
“If these particular elected officials are interested in working with DSS on this issue, it would be more effective to reach out to us, rather than calling a press conference without ever having done so,” it says.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The U.S. Department of Agriculture has announced it would restrict the use of federal subsidies for solar energy projects in favor of protecting farmland, but clean energy advocates say solar gives farmers a higher production value per acre than any traditional crop. 
A press release from USDA notes specific funding programs can no longer be used for wind and solar projects. The action, the release said, furthers the department’s goal to end taxpayer support of  “unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and ensure the supply chain consists of American products and manufacturing.” 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins said in the release the changes will also stop the loss of prime farmland to solar fields. According to the release, the number of solar panels on U.S. farmland has increased by more than 50% since 2012. 
Rollins said beginning farmers have a more difficult time entering the agricultural market when they also have to compete with solar projects for land. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“Our prime farmland should not be wasted and replaced with green new deal subsidized solar panels,” Rollins said. “It has been disheartening to see our beautiful farmland displaced by solar projects, especially in rural areas that have strong agricultural heritage.”
Scale in Iowa 
USDA defines prime farmland as land with the “best combination” of characteristics for producing food, feed, forage, fiber and oilseed crops. This land must also be available for these uses, per the definition. 
According to the Clean Grid Alliance, about 17.5 million acres of Iowa’s 30 million acres of farmland are considered prime agricultural ground. 
The Clean Grid Alliance analyzed data from USDA and the power grid for the central U.S. and found that if all of the proposed solar projects in Iowa were built on only prime farmland, it would occupy 0.2% – or about 35,000 acres – of prime farmland in the state. 
The alliance report shows in 2025, Iowa had 677 megawatts of solar online, and on about 5,755 acres of land. A view of active, utility scale solar projects in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, or MISO, power grid shows Iowa has fewer solar projects than surrounding states in the MISO power grid. 
Rollins’ announcement also noted solar panels manufactured by “foreign adversaries” could not be used in USDA projects. Rollins said again in a press release Thursday that foreign-made solar panels would not be allowed in USDA projects. This separate release directed agencies to prioritize land use efficiency in power generation projects on National Forest System lands.
According to a 2022 report from the International Energy Agency, China “dominates” solar manufacturing and accounts for more than 80% of the share in all manufacturing stages for solar panels. 
The USDA initiative would target the Business and Industry program and the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, both of which are under USDA Rural Development. 
Per the press release, wind and solar projects are no longer eligible under the Business and Industry program. 
Recipients of REAP must ensure any wind or solar installations are “right-sized for their facilities.” The release specifies that ground mount solar photovoltaic systems must be smaller than 50 kilowatts and be able to record historical energy use to remain eligible under the REAP program. 
USDA did not detail how it would judge location or solar panel origin as it relates to these programs.
Clean energy advocates say the action restricts farmers’ choices
Andy Olsen, the senior policy advocate for Environmental Law & Policy Center, said in a statement that USDA’s claim to protect farmland was “dubious.” 
Olsen said commercial development and data centers are “legitimate threats” to American farmland, while wind and solar projects can “coexist successfully with crops or grazing.” 
Olsen argued the REAP program gave farmers and rural businesses “greater freedom” to care for their operations. The program has been used for things like rooftop solar on small businesses or on top of hog barns. Other grants have helped with energy efficiency upgrades at farms and rural businesses. 
ISU, Alliant Energy solar farm caretakers showcase agrivoltaics results

“Any conversation around protecting farmland should come from thoughtful, balanced input, not blanket restrictions that strip choices from the very people REAP was designed to serve,” Olsen said in a statement.
REAP was established in the 2008 Farm Bill, and funding for the program increased substantially under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. 
Olsen also said solar and wind projects give farmers the ability to generate energy on their own and to create additional revenue streams. 
According to Clean Grid Alliance, Iowa farmers and landowners receive $4.3 million, annually in land-lease payments for solar projects. 
The fact sheet from the alliance also notes solar pays significantly more per acre than traditional row crops. According to its data, solar can generate a production value of $11,068 per acre, annually, for farmers. Corn, by contrast, has a per acre production value of about $930. These figures are dependent on the price of electricity and on corn. 
Some larger-scale solar projects in Iowa are managed and run by utility companies, including the 150 megawatt Wever Solar Project, operated by Alliant Energy in Lee County. 
A spokesperson for Alliant said the company did not seek federal grants from USDA for any of its solar projects and is not impacted by this latest decision from USDA.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 15:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven-area ER visitors more likely to report suicidal thoughts,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/suicide-connecticut/,Residents from South Central Connecticut told emergency room personnel they'd had thoughts of suicide at 1 1/2 times the state average.,"Residents in one part of Connecticut are more likely to report having suicidal ideation, but experts say that might be due to a willingness to talk about it.
Emergency departments in South Central Connecticut recorded more frequent mentions of suicidal ideation than facilities in other parts of the state, according to the state Department of Public Health. 
In data collected between April 2024 and April 2025, residents of the towns that make up the South Central Regional Council of Governments told ER personnel they’d had thoughts of suicide at one-and-a-half times the state average. 
But the numbers might point to more of an opportunity than a problem.
“I do wonder if, in the region of South Central Connecticut, stigma has gotten to the point where we are more open to know about suicidal ideation, more than in other regions,” said Dr. Pamela Hoffman, a clinician at Yale Medicine’s pediatric emergency department.
“It’s really wonderful that we’re seeing these numbers, because it means that we can intervene,” she said. “There are suicidal people that are out there that we don’t know about, and this is actually us finding out about it.”
When patients arrive at the ER, suicidal ideation may be assessed by a medical professional, who asks the patient directly if they are thinking of ending their life. The data includes people who may have been treated for other conditions, but they were asked, as per hospital protocol, if they wished to harm themselves, according to a statement by the Department of Public Health.    
“There are hospitals around the nation for which there is not the standard of care to ask about suicidality for all patients,” said Hoffman. “I’ll give credit to our Hartford colleagues” at Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, she said, who started universally screening all ER patients for suicidal thoughts five years ago.
Residents of the Capitol Region Council of Governments, which includes Hartford, told ERs they had suicidal thoughts at the second-highest rate in Connecticut.
Suicidal ideation rates at ER visits have remained relatively steady in the last five years, apart from a big drop between Q1 and Q2 2020, which, according to the Department of Public Health, “is the impact of COVID 19 and people being fearful of going to the [emergency department] for routine and non-life-threatening conditions during this time.”
Thoughts of suicide had been on the rise long before COVID, according to Hoffman. In her almost two decades of emergency room practice, she has seen an increase in suicidal thoughts, attempts, and fatalities, while the age of people attempting suicide has gone down. “Younger kids are trying things, more than they ever have,” she said. 
The belief that talking about suicide increases the chances a person will act on it has been widely debunked. 
“We had a mental health crisis for children even before COVID,” said Hoffman. “Now we’re talking about it, thankfully. Now we’re describing it. Now we’re trying to change it.”
Dr. Christine Cha, a youth suicide researcher at the Yale Child Study Center, said, “There’s no need to wait until a person has already tried to hurt themselves and gone to the [emergency department] to then broach the topic of suicide. The science shows us that asking youth and adults about suicide is not directly harmful or suggestive. It’s OK to ask. And by not asking, we may be giving up countless opportunities to start an important conversation.”
Connecticut ERs saw over 38,000 visits in which suicidal ideation was present last year, according to data from the Department of Public Health.      
Young people aged 10 to 17 had the highest rate of suicidal ideation — 501 per 10,000 visits. In Connecticut, the rate of suicidal ideation per ER visit decreased with age.
Residents of the city of New Haven differed from the typical age pattern. Their rate of suicidal ideation in ER visits increased with age up to the 45-54 range, before decreasing. Researchers could not speak to the reason behind the older ages in New Haven.
Nationwide, men ages 85 and older are the most likely cohort to die by suicide. Fatality is linked to access to lethal means, particularly firearms. 
“The folks that die from suicide don’t necessarily have a pattern of hospitalizations or emergency room treatments,” said Brendan Burke, Assistant Child Advocate at the state Office of the Child Advocate. “Some folks have zero contact with helping systems before they die by suicide. Others have years and years of treatment, and they still die by suicide.”
Many who struggle with suicidal thoughts and self harm do not get access to the treatment they need, said Burke. And just because a person is seen at an ER doesn’t mean treatment resources are established or those thoughts are resolved.
“Once they come into my ER, we’ve already failed them,” said Hoffman.
Both Cha and Hoffman are positive about telehealth treatment, which has become more prominent since COVID and is legal in Connecticut. Hoffman said she hopes to see more conversations about suicide at schools and workplaces.
Anyone can experience thoughts of suicide, Burke said. “It’s your neighbor, it’s your school teacher, it’s anybody around us that could get to that point.”
Hoffman suggests that kids save the 988 and 211 hotline numbers in their phone’s contacts before they think they need them. 
“I actually encourage them not to name it like ‘crisis’ or ‘suicide hotline.’ I want them to name it something that if their friends started going through their phone, they wouldn’t freak out about it,” Hoffman said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-29-at-1.48.27 PM-1024x827.png,,,2025-08-22 11:58:15.122431

The land is significant because of its proximity to the Lewis and Clark encampment. (Photo courtesy of American Prairie)American Prairie has added just more than 1,400 acres of land, which includes scenic habitat situated both near and along the Missouri River, improving public access for boaters, floaters, anglers, and other river recreationalists.
The first land acquisition grows American Prairie’s existing PN unit by 1,365 acres, which is made up of 630 deeded acres and 735 leased acres. The property is located in Chouteau County, across the Missouri River from the historic Lewis and Clark campsite at Slaughter River, also known today as “Arrow Creek.” It was one of the few locations utilized by the expedition on both their outbound and return journeys. Sitting at the confluence of the Missouri and Arrow Creek, this area is also culturally and historically significant for the region’s Indigenous Peoples who lived, traveled, camped, and hunted buffalo and other game along the resource-rich river corridors.
Being adjacent to the PN, this property is rich with wildlife and provides habitat for elk, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, bears, prairie dogs, curlew, burrowing owls, and upland birds. Bighorn sheep are also present in the area, and it serves as an important migration corridor for carnivores.
“This property is an incredible area for hiking, biking, and wildlife viewing, and a great jumping off point to explore this part of the Missouri River Breaks,” said Alison Fox, CEO of American Prairie. “As Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks continues to develop plans for Judith Landing State Park, we’re excited to continue to grow public access along the Missouri River.”
Last year, American Prairie donated 109 acres of deeded land on the PN to the Montana State Parks Foundation. The donated land is part of the Judith Landing Historic District, and a treasure trove of historical and cultural significance. Recognizing the unique value of Judith Landing to the people and the State of Montana, American Prairie took the initiative to gift stewardship of these acres for the creation of Montana’s newest state park. Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks is currently developing plans for the park, which will include interpretive signage, day-use parking, bathrooms, and a small campground so visitors can enjoy the river corridor overnight.
American Prairie also announced it has acquired an additional 84 deeded acres in Phillips County along the Missouri River, just west of its popular Antelope Creek Campground. It includes more than a half-mile of river frontage within the National Wild and Scenic stretch of the river.
“Every acquisition is meaningful, and these additional 84 acres will provide terrific river access and another scenic camping spot,” said Fox.
Visitors at Antelope Creek Campground on American Prairie’s Mars Vista unit, will now be a short hike from their RV spot, tent site, or cabin to this new access point on the Missouri River. Every year, thousands of visitors choose to get off the beaten path and stay overnight at American Prairie’s lodging facilities, which include Antelope Creek campground, Buffalo Camp, and the Myers Family Huts.
These two land purchases bring American Prairie’s total habitat base to 528,408 acres, which is comprised of 141,157 deeded acres and 387,251 leased public acres.
Providing public access is a cornerstone of the nonprofit’s mission and the majority of its private lands are open to the public for recreation. American Prairie intends to share public access details in the future to spell out recreational uses on these new deeded acres. As it has done in the past, the organization needs to first take time to familiarize itself with the property.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Image-8-21-25-at-11.26-AM-1024x677.jpeg,,,2025-08-22 10:56:33.443257

Article Summary
Article Summary

The Citizen Participation Act now explicitly protects news reporting from “strategic lawsuits against public participation.”
The Illinois Supreme Court had previously ruled that news reporting itself wasn’t covered if it was not investigative in nature or eliciting participation in government.
Lawmakers filed the bill in response to that court ruling, and Gov. JB Pritzker said the measure was designed to “protect and empower Illinois journalists.”

A state law designed to prevent lawsuits that curtail public participation in government now explicitly protects the news media.
Gov. JB Pritzker signed a measure into law on Thursday that was spurred by a former government official’s lawsuit against the Chicago Sun-Times. Senate Bill 1181 explicitly protects non-investigative news reporting against “strategic lawsuits against public participation,” otherwise known as SLAPP lawsuits.
The Illinois Supreme Court allowed a lawsuit by a former Property Tax Appeals Board director to continue against the Sun-Times last year despite the paper’s claims that it was a SLAPP suit under the 2007 Citizen Participation Act.

Sun-Times reporting
The paper published multiple articles about government watchdog investigations into the former executive director of the PTAB, Mauro Glorioso, stemming from the board’s treatment of a property tax appeal at Trump Tower in Chicago.
The complaint, which has since been ruled unfounded by the Office of the Executive Inspector General, claimed that Glorioso, a Republican, told staff “he wanted a large reduction in the assessment of Trump Tower because the owner of the property was the president of the United States.”
Glorioso sued the newspaper in 2021, claiming the paper defamed him by mischaracterizing the OEIG investigation, misstating his motivation and overstating his involvement in the decision.
Supreme Court ruling
The court ruled in November that the Sun-Times’ articles weren’t investigations, which would have been protected under the law. Instead, the court wrote, the articles were news reports about something a government agency was doing and lacked any intent to elicit action from the government — which was needed for SLAPP protections to be applicable.
The court allowed the suit to continue at the lower level.
“This is not to minimize or understate the importance of the press and other news media in our democracy,” Justice David K. Overstreet wrote in the opinion. “Our jurisprudence is replete with privileges and other protections designed to protect these concerns, many of which remain at issue in this lawsuit. We are simply holding that the (Citizen Participation) Act specifically protects government participation and does not encompass all media reports on matters of public concern.”
That’s no longer the case after the signing of SB 1181, which reads: “The press opining, reporting, or investigating matters of public concern is participating and communicating with the government,” meaning organizations doing so are protected under the law.
‘Ensures the media can do their job freely’
The measure was sponsored in the Senate by former news anchor Steve Stadelman, D-Rockford.
“As a former news anchor, I know it’s essential for the media to use their First Amendment right to free speech and press,” Stadelman said in a statement. “This law ensures the media can do their job freely, without fear of legal harassment or intimidation.”
Gov. JB Pritzker shared similar sentiments.
“As Trump and his friends continue their frivolous and targeted attacks on members of the free press, we are working to protect and empower Illinois journalists as they keep the general public informed,” Pritzker said in a news release. “This law will strengthen our anti-SLAPP legislation in Illinois — ensuring press don’t have to fear retaliation for reporting the truth and reminding all Illinoisans that their free speech is safe, valued, and protected.”
The measure also provides that all legal proceedings in a case, including discovery, would be stayed while a party’s Citizen Participation Act lawsuit motion progresses in court.
Rep. Dan Ugaste, R-Geneva, was among the Republicans who voiced concerns on the House floor.
“I believe we’re going to have an unintended impact of actually harming individuals who are just trying to protect themselves from what could be very irresponsible journalism, all under the guise of protecting the constitutional right of the freedom of the press,” Ugaste said before voting “no.”
Rep. Daniel Didech, D-Buffalo Grove, explained the reasoning behind the change during floor debate.
“We are amending the statute so there still has to be a nexus to that exercise of constitutional rights, but the conduct does not have to be solely related to that exercise,” Didech said.
The bill cleared the House 75-38 and the Senate 47-10.

(Photo by Kyle Stokes/Axios)What had been a polarizing election for Minneapolis mayor has exploded into a full-blown political crisis for the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.
U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar and a group of prominent Minneapolis Democrats Thursday released a statement condemning the state party for revoking the DFL convention endorsement of mayoral candidate Sen. Omar Fateh, who would be the city’s first Somali-American mayor if elected in November.
“A small group of DFL board members, a majority living outside Minneapolis, met privately to overturn the will of Minneapolis delegates who volunteered, organized, and participated in a months-long DFL process. It is inexcusable to overturn the results weeks after the convention because board members did not like the outcome,” wrote the group, which also comprised state Sens. Zaynab Mohamed and Doron Clark, state Reps. Aisha Gomez, Fue Lee, Mohamud Noor, Sydney Jordan and Esther Agbaje and several members of the City Council and Hennepin County Board.
The statement notes a majority of the DFL committee that revoked the endorsement Thursday don’t live in Minneapolis, while also drawing an ideological contrast between “progressive democrats who are challenging the status quo and moderate democrats.”  It also alleges “blatant corruption” via “the influence of big money in our politics.”
Though his name goes unmentioned, the statement is a pointed rebuke of state DFL Chair Richard Carlbom, who was hand-picked by Gov. Tim Walz to succeed current DNC Chair Ken Martin.
The ruling and report, released on Thursday from the state party following a formal complaint by the Frey campaign, paints a portrait of a convention so dysfunctional that the Minneapolis DFL is on “probation” for two years. Carlbom reached for comity with an anodyne statement announcing the decision, telling Democrats to move on: “Now it’s time to turn our focus to unity and our common goal: electing DFL leaders focused on making life more affordable for Minnesotans and holding Republicans accountable for the chaos and confusion they’ve unleashed on Minnesotans.”
Not so, Omar and the progressives responded in a thunderous finale: “This decision will be a stain on our party for years to come and damage our ability to organize for Democratic wins this year, next year, and beyond.”
Unions backing Fateh — including SEIU and Unite HERE — called a Friday press conference, an ominous sign for a party where the “L” in DFL is still a major source of campaign foot soldiers and money. 
Carlbom’s ties to Mayor Jacob Frey, whose campaign launched the challenge, only fueled suspicions about a cozy relationship between the state party and the incumbent: The firm of which Carlbom was a partner until he was elected DFL chair last year — United Strategies — has received some $30,000 in consulting fees from the Frey campaign this year.
Carlbom seems to have been in a difficult spot, however. The report details an electronic voting system that the committee calls “substantially flawed.” The narrative describes an old version of the spreadsheet software Excel, powered by broken formulas, and a massive undercounting during the first round of voting. Hours of challenges and delay followed. The credentials sheet was left unsecured and apparently accessed by people who shouldn’t have had access, including the campaigns. Another candidate, DeWayne Davis, secured enough votes to move on to the next round but was wrongly excluded. The entire Ward 5 credentials book was lost. The final vote was a show of hands. 
For Fateh defenders, the convention problems — and the entire challenge — are all noise because they insist Frey had no chance to win, while Fateh merely needed to consolidate the anti-Frey delegates for the victory they say has now been unjustly revoked.
Now, Carlbom and other prominent Democrats must deal with the potential fallout, which could anger progressives across the river and into the newly blue suburbs. Even if the rage were to remain local, however, the consequences could be substantial. The 5th Congressional District, which encompasses Minneapolis, delivered 293,00 votes to Vice President Kamala Harris last year, some 40,000 more than the DFL-rich 3rd and 4th Districts.
If progressives stay home next year or even feel less inclined to volunteer, that could help Republicans achieve their first statewide win in 20 years.
Jeff Blodgett, a longtime DFL consultant who managed the campaigns of the late Sen. Paul Wellstone, said he’s confident Democrats will find unity out of purpose next year: “The stakes in these election are so high that I don’t think people are going to boycott them due to frustrations with intraparty DFL controversies.” He called Carlbom a “dynamic chair” who is leading a state DFL that is well funded and doing off-year organizing and messaging that will pay off next year. 
Still, the divisive mayoral race is just the latest challenge to beset Democrats, the list of mistakes and misfortunes growing seemingly by the day. From the farcical — a state senator’s second drunk driving arrest while in office; the felony conviction of a different state senator — to the tragic, in the form of the assassination of House DFL leader Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark.
The party also has real, substantial differences it must either resolve or — more likely — learn to live with. Israel’s war on Gaza, for instance, has riven the party, often along demographic lines, with young progressives supporting the boycott, divest and sanctions movement and accusing older Democrats like Sen. Amy Klobuchar — who has also endorsed Frey — of complicity in genocide.
The DFL’s struggles, after a long run of governance, evoke some similarities to national Democrats of the late 1960s: A party dominant since FDR’s New Deal but then exhausted and fractured by the Vietnam War, civil unrest and urban disorder, changing demographics, racial struggle, countercultural anthesis — and the murder of beloved leaders.
The climactic scene of 1968 also took place at a political convention, this one in Chicago, where the emerging New Left were embittered at the defeat of their insurgent antiwar candidate Sen. Eugene McCarthy.
What followed was a period of Republican dominance that has helped shape the country we live in today.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dfl-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-22 10:56:33.443257

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.













Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee





“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Last year in Missouri, a pound of wholesale marijuana sold for about $2,000 on average, according to the nation’s leading wholesale cannabis platform LeafLink. That put Missouri in the company’s top five highest prices.
It’s still profitable to sell a marijuana facility license in Missouri, said Ben Burstein, corporate development manager at LeafLink —  a dynamic that is not true in many other states. 
“You have tons of licensed operators that put millions of dollars into their businesses over time,” Burstein said of the experience in many other states. “And not only are they not making money, they have to pay to get rid of those licenses and all the closing costs associated with it.” 
 This guide used data from orders placed on the LeafLink marketplace between Jan. 1 and Dec. 31, 2024.
Experts agree the success is due, at least in part, to Missouri’s limited number of facility licenses. 
Capping the number of businesses that can partake in the cannabis industry has drawn pointed criticism that it has encouraged a monopoly in the program and created the appearance of corruption. But the cap also keeps supply and demand in balance, experts say, protecting Missouri from the pitfalls others states are facing. 
Oregon-based cannabis economist Beau Whitney says in other states there’s a “massive amount of oversupply” that has made it difficult for marijuana businesses to stay afloat. 
A survey Whitney Economics released last year found that only 27% of cannabis companies nationwide on average were profitable in the cannabis space. And 73% were either breaking even or losing money.
Last week, President Donald Trump told reporters he plans to revisit a proposal to reschedule marijuana that started under President Joe Biden, which has been on pause since January. The plan would place marijuana in the same federal classification as codeine, instead of where it currently is alongside heroin.
“We’re looking at it,” said Trump last Monday, noting that he expects to determine whether cannabis will be reclassified in the next few weeks.
So would a push by the president to restart the plan disrupt Missouri’s ecosystem?
The short answer is yes, Whitney said, but it wouldn’t be immediate. 
The process to reschedule a drug requires going through multiple drafts of administrative rules, hearings and public comment periods that could take years to accomplish. 
“It’s a long process,” Whitney said. “It’s not a snap of the finger.”
It’s currently a federal crime for marijuana to cross over state lines. Would rescheduling open up the borders and allow states to sell to each other, also allowing the oversupply to bottom out Missouri’s prices?
That depends on the details in the federal rules, said St. Louis attorney Eric Walter, who represents a number of cannabis operators and the Missouri Cannabis Trade Association.
But a provision in the Missouri constitutional amendment that voters approved in 2022 legalizing marijuana was designed to control that scenario, Walter said. It states that if federal law is amended to allow interstate commerce, then only licensed cultivators could import marijuana from other states.  
“They couldn’t just sell directly to dispensaries or sell directly to consumers,” Walter said. “It would still need to run through the regulated licensees, and the product would be subject to all of our specific requirements, including our testing panel.”
While it could upset Missouri’s economic impact, Walter said the financial impact nationwide would be “massive.” 
Rescheduling marijuana means that the substance would be moved from Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substance Act to Schedule 3. 
“Marijuana has been on 1 since the [act] was created in the early 70s,” he said, “and it never belonged.”
Medical benefits and susceptibility of addiction are taken into account when scheduling, Walter said, and Schedule 1 is for the most addictive substances with no known medical benefits, such as heroin. Cocaine is Schedule 2 because it has some medical benefits, such as numbing properties. 
“It would further erode some of the anti-marijuana bias and perceptions, and open the door to banks and financial institutions interacting with industry operators more sensibly,” Walter said.
Rescheduling would also provide tax relief to businesses, he said.

Whitney calculated that this year cannabis businesses will pay about $2.7 billion more in taxes than a normal business would have paid because they can’t write off deductions on their federal taxes. 
“They’re paying huge taxes to the federal government, even though it’s federally illegal,” Whitney said. 
In Missouri, Burstein estimates the annual impact of rescheduling in terms of taxes to be more than $150 million in additional cash flows to operators, based on current market sales.
While rescheduling would give tax breaks, it may also increase the burden on operators to get certain certifications and occur other expenses in compliance, Whitney said. With so few operators profitable as it is, “not everybody is going to be able to survive,” he said.
The rules will have different impacts in each state. In Oregon, Whitney said all Schedule 3 drugs must be sold at pharmacies, meaning dispensaries could be out of business. 
“That tax break doesn’t really help if you’re out of business,” Whitney said. “Rescheduling is maybe not the greatest thing from an economic perspective and for the industry. Even though reform is always welcome, the question then becomes, well, is the reform going to do more harm than good? I just don’t know because the reform is still in concept. It’s not even on paper.”
While President Trump said he’d take a look at it, the timing is unclear. Many Republicans, including the DEA chief Terrance Cole, are opposed to marijuana, he said.
“Operators need to remain disciplined and realize that there’s not going to be change overnight,” he said, “but be flexible enough in their processes to be able to pivot quickly once those changes happen.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5879-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 10:56:33.443257

Wes Moore (D). Grady will leave her position in October after three years with the administration. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore’s Cabinet will have another vacancy this fall, when state Budget Secretary Helene Grady will leave to start her own consulting business.
Grady is the second senior administration official to announce her departure this week, after Monday’s announcement that Chief of Staff Fagan Harris is leaving, and the seventh so far this year. Her decision to leave, which will be announced by the administration Friday, was not unexpected, as it was widely circulated in and around Annapolis.
But it was still “incredibly difficult,” Grady said in an interview with Maryland Matters.
“It’s just monumental pride that I feel in the work and the team, and this leads me to feel very confident that this is the appropriate time to pass the baton for the next leg of this work,” Grady said.
Grady said she expects to start her own consulting firm “to work with public and private organizations to help them tackle messy challenges through analysis and collaboration, aligning strategic vision with detailed planning and management execution, and communicating the important work they’re doing internally and externally.”
Moore called Grady “a true public servant in every beautiful sense of that phrase.”
“When the story of Maryland’s Decade is written, her fingerprints will be all over the page,” Moore said in a statement. “During Secretary Grady’s distinguished tenure, we turned an inherited structural deficit into a surplus, delivered a tax cut to middle-class families, and secured historic investments in education, health care, public safety, transportation, and countless other priorities that Marylanders deserve.”
Grady has had to help craft budgets in a new era in which the legislature gained broad budgetary power: A constitutional amendment approved by voters before Moore was elected ended an era where Maryland’s governor controlled the budget with arguably more power than any other state executive.

Additionally, all three budget years have come with their own challenges including a post-COVID economy and the ongoing expense of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future education reforms. This year alone, Moore and the legislature crafted a compromise budget that includes tax increases (and some modest targeted decreases) and fees.
She was also responsible for implementing a transition of 50,000 retired employees to Medicare. The move, mandated before Moore came into office, saved the state $200 million annually and $10 billion in post-employment liabilities. But it left retirees angry and sparked court challenges.
“I wouldn’t say that these particular efforts weighed heavily in any way on my decision,” Grady said. “This is part of the portfolio of work that I’m just incredibly proud of the DBM team in terms of what we’ve accomplished together and with our colleagues across state government in just three short years.”
Harris, Moore’s chief of staff, credited Grady with guiding the administration through a 2025 legislative session that included erasing a $3.3 billion structural budget deficit.
“We knew this was going to be one of our most challenging sessions in the first term,” Harris said. “There are a lot of issues needed to be resolved in the budget and for the state’s kind of fiscal footing going forward.”
Harris said Grady was the “architect of the governor’s tax plan.” Moore boasted that 94% of Marylanders would see no change in their taxes or would get a reduction, albeit a modest one. That plan was ultimately altered by legislators as they crated a compromise budget.
“I think she understood that the General Assembly has an important role in this,” Harris said. “I think what she set out at the outset was so sturdy and the framework for the budget was so clear and compelling, that while the budget and the ultimate plan that was passed evolved somewhat, the tent poles remain the same.”
A transition and an October departure
Grady said the job is “incredibly fulfilling and invigorating, but also very consuming, and I think it’s the right time for someone fresh to come in and lead the next leg of the work.”
She plans to stay until October, expecting the extended notice will allow Moore to find a new secretary and ensure a smooth transition.
“My understanding is that the governor’s office is focused on a search with an eye toward potentially having a successor named in that time frame,” Grady said.

October is a key month for the executive branch as it plans its budget for the coming legislative session and fiscal year.
“The team is very strong and really well positioned to keep everything running through this transition,” Grady said. “That’s also part of the reason we’re announcing at this point, so that we can ensure a smooth transition between now and when I separate in October.
“Everything is underway as we would normally be doing at this point in the year, and I anticipate a really smooth handoff with whoever comes in to succeed me,” she said. “October is a pretty natural time for that transition.”
Grady was one of five early hires made by Moore in November 2022 following his historic election. Prior to joining the administration, she was chief financial officer and treasurer at Johns Hopkins University.
She is married to Matthew Gallagher, president and CEO of the Goldseker Foundation in Baltimore and chief of staff to former Gov. Martin O’Malley (D). Gallagher is also chair of the board for Baltimore Corps, a Baltimore nonprofit once headed by Harris, Moore’s outgoing chief of staff.
Talk of Grady’s departure grew in recent weeks, as did talk of  potential replacements, including Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), chair of the Senate Budget and Taxation CommitteeChair Sen. Guy Guzzone (D-Howard), and Richard Madaleno, the former Montgomery County senator and vice chair of Budget and Tax, who currently is county administrative officer under term-limited Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich.
Challenges on the horizon
The “next leg” of the work, as Grady described it, will be rife with challenges.
“As you know, one key, key part of the next leg of the work for the next DBM leader is certainly going to be helping Maryland navigate the changes and the impacts of changes from the federal government,” Grady said.
Included in those are “the impacts on Maryland’s economy from federal job losses, which obviously impact our revenue base, potentially, as well as the impact from federal budget changes, particularly within Medicaid and SNAP at the top of the list,” she said.
Grady is the seventh senior official to leave the Moore administration as it prepares to enter its last session before Moore will be up for reelection in 2026.
Harris announced Monday that he will leave on Jan. 5 to become the next president and CEO of the Baltimore-based Abell Foundation, a prominent philanthropic organization.
In July, Transportation Secretary Paul Wiedefeld announced his retirement.
Embattled Department of Juvenile Services Secretary Vincent Schiraldi left the administration. Schiraldi, a lightning rod for criticism, especially from Republicans, said he left of his own accord, but Moore later said he asked the secretary to resign.
Anthony C. “Tony” Woods announced in May that he was leaving his job as secretary of Veterans and Military Families for a private-sector tech startup.
In January, Moore announced Kevin Anderson would leave his role as Commerce secretary and become an economic development adviser. Two weeks later, state Health Secretary Laura Herrera Scott announced she would step down amid a budget storm that included a proposed $200 million cut in funding to the Developmental Disabilities Administration.

Newsom spoke about a possible California referendum on redistricting to counter the legislative effort to add five Republican House seats in the state of Texas. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 ‘An unprecedented time’

State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
Pennsylvania rebuffs U.S. request for voter rolls containing personal data

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
 Tricky terrain

As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.

 ‘Is this bad for reform?’

While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — An open letter from Kansas Catholic bishops urges people to approach immigration with compassion, and condemns portrayals of all immigrants as criminals — rhetoric President Donald Trump frequently uses.
“Treating all migrants and refugees as if they were violent criminals is simply unjust. They are human beings made in God’s image,” wrote Archbishop Shawn McKnight, Bishop Carl Kemme, and Bishop Gerald Vincke in the letter.
Both Pope Francis, who died in April, and Pope Leo XIV, the first American pope, have been critical of Trump’s mass deportations and descriptions of immigrants as criminals.
The Kansas Legislature passed a resolution in April to encourage Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly — who has condemned Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, like his deployment of the National Guard on U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement protests in Los Angeles —  to “fully cooperate with the policies of the Trump administration in enforcing federal immigration laws.”
The resolution encourages compassion for immigrants — who are less likely to commit crimes than U.S.-born Americans — but includes a paragraph that asserts “illegal immigration leads to severe repercussions for our entire state, including threats to public safety and public health via human trafficking, the deadly fentanyl crisis and strains on public resources.”
Some of the legislators who voted yes on the resolution are Catholic, including Republican Rep. David Buehler from Lansing.
Buehler said he found the bishops’ letter, which acknowledges criminals are taking advantage of the country’s broken immigration system, to be incomplete.
“We don’t have anything in the way of policy in the state of Kansas that I think is not kind. I think we all stand for law and order and humane treatment of all people,” Buehler said. “But I think we have to consider all aspects of this issue, and we can’t turn a blind eye to the impact on our schools, to the impact on our health care. There are so many pieces and parts.”
Buehler said he is worried about what he sees as the unintended consequences of immigration, which he believes were exacerbated when President Joe Biden was in office.
“We should have humane treatment for immigration and those who may be here illegally, but we also at the same time should enforce the laws of this country,” Buehler said. “We can do both.”
Throughout their letter, the bishops encouraged Kansans to see immigrants as humans rather than criminals. 
“Amid political division and fear, we remind our communities that at the center of every immigration debate are real people: families in our pews, children in our schools, workers in our neighborhoods, and volunteers in our parishes,” the bishops wrote.
Shabina Kavimandan immigrated to Kansas from India in 1998. She said she started volunteering with Overland Park Democratic Sen. Cindy Holscher’s campaign for governor in part because of Holscher’s kindness toward immigrants.
“There are certain members of a party that always say they align with so many religious views, especially when it comes to ‘pro-life’ issues,” Kavimandan said. “I see that they believe in life, and the value of life. And then on the other hand there is such a dismissal of the reasons why people choose to come to this country.”
Kavimandan said she stayed in the United States in part because of her determination and also because of Kansans’ interest in knowing and helping her as a person.
“There were people who sat across from me and asked about Shabina the individual. I see that missing now,” Kavimandan said. “That’s another piece that lawmakers tend to overlook sometimes. Behind all the policies there really are just people and their stories. There’s a Shabina who came to this land with $200 in her pocket, but then there were people who were like ‘We have to make sure that she becomes something in this country.’ ”

(Photo by Melissa Sue Gerrits/Getty Images)At the end of July, North Carolina officials awarded Dynamic Group LLC a contract to demolish, repair and rebuild western North Carolina homes that were destroyed by Hurricane Helene.
Two years earlier, almost to the day, Dynamic — along with its founder and affiliated companies — was served federal court papers. In that suit, a Texas business partner is accusing CEO Joshua McCoy of running a racketeering scheme, allegedly using the partner’s company to qualify for million-dollar loans, pay off debts and enrich his “spiderweb” of LLCs.
A complaint filed in Texas federal court in 2023 alleges that Dynamic’s business partner was “just the latest in a series of victims of McCoy and his enterprise’s modus operandi of fiduciary breaches, falsification of financial[s] and embezzlement.”
The case has been on pause since December 2023, but remains open. Dynamic’s attorney calls it a “commercial dispute” in which Dynamic is “owed significant funds.”
Now, the Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based business is one of 20 that will be paid by the state to rebuild homes after the deadliest storm in North Carolina history. The companies will play a crucial role in a $1.4 billion federal grant program.
State officials are aiming to avoid the errors that plagued past recovery efforts. During North Carolina’s recovery from Hurricanes Matthew and Florence, errant communications and jumbled accounting led to countless construction delays. Survivors waited years to be able to go home, as the state agency charged with building housing racked up a deficit of hundreds of millions of dollars.
Gov. Josh Stein’s administration has pledged to chart a more efficient path as it rebuilds from Helene, frequently citing an unprecedented timeline for recovery thus far while it navigates uncertainty from Washington.
Dynamic is not the only contractor hired by the state that has landed in court. Other companies have previously settled lawsuits both in and out of court with customers, subcontractors and the federal government, court records reviewed by NC Newsline show.
At least five of the companies are still parties to open federal litigation as of mid-August. And two other companies do not currently hold general contractor’s licenses in the state.
The businesses are set to enter three-year contracts with North Carolina. State officials can choose to renew each contract for up to three additional years.
Companies that submitted bids were required to disclose their history of litigation, including any pending cases. Failure to comply “may disqualify” the company, according to the state. And officials can reject a bid if the legal history “demonstrates … unsatisfactory performance, adversarial or contentious demeanor or significant failure(s) to meet contractual obligations.”
Documents provided upon request to NC Newsline detail the state’s grading and recommendation process for all bidders.










While a vendor’s litigation history was not a specific criterion used by the division’s selection committee, that factor was indeed a part of the overall review process related to evaluating a given vendor’s ability to perform.


– David Rhoades, spokesperson, N.C. Department of Commerce


The state received 46 bids in total. Twenty were deemed not eligible, seven others were eliminated after a review of financial documents and one declined the state’s offer.
All 20 contracted companies were graded “recommended” or “highly recommended,” with department officials praising their records of past performance, capacity and proposed plans for western North Carolina.
Many of them are based in the South, and most are national in scope — frequently bidding for significant disaster rebuild contracts across multiple states battered by hurricanes. The businesses’ levels of experience were frequently cited by state officials as key factors in selecting them.
“While a vendor’s litigation history was not a specific criterion used by the division’s selection committee, that factor was indeed a part of the overall review process related to evaluating a given vendor’s ability to perform,” said David Rhoades, spokesperson for the N.C. Department of Commerce, which issued the contracts.



RICO suit, manufactured home complaints & federal fund claims
Multiple companies that won contracts with North Carolina are parties in open federal lawsuits.
Dynamic is accused of breaching contract, fraud and civil conspiracy, among other charges, in the Texas case.
Drew Zarallo, who founded a solar energy company called Cogent, has alleged in that lawsuit that McCoy, the CEO of Dynamic, used his majority stake in the company “to exploit Cogent for the benefit of other companies he owned and/or controlled.”
Among the specific allegations leveled against McCoy and his company in the action: moving to apply Zarallo’s company for a $2.5 million bank loan without his knowledge; embezzling that loan to pay down debt for a separate company; “impersonating” Zarallo’s wife in emails to contractors; and “emptying” Cogent’s main bank account before selling their stake in the company.
“Dynamic is an experienced contractor and is excited to be part of rebuilding homes for North Carolinians,” said Paul DeClouet, general counsel for Dynamic, in an email. “This years-old lawsuit arises from a commercial dispute in which we are owed significant funds and was fully disclosed in our proposal.”
Eli Ness, the attorney representing Zarallo, confirmed to NC Newsline that the suit remained open. In a filing last week, he requested a formal update from the court. The case has been effectively frozen for more than a year and a half, after Dynamic and McCoy filed a motion to dismiss it.
Dynamic will have “the capacity to do repairs, rebuilds and manufactured housing” in western North Carolina, DeClouet said. The company has previously won $88 million in contracts for hurricane levees in Louisiana, and in 2022 was tapped as a construction manager for the state’s federally-funded homebuilding program. State officials marked the company as “highly recommended” in a memo.
Other cases involving contracted companies appear to be nearing resolutions.
In one of those cases, two Louisiana residents who purchased a manufactured home from Regional Enterprises LLC allege that there were “instantly noticeable issues and defects.” They cited uneven and sinking floors, incomplete painting and sheetrock work, faulty electrical work and vegetation growing between the two halves of the home.
Attorneys for the Mississippi-based Regional pushed back on many of those complaints, and described them as “manufacturer issues” (a separate company, also part of the suit, assembled the home).
A judge ruled in March that the case should be settled in arbitration. Regional Enterprises LLC did not respond to NC Newsline’s requests for comment.
Two other businesses tapped for North Carolina homebuilding are named in a New York-based suit.
A pair of residents, on their own behalf and on behalf of the federal government, sued Baumgardner House Raising LLC and SLSCO, along with New York City agencies. They allege that the companies submitted “false claims” and received federal funds for home repairs after Hurricane Sandy.
Both companies have denied the allegations and previously moved to dismiss the case.










You’re going to have people that end up wanting to either complain about the work, or some people run out of money on a project. Then all of a sudden, every issue becomes the contractor’s issue, even though it may not be a valid complaint.


– State Republican Sen. Steve Jarvis of Davidson


In a statement to NC Newsline, Texas-based SLSCO called the matter a “nuisance value case that has been settled (pending approval from the court).” Bids from the company “always disclose any litigation as required.”
The president of Baumgardner House Raising, Christian Baumgardner, declined to comment on the lawsuit when reached by phone. But he said the New Jersey-based company was experienced working with federal grant programs, and was hiring western North Carolina-based subcontractors.
“You don’t often hear of hurricanes that cause this type of damage up in mountainous regions,” Baumgardner said. “So that’s going to be a challenge. But the best way that I can think to conquer that … is with local knowledge and a team from the area.”

Timberline Construction Group of Alabama is also moving toward arbitration in a 2023 suit in which they accused a contractor of unjustly firing them from a temporary housing site in Florida. Timberline did not respond to a request for comment.
State Sen. Steve Jarvis (R-Davidson), who is a general contractor by trade, said lawsuits were all but inevitable given the amount of projects some larger contractors take on. And bidders involved in active litigation, he said, should be judged on a case by case basis.
“You’re going to have people that end up wanting to either complain about the work, or some people run out of money on a project,” Jarvis said. “Then all of a sudden, every issue becomes the contractor’s issue, even though it may not be a valid complaint.”
A last-minute filing to operate in state
Two of the companies awarded contracts do not hold active general contracting licenses in North Carolina.
Searches for Nexlegacy LLC and Lamar Construction Co. of Louisiana LLC on the database do not return any matching results. A Department of Commerce spreadsheet tracking license info confirms that the two companies do not have active licenses.
An employee with Lamar Construction confirmed that the company was currently working to secure its license in North Carolina, and that the company was hiring licensed subcontractors local to the region.
Nexlegacy’s president, Kendrick Whittington, did not respond to a request for comment.
“While builders were not required to have a North Carolina (general contracting) license in place prior to signing the contract, no builder will be assigned any work nor be paid without having this license in place,” Rhoades said.
He added that the department has alerted all contractors about the requirement.
Nexlegacy was also lacking a certificate to do business in North Carolina until this week, state business records show.
The Texas-based company had its certificate of authority revoked in 2021 after failing to file an annual report, according to records kept by the North Carolina Secretary of State’s office. It submitted its first filing in four years on Wednesday, after NC Newsline inquired about the company on Tuesday.
Whittington did not respond to separate requests for comment about the certification status.
Contractors “were not required to have” an active certificate in order to submit a bid, said Rhoades, the Commerce spokesperson. But they are required to get one upon being rewarded a contract and “prior to receiving any projects from us.”
“It’s not uncommon for out-of-state contractors to not maintain their North Carolina certificates of authority if they are currently not doing business here,” Rhoades said. “We are reaching out to all the builders to be sure they have a (certificate) prior to signing any scope of work for a specific project.”
The company filed an application to be re-certified on Wednesday and is now listed as “active” as of Friday.
The secretary of state’s office has previously advised the state to cross-check vendors with its records while issuing contracts after natural disasters.
In a letter to former Gov. Pat McCrory during Hurricane Matthew recovery in 2016, Marshall told his office to “emphasize the importance of making sure (local and state governments) check the state’s business registration database, and work with reputable and appropriately registered contractors.”
Suits involving contractors lead to settlements, arbitration
Many lawsuits involving the awarded companies ended up being dismissed. Almost all of those that did reach a resolution were settled out of court between the two parties, or in arbitration with a neutral mediator.
Those complaints included disputes with homeowners, subcontractors and in some cases, state and federal governments that hired the contractors previously. Settlement agreements do not imply guilt or admission of wrongdoing.
One of the contractors, Thompson Construction Group of Sumter, S.C., settled with the federal government in March for $191,000. Prosecutors in West Virginia had alleged that the company submitted false claims for federal disaster grant dollars, and falsely certified that homes met required conditions.
Thompson was one of four companies named in a West Virginia legislative audit released in 2018, as the state’s recovery program and contractors came under scrutiny. Thompson later faced complaints from a subcontractor under that same program, but those complaints were disputed by state officials, the Parkersburg News & Sentinel reported in 2019.
Also named in that audit was Horne LLP, which is serving as prime contractor for North Carolina’s homebuilding program. Mississippi-based Horne is now facing a ban on government contracts in West Virginia, NC Newsline previously reported. Horne has denied any wrongdoing and said it will dispute the state’s decision.
Among the other previous cases and complaints brought against contractors hired for homebuilding in North Carolina:

Regional Enterprises LLC has settled or gone to arbitration in recent years with multiple customers who purchased manufactured homes. A North Carolina resident and Regional agreed to arbitration in a complaint in October 2024. An Alabama homeowner who had alleged plumbing issues and subsequent flooding settled with Regional in August 2024. And the company settled a Mississippi case that included allegations of a faulty septic tank and cracked floors in March.
The owner of DSW Homes LLC of Texas was accused of improper installation and fraud during a Florida county licensing board hearing in April, 10 Tampa Bay News reported. The owner was cited, but was not fined and did not have his license suspended or revoked.
Persons Services Corp. of Alabama settled a dispute last year with a subcontractor in North Carolina that stemmed from constructing a Family Dollar Tree.

A year post-Helene, NC inches closer to starting construction
The construction contracts mark another step toward getting shovels in the dirt for the Renew NC homebuilding program. Leaders in the governor’s office, as well as the Department of Commerce, have been under pressure from state lawmakers wary of past struggles and itching to see visible progress.
Those efforts are complicated by the slow trickle of aid from FEMA — including the billion-dollar grant that will be used to pay contractors and build homes.
“I would settle for a little reckless spending right now, just to get money in the hands of the people,” Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson) said last month.
Officials leading the recovery have frequently cited the state’s record speed at getting federal money secured. An agreement releasing the $1.4 billion housing grant has been signed, but other requirements remain for the money to become available.
Jarvis, the senator who also sits on the legislature’s committee overseeing hurricane recovery, said he was optimistic thus far of the state’s transparency and process. He’s glad to see specific timelines laid out for demolition and mobile home building, for example.
Errors in past recovery efforts, he hopes, have taught the state what to do — and what not to do.
“If what’s on paper actually translates into an effective on-the-ground result, I think that is critical,” Jarvis said.



Homebuilding and Helene recovery in western NC: A rundown
How many homes will the contractors have to build? That depends on how many applications the state receives. The Department of Commerce said the program had surpassed 1,500 applicants for the single-family housing sector. The state will open applications for multi-family and workforce housing later this year.
When will construction begin? State officials have set a goal to begin construction in earnest by the early fall. The program cannot begin working at full capacity until the federal government unlocks the $1.4 billion in grant money that will fund homebuilding and pay contractors.
How do I apply? Visit the Renew NC website or read our story detailing the eligibility requirements and application process.

(U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee video screenshot)The Alaska Bar Association has voted to recommend that former U.S. District Court Judge Joshua Kindred be disbarred in Alaska.
Kindred, appointed by President Donald Trump to serve as a federal judge here, resigned last year from the federal bench after investigators found that he had a “sexualized relationship” with a clerk who became a prosecutor and lied about it to a senior judge and investigators, and maintained a hostile workplace for law clerks.
Since that investigation, additional improprieties connected to the U.S. attorney’s office have come to light.
On Thursday, the bar association’s board of governors voted without dissent to recommend that Kindred be disbarred, forbidden from practicing law in the state. The bar association regulates attorneys across Alaska.
The board’s recommendation will go to the Alaska Supreme Court, which must make the final determination. No date has been set for when the court will consider the issue.
Kindred, whose law license is “inactive” according to the bar association’s database, did not participate in the investigation that preceded Thursday’s hearing, said Rebecca Patterson, president of the bar association’s board.
Louise Driscoll, assistant counsel for the bar association, said the association received “lots of calls” when the investigation into Kindred was revealed to the public.
Typically, she said, the association prefers to act when a grievance is filed by someone other than the association’s own counsel, but in this case, the association’s counsel filed the grievance itself in November.
The subsequent investigation, she said, was slowed by the fact that Kindred didn’t respond to requests for a response to the grievance. He no longer lived at his address on file. He had left the federal court. Former acquaintances didn’t know where he was.
Eventually, Driscoll said, a process server found Kindred sitting on the couch at his mother’s house. 
“It was Mr. Kindred’s mother who answered the door and accepted service, but you could see Mr. Kindred on the sofa, so he was on notice,” she said.
Even then, Kindred didn’t respond, and in June, a committee recommended that Kindred be disbarred.
Driscoll said the committee considered it “very serious” that Kindred had lied to federal investigators about his activities.
“Lawyers are expected to be honest, and the members of the public have a reason to consider that they will be dealing with honest counsel,” she said.
Kindred’s actions, she added, have caused real harm — there are dozens of cases whose outcomes are now in doubt because Kindred failed to disclose conflicts of interest.
In addition, Kindred’s resignation has left only one active judge on Alaska’s district court bench.
“There’s been grievous harm,” Driscoll said of Kindred’s actions.
In a footnote to the disbarment recommendation, the committee said, “We enter our decision not with any joy. It is our collective hope Mr. Kindred can recover emotionally, financially and physically notwithstanding the hardships Mr. Kindred confronts.”
On Thursday, after Driscoll’s suggestion, the board of governors deleted that footnote.
Kindred, they concluded, should receive no more special courtesy than any other attorney facing the same accusations.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/Utah News Dispatch)Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT Jewish leaders denounce new rules for federal security grants,Laura Tillman and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/ct-jewish-leaders-federal-nonprofit-security-grants-dhs/,"Recipients of the nonprofit security grant will be prohibited from DEI programming, staging some boycotts or helping undocumented immigrants.","Several Connecticut Jewish leaders and synagogues have signed on to a national letter denouncing new prohibitions on recipients of a federal security grant, which would ban nonprofits — including faith-based organizations — from conducting equity or “DEI” programming, staging some boycotts or helping undocumented immigrants. The new language would also require such institutions to cooperate with immigration enforcement. 
The letter was signed by Temple Beth El in Stamford, the Mending Minyan Synagogue in New Haven and the Hartford Jewish Organizing Collective, in addition to dozens of other religious groups and leaders across the country. 
The Nonprofit Security Grant Program is run by the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. It helps nonprofits considered in high risk of a terrorist or extremist attack to pay for physical and cybersecurity. That funding can go toward security cameras, warning and alert systems, hired security services, perimeter security like gates and barriers, and screening systems like metal detectors.
Rabbi Debra Cantor, of the B’nai Tikvoh-Sholom synagogue in Bloomfield, also signed  her name to the letter. She said that her congregation had benefitted from the grants in the past. “We were able to strengthen some of the areas that were vulnerable to someone coming in,” changes in infrastructure the congregation couldn’t have otherwise afforded to pay for. The congregation also did safety trainings that would prepare them in the event of a violent attack.
“It made us feel less vulnerable. Anything that puts that in jeopardy is quite upsetting. But here’s the thing, the new revised conditions completely go against our beliefs and our ethical values, so it’s a really terrible tradeoff.” 
Alli Warshaw, co-leader of the Mending Minyan Synagogue in New Haven, said that the new contract is “traif,” or not kosher. 
“This does not fit into our Jewish values,” Warshaw said. “It’s also fiscally unsafe — you could be sued or have your money taken away, even for something like having someone in the community do a sermon and talk about the rights of immigrants.” 
While Jewish institutions are not the only religious groups eligible for the funds, Jewish institutions around the U.S. have pressed for access to the funding in recent months to protect against rising concerns about antisemitic attacks.
The new terms and conditions for all DHS financial assistance for fiscal year 2025 require that recipients won’t “operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, DEIA, or discriminatory equity ideology,” participate in “discriminatory prohibited boycott,” and run any program that “benefits illegal immigrants or incentivizes illegal immigration.” Those provisions are new and weren’t included in the standard terms and conditions for the previous year.
Recipients of DHS funding, like the security grants, would also be required to cooperate with agency and immigration officials, including requests for information sharing and participation in joint operations, access to detainees if an immigration officer wants to interview someone subject to removal and a restriction on publicly sharing details of an immigration enforcement operation.
A spokesperson with the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency won’t fund grant projects “that have alleged affiliations with terrorist activities,” though it did not elaborate on how they’d classify that or to which groups it may apply.
“Under the leadership of Secretary [Kristi] Noem, DHS and FEMA are conducting a comprehensive assessment of all grants to root out waste, fraud, and abuse,” a DHS spokesperson said in a statement. “Unlike the previous administration, grants will no longer be used to empower radical organizations with questionable ties that don’t serve the interest of the American People.”
According to Fox News, DHS has also been cancelling NSGP funding for Muslim groups with alleged terrorist ties.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who has joined numerous lawsuits against the Trump administration in recent months, said that his office was “evaluating all legal options to keep Connecticut safe and protect access to our funding.
“The security of our religious institutions should not depend on their adherence to MAGA politics. Period. These arbitrary and unlawful conditions make us all less safe,” Tong told The Connecticut Mirror in a statement. 
Zohar Berman, a social justice and cultural organizer for the Boston Workers Circle, which signed onto the letter, said DEI programming was not optional for the group. 
“It’s always been a part of our history, and now we have this great term, ‘DEI,’ to describe a multicultural community, but DEI isn’t new,” Berman said.
The letter of protest was organized by the Community Safety Campaign, a Jewish organization that launched in 2022 in response to an attack on a Texas synagogue, “to build more coordinated and strategic approach to Jewish community safety practices.” That organization already encourages synagogues and other Jewish institutions to seek out safety practices that do not include the kind of surveillance technology paid for by the federal grant funds.
The Council on American Islamic Relations, or CAIR, first sent out a press release on Aug. 7, urging mosques, synagogues, schools and nonprofits to pause or withdraw applications to all grants administered by DHS and FEMA until the agency removes “two dangerous and unconstitutional conditions” for fiscal year 2025.
“CAIR is encouraging every nonprofit and house of worship to abstain from applying to the nonprofit security grant program and any other DHS grant that would essentially force you to silence your political speech or become a deputized enforcer of the department’s discriminatory immigration enforcement programs,” said Robert McCaw, the director of CAIR’s Government Affairs Department.
CAIR is among the organizations that have received NSGP funding in the past to “harden its facility and protect employees,” though for safety reasons McCaw did not go into the details of what it was used for.
McCaw said that grant has been an important resource.
“It protects people, it protects institutions and it creates safer spaces for nonprofits and houses of worship to serve our communities,” McCaw said. “But it seems this administration is dead set on limiting the amount of time to apply to this program and who can actually receive funding, and its purported review of Muslim applicants makes CAIR question whether there’s a discriminatory bias in the management of this program.”
Jewish and Christian communities have been the largest recipients of the grants in the past, according to McCaw.  “And we applaud any organization that’s been able to enhance its community’s security. That said, we have always strived for Muslims to receive a more equal share.”
Amid some delays, the NSGP grant notice of funding opportunities for fiscal year 2025 was posted on July 28 with a deadline to submit applications of Aug. 11. The estimated total funding is around $274 million. The agency expects to make funding selections in the coming days with the award date scheduled for the end of September, according to a FEMA fact sheet.
The available funds are similar to previous years, though the funding for the previous fiscal year had a significant bump because of a $210 million boost provided through a national security supplemental approved by Congress last year. The first tranche of that supplemental funding was delivered in June to more than 500 Jewish faith-based organizations.
The remainder was doled out this week. DHS announced Tuesday it awarded $110 million across 600 faith-based organizations and nonprofits. The agency said the money will go to Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh and Jewish-affiliated institutions. 
The funding and application process for the NSGP security grants faced various delays over the course of the year.
Earlier this year, grantees were unable to draw down their funding to get reimbursements for their security enhancements. But the freeze on the funding was lifted in May after pressure from lawmakers in both parties and some Jewish organizations, according to Jewish Insider.
There was also a monthslong delay in opening the application for grants this year.
After Congress passed a bill to fund the government in March, eligible groups expected to be able to start applying for the new funds two months later, which was a requirement of the law. A group of organizations wrote a letter urging DHS to roll out the application process as soon as possible before the end of the federal fiscal year, fearing they would become unavailable by Sept. 30.
The Jewish Federations of North America played a major role in advocating for these security grants over the past few months.
After the deadly shooting in May at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C, the group called for a significant bump to the federal security grant by asking Congress to approve $1 billion, noting the demand with 43% of applicants for NSGP receiving funding last year. The Jewish Federations of North America also estimated that the cost of security for those in the Jewish community is around $765 million a year.
But by July, FEMA publicized the notice of the grant funding for fiscal year 2025, alleviating concerns of the groups pushing for its immediate release.
“Jewish Federations of North America strongly encourage institutions in our communities to apply for critical, life-saving Nonprofit Security Grant Program funds,” Eric D. Fingerhut, president and CEO of Jewish Federations of North America, said. “We are working closely with DHS and stand ready to provide guidance to any institution seeking support around this process and raise any issues that come up along the way.”
But Rabbi Cantor of Bloomfield said that the new terms were setting up a terrible set of choices, especially at a time when security is needed. 
“People feel safe when they come into a house of worship. If we are pressured to share information about people, that goes against our beliefs. That goes against our deeply shared values,” Cantor said. “Jews do not do well in autocracies, they do not do well in places that lean toward fascist hatred and beliefs. Jewish people, like others, do well in a free democracy. So anything that threatens that, that limits our basic rights under a democratic set of laws is bad. It’s bad for Jews — it’s bad for all of us.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24344277337531-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 09:58:18.853531

California will hold a special election on Nov. 4 after the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom passed a legislation package Thursday greenlighting a mid-cycle redistricting effort ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, report CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller and Jeanne Kuang.
What started as a terse warning in July — Newsom floated the idea of retaliating against the Texas GOP’s plans to redistrict in a way that would help Republicans add seats in the U.S. House of Representatives — has culminated in a mad dash by Democrats to redraw California’s congressional map to do the same for their own party.
It’ll be up to California voters then to decide whether to suspend the state’s existing electoral boundaries, which were drawn by an independent redistricting commission, and replace them with maps that would benefit Democrats. If passed, the state would return to the commission’s authority after the 2030 census.
Read more here.
Throughout his redistricting campaign, Newsom has once again thrown himself in the national spotlight by positioning himself as a chief antagonist to President Donald Trump, writes CalMatters’ Alexei Koseff.
During his visit to South Carolina last month — a longtime early primary state — Newsom provided a blueprint of sorts for Democrats, according to the chairperson of the Democratic Party in South Carolina, who are concerned that Trump will also pressure their red state into gerrymandering, as his advisers did with Texas.
But Newsom’s gambit is no sure bet: California voters could end up rejecting the ballot measure, which would leave a lasting stain on his gubernatorial tenure. Republicans, who are already seizing the redistricting plan as an illegal power grab by Democrats, would also likely frame the potential failure of the measure as a referendum on Newsom himself.

What about Texas?: CalMatters’ Jeanne and Maya reached out to several California Republicans in Congress and the state Legislature to see what they had to say about Texas’ redistricting plan in the face of their opposition to California’s.
While some demurred when asked if they would call on Trump directly to backtrack on redistricting in Texas, some have expressed something similar to the adage of “two wrongs don’t make a right” — without openly disapproving of Trump.

Assemblymember Carl DeMaio of San Diego: “Gerrymandering is wrong no matter who’s doing it, whether it’s done by a red state or a blue state.”

Immigration numbers down for first time in decades

Months after Trump’s return to the White House, there are now 1.4 million fewer immigrants living in the U.S., writes CalMatters’ Wendy Fry.
For the first time since the 1960s, the number of immigrants living in the country is shrinking, according to a report published Thursday by the Pew Research Center. In January 2025 there were 53.5 million immigrants in the U.S., and as of June there were 51.9 million — a 2.6% drop.
With roughly 11.3 million immigrants in 2023, California is home to the largest share of immigrants in the nation — about 28.4% of the national total. 
There are several reasons that may be contributing to the decline, said the research center’s director of race and ethnicity. One is likely federal policy and enforcement changes between January and June. Between those months, Trump issued several executive actions that aimed to block the arrival of new migrants at the border; strip protections for those who entered legally; and deport unauthorized immigrants.

Home battery program could make a comeback

From CalMatters climate reporter Alejandro Lazo:
California defunded a program in June that paid households to send power from home battery storage units back to the grid. But lawmakers now may bring it back as part of a negotiation over cap and trade.
The Demand Side Grid Support Program aims to reduce the risk of blackouts during extreme events. Essentially, homes and businesses together serve as one virtual power plant. Investor-owned utilities — and clean energy companies like Sunrun and Tesla — argue the program’s just beginning to prove its value: It delivered more than 500 megawatts of energy over two hours on a July evening, enough to cover more than half of San Francisco’s peak demand.
The draft proposal, by Democratic Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin of Thousand Oaks, could offer the program a lifeline if it’s approved. The trouble: Many interests are competing for cap and trade cash as lawmakers wind down their work.

CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: The Legislature is considering a plan by Newsom to reroute money from the state’s cap-and-trade program to help pay for things including the high-speed rail project — a proposal fraught with issues.
Newsom’s push to fast-track the Delta tunnel project underscores a familiar but dangerous delusion that humans can control nature, when in reality the truth and the land will catch up to us, writes Devon Provo, an urban planner and senior policy manager at Accelerate Resilience L.A.

The 18-year-old is something of a collector for academic achievements. At his home in south Jackson, Anderson has a coffee table’s worth of awards: Trophies, badges, plaques, rainbow-colored cords. 
And a binder stuffed full of college acceptances. 
All told, Anderson applied to more than 600 colleges and was admitted to exactly 582, racking up more than $10 million in scholarship offers. 
The eyepopping feat, which went viral earlier this summer, was driven by curiosity, free time, a desire to go out-of-state for college and a competitive streak.

He also wanted to be an inspiration to other JPS students, who he said are often misunderstood and stereotyped, even by fellow Jacksonians. 
“I have to say that when most people think about JPS kids, they think about criminals, bad people,” he said, “but at the end of the day, the majority of the people at JPS, they are not that.” 
Who are they? 
“Brilliant, intelligent, inspiring,” he said. “They actually want to do better for themselves.” 
Don’t get Anderson wrong: There were challenges. During his junior year, afternoon gun violence at a nearby convenience store kept forcing Forest Hill to go on lockdown. He said he missed a lot of AP U.S. History instruction that year. 
At one point, Angella thought about putting Anderson in private school. She was frustrated he kept getting marked absent when she knew he wasn’t. The school told her it was an attendance record system issue. 
She had a high school picked out – a Christian school on Siwell Road that, like many in the metro area, originated as a segregation academy. But the day she told Anderson she was at her wit’s end, he asked her if he could stay at Forest Hill. 
Anderson didn’t want to start over at a school he didn’t know, with teachers who might not support him. The two agreed that despite hardships, he had blossomed in JPS. 
“I wanted to continue growing,” he said. “The teachers that I had, my counselors, they motivated me to keep on pushing myself.” 
Forest Hill was where, in 9th grade biology class, Anderson decided he wanted to be an oncologist after learning that cancer is caused “by the cells growing out of control.” It was where he joined band and learned to play the oboe, a challenging instrument that he chose in part because it made him more attractive to colleges. 
And it’s where he got an opportunity to take dual enrollment classes at Hinds Community College. 
“It actually taught me how to study better,” he said. 
Anderson’s first anatomy exam, he scored a 79. Then he buckled down and got an 85 on his second.

By his senior year, Anderson had racked up so many credit hours, he had a lighter classload and a lot of free time. With encouragement from his guidance counselor, Monica Dickerson, he used those hours to apply to as many colleges as he could. 
“He was sitting outside of our office, and my email just started dinging, dinging, dinging,” with requests to send his transcript to one college after another, Dickerson recalled. “So I walked out of my office and I said, ‘Jayme.’ I said, ‘Now listen, I know I told you to apply to schools, but I don’t want you just to go crazy.’”

He was undeterred. Every now and then, he’d ask Dickerson to print him off some more fee waivers, so he didn’t have to pay for the applications.
He applied to colleges in all 50 states, and even to a few he found on Indeed.com. 
“I think his motive was to get a lot of scholarships,” Angella said. “At one point when I talked to him, he was over $5 million, and he was like, ‘Momma, I’m gonna get the most in scholarships.’” 
Anderson had initially planned to attend Stanford University, but earlier this month, he had a change of plans. He enrolled in Pennsylvania State University — in part, his mom said, because it snows there, and he wanted to get out of the southern heat. 
“That was it, point blank,” his mom said. “It was the cold. It was the air.” 
They made the trip to State College earlier this week, taking two cars packed full of the usual necessities — laundry detergent, a mini fridge, boxes of bedding, clothes and lots of pens. 
Anderson also brought the award that meant the most to him: His associate’s degree from Hinds.

This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. 
In 2020, the Department of Energy predicted that Appalachia was “on the cusp of an energy and petrochemical renaissance” fueled by abundant shale gas. The agency saw the ethane cracker plant Shell was building outside Pittsburgh as “the first of what could be multiple facilities” in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Five years later, Shell stands alone, the only one of a fleet of proposed projects that was actually built. Now, the company would like to sell it.
“The issue is it’s our only one, our only major facility” that makes this kind of plastic, Shell CEO Wael Sawan told analysts in a recent earnings call. “And that’s why we’ve said we’re not the natural owner of that asset.” He acknowledged that a deal may not happen quickly but said the company is having “discussions” about a sale or partnership.
For people in Beaver County who have watched the planning, construction and opening of the plant drag out over the past 13 years, that possibility—first suggested in a Wall Street Journal story in March about Shell “exploring a potential sale” of its American chemical facilities—was surprising. Marcellus Drilling News, a fracking industry trade publication, called the news a “shocker.” Residents wondered if this meant the facility, which began operating in Monaca just three years ago, could be shut down or its workforce laid off.
In a statement to Inside Climate News, Shell spokesperson Krista Edwards said the company “has not announced any sale of its Monaca facility.” Shell is “exploring strategic and partnership opportunities” for its chemical facilities in the U.S., including Monaca, she said.

Shell’s CEO said that the company wants to go “back to what we call the brilliant basics”: oil and gas, not petrochemicals. The Monaca plant—which ended up costing $14 billion to build, $8 billion more than initial estimates—is a small part of its global portfolio. Shell was enticed to build in Pennsylvania when the state government granted the company a record-breaking $1.65 billion tax break that could last 25 years.
Financial experts said Shell Monaca’s location is one reason that a sale makes sense. “Shell is about as isolated in Pennsylvania as you can get,” said Rob Stier, a global petrochemicals expert at S&P Global Commodity Insights.
“Anything that goes wrong in Pennsylvania, the Shell Pennsylvania facility has to shut down,” he said. “If it’s running, it makes money. But if it’s not running, they’re in trouble.”
What he means is that Shell loses out whenever the plant falters because it has no other way to fulfill orders. In contrast, on the Gulf Coast, the home of a massive, interconnected petrochemical hub, companies can make up for losses by producing more at another facility. “Shell doesn’t have that luxury because they have Pennsylvania as their only polyethylene manufacturing site in the world,” Stier said. Polyethylene is the type of single-use plastic produced in Monaca. Shell uses ethane, a byproduct of natural gas, to make the plastic.
As of July 2025, Shell had submitted 80 malfunction reports to the state Department of Environmental Protection, according to the nonprofit FracTracker Alliance. It paid $10 million in civil penalties for air quality violations in 2023. Residents living nearby have complained about light, noise and air pollution and say the plant is disruptive to their daily lives, with some people choosing to move away to escape it. The Shell plant has an anticipated lifespan of least 25 years.
Stier said the market for polyethylene changed in 2022, the same year the Pennsylvania facility came online. Responding to increased demand for plastics domestically, China built more petrochemical plants. But in the last few years, demand there hasn’t kept up with all the new production, and the country is over capacity. That means fewer opportunities for American companies to sell in China, and it creates more competition for Shell in the U.S. market.
Shell Monaca still enjoys a competitive advantage because its feedstock costs less than the oil-based feedstock used in China.
“This is a valuable asset,” said Stier. The site is also likely to retain the huge tax subsidies it received from the state, even with a new owner, according to financial experts.
Shell’s tax “windfall” in Pennsylvania 
Shell’s tax breaks from the state are behind its decision to push forward with the project even as other companies walked away from the “renaissance” for economic reasons, said Anne Keller, managing director at Midstream Energy Group, an energy consultancy. Keller has worked in the energy and petrochemical industry for more than 30 years. Compared to Ohio and West Virginia, Pennsylvania “far and away shelled out more money,” she said.
In 2016, then-vice president of Shell’s Appalachia Petrochemicals Division, Ate Visser, acknowledged the role the subsidies played in its decision-making. “I can tell you, hand to my heart, that without the fiscal incentives, we would not have taken this investment decision,” he said.
Those incentives help to explain how Shell ended up stranded in a region that turned out not to make sense for petrochemical buildout in the current market.
Keller said Pennsylvania’s gift to Shell is unprecedented in the industry. “I’ve literally never heard of anything like that. It was just stunning,” she said. “The state got dealt.”
While there was some greater economic advantage to the region during construction, when more than 9,000 workers were needed, once the plant became operational and the workforce shrank to 500, “the state might as well have just put people in an office and written them a check,” Keller said. Essentially, she said, the financial benefit to the company is so large that the state is effectively off-setting the cost of all full-time employees at Monaca with the tax break.
Edwards, the company spokesperson, said Shell currently employs about 500 people in Monaca and “regularly averages” approximately 400 contractors at the site. Four hundred is the minimum number of permanent jobs required by the state’s tax agreement with Shell.
In 2012, the year the state legislature passed the $1.65 billion tax credit, Republican Gov. Tom Corbett’s industry and labor secretary, Julia Hearthway, said she was convinced that the Shell plant would “kickstart a chemical manufacturing boom.”
“And with it comes jobs. Not a few hun­dred jobs. Not one com­pany hir­ing 300 or 400 jobs. But thou­sands and thou­sands of jobs to Pennsylvania,” she told StateImpact Pennsylvania.










“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened.”


– Eric de Place, energy policy consultant


At one point, the Corbett administration claimed the Shell plant would spawn 20,000 permanent jobs directly and indirectly, because it would draw so many people to move to Beaver County. The administration said Shell would build its plant in another state if Pennsylvania didn’t offer enough incentives.
That same year, the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center called the tax breaks “a windfall” for Shell and said the deal was expensive for taxpayers while creating few permanent jobs. That warning now appears prescient.
The economic boom and thousands of new jobs that were supposed to follow in Shell’s wake have failed to materialize, according to research conducted by the Ohio River Valley Institute. 
“There was a lot of happy talk about how, once you build petrochemical facilities in Appalachia, then all these other businesses will relocate next to them, which is not a thing that happens and hasn’t happened,” said Eric de Place, an energy policy consultant who has researched Shell Monaca for ORVI. De Place’s analysis found that Beaver County’s population has declined since 2012, and it has not seen growth in jobs, GDP or businesses.
“There’s simply no way to look at economic performance and say, ‘Beaver County got this petrochemical plant and it flourished.’ In fact, it is declining relative to the U.S. and Pennsylvania, and it has not outperformed the counties around it,” he said. “I think you look at the scoreboard and you say, this was a terrible investment of taxpayer money.”
Stier said of Shell’s change of course, “The real driver of this is corporate strategy. Fifteen years ago, Shell was going in a different direction.
“It just goes to show you how big global companies can change their strategies pretty quickly. Companies can make some big, multibillion-dollar mistakes at times, and market conditions change,” Stier said. For Shell, “this asset no longer fits.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Inside-Climate-News-Cracker-plant-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(Photo by Alon Skuy/Getty Images)A federal judge has ordered that no more immigrant detainees be sent to the state’s immigration detention facility in the Florida Everglades and known as “Alligator Alcatraz.” The judge also called upon the government to begin dismantling much of the facility.
U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams of the Southern District of Florida gave both the state and federal government 60 days to move out existing detainees and to begin removing temporary fencing, lightning features, and generators, gas, sewage and other waste and receptacles installed to support the project.
In her 82-page decision, Judge Williams cited extensive harm to the Everglades caused by operation of the facility, which was built in eight days.
The state of Florida filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeal for the Eleventh Circuit immediately after the order was released.
Two environmental groups — Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity — filed a lawsuit in late June, shortly after the state announced that the facility was about to open, claiming the plan had not gone through any environmental review as required under federal law. They were joined in the lawsuit by the Miccosukee Tribe.
In her ruling, Judge Williams agreed, saying that under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the government was required to issue an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or conduct an Environmental Assessment (EA). “The Defendants chose not to do so,” she wrote.
“The Defendants’ decision to refrain from issuing an EIS or conducting an EA, and then building a detention camp, represents a determinative position on the matter and has adversely affected Plaintiffs’ recreational, conservational, and aesthetic interests,” she wrote in her order. “Accordingly, the Defendants’ decision not to issue an EIS or conduct an EA and then construct a detention camp qualifies as a final agency action.”
The Trump administration contended that a review under NEPA did not apply because, while the center houses federal immigration detainees, it is run by the state. State officials have said that their authority came from an agreement with the federal government.
Judge Williams strongly objected.
“Defendants essentially tell the Court that the project is purely state action because its employees (presumably) wear uniforms bearing state agency logos, and because the federal government seems to have held back on sending its reimbursement until some unidentified impediment (perhaps, this litigation) has abated,” she wrote.
“Meanwhile, the project was requested by the federal government; built with a promise of full federal funding; constructed in compliance with ICE standards; staffed by deputized ICE Task Force Officers acting under color of federal authority and at the direction and supervision of ICE officials; and exists for the sole purpose of detaining and deporting those subject to federal immigration enforcement. Detainees are brought onto the site by federal agents and deported from the site by federal agents on federally owned aircraft. In concluding the camp is a major federal action, the Court will ‘adhere to the test-tested adage: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, and looks like a duck, then it’s a duck.’”
The judge quoted President Harry S. Truman’s address during the 1947 dedication of the Everglades National Park, and noted how a proposal in 1967 to create the world’s largest jetport at the site was abandoned and the Big Cypress National Preserve was created to protect the area.
“Since that time, every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades,” she wrote. “This Order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.”
‘Clear message’
The two environmental groups that filed the initial lawsuit hailed the decision on Thursday night.
“This is a landmark victory for the Everglades and countless Americans who believe this imperiled wilderness should be protected, not exploited,” said Eve Samples, executive director of Friends of the Everglades. “It sends a clear message that environmental laws must be respected by leaders at the highest levels of our government — and there are consequences for ignoring them.”
“This injunction is a huge relief for millions of people who love the Everglades,” added Elise Bennett, Florida and Caribbean director and attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. “This brutal detention center was burning a hole in the fabric of life that supports our most iconic wetland and a whole host of endangered species, from majestic Florida panthers to wizened wood storks. The judge’s order came just in time to stop it all from unraveling.”
Central Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Maxwell Frost, who toured the facility for the second time on Wednesday, issued a blistering statement after Judge Williams’ order was released.
“The Everglades Immigrant Detention Center is nothing more than a state-sponsored, government-funded internment camp designed to keep Black and Brown immigrants in hellish conditions while Donald Trump pretends it makes our country safer,” he said in a written statement. “Thanks to the tireless work of Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biological Diversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe, this inhumane facility has been ordered to halt operations. This is a major victory for justice, civil rights, and our environment.”
Judge Williams had placed a temporary restraining order pausing new construction at the detention center on Aug. 7 — including filling, paving, and installation of new infrastructure and lighting. That ruling may have already proved to DeSantis that Williams, a 2010 appointee to the federal court by President Obama, would ultimately rule the way she did.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in front of a judge who is not going to give us a fair shake on this,” he said earlier this week.

Read this story in English.
En una entrevista reciente con MSNBC, centrada en la preparación del estado para la temporada de huracanes, el Gobernador Ned Lamont hizo referencia a las inundaciones mortales ocurridas en el valle de Naugatuck en agosto pasado. 
Afirmó que Connecticut se está preparando para emergencias climáticas severas y de seguridad pública mediante la adopción de diversas medidas, como la reserva de fondos en caso de daños importantes por tormentas.
“Simplemente no sé si puedo contar con FEMA en este momento”, dijo Lamont, refiriéndose a la Agencia Federal para el Manejo de Emergencias (FEMA), una de las agencias federales que el presidente Donald J. Trump ha estado trabajando para desmantelar.
También instó a los residentes a inscribirse en el “sistema de alerta temprana” del estado.
En Connecticut, varios sistemas de notificación de emergencias operan bajo la supervisión de las autoridades estatales y regionales para comunicar a los residentes con información importante en tiempos de emergencias de seguridad pública y salud. Un sistema estatal relativamente moderno es “CT Alert”. 
Impulsado por la empresa de software Everbridge, CT Alert permite a los centros de llamadas del 911 de los municipios participantes, contactar a los residentes registrados con información relacionada con evacuaciones, medidas de seguridad o alertas generales por teléfono celular, correo electrónico o mensaje de texto.
En situaciones de emergencia crítica, el sistema, operado por el Departamento de Servicios de Emergencia y Protección Pública (DESSP) del estado, puede intentar múltiples métodos para contactar a un residente si lo solicita, pero no recibe confirmación de que recibió la notificación.
¿A cuántas personas llega CT Alert?
Menos del 10% de los residentes de Connecticut se han registrado en CT Alert, pero el DESSP de Connecticut cuenta con más de 4.8 millones de contactos estatales en el sistema, lo que le permite ampliar el alcance en caso de emergencia.
En promedio, entre 3,000 y 5,000 personas se registran para recibir alertas a través del sistema cada año. En lo que va de este año, se han registrado aproximadamente 9,000 personas.
Cada alerta es personalizada: los operadores del 911 pueden elegir la localización de la notificación y a cuántas personas contactar. El año pasado, CT Alert se usó 97 veces. Este año, se ha usado 25 veces. El sistema registra picos de registro después de eventos como inundaciones, incendios y otras emergencias.
¿Cómo me registro?
Los residentes pueden registrarse en el sitio web de CT Alert proporcionando su nombre, correo electrónico, número de teléfono y dirección de trabajo o particular. Los residentes y negocios que tienen números de teléfono registrados ya están anotados en el sistema.
Aunque el sistema está disponible para todos los municipios, su uso depende de los centros de 911 de su municipio o región. Algunos municipios pueden usar sistemas de notificación más avanzados o específicos, como Reverse 911.
Cuando un municipio decide usar CT Alert, significa que su centro de despacho de emergencias utilizará el sistema para enviar alertas de emergencia a los residentes. Sin embargo, una persona registrada seguirá recibiendo alertas estatales y regionales de Connecticut, incluso si su municipio no usa el sistema activamente. Aunque DESPP tiene acceso a los datos de Whitepages para números de teléfono fijo y datos de teléfonos celulares adquiridos a través de Everbridge, registrarse para recibir alertas es la forma más efectiva de mantenerse actualizado por el sistema, según las autoridades.
Los datos registrados pueden divulgarse a terceros para fines de notificación de emergencia o según lo exija la ley, según la página de preguntas frecuentes de CT Alert.
¿En qué se diferencia CT Alert de otros sistemas de notificación de emergencias?
La idea principal de CT Alert es advertir a los residentes de forma preventiva antes de que el peligro sea inminente. Algunas notificaciones estatales se envían para advertir sobre peligros inminentes, no siempre esperados.
El “911 inverso” es otro sistema de notificación de emergencias de uso común en Connecticut, que permite a las autoridades locales llegar a vecindarios, zonas o pueblos específicos contactando a teléfonos fijos y celulares registrados para detectar amenazas localizadas. Los sistemas de notificación a nivel nacional, adaptados regionalmente por las fuerzas de seguridad locales, como el Sistema Integrado de Alerta y Advertencia Pública de FEMA o las alertas AMBER, notifican al público en general sobre emergencias más específicas, como solo desastres naturales o solo niños desaparecidos, respectivamente, a menudo mediante transmisiones por radio y televisión, además de teléfonos celulares.

Gavin Newsom tries to fast-track the Delta Conveyance Project, we must learn from history's hard lessons.","Guest Commentary written by

Devon Provo
Devon Provo is an urban planner and senior policy manager at Accelerate Resilience L.A. She lives in Altadena.


Most mornings, I walk my dog at Hahamongna Watershed Park in Pasadena, pausing by the reservoir to watch grebes and ducks glide across the water. It’s a quiet routine, but since the fire tore through Eaton Canyon in January, the silence feels louder, like this place has something to say. 
As an urban planner, I’ve spent years working on land use and water policy. When I walk through my Altadena neighborhood, I don’t see a freak disaster. I see a moment of reckoning, in a much older story about the quest to control nature and consequences that echo across generations. 
As Californians struggle to recover from compounding climate disasters, Gov. Gavin Newsom is moving to fast-track the Delta Conveyance Project, presenting lawmakers with a familiar choice. But before committing billions to yet another major water project, we must confront some hard lessons from our past.
Eaton Canyon is named after Judge Benjamin Eaton, an Anglo-American settler who built Pasadena’s first water infrastructure in the 1860s. Eaton engineered irrigation ditches to support settler agriculture and real estate development by diverting water away from Hahamongna, a place named “Flowing Waters, Fruitful Valley” by the original Tongva inhabitants. His intervention added to a harmful pattern that began with the Spanish mission system, when the violent colonization of Hahamongna Village disrupted sacred community relationships with land and water. 
Eaton’s son, Frederick, later expanded his father’s ambitions on a larger scale. As mayor of Los Angeles in the early 1900s, Frederick Eaton partnered with William Mulholland to develop the L.A. Aqueduct, a massive conveyance system that redirects water from Mono Lake and Owens Valley — called Payahuunadü by the Native residents — to fuel Los Angeles’ growth 220 miles south. 
It was one of the most significant and destructive water transfers in U.S. history, devastating the ecosystems and homelands of the Nüümü, Newe, and Kootzaduka’a people. Owens Lake, which is also called Patsiata, was once full of life. After it dried out, it became the largest source of dust pollution in the country, exposing nearby residents to toxins that increased cancer risk. 
The consequences were not limited to the Eastern Sierra. Angelenos suffered, too. 
The aqueduct committed Los Angeles to a model of extraction that has persisted for more than a century. Today we’re often told L.A. is a desert, obscuring the truth that the rivers, wetlands and groundwater that shaped this region didn’t disappear — they were buried, paved and drained.
Instead of investing in local solutions like stormwater capture, recycled water and fire stewardship, Los Angeles prioritized importing water, urban sprawl, and fire suppression practices throughout the 20th century, leaving it increasingly vulnerable to disaster.
The result: L.A.’s stormwater rushes to the ocean through concrete channels, bypassing the thirsty soil beneath our feet. Fire-adapted chaparral, once tended through Indigenous cultural burns, goes misunderstood and mismanaged. Fire always finds its fuel. 
This legacy didn’t spark the Eaton Fire, but it seeded conditions that allowed it to spread and devastate. Eventually the truth catches up to us. The land remembers what we try to forget. 
Meanwhile, policymakers rely on public amnesia. The governor’s latest push to secure legislative approval for the Delta Conveyance before the session ends in September risks repeating history. The success of this water diversion megaproject hinges on the same myth of control, the illusion that humans stand apart from the very ecosystems that sustain us, that futile attempts at domination can shield us from the fragile, uncomfortable reality of our interdependence with nature.
A tragedy like the Eaton Fire reminds us that true leadership begins with humility, with the courage to take a hard look at ourselves and admit that we’re in a relationship with living systems, not in charge.
If destruction can be built one choice at a time, so can repair. 
In Payahuunadü, the Owens Valley Indian Water Commission continues to fight for water justice and the right to care for Owens Lake once again. Here in Los Angeles, tribal governments and Indigenous-led groups, such as the Tataviam Land Conservancy and Sacred Places Institute, work to restore ancestral lands, revitalize native plants and uplift traditional ecological knowledge. 
Across the region, grassroots groups are repairing relationships to water and soil, planting native trees, removing asphalt and transforming concrete schoolyards into living landscapes. Local agencies are getting serious about solutions we’ve long ignored: stormwater capture, recycled water, groundwater recharge and conservation. 
The Eaton Fire is the latest chapter in the long Eaton story. A name once celebrated for taming water now symbolizes a fire that reveals the limits of our control. 
The irony invites a deeper question: what does accountability look like when harm is inherited but the consequences are still unfolding? The control we seek may already reside within us — in our ability to exercise restraint, respect limits and stay in relationship with things we don’t fully understand. 
Like those before us, we face complex trade-offs. But unlike them, we have the benefit of hindsight and the opportunity, if we’re willing, to choose another way. Will we take it?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/052024_Delta_LE_CM_24.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The discovery recently of more than 150 unmarked graves at a juvenile detention center in Cheltenham has exposed uncomfortable truths not only about the state’s history of mistreating poor Black children in the justice system, but also about its ongoing, racially disproportionate practice of automatically charging young people accused of crime in the state’s adult criminal courts.
The children and youths buried more than a century ago in newly discovered unmarked graves beside the Cheltenham Youth Detention center may have broken the law.  Some, however, may have been the equivalent of today’s status offenders — kids who do things that are illegal only because they are not yet adults, like skipping school or running away from home. Others may have been sent to the House of Reformation and Instruction for Colored Children — as the original facility was called — simply because their families were poor.
Regardless of how they got there, these children were wards of the state, and the state failed in its duty to protect them.
It’s unclear how these children died. Only a deep investigation will give us those answers. But what is clear from these forgotten graves — in the woods, unmarked, half-buried beneath more than a century of fallen sticks and leaves — is that these children’s bodies were disposed of, thrown away, without an acknowledgement of who they were.

The contrast with how we treat other people is heartbreakingly evident when you compare these Black children’s graves to the veterans cemetery that lies immediately adjacent to it. The veterans’ graves have headstones with names and dates. The grounds are meticulously maintained. The brush and leaves are cleared away. The grass is cut regularly.
The ongoing attention and maintenance tells us that the veterans laid to rest are cared for and were loved. The children buried at Cheltenham, not so much.
And Maryland isn’t the only place with this hideous legacy.
More than a dozen years ago, archeologists at the University of South Florida made a similar shocking discovery at Florida’s youth prison, the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys, of dozens of unknown graves of children who died there — nearly 100 children in the prison’s 100-year history.
We may be tempted to believe that these unmarked graves are just an echo from the soil of a time that has passed. But as the great Southern writer William Faulkner reminds us, “The past is never dead. It’s not even past.”
The unmarked graves beside today’s Cheltenham Youth Detention Center expose an uncomfortable truth about how Black children’s lives are being thrown away by the state even now.
Maryland automatically prosecutes more children in adult criminal court than every other state but Alabama. The state’s Black children are five times more likely to be prosecuted in adult court than white youth, even when charged with similar offenses. More than 90% of youths tried as adults in Maryland are children of color; more than 80% are Black.
And yet, if the goal is to make communities safer, research tells us that trying kids in adult courts doesn’t work. In fact, just the opposite is true:  Young people tried in adult courts and placed in adult facilities are more likely to commit another offense — and a more serious one — compared to similar kids who stay in the youth system.
Does the state really want future generations to look at Maryland’s current failings on Black children with the same disgust and judgment of its actions as I imagine many people do now at the site of the unmarked graves at Cheltenham?
Maryland should apologize for the dreadful sins of the past by cleaning up the cemetery, identifying who these children are, finding and notifying their families and placing headstones with the children’ s names.  But the state must also change how it treats children today by ending the automatic transfer of youth to adult criminal court.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Cheltenham-Youth-Detention-Center-1-13-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

In the more than 23,000 assessments conducted by Utah law enforcement since the protocol became statewide law in July 2023, 63% revealed the potential for lethal violence, according to the dashboard data.
The law came out of a tragedy in the family of Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, whose cousin, Amanda “Mandy” Mayne, was murdered three years ago by her ex-husband, who then turned the gun on himself. Her death pushed Henderson to question what more could have been done to help Mayne, and how law enforcement agencies were — or weren’t — communicating with each other about cases of intimate partner violence. 
A painting of Mayne was on display during the news conference, and her mother, Shauna Mayne, was in attendance.
“Data is important. The faces and the names, the families behind the data, are even more important,” Henderson said at a news conference at Veterans Memorial Park in West Jordan on Thursday. “And what we do with this data, what we do with this information, is critical, because information is only good if we use it.”
One way that data could be used, Henderson said, is developing a “second track” when responding to intimate partner violence — what to do with the offender.
“We’ve got the victim track, and we need to get that offender track put in place, because we care about them too, and we want everyone in our state to be successful and happy. And sometimes that requires law enforcement intervention, sometimes that requires better training, sometimes it requires therapy,” Henderson said.
Introducing the dashboard, newly confirmed Department of Public Safety Commissioner Beau Mason said the group had considered rescheduling the event as the state mourns the deaths of Tremonton-Garland Police Sgt. Lee Sorensen and officer Eric Estrada, who were killed Sunday night as they responded to 911 hang-up calls from a Tremonton home. 
“But with that incident, it also brings urgency to how important this cause is and why we are here today, why we gather to talk about such an important topic, and how we can make a difference in domestic violence and intimate partner violence,” Mason said.
Charges filed Wednesday allege Ryan Michael Bate, 32, headbutted his wife and slammed her head with a door before grabbing her throat and pushing her against a wall. One officer was shot running to help the woman after Bate shot at his police vehicle, prosecutors said, and the second was killed as he attempted to render aid to his fallen colleague. Prosecutors announced they intend to pursue the death penalty for Bate.

It wasn’t the first time Bate had been involved in a domestic violence report, said Rep. Ryan Wilcox, R-Ogden, who co-sponsored SB117 in the Utah House in 2023, expanding the lethality assessment protocol statewide. In a previous case, he said, the lethality assessment had been utilized to identify potential risk Bate posed and gave an opportunity to offer domestic violence services.
Now, following the deaths of Sorensen and Estrada, Wilcox said the question of what to do with offenders to prevent future violence has weighed heavy on him.
“We had him,” Wilcox said of Bate. “We issued the protocol. It gave us the information we were looking for, and he didn’t murder her at that time, and in the back of my mind all week, ever since I read the report, has been ‘what should we have done differently then that would have prevented the loss of life of these officers?’” Wilcox said.
After SB117 became law and the lethality assessment went into use around Utah, Wilcox said, he was surprised, though he shouldn’t have been, at just how much it was being used and the resources that were needed in response.
“We hoped that it would save some lives. We hoped that it would work. We didn’t realize the depth of … how many would need to be added, that we would find,” Wilcox said. “That’s what I expect will happen as we hone these tools and we will uncover more things. We’ll understand better how to help. We’ll understand better how to prevent and understand how to get ahead of it, so that we don’t have to be here having these conversations again.”

(Photos courtesy of candidates. Graphic Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Voters in Cullman and Blount counties will go to the polls Tuesday to elect a new representative in the House District 11 special election.
Voters in the district, which covers part of Cullman and Blount counties, will choose between GOP nominee Heath Allbright and Democratic nominee Alex Braswell. The seat was left open when former Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tempore Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman. 
The district is solidly Republican. Shedd, who won the seat in a special election in 2013, never faced opposition in any subsequent general election.

The candidates

Allbright, 39, has campaigned on conservative Christian values, supporting local education and tax cuts for small businesses. Multiple messages seeking comment from Allbright were left this week.
Dalton Dismukes, Allbright’s campaign manager, wrote in an email Thursday that Allbright is meeting with as many community members as possible.
“Heath’s priorities remain the same as they were when he started: cutting taxes and wasteful spending, protecting and fighting for family values, and ensuring students, families, teachers, and everyone in House District 11 benefit from a strong, quality education,” Dismukes wrote.
 Allbright defeated 60-year-old Don Fallin in the May primary with 54.3% of votes. Allbright has been endorsed by the former seat holder.
Braswell, 31, has campaigned on protecting the rights of disabled Alabamians, access to CBD and road safety. She said in an interview on Monday that her campaign has gone well, and feels it has made a difference in her community.
“Still, by all means, advocating for the rights to the disabled CBD access … Really, I would love to legalize marijuana and get it over with, but we need to start with the small goals here,” the American Sign Language interpreter said. “So CBD access and road safety, just ensuring our roads are safe.”
Braswell, the first Democrat to run in a general election in the district since 2006, secured an endorsement from former U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama, who also held a town hall campaign event for Braswell. 
“We’ve had some great people alongside us, and our town hall was a great success,” she said. “I really couldn’t be more proud of our campaign.”

Campaign finances

Allbright has raised $128,501.57 in monetary contributions and more than $12,000 in in-kind contributions, according to campaign finance records. About half of his monetary contributions come from political action committees (PACs), with the Alabama Forestry PAC donating more than other PACs at $7,531.57. 
The Alabama House Majority PAC also donated $5,000 during the primary campaign.
Braswell has raised $14,686.47 in monetary donations and about $800 in in-kind services, according to campaign finance records, with no PACs contributing. Braswell said that most of her campaign materials like yard signs and car magnets were possible because of in-kind donations.
“It’s been just overwhelming because I never thought for a special, and granted I still don’t have a 10th of what Albright has, but most of the baseline supplies that I’ve needed for a campaign were all kindly donated,” Braswell said.

How to vote

District 11 voters can choose between Allbright and Braswell on Aug. 26. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Polling locations can be found here. The winner will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives.

The Nevada Employee Savings Trust, or NEST, launched on July 1. Through the program, Nevadans who do not have access to retirement plans through their private-sector employers will be automatically enrolled in an Individual Retirement Account and can contribute to it a certain amount (or percentage) of each paycheck.
Employees have the ability to opt out of the program, but according to the Nevada State Treasurer’s Office, which administers NEST, approximately 20,500 people have already been enrolled.
That number is expected to rise. By Sept. 1, businesses with six or more employees will be required to either offer their own retirement plan or enroll their employees into NEST.
“I think this is going to help tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands, of Nevadans be in a better place,” said Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine.
An estimated 593,000 Nevadans lack easy access to a retirement account, according to AARP. Nationally, 1 in 4 adults have no retirement savings at all, according to the American Retirement Association.
It’s estimated more than 40% of small businesses nationwide do not offer retirement benefits to their employees. Employers often cite cost as the barrier stopping them from offering a retirement plan, according to Pew.
States are increasingly deciding to step in, boosted by research showing people are far more likely to save for retirement when contributions are automatically deducted from their paycheck.
Twelve states now have auto-IRA programs, and according to Pew, more than a million people have saved $2 billion through them since the launch of the first program in Oregon in 2017.
The Nevada State Legislature established NEST through legislation passed in 2023. That bill, Senate Bill 305, was sponsored by three Democrats and a Republican. All Democrats supported the measure, while Republicans were divided in their support. Gov. Joe Lombardo signed the bill into law.
Conine acknowledges that access to, and even initial enrollment in, NEST “doesn’t mean every Nevadan is going to save.”
He added, “Not everyone will choose to use it, but those that do all of a sudden have a way to save for retirement really easily — like, really, really easily.”
In advance of the new retirement plan requirement, the Vegas Chamber launched its own pooled 401k program, something Conine sees as a benefit to the community.
“If (people) are saving,I do not care if they are saving with us,” he said. “I care if they’re saving.”
The NEST model could be particularly beneficial for people who work multiple jobs or switch jobs often.
“If you’ve got an account and you’ve got two jobs and you want to put in some money from both paychecks, you can,” said Conine. “You want to put in more money from one and less money from another, you can. If you go get a third job and don’t have either of those two original jobs anymore, you still have the account.”
Gig workers can also set up NEST accounts and deposit money.
The program is designed with retirement in mind, but contributions are easily accessible for emergencies.
“We have a lot of Nevadans, unfortunately, who live paycheck to paycheck,” he said. “When they have some unexpected expense, an emergency, a lot of times they have to go to a payday lender, a title lender, or some other very, very expensive source of credit.”
The principal balance on NEST accounts can be pulled out by the account holder without penalty. As a Roth IRA, contributions are post-tax.
“It can serve as an emergency account,” said Conine.
If someone moves out of Nevada, their account can stay open and contributions can even still be deposited directly into the account. If they have moved to one of the five states in the same interstate consortium as Nevada — Colorado, Maine, Delaware, Vermont and Minnesota — they may be able to connect their account to their new employer in that state.
NEST comes with no costs to employers, other than the minimal time it takes to facilitate enrollment in the program.
Ongoing costs of running the program will be covered through minimal fees, which Conine said are lower than at similar funds not run by states. He put the cost at around $26 annually, plus one-fifth of one percent, or a $2 fee on $1,000.
The upfront $1.2 million cost of launching NEST was covered through a loan from the state general fund.

,California,2025-08-22 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Renewal of California cap and trade program to cut emissions is fraught with issues,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/08/cap-and-trade-renewal-fraught/,"There are several issues to resolve in the remaining weeks of California's legislative session. Many are fraught with political conflict, but the cap and trade program is particularly complex.","While the Capitol is fixated on Gov. Gavin Newsom’s drive to rearrange California’s congressional districts in order to counter a pro-Republican gerrymander in Texas, there are several other pithy issues to resolve and just three weeks remaining in the legislative session.
They include a new effort to jumpstart housing construction, whether California should merge its electrical power grid with those of other Western states, regulation of artificial intelligence and renewal of the state’s cap and trade program for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.
All are fraught with political conflict, but those of cap and trade are particularly complex.
Each quarter, the state Air Resources Board auctions emission permits with proceeds being used, at least in theory, to reduce greenhouse gases. The program is due to end in 2030 and Newsom wants to renew it for an additional 15 years, albeit with some tweaks.
The issue’s macro-politics are that while gas-emitting industries and business groups favor its renewal as a predictable way of meeting emission reduction goals, environmental groups see it as business buying exemptions from pollution. They would prefer direct company-by-company regulation.
Within that conflict are other issues, such as steadily dropping proceeds from the emission auctions, which emitters with vital products should be given permits without cost, and how auction revenues should be spent.
Newsom wants the program to be renamed “cap and invest.” In the state budget he signed in June, it declared the establishment of “a stable and predictable price on carbon pollution to drive deeper investments in carbon reduction and clean technologies.”
However, the more than $30 billion generated by the auctions to date are not always being spent on effective emission reduction programs. Some are being used instead to finance programs that are strapped for money.
For instance, Newsom wants to keep setting aside at least $1 billion a year in auction funds to keep the state’s much-troubled bullet train project alive. In theory, electric-powered trains would reduce carbon emissions by replacing auto and airline travel, but the data behind that rationale are shaky.
By the state’s own projections several years ago, a fully constructed north-south system would reduce auto travel by 16.3 million vehicle-miles each day. That sounds impressive but is just shy of 2% of the nearly one billion miles Californians drive each day. Meanwhile, bullet train construction itself is emitting carbon.
Newsom also wants auction funds to pay for fighting the state’s many wildfires, which are major sources of pollution. It would relieve the general fund budget of that burden, but would do little or nothing to prevent those fires.
One of the biggest issues, at least politically, is the impact on Californians’ living costs. It’s well-established that emitters pass on their costs as higher prices — 23 cents per gallon of gasoline, the Legislative Analyst’s Office has calculated.
Chevron executive Andy Walz told a Public Policy Institute of California forum on the issue Thursday that refiners consider cap-and-trade costs as a major factor in deciding whether to continue operating in the state. California once had dozens of refineries but only nine remain and two of them have announced closure plans. Newsom and legislators, who only months ago were denouncing refiners as price-gougers, now are pleading with them to remain in business to avoid big price increases during the conversion to a zero-emission economy.
Meanwhile, a recent poll by the PPIC found that while a majority of Californians want the state to reduce carbon emissions, they also don’t want to pay higher energy costs from that effort.
That bifurcated attitude colors whether cap and trade will be renewed and how its costs will be borne.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/022124-Chevron-Richmond-LE-CM-07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-22 08:56:09.894951

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The interim CEO for the Southern Poverty Law Center said he does not plan to seek the job permanently and will step aside once a candidate is found.
SPLC Board members appointed Fair interim CEO in July soon after Margaret Huang resigned, citing family reasons. In an interview earlier this month, Fair said he will not be a candidate as the civil rights group conducts a nationwide search for a permanent leader.
“I am in a transition, we are in a transition,” Fair said in an interview following his remarks at an event commemorating the 60th anniversary of the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. “I am the interim president, and I am not a candidate to be the permanent president.”
Huang said in a statement in July that she considered herself “fortunate” that she has had the opportunities to communities of color in places throughout the South, but that the work can be demanding.
“And while I am deeply committed to this work, the reality is that the demands of my job have created serious challenges for me and my family as I have tried to support and care for aging parents at the same time,” Huang said. “Recently, I realized that if I want to live my values, I need to make significant changes at home.”
Huang said that those in the baby boom generation are increasingly demanding medical care, and that Millennials and Gen Xers, like Huang, are struggling to find the resources to care for their aging parents.
“As a daughter, I am so grateful that my parents — both former teachers — saved for this situation,” Huang said in her statement. “So many families can’t afford to access the support of professional caregivers. But like so many others, I worry about the long-term costs of these arrangements and what will happen as Medicaid and Medicare budgets are reduced over the next five years.”
Huang was the executive director of Amnesty International before getting hired to lead SPLC in 2020 after a tumultuous period for the organization that saw the ouster of co-founder Morris Dees and the resignation of several executives amid questions of racial gender equity at SPLC.
Huang attempted to move SPLC toward community organizing during her time on the job while trying to maintain the organization’s traditional litigation approach. But she faced challenges. SPLC announced that it was laying off part of its workforce in June 2024 and the SPLC Union, representing the employees in the organization, approved a motion of no confidence in Huang in September of the same year.
“SPLC’s new CEO should be someone who values the experience and expertise of our staff,” the SPLC Union said in a statement on Thursday. “We know SPLC can thrive and rebuild its reputation under a leader who meaningfully seeks staff input on the strategic direction of our work and who is committed to increasing job security, resilience, dignity, and morale in our workplace.
He also said he leaves the responsibility to members of the board and staff to select SPLC’s next leader.
“I have complete confidence in the board and the staff at SPLC to make an excellent choice for its next leader,” Fair said.
For its tax year that ended on Oct. 31, SPLC reported $129 million in revenues, down from $169.9 million the year before. It reported spending nearly $129 million, up from $122.1 million in 2023.

The forecast comes as the Trump administration has set up roadblocks to clean energy development, including funding cuts and an order that directs Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally approve all solar and wind energy projects on public lands.
Developers are on track to add 33 gigawatts of solar power in the U.S. in 2025, accounting for about half of the total new electricity generating capacity planned for the country, the agency said on Wednesday.
In the first half of the year, 12 gigawatts of solar capacity was added to the grid with the remaining 21 gigawatts planned in the second half. 
If energy developers’ plans are fully realized, large-scale solar power additions in the U.S. would reach a record single-year high, said the EIA.
Battery storage, wind, and natural gas power plants account for virtually all of the rest of the 64 gigawatts of capacity additions planned for 2025.
Solar energy does not produce global warming emissions. That makes it central to plans by U.S. states to decarbonize, while also meeting record-high electricity demand brought on by energy-intensive industries like data centers. 
Many of the federal government financial incentives that propelled the development of solar power over the last several years, however, will disappear under the administration of President Donald Trump, adding uncertainty to future developments.
On Aug. 1, Interior Secretary Burgum signed an order seeking to rein in “environmentally damaging” solar and wind power projects on federal lands. Burgum said the clean energy technologies were an inefficient use of “federal lands when compared to other energy sources with much smaller footprints, like nuclear, gas and coal.”
A week later, the Environmental Protection Agency announced it was ending a $7 billion program that offered solar energy grants to help states develop solar for low-income households. Nevada lost a $156 million grant from the cancellation. 
Last month, Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” rolled back most federal support for renewable energy, including tax credits that fueled solar development. 
But a July 15 memo mandating that all solar and wind energy projects on public lands be personally approved by Burgum could be especially significant for Nevada – where more than 80% of land is federally managed. 
Trump policy prompts NV Energy to seek escape hatch for would-be clean energy transmitters  

In an Aug. 4 letter to Burgum, Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo wrote that in Nevada “solar projects deep in the project pipeline have been frozen” by the administration’s July announcement. 
One of the projects listed by Lombardo – 174 Power Global’s Boulder Solar III project – is listed by the EIA as one of the solar projects planned for installation in 2025, but it has yet to receive regulatory approval by the federal government.
“Solar energy development in Nevada is crucial to our state’s economic future and will contribute to the Nation’s energy dominance and independence,” Lombardo wrote. 
In 2024, Nevada ranked fourth in the nation in total electricity generation from utility- and small-scale solar resources combined. Solar provided 31% of the state’s total generation, according to the EIA. 
While Nevada’s solar capacity has grown substantially, most of the new solar capacity nationally in 2025 was attributed to Texas, California, and Arizona.
Texas accounted for more than a quarter of the solar power developed so far in 2025. For the second half of the year, Texas plans to add another 9.7 gigawatts of new solar capacity, or nearly half of all of U.S. solar planned for development over that time period.
Battery storage accounted for the second-largest share of capacity additions in the first half of the year, about half of which was in Arizona or California.
Relatively little generating capacity has been retired this year, according to the EIA. 
In the first half of the year, only 2 gigawatts of the 8.7 gigawatts scheduled to be retired from service this year were pulled back. More than 3.6 gigawatts of power planned for retirement have been delayed or canceled. 
If the other planned retirements stay on track, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas at 19%.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Solar-Robin-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 07:56:39.044716

HARTFORD — Three people have been arrested in connection with a fatal shooting Thursday morning, and authorities also have identified the victims, police announced overnight.
David Labrecque, 65, of Canaan, was pronounced dead Thursday morning at the scene off VA Cutoff Road, Vermont State Police said in a news release issued at 2 a.m.
The injured victim was identified as Jessica Lemay, 36, also of Canaan, who police said was being treated for multiple gunshot wounds at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire.
Police identified the suspects as Demetrius Drew, 30, of New Haven, Conn. , the alleged gunman, and Jeffrey Mullins, 46, and Michelle Mullins, 48, both of Rindge, N.H.
Drew is charged with first-degree murder, attempted second-degree murder, and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. The Mullinses are both charged with being an accessory before the fact.
The news release did not offer any details about the investigation, such as how, when and where the trio was apprehended. All three are are being held without bail and are scheduled to be arraigned at 12:30 p.m. Friday in the Criminal Division of Vermont Superior Court in White River Junction.
Thursday’s investigation began just before 4 a.m. when Hartford police received a 911 call reporting gunshots at a residence on Verna Court.

Judge Matthew Brann of the Middle District of Pennsylvania, in a highly anticipated ruling over the legality of Habba’s appointment, said because federal law allows for 120-day terms for acting U.S. attorneys who do not receive confirmation by the U.S. Senate, Habba’s term ended on July 1 and she has been acting “without lawful authority” since then.
Brann’s ruling represents the second time federal judges have rejected Trump’s pick for chief federal prosecutor of New Jersey. When Habba’s term was set to expire in July and she had yet to receive Senate confirmation, New Jersey’s federal judges named her first assistant, Desiree Leigh Grace, as her replacement, angering the Trump administration so much it fired Grace and implemented a series of personnel changes intended to give Habba another 210 days on the job.
Brann called that maneuvering “novel” but unlawful. He stayed his decision for an expected appeal to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. Habba predicted the Trump administration would win on appeal.
“You might try and change my title, you might try and fight me, but just like today with New York, we will win, we always do. It just takes time,” Habba said on Fox News Thursday.
A New York state appeals court on Thursday overturned a nearly $500 million civil penalty against President Donald Trump, but left in place a finding of fraud based on records that inflated the value of Trump’s business holdings.

Polls show that, regardless of political affiliation, preserving our natural wonders is wildly popular.

Regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum, the vast majority of us feel a deep connection with nature and outdoor public spaces and do not want to see them sold. Unfortunately, America’s public lands are now under attack and at-risk of being sold off to the highest bidder.
The Trump administration has fired rangers and defunded the parks department. On February 14, 5% of the National Parks Service was laid off. These people are stewards of our national treasures and their stories are harrowing. Yet these cuts are just the beginning. There are plans to further reduce the Parks’ budget, slashing it by as much as one-third.
Sen. Mike Lee, R-Ariz., introduced legislation to sell up to 3 million acres of our public land while making 250 million acres available for sale. While it failed, there is still a looming battle over our shared natural inheritance.
In Vermont, over 12,000 acres of forestland are converted to non-forest use annually. While this is more due to rural sprawl, our forests are being fragmented, threatening biodiversity and animal migration. A recently failed proposal to build an Amazon distribution facility in Saxon Hill shows how ardently Vermonters oppose this type of development. 
Privatization of public lands leads to mining, logging and other destructive activities. At an oil industry conference, Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum called our national parks the “largest balance sheet in the world.” The Trump administration has repeatedly advocated a “Drill Baby, Drill” approach to our public lands.
This is not how most Americans feel about our purple mountain majesties. Polls show that, regardless of political affiliation, preserving our natural wonders is wildly popular. Americans recognize our obligation to preserve the natural splendor for future generations. Unfortunately, the state is abdicating its duty. 
While America’s natural wonders are under threat, her financial assets are booming.
The stock market hit a record high on July 2 and has continued its upward trajectory. A strong jobs report caused U.S. Treasury yields to spike. That said, the link between Wall Street and Main Street is severed. Wages have failed to keep pace with productivity gains across Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. Almost 4 in 10 Americans don’t own any stocks or bonds. The trillions in stock market gains are enriching already-resourced individuals, creating an even bigger divide between the haves and have-nots. 
When the government steps back, non-governmental organizations step up. Many groups are filling the void left by the cuts to National Parks Services, and they need your help.
As a member of the board of The Nature Conservancy in Vermont, I own my bias, but there are many groups doing important conservation work in Vermont — from local land trusts to state-wide initiatives.
The Nature Conservancy is a politically non-partisan group, putting the work over the politics. We advocate for practical, science-based policies under both red and blue administrations. In Vermont, The Nature Conservancy is working to conserve critical habitats for biodiversity and climate resilience, store carbon by preserving our forests, and create a vast network of connected, conserved lands.
If you feel that our shared natural inheritance does not belong in the hands of Wall Street, please consider donating to the vital conservation work happening around our beautiful state. Once these lands are lost, we’ll never get them back.

Criticism of Israeli government actions and policies in and of itself is not antisemitic harassment, just as my criticisms of the Trump administration’s actions and policies are not anti-American.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Heather Wood: A response to Mark Treinkman regarding H.310.","This commentary is by Heather Wood, of Waterbury.


In his recent letter to the editor, “Clearing up misconceptions about H.310,” Mark Treinkman accuses Habib Meiloud — who had written an earlier commentary opposing H.310 — of failing to read H.310. Well, I suspect Habib Meiloud did, in fact, read the bill. And so did I. 
H.310 indeed does not mention Israel. It does, however, in Sec. 2. 16 V.S.A. § 11, define “antisemitic harassment” as including “negative references to Jewish customs or the right of self-determination in the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland.”
In other words, if this bill was passed and implemented as written, it could reasonably be interpreted as prohibiting discussions of, say, the ramifications of Israel restricting humanitarian aid in Gaza or undermining the possibility of an eventual Palestinian state by moving ahead with controversial settlements in the West Bank.
In other words, contrary to Mark Treinkman’s assertion, the bill states clearly that “negative references” about “self-determination” in Israel would constitute “antisemitic harassment.” Israel is considered to be “the Jewish people’s ancestral and indigenous homeland.”

It is also the ancestral and indigenous homeland of the Palestinian people, hence our ongoing conflicts and endless debates. Those conflicts and debates are not going away, no matter how many bills targeting free speech like H.310 get passed and how many universities get their research funding cut because of accusations of antisemitism.
It is true that both antisemitic harassment and anti-Muslim harassment are on the rise; that is, indeed, a concern worthy of legislative intervention. But criticism of Israeli government actions and policies in and of itself is not antisemitic harassment, just as my criticisms of the Trump administration’s actions and policies are not anti-American. It might behoove the Jewish people to stop equating Israel’s politics and state actions with their ethnicity; otherwise, they might start seeing antisemitism absolutely everywhere and in everything.

Santiago/Getty Images)Dozens of Democratic lawmakers in the Washington Legislature have pushed in recent months to reassess how the state Department of Corrections shares information with federal immigration authorities.
But Washington’s governor and attorney general, both first-term Democrats, see no need to change current policy. 
The Keep Washington Working Act, passed in 2019, strictly limits local police from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. This month, the statute has spawned a war of words between Gov. Bob Ferguson and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi over whether it violates federal law.
The Department of Corrections remains an exception under the state law. And that doesn’t sit well with some Democrats.
“I don’t think that we have done everything in our ability to keep communities safe,” said state Rep. Sharlett Mena, D-Tacoma. “Certainly, I don’t think we’ve done enough with Department of Corrections information sharing.”
The state agency can ask for and collect information about inmates’ immigration status and country of origin to share with embassies, spokesperson Christopher Wright said. Prison staff don’t confirm this information. And incarcerated Washingtonians aren’t required to provide it.
The Department of Corrections sends a weekly report to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement listing the names of everyone newly admitted to the state’s prisons, regardless of immigration status. ICE compares those names to its list of people who they believe should be deported. 
Agents can then share detainer requests with the Department of Corrections, allowing the prison system to let immigration authorities know when people will be released and coordinate transferring custody to ICE. 
Corrections doesn’t hold people beyond their release date so that ICE can pick them up, Wright noted. And the agency doesn’t allow agents to interview incarcerated people on their immigration status while in prison, unless the person consents.
Despite the information sharing between the department and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the number of people federal immigration authorities detain after their release from Washington prisons has been dropping for years, state data shows. 
Of the 61 prisoners wanted by immigration authorities who have been released this year, ICE has picked up 51 of them, the highest rate in the past decade. In 2024, immigration agents detained 101 of 128 of those leaving prison. 
The number of prisoners exiting with ICE detainers has dropped over the past decade from more than 300 in 2015. This mirrors a declining prison population in general, Wright said.
The more than 500 prisoners still in custody with ICE detainers have mostly been convicted of violent offenses. More than one-third are serving time for murder convictions, and more than one-quarter are in prison on rape charges, according to state data. 
ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security didn’t provide comment.
‘Why do we do this?’
In a letter to Ferguson in June, around four dozen state lawmakers, as well as city and county council members from western Washington, called for a second look at the Department of Corrections’ role under the law. 
Mena, who spearheaded the letter, met with top aides from Ferguson’s office about the concerns. She said they were receptive to changing prison policy. She’s now figuring out ways the Department of Corrections is sharing information that isn’t required by federal law that Ferguson could address through executive action, instead of through new legislation. 
For example, she says prison staff don’t need to ask prisoners about citizenship status. She also wants Corrections to stop volunteering the lists of people newly admitted into prison.
“I want to have a deeper conversation about, why do we voluntarily share that list, as opposed to letting the Department of Homeland Security specifically request information about certain folks?” Mena said. “That is truly not required. That’s my biggest question mark is, why do we do this?”
Some worry changing the law could make it vulnerable to legal challenges.
In a February press conference, Ferguson noted advocates’ concerns about the state prisons’ continued cooperation with immigration authorities, but said he wouldn’t make changes. 
Ferguson’s position hasn’t changed. 
“We’re always happy to have a conversation about anything that the state’s doing,” he said in an interview Thursday. “But I think the Legislature in 2019, when they passed the bipartisan Keep Washington Working Act, struck a good balance. They carved out an exception for the Department of Corrections in a thoughtful way and the Department of Corrections is acting in a way that’s totally consistent with the Keep Washington Working Act.”
Similar to Ferguson, state Attorney General Nick Brown said he doesn’t “see any reason right now to change the law” on Corrections’ information sharing with ICE.
“We want to make sure that we’re continuing to protect people in Washington from people who have committed crimes or have a risk of danger moving forward,” he said in an interview this week.
Wright, from the Department of Corrections, also said the agency has “no intention” of changing its policy.
Meanwhile, Mena said President Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda has created more urgency around the issue. 
She has been leading the charge on this in part because of one of her constituents, Ngoc Phan, whose husband had finished a 25-year sentence for murder and assault when ICE detained him. 
Tuan Thanh Phan was a lawful permanent resident from Vietnam before his conviction. He was in limbo for weeks in the African country of Djibouti as advocates fought in court the Trump administration’s move to deport immigrants to so-called third countries. These are places where the deportee has no ties. 
Ferguson denied a pardon request for Phan, to the disappointment of Mena, other lawmakers and advocates. The U.S. Supreme Court in early July cleared the way for the final deportation of Phan and seven others to South Sudan in the headline-grabbing case. 
This year, lawmakers approved an expedited pardon process for immigrants facing deportation.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/immigration-ICE-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 07:56:39.044716

(Getty Images)It feels like every day there is a new request to raise electric rates or a new report on how much utility costs are growing. It’s become crisis level, and I consider it even more important than the debate over property taxes.
A recent NPR article said across the country, electricity prices have jumped more than twice as fast as the overall cost of living in the last year.
So, who’s to blame? If only it were that easy. There is no one culprit — instead it’s a handful of factors all colliding to create the highest summer bills I have ever seen. And that’s with a vigilant husband who controls the thermostat.
First, I’ll talk about what I have seen firsthand: lawmakers giving utilities more freedom each year to recoup costs from ratepayers and protect shareholders over consumers. I understand some of the requests from utilities, but customers never seem to win in the discussion.
These so-called trackers allow utility companies to adjust rates for specific costs outside of a normal base rate case before the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. For instance, Hoosier power companies can recover costs related to transmission, distribution and storage system improvements. But there are many others.
Hoosiers’ electric bills spike 17.5% in one year

That means that part of my bill is paying to upgrade an aging infrastructure. Think about it like you having to replace your roof after 30 years. But in personal finances you save for that — something utilities clearly haven’t done.
Hoosiers also haven’t fully embraced all forms of power. From coal and natural gas to solar and wind, all can add to the reliability and affordability of power in Indiana. But in some cases, legislators have limited or outright banned incentives or designations for renewable options. Instead, they are going all in for small modular nuclear reactors.
I fully support exploring nuclear, but the fact is it is likely decades away from coming to fruition and does nothing to help Hoosiers now. And yet that is where legislators focused much of their effort earlier this year.
Then there are those power-hungry data centers. They seem to be popping up everywhere. While only a few of them are partially active in Indiana, many others have been proposed. They create a very real threat to power in Indiana, and I can’t see what advantages they bring to Hoosiers. They usually create a small number of jobs and long tax abatements limit their impact on the tax base.
The last thing I will mention is the rate game. Utilities come in and propose purposely high rate hikes. The Office of Utility Consumer Counselor opposes, and the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission approves a lower rate, but one that still adds to the burden.
This is one area where Gov. Mike Braun could have an impact. He likes to talk tough, and I hope he brings that same approach to his role over appointments on both agencies.
The agencies will have new leadership soon and he needs to make clear it’s time to start putting the consumer first — not utility shareholders. That’s harder than it looks when you see how much utilities spend in the political arena.
Beyond millions each year in direct donations to campaigns, utilities are among the top spenders on lobbying activities. And some of the state’s largest utilities also help fund the Indiana Economic Development Foundation.
There is no silver bullet. But a starting point would be for legislative leadership to clearly acknowledge the problem and commit to finding solutions.

That’s a change from the The Indiana Department of Correction’s earlier consolidation plan laid out in 2023, which called for shuttering both Indiana State Prison and Westville Correctional Facility to save on staffing and operating costs.
Instead, DOC confirmed to the Indiana Capital Chronicle this week that Westville will close as originally planned, but the state prison will remain open indefinitely.
The Westville facility is just 14 miles south of Michigan City, where the Indiana State Prison is located.
The new correctional facility — which DOC calls the Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility — is still under construction on the site of the current Westville correctional campus.

“DOC still intends to close Westville Correctional Facility with the opening of the new Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility,” said DOC spokesperson Annie Goeller. “We have been collaborating with state and local officials on the future of the Indiana State Prison, which we intend to keep open for some time after the opening of the new facility. At this time, we have not yet determined how long that will be.”
It’s not clear, though, whether DOC’s cooperation with federal immigration authorities influenced the timeline. 
Earlier this month, Gov. Mike Braun’s administration announced it would lease up to 1,000 empty state prison beds to the federal government to house immigration detainees.
Goeller cited recent growth in the state’s incarcerated population as a factor but did not say  specifically if arrangements with federal officials factored into the decision to keep the state prison open longer.
“DOC’s population has been growing for the last several months and we are focused on utilizing our current space efficiently, which includes the space at Indiana State Prison,” she said.
Even so, the Indiana Public Defender Council expressed concern that federal contracts could stretch already thin staff even further.
“Our prisons are already understaffed, with correctional officers overworked and pulled away from their core mission of humanely housing and rehabilitating the people in their charge,” the group said. “Additional federal demands only hinder the state’s ability to maintain the standards of safety and rehabilitation it has worked hard to achieve.”
The council additionally pointed to a December 2024 agreement between then-Gov. Eric Holcomb and Michigan City that envisioned transferring the site to the city by 2029.
“IPDC has always recognized that the Indiana State Prison could not be decommissioned overnight, but Governor Holcomb’s letter of intent to transfer ownership to Michigan City by January 1, 2029, suggested its closure was on the horizon,” the council said. “We hope that remains the plan.”
A new prison in the works
Construction on the new Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility is proceeding on schedule, and is under budget. 
Goeller said a “majority of buildings” have their exterior completed and interior work is ongoing.
The new facility is set to open in 2027.
Elevatus Architecture was selected to lead the $1.2 billion effort, from planning through construction completion. The campus design consists of 28 buildings totaling about 1.4 million square feet. It’s the first new prison built in Indiana in more than 20 years.
According to the architecture firm, administrative spaces at the new prison site will be enhanced to provide amenities for staff “that they have not been afforded in the existing facilities.”
A medical area and dedicated mental health building for inmates are under construction, too. Recreational spaces, vocational programs and industrial manufacturing are also included in the campus design.
The maximum-security facility will have 4,200 beds, making it one of the largest in the state.
When the project was announced in 2023, DOC leaders emphasized cost savings as the driving motivation.

Then-Commissioner Christina Reagle told lawmakers the consolidation would save the state $45 million a year in operating costs, noting that it would not be “cost effective” to renovate the 163-year-old Indiana State Prison. 
The state’s budget leaders backed the plan, pointing to long-term efficiency gains by staffing and maintaining one modern complex instead of two outdated ones. Initially lawmakers set aside about $400 million in 2021 but inflation and supply chain challenges caused a boost in the 2023 budget.
Both existing facilities are now running near capacity — and the state’s prison population keeps ticking upward.
DOC’s latest figures for August show that the Indiana State Prison is housing 2,436 inmates in 2,486 available beds, putting it at nearly 98% of its capacity. Westville holds 2,858 inmates in 3,013 beds, at about 95% capacity.
Both prison facilities have additional bed space — around 463 beds in Westville and 52 beds in Michigan City — but DOC officials said staffing and maintenance constraints, among other issues, have kept those beds offline. 
The future of the Indiana State Prison site
The long-term fate of the sprawling Indiana State Prison property remains unclear. 
Holcomb signed a letter of intent with Michigan City in December 2024, laying the groundwork to transfer ownership of the prison site to the city by Jan. 1, 2029. That agreement was meant to give Michigan City time to plan while the new prison was under construction.
The deal was described as part of an Indiana State Prison “reimagination strategy,” aimed at spurring community-driven redevelopment of the site.
DOC plans to close Indiana State Prison as part of new Westville project — which now tops $1.2B

Local leaders in Michigan City have spent the past year gathering ideas for how the historic prison site might be reused once the state vacates it.
Residents have suggested everything from mixed-use housing and business space to parks and cultural attractions, noting the waterfront location and historic architecture as assets.
The effort has already drawn state backing. Michigan City was awarded READI 2.0 funds to support community planning around the site, which officials say will help with public engagement and long-term design work.
If Indiana State Prison remains open beyond 2029, however, DOC and the Indiana Department of Administration may have to revisit the agreement terms.
Because Holcomb’s letter of intent was not a final deed transfer, state officials have acknowledged that DOC, IDOA and Michigan City would might need to negotiate a new arrangement if the prison facility is still operational at the end of the decade.
That could mean pushing back the transfer date, entering into a phased transfer or striking a revised agreement that allows part of the site to be repurposed while the prison continues operating elsewhere on the grounds. IDOA did not reply to the Capital Chronicle’s request for comment about the deed transfer.
The public defender council said the delayed closing decision underscores state expectations that the prison population will continue to rise.
“[I]t is no secret that DOC is preparing for a larger prison population, with projections indicating the count could exceed 28,000 by 2028,” the group continued. “While many factors play a role, a central driver is the reduction in credit time enacted in the 2014 criminal justice reforms, compounded by new crimes and sentence enhancements. In other words, policy choices, not crime rates, are fueling this growth.”

(Photo Illustration by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Tuesday he’s suing TikTok for illegally exploiting young users. The lawsuit resembles a similar suit filed by more than a dozen bipartisan attorneys general last year. They allege that TikTok’s addictive algorithm, which delivers personalized content in a never-ending scroll of short videos, along with other features such as TikTok LIVE and “beauty filters,” are harming young users’ mental health in what amounts to a deceitful trade practice.
The lawsuit cites data on TikTok usage among Minnesotan youth specifically, though the numbers are redacted because TikTok says they are confidential, according to the attorney general’s office.
We know that TikTok usage is widespread among teens nationwide, suggesting similar trends in Minnesota. Apart from YouTube, TikTok is the most popular social media app among teens. A 2024 survey by Pew Research found that 63% of U.S. teenagers use TikTok, down from 67% in 2022, with 16% — one out of every six American teenagers — who say they use TikTok “almost constantly.”
And, TikTok’s own data show that teens check the app “an average of 17 times a day and spend an average of almost two hours a day on the app, more than any other age group,” according to the lawsuit.
Many teens say they use social media too much — 27%, according to a survey conducted in 2023 by Pew.
As kids say they are glued to their phones, their mental health appears to be worsening, both here and nationwide.
Minnesota’s statewide student survey reports that nearly one-third of 11th graders in 2022 said they had long-term mental health problems, compared to 27% in 2019. For ninth graders, the percentages were 28% in 2022, up from 23% in 2019.
Though many mental health questions in the survey change, students across time are asked about how often they build friendships. The results show an increasing percentage of kids without close friends. The percentage of 11th graders who say that they build friendships with other people “not at all or rarely” jumped from 3.8% in 2013 to 7% in 2022.
More teens think that smartphones make it more difficult to learn good social skills, according to the 2023 Pew survey.
It’s not just kids who are worried about their social media use. Of 1,400 mental health workers surveyed by Politico, over a quarter believe that social media is the biggest driver of mental health issues in kids, though clinicians cite a variety of other factors, such as political instability and social isolation.
What remains uncertain — at the moment — is a causal link between social media use and mental health problems.
For example, Candice L. Odgers, a University of California-Irvine psychologist, wrote in Nature last year that the “suggestion that digital technologies are rewiring our children’s brains and causing an epidemic of mental illness is not supported by science.”
Ellison explicitly compares TikTok to nicotine. The comparison unwittingly underscores just how much patience Minnesotans may need to hold the social media giants accountable if indeed they are selling a dangerous product.

A federal lawsuit filed on Bishop’s behalf in 2023 after her parole says her prolonged time in solitary confinement caused “depression, hopelessness, severe anxiety and feeling as if she were going insane and reaching a mental breaking point.” It also, the lawsuit says, drove her to “physically self-harm including attempts to take her own life.”
On Wednesday, the department agreed to a settlement, setting new policies and training requirements. But Bishop died before the settlement could be reached, taking her own life in October 2024.
“My sister, Honesty, was a fighter who never gave up,” Latasha Monroe, Bishop’s sister, said in a news release from the MacArthur Justice Center Thursday. “She endured years of cruel treatment because of her HIV status, but she never stopped believing that things could change. This settlement honors her memory and ensures that others won’t have to suffer what Honesty went through. Her courage in speaking out has created lasting changes.”
Monroe continued the lawsuit on behalf of her sister’s estate. There was a monetary award in addition to the policy and training changes, but the amount has not been released.
Lambda Legal and law firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon also participated with MacArthur Justice Center in representing Bishop.
Shubra Ohri, senior counsel at the MacArthur Justice Center, said she first met Bishop soon after she was released from isolation and got to know well after her parole.
“She was a bright person who had to cope with a really torturous experience, basically,” Ohri said. “And you know, despite being bright and despite being hopeful and really productive, I could tell she was struggling with things.”
Bishop was in prison after being sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2014, according to a report on the settlement prepared by Midwest Newsroom and The Marshall Project. During a scuffle with police as they tried to arrest her in 2011 for a misdemeanor stealing charge, Bishop bit an officer and was charged with assaulting an officer and recklessly risking an HIV infection.
Bishop began transitioning after arriving at Jefferson City Correctional Center. During her time in isolation, Ohri said, “she was denied, like a lot of things, that would help affirm her identity as a transgender woman, which really had an amplified impact on her mental health.”
At the time of the assault, and until the settlement, the department policy was to place anyone with HIV into isolation if they were deemed sexually active, Ohri said in an interview Thursday with The Independent.
“It was very, very obviously an unconstitutional policy,” she said.
The Midwest Newsroom/Marshall Project report states that, as of January 2025, there were 218 people with HIV incarcerated in Missouri.
Karen Pojmann, spokeswoman for the state department of corrections, did not respond to a request for comment on the settlement. 
Going forward, any incarcerated person with a communicable disease will be evaluated individually to determine if they need to be in administrative segregation to prevent the infection from spreading, according to the settlement
“This settlement represents a critical victory in our ongoing fight against HIV criminalization and discrimination,” Jose Abrigo, Lambda Legal HIV Project director, said in the news release. “For too long, correctional systems across the country have subjected people living with HIV to punitive and medically unjustified isolation based on outdated stigma rather than modern science.”
HIV can be controlled with medication to the point that the virus is not transmissible. Part of the settlement mandates new training for corrections officers on HIV transmissibility, as well as the law on disability-based discrimination, Ohri said.
“The hope is that combined, the policy change and the training,” Ohri said, “would really drive home that what happened to Honesty, putting someone in segregation who may have HIV, but was on medication, that there’s no reason for it.”

(Getty Images)Consumers who purchase health insurance through the New Jersey marketplace may pay an average of 16% more for coverage next year, state officials said Thursday.
Health insurance carriers say the increases on the Get Covered New Jersey marketplace are a result of the rising cost of health care and the anticipated expiration of federal tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act.
About 512,200 New Jerseyans purchased health insurance on the marketplace this year, according to New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Commissioner Justin Zimmerman. Nearly 90 percent of them received the federal aid that is scheduled to lapse at the end of 2025, Zimmerman said.
“Particularly given the anticipated loss of enhanced financial help made available by the federal government that resulted in lower costs for so many in past years, it will be important for consumers to look closely at their options and choose the plan that best fits their needs and budget,” Zimmerman said.
Open enrollment begins Nov. 1. For 2026, five New Jersey insurance companies will offer plans through the exchange. The rate increases scheduled for 2026 are:

Ambetter from WellCare of New Jersey: 17.1%.
AmeriHealth: 15.5%.
Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey: 17%.
Oscar: 4.6%.
UnitedHealthcare: 18.4%.

The marketplace was created by the Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare, as a place for people who could not get health insurance through work or through Medicaid expansion.
Aetna announced earlier this year that it is not providing plans on the marketplace in 2026.
Under the Biden administration, Congress passed bills that increased federal subsidies for marketplace plans through 2025. Health research group KFF says the number of marketplace enrollees receiving federal aid has nearly doubled since 2020.
The subsidies have reduced premium payments by $705 a year on average for enrollees receiving tax credits, according to KFF. 
State officials estimate New Jersey would lose more than half a billion dollars in federal support. The expiration of this aid would create a gap that either the state budget would need to fill or families would have to shoulder.
Lower-income households, particularly those earning too much to qualify for Medicaid but without employer-based coverage, would be hit hardest, according to Brittany Holom-Trundy, a senior policy analyst at the New Jersey Policy Perspective.
Holom-Trundy told the New Jersey Monitor that, for families already stretched thin, small increases can be detrimental. 
“If you’re barely able to pay your bills as it is, adding another 3% on top of that … can be the difference between having enough to, you know, buy food to pay the rent and having to find another home, maybe facing eviction,” Holom-Trundy said.
Health insurance carriers told the department that if Congress renews the enhanced credits this fall, they expect the average rate increase would drop from 15.9% to 12.8%.
The expected increases in New Jersey fall just below national trends. A recent KFF survey found a median 18% premium increase among Affordable Care Act-regulated plans across the country.

(Getty Images)Wisconsin policymakers approved more than $1.3 billion in tax cuts in the latest state budget but the exclusion of a “no tax on tips” proposal has lawmakers pushing ahead with a bill that would line up state law with a new federal law. 
Bill coauthor Rep. Ron Tusler (R-Harrison) said during a hearing in the Assembly Ways and Means committee that lawmakers should help working class people who are “trying to get themselves to that middle class” with Assembly Bill 38. A hearing on the bill was held in the Senate in May, though it has yet to come up for vote in either chamber. 
“When I was a younger man, I was a waiter at Perkins, and I received tips. I also received tips for a couple years as a valet, and folks that receive tips aren’t just waiters and valets, but also housekeepers, bartenders, delivery drivers, massage therapists, hairdressers, taxi drivers, tour guides,” Tusler said. “Those are the type of people we’re talking about, trying to help with this bill, trying to not tax and as representatives, these are great folks for us to target, and as Christians, we should always be trying to help the poor.”
President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law on July 4 includes a federal provision that will allow workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tips annually from their taxable income. Those earning more than $150,000 aren’t eligible for the deduction. 
The Wisconsin bill and a recent amendment to it seeks to implement the same policy when it comes to the state income tax, which currently considers tips as taxable income. The deduction would apply to tips whether paid by cash or credit. Similar to the federal law, the provision will go into effect starting tax year 2025 and sunsets after tax year 2028 — around the end of Trump’s second term in office. 
“Any time that we can allow people to keep more of their hard-earned money — that’s going to be something that I’m supporting,” Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken) told the committee.
Erin Vranas, co-owner of Parthenon Gyros located in downtown Madison and chair of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association’s Board, said many restaurant employees are struggling with semi-unpredictable income. 
“Every dollar matters, so this bill really could help provide meaningful relief,” Vranas said, adding that it would also help restaurants trying to recruit and retain employees. “Wisconsin restaurants face ongoing workforce shortages, and I understand this isn’t just a restaurant thing, but we definitely feel it in this industry. AB38 will help us recruit and retain staff, making restaurant jobs more competitive and sustainable. When employees keep more of their hard-earned tips, then they’re more likely to stay and grow and see hospitality as a sustainable career, which strengthens both our businesses and Wisconsin as a state.” 
The minimum wage for tipped employees in Wisconsin is currently $2.33 per hour. Employers are required to make up the difference if an employee’s combined wages and tips do not equal the regular minimum wage of $7.25 per hour.
Susan Quam, executive vice president of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, said she only knows of two restaurants that  pay the minimum wage. Those restaurants have a $100 per person check average and employees typically make $20 per customer “every single time they work, so we’re talking about folks who are making $100 to $150 dollars an hour in tips.” WRA, a nonprofit trade association that represents thousands of food, beverage and hospitality businesses, supports the bill.
“The vast majority of our members tell us that they’re paying well above that $2.33 to their tipped employees, some of them higher than the $7.25 minimum wage,” Quam said. “The marketplace is dictating what that base wage is, not necessarily the fact that they are getting tips.”
Tusler explained that employees would still need to report tips, both because there is a limit on the tax deduction and because tipped employees need a record of their full income when applying for loans. 
“It would make it more difficult for those tip earners to borrow money for their houses or their cars,” Tusler said.
He told the committee the bill would also cut down on confusion between the federal and state policies when people are filing taxes. 
The tax break also wouldn’t cost the state much, Tusler said. The Department of Revenue estimates that the state brings in about $33.7 million a year from tips and would lose about that much in each year of the biennium under the proposal. 
“That’s it,” Tusler said. “We have a $111 billion budget.”
The recent bipartisan state budget cut taxes by about over $1 billion, but the tips proposal was not included in the budget passed by the Republican-led Legislature and signed by Gov. Tony Evers last month. Evers had included a similar proposal in his budget proposal, but Republican lawmakers threw it out when they started working on the budget. 
A bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Jacque, previously introduced the idea of exempting cash tips from taxes in 2019, though it never became law. 
The idea picked up steam nationally when President Donald Trump started campaigning on the idea, which led Republican lawmakers to reintroduce the proposal in Wisconsin this year.  
The coauthors of the bill expressed frustration that no Democrats have signed onto the bill yet, noting that Evers has supported something similar before. 
“This was something where Gov. Evers basically took that previous proposal… cut and pasted that into his budget proposal, so it’s not like there was ever any indication that this wasn’t something that shouldn’t have bipartisan support,” Jacque said. “And I certainly hope that it will going forward.”
Rep. Joan Fitzgerald (D-Fort Atkinson) said during the hearing that she and her husband, who is a bartender, have discussed the issue extensively since it started gaining popularity around the 2024 election and questioned whether a bigger conversation about helping lower-income workers needs to be had. 
“I would say encouraging employers to have better benefits, higher pay, better working conditions are also ways we get people to realize the American dream,” Fitzgerald said. “Cutting taxes might be one small part of that, but there’s a broader array of things that we can do, and if, and if that’s your goal, and it’s my goal, then I say we attack some of those other issues.” 
Jacque said he understands that tax relief needs to be multifaceted, but said that if the state starts “mandating things on employers that potentially raise costs…, you aren’t going to have customers and those jobs aren’t going to be supported.”

Deployments to Trump's inauguration and to immigration detention efforts in Wyoming is impacting the Wyoming National Guard's coffers, commander says.
The post Wyoming guard looks to Congress for money as Trump deployments hit accounts appeared first on WyoFile .","The Wyoming National Guard’s coffers are feeling the pinch of President Donald Trump’s second administration after a deployment to Washington D.C. for the January inauguration, federal hiring freezes and a new mission supporting immigration enforcement, guard officials said this week.
The cost of the guard’s deployment to support U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the accelerating drive to round up, detain and deport vast numbers of immigrants nationwide is still unknown, Maj. Gen. Greg Porter told state lawmakers on the Joint Transportation, Highways & Military Affairs Committee. 
The unprecedented new role for guard troops, who state officials have said will only work in Wyoming, is still taking shape. But whatever the tasks, and the costs that come with them, it is for now an expense borne by Porter’s department, not the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
“It’s free chicken right now to ICE,” Porter said. “So, we’ll see how long this lasts and where that goes, but it really has an impact on our readiness accounts.” Porter was referring to accounts that support guard training and operations, which are funded by the federal government, not Wyoming. 
National Guard units from around the country are now asking Congress for money to refill their coffers so that they afford their usual fall training deployments, Porter said. Wyoming has been able to steward its funds so that its fall training will occur, he said, but other states will find themselves in a tight spot if Congress doesn’t spend more money. 
“Some states could face significant financial liabilities that would directly impact readiness,” Porter told WyoFile in an emailed statement. “To keep the Guard trained, equipped, and ready to respond when our nation calls, federal funding must be provided accurately, fully, and on time.”
In his second administration, Trump has deployed both the national guard and the regular military to control American citizens in unprecedented ways. Citing one crisis after another — rationales that critics consider manufactured excuses to use emergency powers — Trump has now sent guard troops onto the streets of two American cities, Los Angeles and Washington D.C.

In Los Angeles, Trump claimed troops were necessary to maintain order after residents began to protest sweeping immigration enforcement actions in the city. He ordered the deployment over local and state leaders’ objections. 
In Washington D.C., again acting over the wishes of local officials, Trump has sent the district’s national guard troops, who have now been joined by guard units from six Republican-led states. Trump claims the troops, who are joined by federal law enforcement agents from ICE, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are necessary to quell a wave of crime. 
Recent crime statistics do not bear that claim out, though federal officials have suggested those numbers were manipulated. 
Porter told committee members he did not think the Wyoming National Guard would join the D.C. deployment. 
Wyoming troops did travel to the capitol in January, however, to provide a security presence during Trump’s inauguration. The guard spent $250,000 out of its readiness accounts on that deployment, and the federal government has yet to reimburse that money, Porter said. 
Wyoming also sent troops to President Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2021. That inauguration came on the heels of the Jan. 6 violence at the U.S. Capitol, when Trump supporters stormed the seat of government to try and stop an electoral college count that secured Biden’s victory. Both inaugurations ultimately occurred peacefully. 
ICE deployment 
The Wyoming National Guard has asked for 15 volunteers to provide logistical, administrative and transport support to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents operating in the state. The guard and the federal government are in the process of selecting and vetting that group of troops, guard spokesperson Joseph Coslett told WyoFile. 
At the committee meeting, Porter told lawmakers the operation was still shaping up, but said Wyoming troops wouldn’t conduct any law enforcement activities in the state. They could be involved in transporting detained immigrants to ICE holding centers in other states, though, Porter said. 
Though in the field troops would take direction from ICE agents, Porter said they would remain under the ultimate discretion of Gov. Mark Gordon, and that funds to support the effort would be routed through the gubernatorial administration. 
Gordon’s decision to enlist Wyoming troops in immigration enforcement comes as he increasingly ties the state to Trump’s aggressive efforts to round up and deport undocumented immigrants. Trump is also increasingly removing protections for people from some countries who had legal status, growing the pool of deportable immigrants. 
ICE is increasingly detaining people who do not have criminal convictions, but whose presence in the country is illegal. Under federal law, unlawful presence in the country on its own is a civil offense, not a criminal one. (Entering the country improperly is a crime.) From January through the end of June, the majority of people ICE arrested in Wyoming did not have a criminal conviction, according to an analysis of ICE arrest data by WyoFile and The Colorado Sun. ICE arrests in the state, however, nearly tripled during that time period. 
“Gov. Gordon’s assertions that this authorization is in pursuit of public safety strains credulity and is at odds with what’s happening on the ground and what data shows,” American Civil Liberties Union of Wyoming spokesperson Janna Farley said in a statement issued to Wyoming Public Media and KHOL when those outlets reported on the guard deployment last week. 
Gordon was joining the Trump administration in stoking fear among immigrant communities, Farley said. Those communities are often composed of families of mixed legal status.
“The fear among immigrants and their loved ones across Wyoming is palpable,” Farley said. We’ve seen this fear lead to empty outdoor concerts, families going without groceries and valuable employees being too terrified to show up to work. Heightening this fear by mobilizing the National Guard will continue to drain resources and contribute to even more devastation in our communities.”
For his part, Gordon has said Wyoming must do its part to help secure the country, and has repeatedly invoked the immigration-hawk adage that “every state is a border state.”
Hiring freeze
As Trump places novel domestic demands on the guard, his administration has also blunted its hiring. A federal hiring freeze includes the agency, Porter said. The freeze has left the Wyoming National Guard “not in a great place,” Porter said. The guard currently has 70 full-time positions vacant and unfillable under the freeze, he said. 
Wyoming lost ten Army National Guard employees and five Air National Guard employees to the Trump administration’s efforts to encourage federal employees to retire, Porter told lawmakers. The freeze could have a long-term impact on the department, he suggested, if not reversed. 
“I can see us shrinking in the full-time force a little bit, which is not where I want to be and I think an unintended consequence of the administration’s path right now,” Porter said. “Because I don’t think they really mean to reduce the amount of lethality we can generate in the National Guard.”

As summer turns to fall, deer, elk and moose shed the velvet from their antlers. Photographer Mark Gocke documents the transition. 
The post An appreciation for antlers appeared first on WyoFile .","The nights are getting chilly, and it is a time of change in Wyoming. While each season has its special attributes, the transition from summer to fall may be the most thrilling for me. A favorite part of summer is seeing deer, elk and moose with their velvety antlers: so soft looking you want to touch them. And antlers are also fantastic photographically, especially when backlit, with their translucence creating amazing rim light.

Not only are antlers a great photo subject, they’re also pretty amazing biologically. Antlers are one of the fastest growing biological tissues, similar to fetal tissue and that of a wound healing. In just a few short months, animals can grow a full set of antlers, which can be massive for the mature males, weighing over 30 pounds each for elk and moose. New antlers start growing as soon as the old ones are shed, which is typically by late winter. All summer, the velvety antlers are loaded with blood vessels carrying lots of nutrients for the rapid growth, and are thus warm to the touch. 
By mid-August, these animals have grown their next full set of antlers. They start undergoing hormonal changes, triggered by shortening periods of daylight. We know this from researchers who have manipulated the amount of light available to animals indoors, actually causing them to grow two sets of antlers in one calendar year.

The hormonal changes primarily involve an increase in testosterone. Males that lack this normal spike in testosterone for any reason will remain in the velvet stage. This has been shown by castrating males in captivity. Otherwise, the blood vessels and velvet will begin to dry up, and the cartilaginous antlers further harden to become an external bone, primarily made up of calcium and phosphorus, just like other bones. 
When the velvet begins shedding, the antlers are pure white with some remaining blood stains. However, this period is short-lived, typically only 24 to 48 hours, as the animals will accelerate the process by rubbing the velvet off on tree saplings and such. Tannin from the trees, along with the blood stains, give the antlers their usual brown color.

Throughout summer, males will often hang together in bachelor herds, but the increase in testosterone also urges the males to disband and start seeking out females to breed with. Thus begins the fall rut. The competition for breeding rights will cause individuals that have hung out together for months to suddenly become rivals, sometimes engaging in fierce battles with each other. This is truly a fascinating time of change for Wyoming’s wild ungulates.

The consequences of severe staffing and budget cuts at federal agencies that manage America’s public lands are already apparent, writes Tracy Stone-Manning, the former director of the Bureau of Land Management.
The post The West is on fire as Washington fans the flames appeared first on WyoFile .","This commentary was originally published by Writers on the Range.
This summer, millions of Americans are hiking, camping, fishing and making lifelong memories in our national parks, forests and other public lands. But something troubling is taking place behind the beautiful views: The federal agencies that safeguard these places for us are being hollowed out.

Opinion

Staffing and budget cuts at the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and U.S. Forest Service aren’t just numbers on a spreadsheet. They are empty ranger stations during peak season, trail crews that never arrive and wildfire teams stretched so thin that they can’t keep up.
During the four years when I led the BLM, from 2021 to 2025, I saw what it takes to care for hundreds of millions of acres of public lands. It takes committed, dedicated people — wildfire crews, wildlife biologists, planners, law enforcement rangers — and it takes funding. Today, both are being stripped away at historic rates.
We can already see the consequences. As I write, flames tear through the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, burning down the historic lodge and scarring over 100,000 acres. The fire has raged for weeks since a lightning strike ignited it on July 4, and it may continue for weeks more.
Fire is part of the West’s natural cycle, but climate change and decades of suppression have made today’s fires hotter and more destructive. It just doesn’t make sense that the Trump administration is gutting the agencies responsible for managing fire risk when we need these experienced and dedicated people most.
More than 1,600 wildfire-qualified staff have been driven out of the Forest Service in recent months, and as many as one in four firefighting jobs remain vacant. To make it worse, firefighters are being pulled from the fire lines to tend to logistics for some forests, even in one of the most dangerous wildfire seasons in memory.
The administration has even proposed removing firefighting from the Forest Service entirely, a dangerous move that separates the rangers who know the land best from those dousing the flames. People of all backgrounds celebrated when we collectively stopped Congress from selling off our public lands earlier this summer. But now, a clear and dangerous pattern is emerging: Shrink these agencies until they break, then claim that selling off or industrializing our public lands is the only fix.
This should alarm anyone who values the freedom these lands provide. Public lands are a great equalizer — places where all Americans have the same right to hike, hunt, fish or camp. And to unplug and touch nature. If we lose the people who manage these lands, our access will shrink under wildfire closures, roads will be gated and campgrounds will close. We’ll lose our freedom to wander.
It’s also a direct threat to conservation. Our public lands deliver clean water, clean air and wildlife habitat. Cutting conservation programs and abandoning fire-smart management will leave forests overgrown and ready to burn — with wildfires too big and too hot.
Worse still, future generations are going to inherit the choices made today. When the administration guts our parks and public lands to pay for tax cuts for billionaires, they saddle the future with parks and trails that are closed, crumbling roads and buildings, forests prone to even worse fire, smoky skies and “No Trespassing” signs. The cherished traditions we pass down — teaching a child to fish or hunt, camping under a night sky, chasing butterflies — will no longer be available to all.
Westerners know what’s at stake. Poll after poll shows that people across the political spectrum want to keep our public lands public, healthy and accessible. That consensus is powerful, but only if we use it now. Either we protect the agencies that protect our public lands, or we watch the slow-motion sell-off unfold.
We must demand full staffing and funding for the agencies that manage our lands, and we must all stand together — hunters and hikers, ranchers and rafters, anglers and climbers — in defense of the places that belong to us all and to future generations.

A paean is “a fervent expression of joy or praise.”  When it comes to the long and ongoing struggle to preserve the incredible legacy of Montana’s world-famous trout fishing rivers and streams, Bud Lilly, who was recently inducted into the National Fly Fishing Hall of Fame, deserves every bit of the praise — and the joy. 
For thousands of young anglers the beautiful flies pictured in Bud Lilly’s catalog brought dreams of fishing the Holy Waters of Montana’s legendary trout streams.  For those lucky enough to actually spend time in Bud’s West Yellowstone Trout Shop, the array of those concoctions of fur and feathers tied so artfully on tiny hooks was dizzying — although few of us had enough money to buy even a fraction of what we so fervently wanted to tie to our leaders.
But for Bud, it wasn’t all about commerce.  He’d gladly take the time to help young and/or inexperienced fly anglers pick “the right flies for the right places” with a humility and kindness that belayed his national and world-wide fame.  
His was not the false bravado so common these days, where anglers feel a need to hold their trout so they can post pictures online to brag of their catch.  Quite the opposite.  
He knew the rivers intimately — among them, the Gallatin, Madison, Jefferson, as well as the Firehole, Gibbon, and Madison headwaters in Yellowstone National Park.  The depth of his knowledge was no surprise since he grew up fishing those rivers.  Initially he did so to feed his family during the sparse days of the Great Depression when the primary goal was “catch and release in bacon grease” and the “end of the rainbow” was a black cast iron pan. 
That would change as he realized that, like so many things, the wild trout of Montana and the rivers and streams upon which they relied were not infinite.  He pioneered the ethic that catching these wild, leaping, beautiful fish was in itself the great pleasure — and that killing and eating every one would soon leave the rivers fished out and barren.
My personal friendship with Bud spanned nearly a half-century and went far beyond what flies to use in what rivers.  For decades we wrestled in the policy arena to pass legislation that actually protected the aquatic ecosystems essential for Montana’s wild trout.
Make no mistake, the challenges to keep the great rivers continue to be many, varied, and increasing.  Far too many irrigators still believe that water left instream to keep a river and its fish healthy is water wasted.  In part, that attitude is fostered by the strictures of western water law that keeping a valid water right means “use it or lose it” — despite the riverine consequences. 
Likewise, rivers that support healthy wild trout populations must have clean and cold water, which means minimizing sedimentation, nutrients, and the ever-increasing variety of pollutants from herbicides, pesticides, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers.  Bud knew all this — and was a stalwart advocate and fierce comrade-in-arms to his final days.
While his induction in the National Fly Fishing Hall of Fame is indeed a great honor to his life and work, the fact is that work is now more important than ever as Montana’s legendary trout waters face the grim challenges of climate change, development, and chronic dewatering. 
Although Bud is now casting in the clouds, I have a hunch he’s still saying “go get ’em and fight for the rivers and fish” — and the real honor to his incredible life and legacy is to do just that.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GO-Bud-Lilly-10-17-07-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-22 06:56:28.146544

Marilyn Gooch was already skeptical about one of her newest neighbors, xAI’s supercomputing facility, when her cousin walked across the street in June with a blue mailer from the Greater Memphis Chamber of Commerce. 
Her cousin didn’t know what to make of the postcard featuring the logos of nine local, state and federal agencies and the chamber’s assurance that billionaire Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence company operated “in full compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and oversight.” The facility — part of Musk’s bid to dominate the AI market — opened at a breakneck pace almost a year before, brought to Memphis, Tennessee, largely due to the efforts of the local Chamber of Commerce.
Across the country, communities are grappling with the boom of data centers and supercomputing facilities, which consume voracious amounts of electricity and water and can emit smog-producing pollutants. In places from Maricopa County, Arizona, to Prince William County, Virginia, residents have used zoning restrictions as a means to keep supercomputers at bay — an option not available to Memphians because the xAI building was already zoned for industrial use. 
Since the opening of the xAI supercomputing facility, Gooch had joined residents and environmental justice advocates sounding off at meetings about potential health impacts of xAI. She learned about the area’s already high concentration of toxic emissions from nearby industrial plants, including an oil refinery, and the county’s high asthma rates. 
Of greatest concern: the emissions from the dozens of methane gas turbines — each roughly the size of a semitrailer — that were initially used to power xAI’s new facility located less than 2 miles from her home in southwest Memphis. Based on its analysis of county health ordinances and federal regulations, the Southern Environmental Law Center has asserted in multiple official and legal documents that these turbines violated the Clean Air Act and should never have been allowed; the Shelby County Health Department disagrees.
Gooch saw the mailer as an attempt to quiet their concerns.

In the face of intense public opposition, the chamber has gone to unusual lengths to promote xAI, whose $12 billion investment the chamber believes will transform the shrinking city into a global hub of technological innovation. The chamber wants Memphis to be known as part of the “Digital Delta,” expanding beyond its blue-collar identity as the distribution capital of the country and FedEx headquarters.
This all-out push includes a five-member special operations team to provide what it calls “round-the-clock concierge service” to ensure “seamless execution of the company’s rapid expansion plans.” The chamber also managed xAI’s PR efforts, and while it has not held open public meetings about xAI, it hosted at least 12 invitation-only meetings to tout the project’s benefits to Memphis. And the chamber sent its first mailer in recent memory, which spread incorrect information about the governmental oversight in place to monitor Musk’s new facility.
Former chamber president Beverly Robertson said she can’t recall another instance of the chamber doing such a full-court press for a company — but then again, she and others noted, Memphis has never attracted a company of xAI’s scale.
The public had no input into the opening of the facility in their community. As a private business, xAI had no obligation to seek community feedback, the chamber has said. And because xAI did not seek or receive tax incentives, it wasn’t subject to review from government bodies or elected officials, some of whom learned about xAI’s arrival from the news. 
The community’s lone chance to hear from xAI in person came in April during a heated health department hearing about residents’ concerns over the gas turbines. Brent Mayo, an xAI executive, read a statement about the company’s plans to meet the highest emissions standards. He left before the public comment period began. 
An xAI spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment about the chamber’s mailer or to questions about the number of gas turbines powering the supercomputer.

In this reliably Democratic and majority-Black city, some residents were upset by Musk’s alignment with President Donald Trump, his brief tenure as the chainsaw-wielding head of the Department of Government Efficiency, and the antisemitic and racist posts from xAI’s chatbot Grok, which is powered by the supercomputer known as Colossus. In response to this criticism, the chamber says it defends projects, not people. 
But what dominated the civic discussion was potential damage to the region’s air from xAI’s temporary turbines, especially the nitrogen oxides and formaldehyde they can emit, which contribute to smog. Even with brief exposure, smog increases the risk of respiratory problems, asthma and heart diseases, according to the World Health Organization.
The mailers sent in mid-June to residents in at least two neighborhoods, including Gooch’s, appeared to be addressing those fears, asserting that the chamber “will continue to prioritize compliance with existing standards and policies.” 
For seven generations, Gooch’s family has lived in Boxtown, a Black neighborhood in southwest Memphis. Environmental justice activists say Boxtown has been plagued for decades by pollution from nearby industrial plants. In Gooch’s ZIP code, the median household income is just shy of $37,000 and the poverty rate is twice that of the city as a whole.

Gooch took the mailer from her cousin and scanned the alphabet soup of agency acronyms for the nine the chamber claims have “regulatory oversight and authority over xAI’s Supercomputing Facility.” Before retiring, she worked in human resources for 25 years and maintained workplace safety reports. “There’s no way they’re going to be monitoring and looking at all this,” she remembers thinking. “That’s so far beyond their reach.”
Only two agencies on that mailer have clear oversight over xAI’s impact on air quality and public health, the community’s primary concerns. The first is the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which under the Trump administration aims to make the United States the world’s AI capital. Local oversight falls to the Shelby County Health Department, which says it is installing a long-awaited air monitor in south Memphis. Both agencies help ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act, the enforcement of which the current administration is weakening as part of a pattern of broader environmental rollbacks. 
Two other agencies represented on the card — Memphis Light, Gas and Water Division and the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation — told MLK50: Justice Through Journalism and ProPublica that they have no authority over xAI’s supercomputing facility. The other five agencies say they do oversee some aspects of the facility, such as fire safety, zoning or potential whistleblower complaints — none of which address the health concerns that most preoccupied the community.

The “Chamber’s mailer stating MLGW has regulatory oversight and authority over the xAI facility is in error. MLGW does not have regulatory authority or oversight of xAI or any business,” Ursula Madden, Memphis Light, Gas and Water’s spokesperson, said in an email. 
Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation spokesperson Jennifer Donnals said in an email that “TDEC does not have regulatory oversight over supercomputer facilities.” The agency issued a permit related to construction and stormwater management at the Colossus site, she said. 
Bobby White, the chamber’s chief government affairs officer, who said he wrote the text featured in the mailer, told MLK50 and ProPublica that he’d used the word regulatory “loosely.” He said the chamber sent the mailers to show residents that xAI didn’t set up shop in Memphis without consulting with anyone.
”It has been my intent to make sure people have understood that the company has essentially abided by rules and law as they currently exist,” White said in a written statement. “I have also in public and private ways tried to advise activists and leaders that changing this company’s or any company’s behavior comes down to changing the policy that allows for it.”
One of xAI’s staunchest critics is State Rep. Justin J. Pearson, who represents a majority-Black district that includes Boxtown. Memphis Community Against Pollution, co-founded by Justin Pearson and now run by his brother KeShaun Pearson, was at the forefront of the fight to get the Shelby County Health Department to deny xAI’s permit for 15 permanent turbines. It was joined by other local groups including Young, Gifted & Green, the Chickasaw Group of the Sierra Club and Tigers Against Pollution.

Justin Pearson said the chamber’s mailer misled residents by including agencies that have no authority or only indirect authority over xAI. 
“It’s the red handkerchief of the magician,” Pearson said. “The propaganda that they are putting out to try and convince people that there’s nothing to see here, there’s nothing to worry about, is only at the behest of a multibillion-dollar corporation.” 
White said xAI did not ask the chamber to send the mailer and accused environmental activists of misleading residents with claims that “the turbines were somehow operating counter to existing policy and regulations.” He said he got involved after seeing his former sixth grade teacher, church members and community leaders he’s worked with for years at a “raucous town hall meeting on the subject of gas turbines, where people were being whipped into a frenzy and still leaving without good information.”
The chamber emphasized White’s message in a more nuanced way in a July webinar held less than a month after the mailers arrived in Gooch’s neighborhood: “XAl’s presence in Memphis has occurred with the oversight of, input from, and/or strategic alignment with the following agencies/organizations,” read a slide, with the logos of the same agencies.
Chambers of commerce exist to promote businesses and lobby for a pro-business climate, said Darrin Wilson, an associate professor at Northern Kentucky University who studies local economic development. But he said pro-business organizations should still be expected to provide accurate information.
“You want to make sure that the residents of Memphis and Shelby County have 100% accurate and full information around something that is going to impact their day-to-day lives,” he said, “so that they can make decisions for themselves and advocate on their own behalf.”

The chamber maintains that xAI is an indisputable win for the city, expected to create an estimated 500 high-paying jobs and, in the first year alone, generate tens of millions of dollars in city and county property taxes, soaring to as much as $100 million next year. The city’s mayor plans to direct 25% of tax revenues from xAI’s first facility to the neighborhoods closest to the operation. xAI has recently committed to funding repairs and new athletic fields at four neighborhood public schools. 
According to press reports, xAI’s presence is continuing to expand in the Memphis area. Its second supercomputer facility, Colossus 2, is expected to come online soon. Musk has announced he’s moving a power plant from overseas to power Colossus 2. And just across the state line in Mississippi, an xAI-affiliated firm purchased the site of a former Duke Energy power plant less than 2 miles from Colossus 2.
After months of weighing whether to approve xAI’s permit request to operate 15 permanent, cleaner turbines, the county health department granted the permit in July. The Southern Environmental Law Center has appealed the permit decision to the Shelby County Air Pollution Control board, an appointed body that hears such protests. The health department did not publicly explain its decision to grant the permit.

The chamber says that xAI has taken a number of steps to address environmental concerns. It claims that emissions from the permanent turbines, which will be a backup power source, will be far less than the maximum the EPA allows. To protect the electrical grid in times of peak demand, xAI is also using Tesla Megapack batteries as another backup power source. 
In addition, the company is building an $80 million wastewater facility that will allow xAI, plus the Tennessee Valley Authority and a nearby steel manufacturer, to use recycled water to cool their plants instead of relying on the aquifer the region depends on. 
“What we’re really seeing is a company that, quite frankly, is doing as much as you could hope a company would do in terms of being environmentally conscious,” White said.
Still, people in Gooch’s neighborhood have reason to worry about air quality. Last year, the American Lung Association gave Shelby County an F grade for ozone, an air pollutant that contributes to smog. The county also has the state’s highest rate of ER visits for asthma, and the city has been named an asthma capital by the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.

In southwest Memphis, the cumulative cancer risk associated with exposure to 13 carcinogens in the air was 4 times higher than the national average, according to a 2013 study by University of Memphis researchers. 
“Every family member that I’ve had that lived in the Boxtown area has died of some form of cancer,” Gooch said, acknowledging that some were smokers. 
Gooch, a member of the Boxtown Neighborhood Association, attended one of White’s xAI presentations at a nearby church this spring. She remembers White saying that Memphis needs more tax revenue and can’t afford to let xAI, or other companies, slide across the state line to Mississippi. 
She’d planned to ask questions, but after listening to White focus on the finances, she decided not to. 
“His whole spiel was about money, economics,” she recalled. “Not all money is good money.”",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Gordon-xai-3x2_preview-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-22 06:56:28.146544

Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is urging supporters and business leaders to push back against “messaging” from “legacy media” regarding the major tax and spending law passed by Congress in July. 
Crapo spoke to a group of about 50 people Thursday morning in Boise at a breakfast held by Americans For Prosperity, or AFP, an advocacy organization founded by billionaires Charles and the late David Koch. The private event at a downtown hotel highlighted the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is now a law and was supported by AFP through a $20 million campaign effort. 
HUD secretary, Crapo emphasize deregulation and tax incentives in housing roundtable 

“Undeniably, AFP was the biggest ally we had in getting the One Big Beautiful Bill across the finish line,” Crapo said Thursday. 
Crapo chairs the Senate Finance Committee, which, among its many areas of oversight, is charged with crafting tax policy. The Idaho senator played a key role in crafting the legislation. 
He lauded AFP for going to the districts of lawmakers reluctant to vote for the bill. 
“And it wasn’t because those House members and Senate members didn’t want to vote for the bill,” Crapo said, “it’s because their constituents were listening to the legacy media message about the bill and didn’t understand what it did, and AFP helped us there.” 
Attendees included Idaho Gov. Brad Little, Superintendent of Public Instruction Debbie Critchfield, state House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, and Boise City Councilmember Luci Willits.
 Protestors call on Idaho congressional delegation to hold open public meetings

Around 30 people protested the event outside, calling for public, free town halls instead. The protest was organized by the Idaho 50501 movement, which was also behind the No Kings Day protest in June, and Idaho Women in Action.

“Senator Crapo’s recent votes to restrict Medicaid and reduce funding for SNAP directly impact families across the state,” said in an Idaho 50501 press release. “Idaho 50501 and Idaho Women In Action believe these decisions should be discussed openly, with input from those most affected.” 
Crapo had no public town halls scheduled as of Thursday, and a page on his office’s website with a calendar and map of town halls listed an August 2022 event as the most recent one. 
Spokespeople for Idaho’s other members of Congress, Sen. Jim Risch and Rep. Mike Simpson, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on if they plan to hold town halls. 
“As our townhall events, including tele-townhalls are organized and scheduled, we will update via our official office platforms, constituent emails, press releases and such,” a spokesperson for Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher said.
 Crapo highlights laws deficit impact, tax cut extensions 

The Idaho senator said Thursday he was “defensive” of the narrative he’s heard that the tax and spending bill — which among many things made cuts to Medicaid and food assistance, extended tax cuts passed in 2017, added temporary cuts to taxes on overtime pay and tips, and increased spending for immigration enforcement and border security. 
An analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that the total bill would raise the federal deficit by around $3 trillion in the next 10 years, FOX Business reported, and the law raised the debt ceiling by $5 trillion, which increases the legal limit on the amount the U.S. Treasury can borrow. 
  U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo speaks at a private event Aug. 21, 2025 in Boise about the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” (Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun)
Crapo countered that analysis, arguing that the office should have used the baseline revenue with the tax cuts enacted in 2017 that were set to expire this year. His office requested that CBO score the bill, using the current tax policy as a baseline; that request shows a $1.2 trillion deficit decrease over the next decade.
“That’s where we needed help from AFP to get our colleagues to agree to take this hit because they were attacked as a gimmick,” he said.” I don’t think most Idahoans think it’s a gimmick to say that the refusal to raise taxes is not increasing the deficit.” 
He also said it wasn’t just wealthy Americans and businesses who benefited from the tax cuts, noting, “billionaires are paying the same taxes this year that they paid last year.” 
A larger percentage of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was made permanent in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act go to the wealthiest Americans, according to analyses by the Tax Policy Center, Economic Policy Institute, and the Bipartisan Policy Center. On average, all income groups receive a tax benefit from the extension — or would have seen a tax increase had the cuts not been made permanent. 
The bottom 20% of household incomes would likely see an average increase of .5% in after-tax income as a result of the extension of the child credit and larger standard deduction, according to the Tax Policy Center. The highest-income taxpayers would see net tax cuts of 2% of after-tax income for those in the top quintile. 
The Council on Economic Advisors, an office under the office of the president, estimated that the average Idaho resident would see a raise in wages by $3,400 to $6,400 in the next four years as a result of the legislation. 
 Crapo, echoing House Speaker Johnson, says another reconciliation bill may be coming 

Crapo underscored that while the massive law addressed many of President Donald Trump’s main priorities, it did not satisfy all of them. He said the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus also wanted to see larger spending reductions. 
Of Trump’s “eight or nine” priorities, Crapo said, the law accomplished “three or four” of them. 
As chairman of the Finance Committee, Crapo was present when Trump signed the bill into law in July. He said the president called him out as knowing “more about taxes than anybody,” but said he and Crapo didn’t always agree. 
“That’s because he didn’t get all eight of his things, and he only got them for a number of years,” Crapo said with a laugh. 
U.S. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, said he wanted another major bill to continue the work, Politico reported.   
To pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, lawmakers used what’s called the reconciliation process. Through this process, lawmakers avoid the filibuster in the Senate and only need a simple majority of votes rather than 60. Reconciliation can only address tax policy and certain types of spending. 
“So we are going to do another reconciliation bill,” Crapo said. “The politics of that one are going to be much, much more difficult because we don’t have the (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) engine driving it. And the pressure in that one will be spending reductions, and any kind of spending reform in Washington is an intense battle, so look for that and keep saying nice things about me when we start cutting more.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)With a year to go in Tennessee’s gubernatorial primary race, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn appears to own the polling numbers over U.S. Rep. John Rose, holding a 52-point advantage in one survey.
Coffee shop talk says she’s a shoo-in.
(Wait a second, Rose’s campaign is claiming he beat Blackburn handily in a Lawrence County Reagan Day dinner straw poll.)
Regardless of whether these polls are worth their weight in Moon Pies, the bigger question is whether the state’s senior U.S. senator will consider Rose a realistic opponent and agree to go head-to-head on a debate stage?
Rose told the Lookout at a Future Farmers of America event in Lebanon this week he is “absolutely” ready to debate Blackburn. Asked if she agreed, he said, “Sounds like she doesn’t want to.”
Blackburn, who spoke at the event’s press conference headlined by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, along with Rose and other Tennessee officials, declined to take questions afterward, choosing to wander away from this reporter and let a flack do the blocking. In making her gubernatorial announcement earlier this month, she also sent out a text message and an online statement but didn’t make herself available to the press.

Rose, in contrast, held his initial confab at the same Wilson County fairgrounds on a nippy March day and answered a few questions afterward, even if he wasn’t enthused about talking.
Granted, Rose is a heavy underdog, and he’s going to do whatever it takes to get an edge. 
No doubt, he was also grinning ear to ear and Blackburn was cringing when Secretary Rollins told the audience she agreed to speak at the FFA ham breakfast just so Rose would quit texting her constantly. 
Will Blackburn stand for such outrage?
She has $4.4 million in her federal campaign account, money that can’t be used for the state race. The Tennessee Journal reports a committee called Team Tennessee raised $676,000 this year to back Blackburn but that a joint federal fundraising account is nearly empty after she shelled out money to a fundraising consultant, transferred a chunk to her Senate campaign, a state political action committee and her strategic team. Another Blackburn PAC, Making a Responsible Stand for Households in America, received $905,000 from her Senate account and is doling out money across Tennessee.
Tennessee gubernatorial candidate touts $6.1M campaign war chest

Rose, whose net worth is much greater than Blackburn’s, reported he made a $5 million loan to his campaign and raised another $1.1 million from donors. He hasn’t started churning out TV ads and mailers, raising questions about whether he’s sitting on the money.
It might be time, though, for Blackburn to take him seriously, which could mean getting into a political debate. She fared well against former Gov. Phil Bredesen in their U.S. Senate race forum in 2018, and butting heads with Rose would give her the chance to ask him why he voted against certifying the Biden election, in addition to signing on to written documents of objection to the outcome. Blackburn voted to certify the election, a reluctant move in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection by Trump zealots. 
Oops, that might not be the right issue to raise, considering the president pardoned all of the rioters in spite of the subsequent deaths of multiple U.S. Capitol police officers, some of whom committed suicide. The vote also could come into play in a Trump decision to endorse, which would effectively end the race.
It’s a political crap shoot. Then again, most debates are a little risky.
Going for the gusto?
After six years of leading private prison operator CoreCivic, Damon Hininger is stepping down as president and chief executive officer, leading to the appointment of Patrick Swindle to head the company.
CoreCivic runs four of Tennessee’s 12 prisons and remains in good stead with Gov. Bill Lee and the Department of Correction in spite of a federal civil rights investigation into conditions at Trousdale Turner. 
Tennessee levied $44.78 million in penalties against private prison operator in three years

In addition to that probe, West Tennessee residents are raising questions about CoreCivic signing a contract with federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement to use a Tipton County facility for immigrant detention as part of Trump’s deportation effort.
Hininger, who spoke last year at Republicans’ Statesmen’s Dinner, was rumored to be considering a gubernatorial run at the time. That could be a little farfetched now, but questions remain about the potential for a U.S. Senate candidacy with Blackburn running for governor. 
Stepping down from the CoreCivic post would eliminate conflicts of interest for Hininger. He declined to answer Lookout questions this week about taking a shot at either political post.
So much for equality
Tennessee is spending more per student to send kids to private schools this year than for those going to public schools, according to a Chalkbeat report.
Under the state’s new private-school voucher program, some 20,000 students are receiving $7,295 each to attend private schools, compared to $7,023 for public school students. The numbers were revealed in a state school board meeting last week, Chalkbeat reported, drawing criticism from the Tennessee Education Association and Democrats.
Tennessee won’t know how many new vouchers go to existing private school students

It’s up to local governments to raise the ante and pour more into schools, as has been the case for decades.
During debate on the bill this year, the state’s projections showed 66% of those receiving the voucher money would be enrolled in private schools already. Education officials told legislators this week the law didn’t require the department to track that number through student applications.
Next year, though, the question will be on applications. Considering most of the seats are taken by private-school students already, will it tell us anything new? Highly unlikely.
Why not here?
This comes from the reader mailbag.
Following Gov. Lee’s decision to deploy Tennessee National Guard soldiers to Washington, D.C., at Trump’s request to cull crime in the capital city, at least one person wants to know why he’s sending troops there when Nashville and Memphis have higher rates of property crimes and violent incidents. Why is no one pressuring Lee to deploy troops to the streets of Tennessee’s two biggest and bluest cities?
It sounds like a sarcastic query. But the answer is: Considering the Tennessee Guard is already helping ICE with logistics and paperwork, don’t give them any bright ideas.

Oddly enough, the same logic has applied for months to the Michigan House Republicans’ approach to the state budget: until they actually present a plan, their budget both exists and doesn’t. 
For those who are not science nerds, the concept of Schrödinger’s cat is a thought experiment which demonstrates that in the super-micro quantum world, something (in this case, a cat) can simultaneously exist in multiple states until we observe it, at which point it is forced to become one or the other.
Obviously in the reality we experience, something can’t be two things at once (the exception may be Michigan weather, in which it can be both snowing and oddly humid), but Lansing politics often transcends reality. 
Earlier this week House Republicans said that box could open as soon as next week with the long-awaited release of their proposal, and the cat about to finally be observed. But House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) slammed shut the box lid by repudiating his own appropriations chair and saying the GOP budget plan might not see the light of day until Sept. 30. That would give negotiators just hours to finalize a budget and get it signed by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1, staving off a shutdown.
This year’s process stands in stark contrast to the last two budget cycles when Democrats held the political trifecta of legislative majorities in the state House and Senate and the governor’s office, passing spending plans by the July 1 deadline.

But one need only go back to 2022 and see that even with a GOP-led House and Senate, Whitmer and fellow Democrats were able to get a budget approved on time.
But today Michiganders are stuck in political limbo, unable to scrutinize or debate what has only been promised, not delivered.
The state is barreling toward an Oct. 1 government shutdown, and every day without a spending plan leaves vital services in limbo and taxpayers on the hook.
There have only been two shutdowns in Michigan before, in 2007 and again in 2009, both lasting just hours until temporary spending plans were put in place. That could be the case this year also, although does anyone really believe we live in a less politically divided world than we did 15 years ago? 
In the meantime, that budget cat, the one we can’t see, is still theoretically inside the box. The cat we can see is the failure of Hall and his Republican caucus to produce a state budget proposal in a timely manner, leaving schools, local governments and countless Michigan families in the lurch. 
With a rapidly shrinking legislative calendar,  that failure has moved beyond mere political posturing. It’s legislative negligence. 
Instead of several months to negotiate a budget that will pass both chambers and be signed by the governor, we are now facing the possibility of mere hours.
But it doesn’t have to be this way. In fact, it shouldn’t be this way. 
Just six years ago, Hall joined every one of his House colleagues – Democrats and Republicans alike – in approving a statutory deadline of July 1 for the Legislature to pass a budget. 
Unfortunately that law provided no sanction for violating it, likely with the assumption that responsible leaders would abide by it out of a sense of their solemn oath.
Feel free to pause here so you can catch your breath after the good laugh that statement surely provided.
But seriously, the goal then seemed logical: provide schools and local governments with clarity and stability. Yet now, weeks after that deadline has come and gone, the very man who helped enshrine that timeline into law is presiding over a chamber that has yet to put a complete budget on paper.
So, what’s the holdup? 
Hall insists that House Republicans are focused on delivering a comprehensive plan that includes fixing Michigan’s crumbling roads, a priority he claims is shared by Whitmer. 
But the governor told Michigan Advance Senior Reporter Ben Solis that while she does want a long-term road funding solution, this year’s budget process “is going a little later than I think any of us want it to,” and a roads plan is just one piece of the overall picture. 
“It all goes together,” she said.

The fact remains that the governor put forth her statewide budget proposal in February, while the Democratic-led Michigan Senate followed suit in May.
The House GOP, by contrast, has offered press conferences, not pages.
With a proposal that had been promised “as soon as next week” but now again delayed, the path forward remains unclear. What’s in the plan? More importantly, will it be a serious spending blueprint that understands a true negotiation requires both giving and getting? 
None of that is certain. What is certain is that the longer House leaders wait to get serious, the greater the risk to essential services, and to the people who rely on them, all of which could have been avoided if the House GOP had treated this process with the urgency it demanded.
The Senate has acted. The governor has acted. The House GOP says it may act soon. 
But Michigan deserves more than promises. It deserves leadership.
There’s still time to avert disaster. But with every passing day, voters should be asking why the chamber that once demanded budget discipline now finds itself scrambling to meet the moment. 
Whenever a plan finally arrives, let’s hope it’s more than a political prop. Because while the theoretical cat inside Schrödinger’s theoretical box can theoretically wait, actual accountability won’t wait.

(Courtesy of Vargas for Nebraska)OMAHA — Tony Vargas, a former candidate for Congress and elected officeholder for more than a decade, has confirmed he is running for Douglas County treasurer in the 2026 election.
The former Nebraska state senator for South Omaha joins the county race with the support of Omaha Mayor John Ewing, who held the treasurer’s spot for 18 years before resigning in June to take on his latest role as mayor.
Prior to Vargas’ eight years in the Legislature — he termed out of the lawmaking role last year — he served on the Omaha Public Schools Board. Vargas, 40, began his career as a public school teacher and twice ran unsuccessfully for the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District seat, losing tight races to now-retiring U.S. Rep Don Bacon, R-Neb.

“From the classroom as a middle school science teacher to the school board, and from the Nebraska Legislature to my run for Congress, public service and giving back to my community has always been at the core of my life’s work,” said Vargas, currently executive director of Square One, a national leadership nonprofit founded by a group of Obama administration alumni and entrepreneurs. 
Vargas said his attraction to the treasurer’s post stems from work that fulfilled him while serving eight years on the Legislature’s budget-setting Appropriations Committee. 
“Being a steward of our state government resources, protecting taxpayer interests and making sure we are being fiscally sound has been something I really enjoyed doing,” he said, foreseeing such skills transferring to the treasurer job.
He said he “worked across party lines” to help deliver balanced budgets and strived to ensure that tax dollars provided efficient and quality services. 
Republicans regularly criticized Vargas during his congressional races for missing votes, which he explained as having to do with his committee work in the Legislature.
Vargas said he was proud of a fiscal planning law he championed in 2019 that allowed lawmakers to better forecast revenue. He said he backed legislation to strengthen public schools and to improve access to health care and consumer protections. 
As treasurer of the most populous county in the state, charged with overseeing the collection of taxes, Vargas said his goals would include following through on the office’s recent technology infrastructure updates.
Earlier this week, another Democrat, Christian Espinosa Torres, assistant director of the Omaha Human Rights and Relations Department, announced his candidacy for the treasurer’s job.
Vargas said he entered the race with more than $50,000 to start his campaign.
“Now more than ever, Nebraskans need leaders who are dedicated to listening to and serving them and who have a track record of getting things done that make their lives better,” Vargas said. 
Vargas earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Rochester and a master’s degree in education at Pace University. He serves as a board member of the Latino Economic Development Council, the Rose Children’s Theatre, Partnership for Kids and Opera Omaha.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)This week, the Trump administration’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced an effort to check the immigration status of people who get their health insurance through Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Medicaid is the public health insurance program for people with low incomes that’s jointly funded by states and the federal government. For families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to afford private insurance, CHIP is a public program that provides low-cost health coverage for their children.
The feds will begin sending states monthly enrollment reports that identify people with Medicaid or CHIP whose immigration or citizenship status can’t be confirmed through federal databases. States are then responsible for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals in those reports. States are expected to take “appropriate actions when necessary, including adjusting coverage or enforcing non-citizen eligibility rules,” according to a CMS press release.
“We are tightening oversight of enrollment to safeguard taxpayer dollars and guarantee that these vital programs serve only those who are truly eligible under the law,” Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who oversees CMS as secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said in a press release announcing the new program.
As of April, roughly 71 million adults and children nationwide have Medicaid coverage, while another 7 million children have insurance through CHIP. Immigrants under age 65 are less likely to be covered by Medicaid than U.S.-born citizens, according to an analysis from health research organization KFF.
Immigrants who are in the country illegally aren’t eligible for federally funded Medicaid and CHIP. Only citizens and certain lawfully present immigrants — green card holders and refugees, for example — can qualify.
But some states have chosen to expand Medicaid coverage for immigrants with their own funds. Twenty-three states offer pregnancy-related care regardless of citizenship or immigration status, according to KFF. Fourteen states provide coverage for children in low-income families regardless of immigration status, while seven states offer coverage to some adults regardless of status.
The tax and spending package President Donald Trump last month cuts federal spending on Medicaid by more than $1 trillion, leaving states to either make up the difference with their own funds or reduce coverage. But the new law also includes restrictions on coverage for certain immigrants, including stripping eligibility from refugees and asylum-seekers.

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The Federal Emergency Management Agency closed disaster assistance applications Tuesday for residents affected by severe storms and flooding in April.
The agency approved roughly $7.2 million in aid to 975 individuals between June 19 and Aug. 19, according to FEMA’s website. This includes $4.3 million in housing assistance and $2.9 million to assist with other needs.
Homeowners, renters, students, self-employed individuals, ranchers and farmers in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties were eligible to apply for disaster assistance, which is meant to help individuals pay for uninsured losses resulting from the disaster.
While the initial application period for the severe storms in Middle and West Tennessee is now closed, FEMA does accept late applications for an additional 60 days. Those who submit late applications must include an explanation for the delay, though FEMA does not require applicants to submit documents supporting the reason for the delay. Late applications are reviewed on a “case-by-case basis,” according to FEMA’s website.
Housing assistance helps individuals cover temporary housing costs and pay for structural home repairs that are not covered by insurance. These funds may also be used to replace wells, furnaces and septic systems. 
Funding for “other needs” can help homeowners and renters offset costs of other disaster-related out-of-pocket expenses not covered by insurance.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. Additional resources can be found at fema.gov/disaster/4878.
Private nonprofits that provide “non-critical services of a governmental nature” may also be eligible for low-interest physical and economic injury disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. More information is available at sba.gov/disaster or 800-659-2955.

(Natalie Fobes/Getty Images)Editor’s note: This is the fourth installment of a four-part series on salmon. Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River. Part Two explored salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, showing the Pacific Northwest is entering extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape. Part Three explored the good work that has restored the Grande Ronde and Imnaha river areas, more so than any other salmon landscape in the Snake River Basin.
I conclude here this four-part reflection on salmon and steelhead extinction science, and extinction’s approach and effects for rivers and people in Washington and Oregon’s Snake River tributaries. The last words go to many I interviewed, after a few more from me.
Salmon extinction in motion in Washington’s and Oregon’s Snake River

I thank everyone who talked with me: Amy Jayne, Bobby Fossek, John Milbert, Kevin March, David Baum, Noel March, Rick George, Joe McCormack, John Appleton, Henry Roller, Kyle Bratcher, Tucker Jones, Ed Bowles, Emmit Taylor, Ryan Kinzer, and Jay Hesse. I thank Hesse, Kinzer, Jones and Kasey Bliesner for data, Kinzer and Pete Sandrock for map help, and a few anonymous reviewers. I thank Pam Conley and Mike Beaty for introductions that got me started, and ongoing advice. I am responsible for any errors.  
More should have been interviewed but were not. Many threads worth following – the 30-year relationship of area ranchers with river restoration, for example – were not.  Nor was I able to talk with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation or the Grande Ronde Model Watershed. Since this story can’t be told without them, I have tried to fill in roles and some details from their websites. The Grande Ronde Model Watershed website is the best single place to get a feel for northeast Oregon’s river and water restoration story-in-progress.   
I believe the word “extinction” no longer penetrates, publicly or politically, as it did 40 or 20 years ago. Nor do salmon numbers – dam counts, for example – because there are too many numbers. 
Yet strong public and political awareness of the fishes’ dire condition is not optional if the lower Snake River is to be restored, so that Snake salmon and steelhead get their shot to restore themselves. Results on the Klamath, Elwha, White Salmon and other rivers strongly suggest that when salmon get that chance, they grab it.
(For the scientific case to restore the lower Snake, by removing its dams, I recommend a webinar by Russ Thurow. Thurow is a U.S. Forest Service emeritus fish biologist, and main architect of comprehensive research and data sets for salmon and steelhead in Idaho’s Middle Fork Salmon River. The link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhaXzrd6wk0&t=1058s) 
The extinction threshold science is good, timely and action-focused. I also see its potential to show extinction in motion to people and leaders – in mapped, named places whose human-salmon stories can be told, and perhaps more deeply heard by those in government who represent the people and places.
Salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, and the ocean fish of northeast Oregon

When the Nez Perce Tribe releases its 2025 extinction threshold update, I hope salmon people studying it ask, can we show extinction risk in motion to Northwest people and leaders, year by year?
In 2022, U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, forthrightly said, “we cannot under any circumstances allow the extinction of salmon to come to pass.”  
But exactly that is underway. Can its pace and locations be shown to U.S. Sens. Murray, Maria Cantwell, Ron Wyden, Jeff Merkley, Jim Risch and Mike Crapo; to Northwest members of the U.S. House; to Govs. Tina Kotek, Bob Ferguson and Brad Little; and to Northwest people?  
As I researched this article, the federal administration and its agencies began a retreat from their responsibilities, to many tribes and the Northwest, to restore salmon and steelhead that federal actions are grinding to extinction. 
This retreat dishonors our nation, ignores what makes the Northwest a unique place on earth, and has 3 ½ years more to run. For at least that long, Northwest people, leaders and institutions must counter federal retreat with equally visible engagement and support for salmon.  
This includes continued pursuit of public and political settlements to make Columbia and Snake River salmon, tribes and salmon communities whole, while keeping other river users whole or better. It’s not an easy pursuit.  
But, when our nation shirks its responsibilities, who else but Northwest people, and our state, tribal and congressional leaders, must step in to fill the vacuum, with sustained action?
 What if salmon and steelhead in your rivers go extinct?

I asked some of those I spoke with a hard question: What if sea-going salmon and steelhead in the rivers you know go extinct? Others have one more point to make about the situation or remedies.    
The good work underway by Pacific Northwest salmon people in northeast Oregon

Retired attorney and fisherman Dave Baum: “I used to try a case in Enterprise, get done at 5 or 6, drive to the Imnaha, 30 miles down to Cow Creek, to fish for steelhead. In October, I’d start the hike about 9 p.m. I used a head lamp and wore high top leather boots for rattlesnakes. I’d get to Eureka Bar on the Snake at 11 p.m, throw my bag out, and start fishing at dawn. I’d fish the Snake an hour or two, then fish back up the Imnaha to Cow Creek. Walking that canyon, its vertical walls, is like being in fairyland. To me, extinction would mean no fishing for steelhead.”  
Ryan Kinzer is the Nez Perce Tribe research scientist coordinating development of the extinction threshold data: “We can see that in the 1980s, the Snake River populations showed significant variability. If one population was down, others were even or up. We started losing that around 2000. Now the populations are pretty synchronous in their decline.  That’s bad. It means the species is losing its ability to refresh its parts and repair gaps. The danger rises of losing them all at once in a catastrophic event or two. This has happened in California, and can happen here.”

Retired acupuncturist and fisherman Kevin March: “I notice the habitat changes without salmon. The Wallowa River used to host freshwater mussels. Now I never see the shells. It’s a real sign of decline. The dead steelhead and salmon aren’t in the river anymore. We still have much more habitat in the ag valleys to re-connect. And, when the Elwha and Condit dams went, the fish came back. Just let them have the chance.”

Fisherman and writer John Milbert, when he thinks about extinction, remembers Celilo Falls, the spectacular fishery drowned by The Dalles Dam in 1957. “We lived on the coast back then, but we drove back to eastern Oregon every year. I was always awake at night, so I saw Celilo Falls, and The Dalles Dam being built as we drove. I didn’t know what it meant, but it was interesting, all the lights and equipment. Then, on one trip, it was done. Where is Celilo? Where are the fish? What do the fishing people do now? I still think about it. If we lose salmon here, it’s the same thing.”
Ascension Center Director Amy Jayne: “Teaching the reality is part of our curriculum. I think we understand how devastating salmon disappearance would be. This is their land. Salmon are sacred to our Indigenous relatives, therefore to us too.  Extinction would be devastating. We want to have hope: a child finds a mussel, the water is cold, you can see the wonder. But we also have to face reality.”
Trout Unlimited river restorer Noel March: “Extirpation in northeast Oregon would be devastating.  To lose that wild connection, the living connection between the ocean and our inland rivers, would be profoundly sad. They’ve always been there for us, for the tribes and now for us all. Not returning the favor, and allowing them to slip away, would be a sad commentary on us.” 
Joe McCormack, of the Joseph Band of the Nez Perce: “It’s a terrible loss for us. Without salmon, you strip tribal people of a large part of who we are. Our sustainability as a tribe rests on the shoulders of those Nez Perce in 1855 who secured our right to fish, in our treaty. Taking salmon away is like losing an arm, a leg, a heart.”

Emmit Taylor, Nez Perce watershed program director: “Salmon is a first food. Water is first and salmon second in the long house. In our creation story, salmon came forward and offered their lives for the people. Salmon are the leader. The fishery is food and culture for tribal people.
“Think of the abundance there was in Wallowa Country: spring and summer Chinook, steelhead, coho, sockeye, lamprey, bull trout … They didn’t just feed us, they fed eagles, bears, trees. Today the watersheds and the people only have a small fraction of what was here 150 years ago.”
Ed Bowles, former Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife chief of fisheries and salmon adviser to Oregon governors: “Snake River salmon are facing extinction, population by population. But we also have evidence, from several sources including extinction threshold science, that intrinsic productivity is still there in these salmon and steelhead. It is NOT too late.  Oregon’s view, based on our best assessment of the science, is that we have two salmon generations, eight to 10 years, to restore the lower Snake. That one action isn’t all that’s needed, but it is the necessary cornerstone for recovery, and must happen soon. This urgency is heightened given the need to secure continuity of services that the lower Snake currently provides, prior to restoration.” 
Caretakers of the Land’s Bobby Fossek: “Our culture was brought upriver on the backs of the salmon. If salmon are healthy, people are healthy. Salmon stood up for human beings, and the health of the ecosystem, for thousands of years. Their decline and loss is apocalyptic to me. It has happened so fast. We are seeing the effects of living as if the health of fish and rivers are irrelevant.”
And Nez Perce elder Elmer Crow: “We are the circle. That’s what life is all about. We take care of one another. So when we have someone in trouble, that’s when the rest of us have to step in.”

Margaret Low, chief executive of WBUR Radio, agreed, observing that her station reaches beyond its airwaves and digital presence through events at its CitySpace venue and through such initiatives as the WBUR Festival.
“There’s something very powerful about bringing people together in a place to talk about some of the most pressing issues of the day,” she said. “And it’s different than the one-to-many that broadcasting is, or even a newsletter is. It’s actually people feeling like they’re part of something bigger than themselves, that they’re part of a community.”
Goldberg and Low spoke Wednesday at a webinar sponsored by the New England chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. The theme of the evening was survival. Earlier this summer the Republican-controlled Congress, acting at the behest of President Trump, eliminated the budget for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), a semi-independent agency that provided funding for PBS, NPR and local public television and radio stations.
Though public media outlets receive a majority of their funds from private grants, donations, and corporate underwriting, a number of stations — especially in rural areas and urban communities of color — were heavily dependent on CPB money and are now struggling to stay afloat. Earlier this week a consortium of foundations led by Knight, MacArthur, Ford and others announced an emergency grant of nearly $37 million to 115 stations that are at the highest risk of closure.
The irony is that even though national operations at PBS and NPR will suffer less than some of their member stations, studies such as a 2024 survey by the Pew Research Center show that local news outlets remain more trusted than national organizations, which have gotten hopelessly caught up in the partisanship that is tearing the country apart. Even as mainstream outlets attempt to reassure their audience that they are dedicated to fair, truth-telling journalism, critics rail that they are hopelessly biased.
These claims are especially loud on the right, as years of deriding sources such as The New York Times, The Washington Post and, yes, NPR and PBS as “fake news” have taken a toll. The latest survey from Pew, for instance, shows that 73% of Democrats and respondents who lean Democratic say that journalists’ role in society is “extremely” or “very” important, whereas only 45%  of Republicans and Republican leaners say the same.
Evidence suggests that robust community journalism can offset such polarization, with one study even showing that readers of a newspaper that eliminated national opinion content and replaced it with local commentary for just one month demonstrated a measurable decline in partisanship. Communities without reliable news and information suffer from lower voter turnout in local elections, fewer candidates running for office, and other civic ills. Yet local news is in crisis, with one recent study finding that there are 75% fewer journalists working in local news today than in 2007.
A thriving public media ecosystem could help solve the local news crisis and ease the partisan divide. Unfortunately, Trump and the MAGA movement want to move in the opposite direction.
Both GBH and WBUR produce a variety of national and local programming. Susan Goldberg noted Wednesday that GBH is the largest producer of national programming for PBS, and that the failure of local stations would harm GBH since they would no longer be able to pay for that programming.
“There are a lot of efforts under way to help stabilize the system,” she said, observing that PBS has cut member fees by 21 percent so that they are better able to pay for national programming. She added: “We’re going to have to make some hard decisions as well.”
Likewise, Margaret Low pointed out that WBUR produces two national programs, “On Point” and “Here & Now,” both of which are paid for by member stations. “We may have to make some tough decisions,” she said. “It’s serious. It’s not insurmountable…. It’s hard to know how serious that impact will be.”










A thriving public media ecosystem could help solve the local news crisis and ease the partisan divide. Unfortunately, Trump and the MAGA movement want to move in the opposite direction.


As Low and Goldberg said, though, it’s the connection with the local community that will determine whether public media rises or falls. Both outlets have robust news staffs and cover local and regional news as part of the national morning and afternoon newscasts.
Unfortunately, financial challenges that arose even before Trump’s second term have forced both outlets to make some painful cuts at the local level. ’BUR canceled its daily “Radio Boston” program last December. GBH-TV canceled all four of its public-affairs programs over the past several years (“Beat the Press with Emily Rooney,” “Great Boston,” “Talking Politics,” and “Basic Black”), though it has revived “Basic Black” as “GBH News Rooted” on digital and has plans to bring back “Greater Boston” in some form as well. GBH Radio also broadcasts four hours of local talk each day via “Boston Public Radio” and “The Culture Show” as well as an hour on Sundays with “Under the Radar with Callie Crossley.”
With no government funding to fall back on, such locally oriented programming, more than ever, is going to depend on viewers (and listeners) like us. Goldberg and Low said that their stations as well as public media throughout the system have experienced a heartening spike in giving since the CPB was defunded.
“We have a direct relationship to the audience. The fact that people give even though they don’t have to is astonishing,” Low said, adding: “As we anticipate the year ahead, if we could find 10,000 more donors and have everybody who gives give 10 percent more, that would cover it.”
Low told the story of a wealthy listener who had never given before and who donated $10,000. Some checking revealed “that he had capacity, as we gently like to say.” He was invited to visit WBUR, and he ended up giving $250,000. “Part of it is figuring out how to tell that different story so people feel motivated to support something that they actually love,” she said.
Goldberg, though, issued a caution.
“I don’t think that fundraising alone is going to solve what is going to be a structural problem,” she said. “Long term, it is pretty hard across the system to replace $1.1 billion, or $535 million each year, which is how much the CPB has given. So I do think that we need to think of other really creative ways, in addition to reaching out to audiences, to helping them understand our value. We’ve got to be better. We’ve got to be more clear about what our value proposition really is.”
Building community, encouraging civic engagement, and telling the stories of the people who live here need to be at the heart of that mission.

Credit: (Christiana Botic/Verite News and Catchlight Local/Report for America)NEW ORLEANS – Corinne Green, a local trans activist and public policy analyst, went to a local Walgreens in June to pick up a refill of progesterone, a hormone she has been taking daily for several years. She was used to getting it for free since she enrolled in Medicaid in January 2024.
But when she got to the pharmacy, she learned that her medication was going to cost approximately $70.
But it wasn’t a surprise. Green had been expecting Medicaid — which is mostly federally funded but administered by the state — to stop covering her hormone replacement therapy, a common form of gender-affirming health care. For nearly a year, she and other trans advocates in Louisiana had heard about sudden, unexpected Medicaid denials from dozens of transgender people around the state.
Whatever happened, it wasn’t a change to Medicaid law. Earlier this year, Congress contemplated stripping gender-affirming care coverage as part of President Trump’s sweeping tax and spending bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” But the provision didn’t make the final version passed by the Senate in early July.

State lawmakers over the past several years have passed a wave of anti-trans and anti-LGBTQIA+ legislation, including banning doctors from providing gender-affirming care to minors. So Green and other trans advocates had been watching the state legislature closely, anticipating movement to prohibit Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for adults. That didn’t happen, either.
That likely meant that there had been an administrative change from the Louisiana Department of Health, which oversees Medicaid. But there had been no notice of any such change from the state department.
“The only way a lot of people are learning about this is that they’re going into the pharmacy to pick up their monthly or once every three months…regular prescriptions that they’ve been on for a long time, and just getting hit with a completely unexpected bill,” Green said. “Because there’s been no communication from the state about this.”
The Louisiana Department of Health did not respond to Verite News’ requests for comment on the denials of Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care for adults and why the denials are happening. But LDH records reviewed by Verite show that the department has made changes to its Medicaid billing and diagnosis codes so that gender-affirming surgeries and hormone therapy are excluded from coverage. The changes appear to have started in August 2024.
As a result, people have been cancelling surgeries they’d been waiting years to get and trying to find other ways to afford their medications, Green told Verite News. Without coverage, these surgeries and medications can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars.
Nationally, between 20% and 25% of transgender adults are enrolled in Medicaid, according to recent estimates.
While there are no readily available data on how many transgender people in Louisiana are enrolled in the public insurance program, the state as a whole has the second highest share of Medicaid-enrolled residents, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
“Many trans people only have access to Medicaid coverage, I’m one of them. [It] definitely is very scary,” said Blu DiMarco, who works with the Queer and Trans Community Action Project. “It’s frightening to know that I could just, like, go to routinely pick up my medication, and they could be like, ‘Oh yeah, this is $200.’ I don’t have $200.”

Community care, collective rage
In response to the LDH policy change, the Trans Income Project, a New Orleans-based social services nonprofit, this month announced a partnership with CrescentCare, a clinic that primarily serves low-income residents. The Trans Income Project, on which Green serves as a board member, will cover the cost of medication used in hormone replacement therapy for Medicaid-eligible transgender adults. (Participants in the partnership have to get their medication from the Avita Pharmacy locations inside of CrescentCare’s Elysian Fields and Mid-City facilities.)
Natalie Rupp, executive director of the Trans Income Project, told Verite News that the organization “saw a serious need in the community” when they began hearing about people losing Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care.
“We’re trying to make sure that those most vulnerable in our community aren’t going to be stuck with additional extra costs that they previously weren’t having to cover,” she said.
The program has been praised by other trans advocacy organizations in Louisiana as an example of people coming together to support those most in need and fight back against anti-transgender policies.
“It’s a really great show of community force and how community will take care of community, even when politicians aren’t taking care of community,” Peyton Rose Michelle, executive director of Louisiana Trans Advocates said.
Rupp said she hopes that healthcare providers and pharmacies in other parts of the state and country replicate the partnership at a time when governments are moving to limit access to gender-affirming care for trans and gender nonconforming people. Eleven other states already explicitly prohibit Medicaid from funding gender-affirming care for both adults and minors.
Although it’s located in New Orleans, Crescent Care serves transgender Louisianians throughout the state, so the hope is that people outside of the metropolitan area will be able to make use of the partnership as well. Michelle said that she knows people in Lafayette, where she lives, who use CrescentCare.
Still, it’s unlikely that the partnership will be able to cover everyone  who loses access to hormones as a result of the LDH coding changes, and there’s still the question of how people who need gender-affirming surgeries, which are not covered under the partnership, will afford that care.
“I think even the organizers of their beautiful plan to provide care via Avita,” Michelle said. “I think even those people understand this isn’t going to save everyone. It is just a band aid kind of solution that will only help a subset of people.”
In order to further raise awareness about the state’s decision to stop covering gender-affirming care through Medicaid and express anger about it, the Queer and Trans Community Action Project is holding a protest Saturday at New Orleans City Hall. The Louisiana Department of Health has an office about a block away on Poydras Street that protestors will march by. The march and rally starts at 5 p.m.
“I think that the issue is not very well-known, and I think that is a very important issue to note, even for people who aren’t queer or trans, because it’s kind of a larger indicator of Medicaid cuts,” DiMarco said. “If they can come for us, then how do you know that you’re not next?”

That means the $145 million Mississippi receives annually for special education is now at risk.","Mississippi isn’t ensuring special education students receive all the services they’re entitled to federally, according to the U.S. Department of Education. 
A recent report shows Mississippi failing to comply with federal special education requirements in 10 categories, including supervision of how well districts follow laws and by allowing people with suspect qualifications to conduct dispute resolution hearings. 
But nothing in the report was particularly surprising to longtime advocates and parents.
“People working with the system have been concerned Mississippi is not compliant,” said Danita Munday, a former Mississippi Department of Education employee turned advocate. “This is validation for what we have been saying for many years.”
The 47-page document outlines numerous areas of noncompliance with federal special education regulations in Mississippi. The overarching conclusion was that the state education agency has not been adequately overseeing districts and ensuring special education students are getting the education they’re entitled to by law. 
The violations cited include the state agency reporting invalid and unreliable data, poorly supervising how districts spend money on special education and inconsistently tracking disciplinary measures for students. The report said the agency lacks a system to ensure in a timely manner that districts are in compliance with federal standards. 
Without that system, Munday said the state education department is taking a Band-Aid approach to special education violations. 
“They’re stepping on bugs,” she said. “They’ve been finding out about noncompliance through complaints and writing corrective action plans to fix it for one child.” 
The report also notes a number of issues with Mississippi’s dispute resolution process. 
When parents feel their child’s rights have been violated, they have the right to complain. A structured process ensues, with timelines and corrective action plans. But the state’s model written complaint and due-process forms require more information than they’re required to ask for, including complainants’ home addresses and phone numbers. The forms also don’t note that people can file complaints against the state, not just their district. 
In the case of mediation, the report shows that Mississippi makes parents sign “confidentiality pledges” before any resolution has been reached. A spokesperson for the agency said that pledge has since been removed. 
Additionally, there’s little evidence to show that hearing officers, impartial people who help resolve disputes over special education services, are well-trained or qualified for their jobs in Mississippi, the federal investigation found. 
A spokesperson for the state education department said the agency “acknowledges advocates’ concerns and remains committed to better serving communities.”
Cassie Tolliver of Disability Rights Mississippi said the report should draw major concern. 
“Parents trust schools to do what’s right by their child, but that’s not always the case,” she said. “We need to ensure everyone knows how egregious this is. … They are failing them all around.”
The numerous violations have Mississippi out of compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the federal law guaranteeing disabled students the right to a free and appropriate public education.
In order to receive federal education funding, state agencies must hold districts accountable to the law. The violations mean the $145 million Mississippi receives annually for special education is now at risk.
That’s a reality that was acknowledged by top education officials at Thursday’s state board of education meeting, as well as the state’s longtime struggle to adequately serve its students with special needs. 
“We’ve been out of compliance for many years,” said Lance Evans, the state education superintendent. “We want to get this fixed. We’re addressing it and moving forward very aggressively.”
The report, released last month along with reviews of nine other states, calls for the Mississippi Department of Education to make corrective changes — some within a few months, and others within a year. According to the spokesperson, the agency has already begun rectifying the shortcomings identified in the report. 
Joy Hogge, executive director of Families as Allies, estimated that 95% of the calls her organization receives are from parents who need help getting their kids’ educational needs met. She said those problems are the very ones highlighted in the report. 
“Every one of those calls represents a very real child who has every right to learn,” she said. “It’s incredibly widespread and devastating when it’s not addressed.
“It’s validating to see this all written down, but the real proof is going to be if anything happens — what changes are made and what is the state held accountable for.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/29120532/No-faces-1.jpg,,,2025-08-22 06:56:28.146544

Santiago/Getty Images)The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce has garnered much media and lawmaker attention recently with a press release decrying the state’s jobs numbers. While they are right that the numbers are lackluster, West Virginia’s flagging economic landscape is not a recent phenomenon. 
West Virginia had the ninth worst job growth of any state coming out of the pandemic with 1.1% growth between February 2020 and July 2025 (the nation has seen a 4.8% increase over that period). West Virginia’s disappointing economic and jobs numbers over the last several years should be seen as a final nail in the coffin for corporate-first policies that fail to prioritize workers, small businesses, and infrastructure investments statewide. West Virginia needs to invest in a 55-county strategy to spur opportunity from Weirton to War.
In recent years, much of the state’s economic development strategy has focused on offering business tax incentives to big corporations to locate in West Virginia alongside enacting deep tax cuts to make the state more “appealing” to businesses. These efforts have yet to move the needle on economic and jobs’ growth while coming with great opportunity costs.
West Virginia has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on business tax incentives in recent years through tax abatements, tax credits and cash handouts. A leading researcher on tax incentives, Tim Bartik, has identified why they are a costly and ineffective approach, particularly in places like West Virginia with large parts of the state made up of economically distressed areas. 
First, the big corporations lured by business tax incentives are unlikely to locate in the places that need them most. Of the “top investments” touted by the West Virginia Development Office in their 2022 and 2023  annual reports, 71% located in a border county and 80% in a county with a higher median household income than the statewide average. 
Second, business tax incentives have the highest cost-per-job of any economic development strategy, coming in at a whopping $436,000 per job on average. And these high costs for taxpayers result in little benefit for West Virginia workers, as state officials have failed to include local hiring provisions and strong wage requirements in the agreements. 
To summarize, business tax incentives largely help big corporations subsidize out-of-state workers, cost much more than other economic development strategies and concentrate economic growth in places that are already doing well.
Since 2023, West Virginia has also enacted $1 billion in tax cuts, two-thirds of which benefited the top 20% of earners in the state. While the promised jobs boom and sales tax growth have failed to materialize, the state has significantly reduced its spending on Medicaid, child care assistance, education and PEIA. This has undoubtedly cost residents jobs, as it has resulted in fewer child care slots, the lowest teacher pay in the country and shuttered community schools with the impacts most concentrated in rural places. Moreover, the foregone revenue from those tax cuts could have helped the state invest in infrastructure and other necessities in struggling parts of our state.
Instead of continuing to give away our tax dollars to corporations and the state’s wealthiest households, West Virginia can invest in an economic strategy that strengthens supports for workers, invests in our communities, and spurs job opportunities even in economically distressed places. West Virginia policymakers can take a people-first approach that prioritizes more cost-effective business development strategies alongside a commitment to public investments and infrastructure improvements in all corners of the state.
Targeted job creation programs like those operated by the Coalfield Development Corporation and the Small Business Development Center can be scaled up along with investments in place-based customized job training, union apprenticeship programs, business incubators and site-ready infrastructure development whose cost-per-job is a fraction of that of business tax incentives and can be targeted to distressed areas.
And those targeted efforts on the business side must be paired with robust investments in the communities that need it most. Prioritizing taxpayer dollars into public transportation, affordable child care, high quality community schools and on-the-job training programs can help increase employment rates at a reasonable cost-per-job while making our residents more workforce ready.
Basic infrastructure needs must be met to ensure all West Virginians have safe roads and bridges, clean drinking water and resilient infrastructure. In 2025, it’s unconscionable for any community to lack these basics. Combined, these efforts can effectively target distressed places by creating jobs in addition to providing the supports people need to be successful in the workforce while remaining in the communities they love. If we continue to let corporations decide where our investments should go, too many West Virginians will be left behind and our jobs numbers in vast swaths of the state will remain disappointing.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by David Stephenson)In a matter of a few days, nearly $1,000 has been donated to the Shelby County Public Library to replace 16 LGBTQ+ books a local church had recommended to check out and never return.
“The response to the missing books has been overwhelming and mostly positive for the library,” said Pamela W. Federspiel, the library’s executive director, on Thursday. “We will use the donated money to replace the books and buy more like them.”
Theft or civil disobedience?

The Kentucky Lantern reported Aug. 18 that three leaders of the Reformation Church of Shelbyville urged its members to remove books from the Shelby County Public Library by checking them out and never returning them. The books portray gay characters and historical figures or explore LGBTQ+ themes.
The  church  leaders — pastors Jerry Dorris and Tanner Cartwright and Austin Keeler, an evangelist with the church mission, Reformation Frontline Missions — defended what they call an “act of civil disobedience.”
But librarian Federspiel said the action is tantamount to “stealing.” She contacted a collection agency to retrieve the books but so far it has not been successful.
The library has “lost” 16 books valued at $410.85 since a member of the church checked them out with due dates in late June 2024. Neither Federspiel nor the church leaders have identified the library patron.
“Since the story came out, people have made almost $1,000 in donations to replace the books,” Federspiel said.  “One anonymous donor gave $500, and we hear more may be coming.”
The Shelby County Democratic Party has encouraged its members to donate money to the library. In an email this week, the political party said the Reformation Church of Shelbyville “seems to believe it can remove books from the local library and not return them on purpose (at the direction of their pastor) because they have decided for all of Shelby County that some of the content should not be available for reading or even in our library.
“Is this ‘civil disobedience’ as claimed or is it theft?”
The party asks people to help the library replace the missing books by donating through shelbydemocrats.org and marking the contribution for “Books.”

Asked what the library would do if the new books are checked out again and not returned, Federspiel said she is talking to a lawyer about what precautions to take.
Asked if he would still urge removal of new books the library uses as replacements, Dorris said, “I am just an individual Christian.  I will keep on saying what I think should be done.”
Dorris posted on Facebook that the removal of the books “is not theft — it is civil disobedience rooted in God’s law, carried out in love for our neighbor and aimed at protecting children.”  He called the books in question “groomer material.”
He claims that under Kentucky law, failure to return a library book is not prosecuted as theft but handled as a civil matter, with fines, collection notices or suspension of borrowing privileges. 
“This is not grand larceny — it is treated like an unpaid bill. By man’s law, and more importantly by God’s, it does not belong in the category of theft,” he said.
A Kentucky law addressing failure to return a library record classifies it as a civil matter.
“The law deals with civil liability but not any criminal defense,” Dorris said.
Shelby County Attorney Carrie McIntyre was asked by the Kentucky Lantern if she is investigating the missing books and trying to determine whether any law was broken.
She said she looks forward to answering the questions when she has time to give them appropriate consideration. She said she now is covering court while her assistants attend a prosecutors’ conference in Lexington.
Dorris, who said he has received one death threat and many vitriolic emails and comments for his stance, noted that some of his critics are using the biblical commandment “Thou shalt not steal” to attack him. 
“Many who cheered riots and looting now clutch the Ten Commandments to condemn us for suggesting vile books be removed from libraries. Their sudden zeal for “Thou shalt not steal” is not love for God’s law — but hatred of it, wielded to defend perversion,” he said.
“When Christians check out such materials and refuse to return them, they are not stealing private possessions but resisting the misuse of common funds for wicked purposes,” he said.
The controversy has created a social media frenzy and has garnered national attention from various Christian, atheist and gay organizations and news outlets.

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — though many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.

 Climate control in Arkansas prisons
Arkansas prison have had air conditioning since the 1970s, according to a 2016 Time magazine article.
Rand Champion, a Department of Corrections spokesperson, confirmed Thursday that all state prisons have heat and air conditioning, though some units that house punitive-status inmates have forced-air circulation for cooling.
The air cooling system at the East Central Arkansas Community Correctional Center in West Memphis broke down last week and took several days to repair, according to news reports. Champion said Thursday that the facility’s climate control system has been repaired.

At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin also wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
These changes mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.

The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons, and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, though the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation also found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.

The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now the director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.










At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating.


– Devin Skrzypchak, who is incarcerated at Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin


D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities also are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.

One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class-action lawsuit in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges that the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Abbey Cutrer)If child care were more available and affordable in the state, around 16,000-28,000 people could join or rejoin the workforce and that could add around $600 million, conservatively, to the economy, the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce estimates.  
The estimate comes from a report released Thursday, which analyzed the economic impact of more affordable child care in Kentucky. 
“Even under conservative assumptions, the report’s upper-bound economic impact estimates range from $599.9 million to $1.097 billion annually in new wages, sales tax revenues and income tax revenues for Kentucky,” the report says. 
This report does not include potential savings in the form of people no longer needing Medicaid or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP. Charles Aull, the vice president of policy for the Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, said those points were too full of variables to confidently estimate the impact. 
The goal with the report was to show a conservative estimate based on rigorous data of what a more robust child care landscape would mean for Kentucky, Aull said. 
  Charles Aull
“It’s been, I think, fairly intuitive for most people at this point, that there’s a connection between the ability of parents to participate in the workforce and child care,” he said. “What hadn’t really happened so far was an effort to try to fully quantify that in a really rigorous way. And so that’s essentially what we wanted to provide with this report, was to take a really rigorous methodology, be very conservative in our approaches, be very cautious in our approaches, and try to estimate: ‘okay, if we can make child care more accessible and make it reasonably more affordable, what are the actual labor market outcomes?’” 
The numbers the chamber came up with are based on survey data and academic research and point back to recommendations made by the chamber in May for how Kentucky can improve its child care landscape. 
In 2024, a survey of 1,357 parents from 88 Kentucky counties showed that some parents had already chosen to exit the workforce because of inaccessible child care. Many families put off having more children, delayed big purchases and sacrificed health care needs because of child care complications, the Lantern previously reported. 
Meanwhile, Kentucky’s workforce participation is among the lowest in the nation. Of its neighboring states, Kentucky is higher only than West Virginia, and tied with Tennessee at nearly 81%, among adults 25-54.

Gender and geography 
If child care costs were reduced by $200 per month, around 6,000 married mothers could enter the workforce, based on survey data in the report. Academic research is a bit more conservative, estimating the number of married mothers who could enter or re-enter the workforce is around 4,000. 
At that same cost reduction per month, the report shows:

Nearly 1,700 single mothers currently not in the workforce could be employed. 
Nearly 2,800 married fathers currently not in the workforce could be employed. 
Nearly 700 single fathers currently not in the workforce could be employed. 

Models in the report show a correlation between the decrease in cost of child care and the increase in the number of parents entering or reentering the workforce. If child care were reduced $350 per month, between 11,300 and 19,900 workers could enter the workforce. If it were $500 less expensive, that workforce range is around 16,000 to 28,000. 
Child care, at the county level, costs between $5,000 and $13,000 every year, Aull said, though it varies by location, the child’s age and the type of center.
The gap between mothers and fathers in these estimates “likely goes back to all sorts of historical, cultural issues that have just been a part of society for a long time.” 
In general, mothers are more likely to step away from the workforce to care for a child, he said. 
Still, Aull said, “this isn’t something that just exclusively affects mothers. There (are) a number of different fathers that are sitting outside the labor market that could also come into the workforce in the event that child care (becomes) more available, but it is certainly heavily skewed toward impact on mothers.” 
 Models in the report show a correlation between the decrease in cost of child care and the increase in the number of parents entering or reentering the workforce. (Screenshot)
The report also breaks the economic impact of more affordable and accessible child care down by region in Kentucky. 
“There may be an assumption that this is something that would primarily affect our urban areas,” Aull said. “What the study actually showed is that the impacts are generally the largest in some of our rural communities.” 
Eastern Kentucky is especially well-positioned to see more workforce participation in response to child care availability, according to the report. 
“That is actually where we have some of the largest impact estimates, and that is likely due to larger numbers of non-working, non-looking for work parents in those areas,” Aull said. “But I think the importance of this is that it illustrates that the real economic impacts and the workforce impacts of increasing access to affordable child care is something that’s really spread out all across the state, and not confined just to our urban areas, but is very much something that will positively impact our rural areas.” 
  The report breaks the economic impact of more affordable and accessible child care down by region in Kentucky. (Screenshot)
Eyes to Frankfort 
During the 2026 legislative session, the General Assembly will pass a new state budget. In order to have a successful child care landscape, the state needs both public dollars and private partnerships, Aull said. 
“Without a doubt … this is going to require public investment,” he said, though he didn’t yet have an estimate of how much the legislature would need to include in the budget for it in 2026.  
“Making sure that we have a really strong low-income subsidy system for those low- income working families, making sure that we have mechanisms to reduce cost for middle income families, making sure we have an appropriate regulatory landscape, making sure that there’s opportunities out there for child care providers to expand into sort of nontraditional areas (and) be able to expand into rural areas, making sure that communities are activated, making sure that employers are activated” will all be important, Aull said. “And of course, something that we think is extremely important in this conversation is good, high quality data, so that we know exactly where there’s a need for child care, where there’s a demand, where it’s lacking.” 
This kind of big impact can’t happen quickly, Aull said. 
“This is not something that’s going to get solved overnight. We’re not going to be able to pull in that many workers in one legislative session. But the sooner we can start laying the foundation for that, the sooner we can get to that point where we can start bringing more of these parents into the workforce — if they want to join the workforce, and if they want to go and do the types of things we talk about in this report.” 
The chamber will also be “pushing” lawmakers to “continue really important programs, such as free child care for child care workers,” Aull said. 
At the same time, he said, “we need to start laying the foundations for actions in the future.”

(Bryan Clifton for UAMS)A network of Arkansas maternal health experts and advocates is encouraging birthing hospitals throughout the state to participate in a postpartum health initiative.
The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences highlighted the Arkansas Perinatal Quality Collaborative’s “Postpartum Comprehensive Assessment, Resources and Education (CARE)” program in a Thursday news release. The collaborative’s cofounders are Dr. William “Sam” Greenfield, a UAMS obstetrics and gynecology professor, and Jennifer Callaghan-Koru, a UAMS public health professor.
The CARE project “will support birthing hospitals to improve education and screenings for women before they are discharged from the hospital after birth,” UAMS’ news release states.
Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement. Maternal mortality is measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth.
“By proactively addressing the postpartum health needs of new moms, we can prevent deaths and hospital readmissions,” Greenfield said in the news release.
Participating hospitals will receive “free staff training, clinical tools and presentations from national experts” to improve their postnatal care capacity, the release states.
The CARE initiative will “strengthen follow-up care, better screen and support new moms’ physical and mental health, and build the community connections that make recovery safer and more sustainable for families,” Michelle Pimentel, director of nursing for women’s and infant’s health at Conway Regional Medical Center, said in the news release.

The systems awarded the collaborative’s silver banner are:

Baptist Health in North Little Rock
Baptist Health in Stuttgart
Great River Medical Center in Blytheville
Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pine Bluff
National Park Medical Center in Hot Springs

The 20 awarded facilities represent a majority of Arkansas’ birthing hospitals. Only 33 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units, and six maternity wards have closed since 2020.
Arkansas ranks sixth in terms of states with the highest percentage of maternity care deserts, according to the March of Dimes, which defines maternity care deserts as areas with no birthing facility or obstetric clinician. Nearly 51% of Arkansas is a maternity care desert, according to the organization’s 2024 report.

(Photo courtesy of Richmond International Airport)Virginia is set to receive more than $48 million in federal funding to upgrade infrastructure at 18 airports, part of a nationwide effort to modernize air travel hubs and boost local economies.
The money, awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration, will fund construction projects ranging from runway rehabilitation to new hangars and improved lighting. The funding is made possible in part by the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
“These investments will help ensure that our airports are a safe, reliable engine of connectivity and economic growth for travelers and communities around the commonwealth,” said U.S. Sens. Mark R. Warner and Tim Kaine, D-Va., in a joint statement. 
“We’re going to keep doing all that we can to bring additional infrastructure investments to Virginia, and to reauthorize the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law that makes many of them possible.”
The largest awards include $7.2 million for new lighting and a taxiway shift at Winchester Regional Airport, $6.8 million to reconstruct taxiways at Washington Dulles International Airport, and $5.2 million to rehabilitate the runway at Virginia Highlands Airport. 
Other major projects include $4.9 million for runway rehabilitation at Leesburg Executive Airport and $4.7 million to improve the general aviation apron at Newport News-Williamsburg Airport.
Additional funding will support taxiway shifts at Blue Ridge Airport, new hangar construction and runway extensions at Twin County Airport, and a runway extension at Richmond Executive/Chesterfield County Airport. Norfolk International Airport will see $1.6 million to reconstruct a terminal entrance road, while Accomack County Airport will receive $1.4 million for a new taxiway and lighting. 
Smaller projects include hangar development at Mountain Empire, Danville Regional, Emporia-Greensville, and Tazewell County airports; a fuel farm expansion at Hampton Roads Executive Airport; apron improvements at Richmond International Airport; a taxiway update at Suffolk Executive Airport; and rehabilitation work at Front Royal-Warren County Airport.
The announcement follows a string of federal awards directed to Virginia airports over the past year. 
Just last month, Warner and Kaine announced more than $21 million for improvements at 10 airports, including runway rehabilitation in Roanoke and updated lighting systems in Southwest Virginia. In October 2024, they rolled out nearly $57 million in federal funding for revitalization efforts. 
The pace of investment reflects a broader push to modernize Virginia’s aviation system, which includes more than 60 public-use airports ranging from major commercial hubs to small general aviation fields. Federal officials and state lawmakers alike have noted that many facilities — particularly in rural areas — require extensive upgrades to meet safety standards and accommodate future growth.
Airports are more than transit points; they are economic engines. A recent Virginia Department of Aviation study found that the state’s airport system supports more than 146,000 jobs and generates over $23 billion in economic activity annually. 
Improvements to infrastructure are expected to help sustain that impact, particularly as the state competes for tourism, business development, and federal contracts tied to military and defense sectors.
Politically, the investments highlight the dividends of the infrastructure law, a landmark $1.2 trillion piece of legislation passed with backing from Warner and Kaine. The law has funded not only airport upgrades, but also broadband expansion, highway projects, and public transit improvements across Virginia. The senators have made a point of underscoring those returns as Congress debates reauthorization.
Warner and Kaine, both members of key Senate committees, have also framed these airport investments as part of a broader commitment to ensuring rural regions don’t get left behind. While Dulles and Richmond International draw the most passenger traffic, small and regional airports often provide critical services for medevac flights, business travel, and military operations.
For Virginia travelers, most of the changes won’t be immediately visible, but the improvements are designed to set up airports for long-term growth. As Kaine and Warner put it, “These investments will help ensure that our airports are a safe, reliable engine of connectivity and economic growth.”

The report, released this month by the advocacy group Protect Our Care, estimates that more than 330 hospitals nationwide — including Aroostook Medical Center in Presque Isle and Maine Coast Memorial Hospital in Ellsworth — are at immediate risk of shutting down due to reductions in Medicaid funding included in congressional Republicans’ tax law signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. That will mean significant job cuts, longer wait times, and an overall increase in health care costs, including for people not on Medicaid, according to the report. Another 400 facilities are considered vulnerable.
Maine hospitals could lose more than $66 million annually in revenue as a result of the Medicaid cuts, according to previously released analyses from Families USA and think tank Third Way. In addition to the Ellsworth hospital, those other studies identified Northern Light A.R. Gould Hospital in Presque Isle, Cary Medical Center in Caribou, and Calais Community Hospital as especially vulnerable due to persistent operating losses and heavy reliance on Medicaid revenue.
In rural states with hospitals already closing, health care leaders have emphasized that the threat is particularly acute. Nearly half of Maine’s 24 rural hospitals are considered “at risk” of closing, according to a separate analysis by the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform. Such closures will impact the local community and economy, the report noted.
Nationally, hospitals employ roughly 10% of all workers in rural counties that report having any hospital employment, the Protect Our Care report said. When rural hospitals close, communities can lose a staggering number of jobs. One rural hospital closure can eliminate 220 jobs immediately, the report said.
The closures would further compound an already shrinking health care network. Since 2020, five hospitals in Maine have shut down their labor and delivery units, leaving expectant mothers in wide swaths of the state without local maternity care. Waldo Hospital in Belfast, Houlton Regional Hospital, Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor, and Northern Light Inland Hospital in Waterville all ended maternity services in 2025 alone.
The report specifically called out congressional Republicans for “pulling the plug on entire communities’ access to care.” 
The new law included more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid, which advocates say is the largest rollback of the program in its history. While the legislation provides $50 billion in rural health aid over six years, experts say that funding falls far short of offsetting the losses.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, who was one of just three Republican senators to vote against the package, cited its effect on rural hospitals when announcing her opposition. However, Maine Democratic leaders have criticized Collins for voting to advance the measure. Maine Democratic Party Executive Director Devon Murphy-Anderson said during a recent press event, “she has cost us our health care. She has cost us freedom. She has cost us the representation that we as Mainers and as Americans deserve.”
If closures accelerate, rural Mainers could face long drives to reach critical care. Advocates have warned that without intervention, Maine’s fragile hospital system may not be able to sustain the services communities depend on.

The proposed two-story, warehouse-style facility would use an electric motor to push additional gas into service areas farther from the pipelines. No new pipelines would be required, and the facility would sit on existing VNG property on Bainbridge Boulevard and South Military Highway.
“We continue to add 1000s of customers each year across our footprint. That means more demand, more gas being drawn off of the system. We have to make sure that we have the appropriate infrastructure in place to keep it reliable,” said Ken Yagelski, the company’s gas supply director. 
At a mid-August SCC hearing, residents and advocates raised concerns about expanding fossil fuel infrastructure, the risk of pipeline leaks, and the rezoning of nearby residential land for industrial use. That rezoning, which drew particular frustration, required two separate Chesapeake City Council votes to pass.
“They are trying to put this project next to homes of a Black community and a poor community, and this is a region that is already vulnerable to climate change,” said Zander Pellegrino, Virginia field manager for Chesapeake Climate Action Network. “Residents are concerned about what their future holds and locking us into more fossil fuel production cannot be the solution right now.”
The property has long been within Virginia Natural Gas’s fenceline, used for more than 60 years despite being zoned residential. Company officials argue that relocating the compressor could require building new pipelines, which neighbors also oppose.
“It was a property we were already utilizing. I think they’re concerned about the prospects of an industrial facility that’s in the region and again. A lot of that angst, I think, might be a little bit misplaced, because of their misunderstanding of what the facility is,” Yagelski said.
The Chesapeake Climate Action Network, which has been heavily involved in the community, argued the project would primarily benefit corporate customers seeking guaranteed supply. Smurfit Westrock, a paper manufacturer, is listed in the SCC filing as requesting higher volumes of gas. Pellegrino said it is unfair for residents to shoulder the cost of infrastructure built for large industrial users. 
VNG says the facility will have no emissions since the motor is electric and does not burn gas. The compressor is expected to operate only about 20 days a year. But residents noted at the hearing that the site’s existing propane plant and flare are slated for retirement in 2026 —  and they don’t want new industrial activity replacing it. 
“It’s not just about the total threshold that this project adds. It’s about the cumulative impact that this community is facing,” Pellegrino said.
The SCC will compile a report on the public comments. VNG will have two weeks to respond before regulators issue a final decision on whether the project can proceed.

The latest assault against compassion and acceptance comes by way of the U.S. Department of Education, which said last week it would pull federal funding from five Northern Virginia school divisions.
The alleged transgression? Officials said the K-12 leadership in the city of Alexandria city and Fairfax, Arlington, Prince William and Loudoun counties wouldn’t comply with a request to change policies that support transgender students. The contested policies are designed to allow transgender students to use restrooms, locker rooms and facilities that match their gender identity, The Washington Post reported.
Statements from the jurisdictions said their policies were consistent with state and federal laws. These divisions support students struggling for acceptance and trying to live their true selves. The administration doesn’t. It values cruelty above all (see: treatment of suspected illegal immigrants).
The Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law says 18,200 children ages 13 to 17 in Virginia identify as transgender. The attack against the Northern Virginia school divisions is typical of the punitive, spiteful Trump administration: Stoke fear. Target a minority group. Threaten funding. Rinse. Repeat.
Virginia legislators and nonprofits are grappling with the upcoming federal cuts to food stamps, Medicaid and other programs that poor people in society depend on. A bipartisan Virginia House of Delegates emergency panel heard reports last week from staffers about the financial impact to the commonwealth.
Neither the state nor charitable organizations can fully reverse the callousness that President Trump’s One Small-Minded, Ugly Bill has unleashed. The tax-and-spending measure that he signed into law also increases the debt by trillions of dollars – which GOP fiscal hawks in Congress conveniently overlooked.
Shame on the Republican congresspeople from Virginia who chose fealty to Trump – and their political future – over their constituents. And shame on me for thinking Rep. Rob Wittman, a Westmoreland Republican who ultimately voted for this monstrosity after expressing reservations, would put Virginians over party.
There’s great news for Diamond Johnson, the Norfolk State University graduate and basketball star. She’s caught on with a professional team in China, after the Minnesota Lynx of the WNBA released her before that season started.
Johnson signed a contract with Hefei of the Women’s Chinese Basketball Association, the top  pro league in the country. She’ll play in the league’s Group B division. Her season starts in November. Johnson graduated from NSU this spring, and I wrote about her bid to make the rare leap from a historically black university to the WNBA. She earned the Most Valuable Player award in a post-season all-star game.
Congrats to her.

More NSU sports: City of Norfolk and public transit officials are alerting football game day attendees about a useful option. Fans can park in a few city-owned lots for free and catch NSU buses or hop on The Tide light rail, also for free, to reach the 30,000-seat on-campus stadium. It can be a congested sojourn otherwise.
It’s the first time Hampton Roads Transit and the city have done this for NSU football games. Call it the Michael Vick effect. The former NFL star will make his coaching debut at home Aug. 28 against Towson University in a nationally televised game on ESPN.
You see it every week: People killing Virginians by gunfire, often for the most absurd or needless reasons. This includes the slaying of Kiersten Renee Moore, 32, in Portsmouth, on Aug. 8.
Her supposed “offense”? Police said she had gone outside around 1:20 a.m. to ask a neighbor to keep the music down. That man instead shot and killed her. Police said that as they headed to the scene, they noticed a car fitting a description of the suspect’s vehicle, which crashed into a parked vehicle. The 33-year-old man apparently shot and killed himself, Portsmouth police said.
Moore worked at LifeStance Health, a mental healthcare company. Her linkedin profile said she started there in September. “Kiersten was a beloved member of our Suffolk team and an exceptional therapist who was highly dedicated to her clients,” a LifeStance spokesperson told me by email Wednesday. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with Kiersten’s family and friends during this difficult time.”
The killing was senseless. I wish people wouldn’t use firearms to settle disputes, showing such disdain for others. Two lives were lost over nonsense. Two families are grieving.
What a waste.
Norfolk International Airport announced some eye-popping stats the other day. More than a half-million passengers used the airport in July, the first time it’s ever reached that monthly benchmark. The passenger total so far this year, at 2.81 million, is up slightly over the same period for 2024.
The airport, which opened in 1938 and is now features nine airlines, is completing several projects. Among those planned are an on-site hotel and a new customs facility.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)When California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled his plan to retaliate if Republican-led Texas redrew its congressional districts to favor the GOP, he affirmed his support for less partisan maps — and then promised to “meet fire with fire.”
“We’re doing it mindful that we want to model better behavior,” Newsom told reporters in Los Angeles earlier this month, nodding to the independent system his state currently uses to draw districts. “ … But we cannot unilaterally disarm. We can’t stand back and watch this democracy disappear.”
President Donald Trump’s call for Republicans to redraw U.S. House districts so the party can win more seats in the 2026 midterm elections — to gerrymander them — has triggered a redistricting frenzy this summer that also threatens to prompt moves by Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri and New York, among others. Ohio was already set to redraw its lines, even before the current fracas.
The battle for partisan advantage is placing Democratic politicians, advocates of less partisan maps and others who support curbs on gerrymandering in an uncomfortable position, pitting their desire for change against fears that Trump will take advantage of their scruples to wring more GOP seats out of a handful of key states. Some say they accept that Democratic states need to respond, while others warn retaliation will only yield short-term gains.
The Texas House passed a new map on Wednesday, clearing the way for a final vote in the state Senate and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s signature. In California, lawmakers passed their own map on Thursday, setting up a statewide vote in November over the new districts.
Other states are now likely to follow, as Republicans and Democrats scramble for a political leg up.










I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard.


– David Daley, senior fellow at FairVote


But gerrymandering opponents say the current moment has the potential to produce new energy for their movement. More people are paying attention to gerrymandering, they say, and new polls show the public opposes the practice. The rush to redraw maps demonstrates the need for Congress to set national limits, they say.
“I think that the gerrymandering wildfire that we’re seeing across the country right now calls real attention to the urgent need for a national standard,” said David Daley, an author of books on gerrymandering and a senior fellow at FairVote, a Maryland-based nonpartisan group that supports ranked choice voting and multimember House districts to end the practice. “We will never have reform if a handful of states can act on their own.”
At the same time, some gerrymandering opponents fear states will unravel hard-fought victories. They wonder whether temporary measures, such as California potentially setting aside the independent commission it uses to redraw maps, could become permanent.
‘An unprecedented time’
State legislatures exercise primary control over congressional redistricting in 39 states, according to All About Redistricting, a compendium of information on map-drawing hosted by Loyola Law School in California. While some states use other methods, only nine states rely on independent commissions, which typically limit participation by elected officials and are favored by many gerrymandering opponents.
Most states draw maps once a decade after the census, making the mid-decade maneuvers and counter-maneuvers highly unusual (six states currently have only one representative, eliminating the need to draw district lines). But just a few seats could determine who controls the U.S. House. Republicans currently hold 219 seats to Democrats’ 212, with four vacancies.
“We affirm that gerrymandering, both racial and political, disenfranchises voters,” Virginia Kase Solomón, president and CEO of Common Cause, an organization that has long advocated for changes to the redistricting process, said during a press call the day before Newsom’s announcement.
“But this is an unprecedented time of political upheaval,” she said. People don’t want to see a situation develop where maps are redrawn every two years, she added.
Texas House Republicans propose new congressional map to increase GOP seats

The new Texas map could ease the path for Republicans to win an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Texas lawmakers rapidly advanced the redraw this week once Democratic state lawmakers returned to the state. They had traveled to other states to deny Texas House leaders the quorum required to approve the map, but returned after Newsom outlined California’s response.
Gerrymandering typically involves “packing” and “cracking.” “Packing” refers to the concentration of opposition party voters in a small number of districts to reduce competition elsewhere. “Cracking” means diluting the voting power of the opposing party’s supporters across many districts.
Texas Republicans have been frank that they are pursuing the redraw for partisan advantage. But they emphasize that no prohibition exists, in Texas or nationally, against mid-decade redistricting and that a 2019 U.S. Supreme Court decision cleared the way for states to draw maps for partisan purposes, removing the power of federal courts to police political gerrymandering.
The new maps give Republicans a chance of winning additional districts but doesn’t guarantee victories, they add.
“The underlying goal of this plan is straightforward: improve Republican political performance,” Texas state Rep. Todd Hunter, a Republican who carried the bill in the Texas House, said during floor debate on Wednesday. He added a short time later: “According to the U.S. Supreme Court, you can use political performance, and that is what we’ve done.”
Tricky terrain
As Texas moves forward and California prepares to respond, Common Cause illustrates the tricky terrain anti-gerrymandering advocates are now navigating.
The group, headquartered in Washington, D.C., fought to enact the California Citizens Redistricting Commission in 2008. But earlier this month, Common Cause declined to condemn California’s retaliation, saying it will judge the effort by whether the maps are a proportional response to gerrymanders in other states, whether the process includes meaningful public participation, and whether the maps expire and are replaced after the 2030 census through the state’s regular redistricting process, among other criteria.
Newsom’s proposal, the Election Rigging Response Act, will ask California voters in November to temporarily set aside the state’s redistricting commission and approve the new map drawn by the legislature. The commission would resume drawing maps following the census.
Why congressional redistricting is blowing up across the US this summer

Recent polling shows widespread public opposition to gerrymandering. A YouGov poll of 1,116 Americans conducted in early August found 69% believe it should be illegal to draw districts in a way that makes it harder for members of a particular political party to elect their preferred candidates. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The number of Americans who say gerrymandering is a big problem has jumped in recent years. In the YouGov poll, 75% of respondents said it is a major problem when districts are intentionally drawn to favor one party, up from 66% in a 2022 survey.
Some California Republicans have responded to Newsom’s proposal by defending the commission system. A group of Republicans sued in state court to block the plan, but the California Supreme Court on Wednesday denied a request to temporarily halt the effort.
‘Is this bad for reform?’
While members of the public might say they favor citizen-led commissions, they may not care deeply about the issue, said David Hopkins, a political science professor at Boston College who has written on polarization in American politics. He called gerrymandering a “classic process subject” that comes off as “inside baseball” to many people.
“The legislators in states that haven’t adopted commissions clearly don’t feel any particular political pressure to do so,” Hopkins said.
Some Republicans in states weighing a mid-decade gerrymander also discount the risk of a public backlash.
In Missouri, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe may call a special session this fall to redraw the state’s map in hopes of gaining an additional GOP seat in the U.S. House. James Harris, a Missouri Republican consultant with close ties to GOP officials in the state, said he wasn’t concerned redistricting would create momentum to change the process.
Missouri voters in recent years have approved ballot measures favored by Democrats, including one in 2018 that empowered a nonpartisan demographer to draw state legislative districts, though not congressional districts. But Republicans led a successful campaign to convince voters to repeal the changes two years later.
Harris painted any new potential map as part of a national effort to help Trump — who received 58.5% of the vote in Missouri last November.
“I think the lens is wanting to make sure the president has a majority in Congress so he can actually govern for the last two years versus two years of investigations, gridlock,” Harris said.
Advocates of less partisan maps said lawmakers aren’t likely to surrender their own role in mapmaking. While some state courts may limit redistricting excesses, federal courts stopped policing partisan gerrymandering following the Supreme Court’s 2019 decision. And the high court may soon weaken the judiciary’s power to block race-based gerrymandering.
Samuel Wang, director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which supports eliminating partisan gerrymandering, said the “one good thing” about the redistricting battle is that it’s prompted voters to pay attention to an arcane and technical issue. That could be a positive in the long run, he said, “if people can keep a cool head.”
Wang has written online that any response to Texas should remain measured and proportionate. California offers Democrats the only clean option to strike back, Wang wrote. Five Democratic seats could be added by redrawing the state.
“Is this bad for reform? I mean, I’m torn,” Wang told Stateline. “Because on the other hand, Democrats have been, over the last few decades, vocal in their advocacy for voting rights in various forms and now that advocacy is in question because they find a need to fight fire with fire.”
“So I guess the way I would characterize it is if they can hold it in check and not do it in every single state and just engage in whatever they’re doing where it will make a difference,” he said, “then we might not lose all the progress that’s been made.”

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Timothy Lang, chairman of the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, and Rep. Erica Layon, the vice chair, sit during a meeting at the State House on Aug. 21, 2025. (Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)A panel of lawmakers on Thursday approved an update to the state’s child care program licensing rule after more than a year of meetings and feedback from the early care and education community.
“I personally think it’s a work of art,” said Shannon Tremblay, director of the New Hampshire Child Care Advisory Council, of the update set to go into effect Sept. 22. (The Couch Family Foundation, which funds the New Hampshire Bulletin’s early care and education reporting position, is a funder of the advisory council.)
Those close to the process said the regulations were combed over line by line through months of meetings and focus groups. The changes, they said, would make the rule a more usable document for those in the field. Providers will now have latitude to set their own policies in certain areas, and the update adds a process for an independent informal resolution to address licensing disputes.
In a document submitted to the Joint Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, the oversight body made up of House and Senate members, the Department of Health and Human Services pointed to some tweaks that may make care more accessible.
The agency said “broadening of the education and experience requirements” could bring more people into the field and increase the availability of child care. The agency also said that “[f]ewer staff will be required to have certifications in pediatric CPR and first aid,” and required yearly professional development training will go from 18 hours to 12. 
The update also reduces the current requirement of “a minimum of 40 square feet of floor space per child” to 35 square feet.
Additionally, DHHS argued families in the state would “benefit from removal of the requirement for children to have an updated record of a health assessment on file every year or 2 years.” The department also noted program staff would no longer have to complete repeat health assessments after an initial exam upon starting employment.
The rule had been pulled off the oversight panel’s consent calendar, the list of items deemed uncontroversial enough for lawmakers to vote on all at once without discussion, for what Derry Republican Rep. Erica Layon described as “vague concerns” that had been expressed to her.
But lawmakers quickly and unanimously greenlit the rule once a DHHS official explained an urgency to approve them at the August meeting so that the state would be in compliance with federal requirements by the end of September. Layon said she had been unaware of the timeline and supported the move.
“We have worked with our child care community for over a year to go line by line through the rule and to make changes,” Melissa Clement, chief of the department’s Child Care Licensing Unit, told lawmakers. 
That included working with the state’s legislatively enacted Child Care Advisory Council and more than a year of weekly meetings, she said. In July, the department hosted a public hearing that it reported as having roughly 50 attendees. 
State law requires agencies to explain how they incorporated — or didn’t incorporate — public comments into their final rules. A packet submitted to lawmakers by the department shows it made several tweaks to the rule in response to that feedback.
Jennifer Legere, who owns the Brentwood child care center A Place to Grow, said “it was nice that the child care community was involved in the rulemaking process this time.” She said that when she started this work 20 years ago, child care licensing and providers were in “two different worlds.”
“It doesn’t feel that way anymore,” Legere said. “It’s not adversarial in terms of relationship. There’s a lot of collaboration and support with one another, and I really appreciate that shift.”
While she appreciated that engagement, she said she would have liked to see one more opportunity for public review of the rule, once the department had made changes based on public comments.
She also said parts of the rule that now put the responsibility on providers to come up with their own policies in certain areas, rather than spelling out universal guidelines, would pose challenges.
For instance, when it comes to illness, the current rule provides a list of symptoms that should result in a child being sent home or denied entry into a program while exhibited. This list is removed in the updated rule. Concern was raised in public comment, but the department responded that “there are many resources readily available” on the issue.
“There will be more pressure on providers to be responsible for that,” Legere said. “That’s hard, and it provides a lack of clarity for parents, because now they’re going to say, ‘Well how did you come up with your policy, Jen? Why is your policy this?’ … I can go back and research how every single one of those, you know, policies was originally made, but it’s a little bit harder for me to have that content.”
Meanwhile, others view the shift to allowing providers to set more of their own policies as a positive one.
“There was a lot of places where child care licensing was almost micromanaging the way businesses were running,” said Marianne Barter, the departing chair of the Child Care Advisory Council who runs two child care programs, “and we were able to change the onus of the responsibility of certain policies onto the business itself.”
Lynn Ouellette, interim chair of the council, said “it makes it more individualized to how a center runs and what their philosophies are, versus the state saying we have to do this.”
Tremblay, the council’s director, said that might have been “the biggest bone of contention” in the field in regards to the regulations. Some providers want “clear-cut, black-and-white” policies, while others prefer the freedom, she said.
On the space per child change from 40 square feet to 35 square feet, Legere said that was significant and would be useful in her own operation. Though her waiting list spans hundreds, every new spot counts and impacts a family, she said.
“Anytime we can help out with these ratios in these little, tiny tweaks, I think there’s going to be a really big benefit to families in the community,” she said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0029-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-22 05:56:31.716110

(Photo by Megan Henry, Ohio Capital Journal). Ohio advocates are calling on Gov. Mike DeWine to bring home the Ohio National Guard troops recently deployed to Washington D.C. 
President Donald Trump said on Aug. 11 he would send National Guard troops to Washington D.C. to crack down on crime and Ohio is one of six states that has so far sent troops to Washington D.C. 
Secretary of the Army Daniel P. Driscoll asked DeWine on Friday to send 150 members from the Ohio National Guard to Washington D.C., and members of the Ohio National Guard left for a 30-day deployment.

“The deployment of the National Guard should be reserved for situations in which the safety of citizens and the integrity of our nation are actually at risk,” said Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer. “We are here today calling for Gov. DeWine to recall the National Guard immediately.”
Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, West Virginia, and Tennessee have also sent troops — all states with Republican governors. 
“It’s not too late for Gov. DeWine … to cancel this ill considered, legally problematic and unwarranted mission,” said former Democratic Ohio House Rep. Adam Miller. “This political theater has got to end. Our National Guard families and our soldiers deserve better.” 
Violent crime in Washington D.C., is at a thirty year low and Toledo, Dayton, and Cleveland all had a higher crime rate than Washington D.C. in 2024. 
“Ohio has traditionally helped the District of Columbia, Ohio mayors, and other states when they request assistance from the Ohio National Guard or the Ohio State Highway Patrol,” DeWine’s spokesman Dan Tierney said when asked about the deployment.
The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia has not asked for National Guard troops to be deployed, and Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser has spoken out against the deployment. 
“The worst thing you can do as any military leader is to sanction an unwarranted action,” said Miller, who is running for Ohio’s 15th Congressional District. He is also a colonel with more than 20 years of service in the U.S. Army Reserve who served as the Judge Advocate General Corps officer.
None of the 150 Ohio deployed troops are part of the Emergency Response Force package, Miller said. 
“This is a fake emergency,” Miller said. “Shame on our chain of command for not asking the questions, for not doing their independent due diligence, and for pulling our service members out of existing training and into a dangerous situation.” 
Miller praised Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, for rejecting the request to deploy National Guard troops.  
“We have to speak up when something happens that is outside the scope of our legal authorities, outside the scope of our mission,” Miller said. 
The Ohio National Guard is one of the largest in the country with around 17,000 soldiers and airmen, according to the 122nd Army National Guard Band. 
“We’re involved in multiple operations overseas,” Miller said. “We have special forces. You don’t pull people out of critical global terrorism missions for political theater. Putting soldiers and their families into a mission for which they’re not well trained is the worst thing that you can do as a military leader and the governor has got to be more willing to say no, or at least ask questions.”
Part of Trump’s crackdown on crime comes from a recent executive order that forces those experiencing homelessness off the streets. 
“With members of United States armed services, including some from our very state, descending as ordered onto Washington D.C., to sanitize and purge the city of people whose only crime is being homeless, it’s clear that a judgment has been reached,” said Rev. Jack Sullivan, Jr., executive director of the Ohio Council of Churches. “It is clear to us that the so-called homelessness and crime crisis in Washington D.C., serve only as manufactured justification for military mobilization.”
ACLU Ohio Legislative Director Gary Daniels said DeWine “has chosen to be part of the problem instead of part of the solution.”
“Requesting National Guard troops to come to another area of the country should be used only for the most extreme examples where they are truly needed and not for what we are seeing here today,” Daniels said. “What exactly is the exit strategy here?”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-08-22 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"To replace HB 5002, CT towns pitch regional approach to housing",Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/ct-hb-5002-regional-approach-housing/,A proposal from organizations that represent CT’s 169 towns eliminates measures related to zoning and focuses instead on regional planning.,"The primary organizations that represent Connecticut’s 169 municipalities have brought forward an outline for a new housing bill that eliminates previously proposed measures related to zoning and focuses instead on regional planning to address the state’s housing crisis.
The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, the Connecticut Council of Small Towns and the nine regional councils of government put together a plan to replace the Democrats’ housing omnibus bill, H.B. 5002. That proposal, obtained by The Connecticut Mirror through an open records request, is being presented to policymakers throughout the coming days.
The plan would eliminate long-debated proposals like funding measures for Work, Live, Ride, which focuses on housing near transportation hubs, a policy known as fair share and some off-street parking requirements. Some towns have argued these amount to mandates that don’t account for the individual needs of municipalities across the state.
Advocates of those measures and housing experts, however, have argued that the status quo and lack of state-level intervention has not moved the needle as much or as quickly as needed. The state lacks tens of thousands of units that are affordable and available to its lowest income renters.
H.B. 5002 was a priority of the Democratic caucuses in the House and Senate and passed toward the end of the most recent legislative session. Gov. Ned Lamont, whose staff worked with lawmakers on the bill, vetoed it in the face of mounting opposition.
Lamont said he wanted to find a way to get towns on board, and asked lawmakers to come back in a special session to pass a reworked housing bill.
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he met with the groups Thursday morning to discuss their plan.
“I’m not surprised to hear that there are things they would like to cut,”  he said. “So I didn’t really need to engage in that conversation and nor do I agree that that’s what we would do, but there are certainly changes we’re already making that they weren’t aware of in those areas.”
Lawmakers and housing advocates have been skeptical about whether it’s possible to have a meaningful bill with widespread buy-in from towns that have historically been reluctant to allow more affordable housing or multifamily housing in their neighborhoods.
The town organizations’ plan would eliminate most of the portions of the bill that housing advocates have said are the most meaningful, including the measure to end off-street parking minimums for smaller towns, the prioritization of state grants for towns that build near train and bus stations, a measure to allow conversion of commercial property to residential without a special hearing and the policy known as fair share that would require towns to plan and zone for a set number of units of housing.
Instead, their plan would require towns to work with their regional councils of government, or COGs, to assess housing needs, then set goals and make plans once every 10 years. It would also have the state offer new funding as incentives for towns to implement their plans. Supporters say this would reduce onerous burdens on towns and allow each part of the state to set goals that make sense for them.
But opponents, including housing experts, say without enforcement mechanisms it would do little to actually increase the state’s housing stock.
“It’s sort of where we are right now, just shuffling the deck and looking at the conversation from a regional standpoint rather than a municipal standpoint, but not really increasing expectations on anyone,” said John Guszkowski, co-chair of the Connecticut Chapter of the American Planning Association’s government relations committee.
Guszkowski added that working regionally and working more with the councils of government is a positive step for town planning in Connecticut, but that needs to be paired with ways to hold towns accountable.
Rojas said accountability has been a political sticking point for years.
“I don’t want to engage in this kind of business of punishing communities for not doing X or Y,” he said. “That’s not how I want to approach this. But that poses challenges.”
As originally passed, H.B. 5002 prioritized certain state infrastructure grants for towns that made changes to their zoning to allow more housing.
Matt Hart, executive director of the Capitol Region Council of Governments, said accountability is one issue the group plans to work on as they keep developing the proposal.
“This is just a suggested framework that we focus more on: how do we leverage the COGs in our relationships, where we can help, where we can convene and help lead and bring our towns together to work regionally?” Hart said.
“We haven’t come to a final solution on that, like, what’s going to compel the towns to actually do this?” said Brian O’Connor, director of public policy for the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities.
Betsy Gara, executive director of the Council of Small Towns, said regional efforts would particularly help smaller municipalities that might not have full-time planning staff. She said she wants to see regional housing needs assessments that account more for water and sewage capacity than past studies have.
“This empowers a municipality to provide input through the COG into what that housing goal should be,” she said. Under the plan, Gara added, each town would have their own goals set in partnership with the COG.
Rob Blanchard, the governor’s spokesman, said in a statement that Lamont appreciates the work the organizations put into the proposal to “meaningfully address our housing crisis.”
“One thing we have learned from that work is that local leaders need to be bought in to the solution and rather than simply opposing efforts, they are coming to the table with ideas,” Blanchard’s statement said. “The Governor remains committed to continuing to collaborate with local leaders, legislators, and advocates on improving the housing bill ahead of eventual passage.”
Rojas said he thinks the meeting with the groups was overall positive.
“There is more alignment on ultimate goals than people otherwise want to let on,” he said.

Unruffled, Moreno defended Republican policy and painted the Trump administration in glowing terms.
“He should, and probably will, end up getting the Nobel Peace Prize,” Moreno said of the president.

“Those are just facts”
In a discussion moderated by NBC News’ Henry Gomez, Moreno praised the Trump administration and its centerpiece budget legislation, The One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
The measure makes permanent large tax breaks from Trump’s first administration and adds on temporary deductions for overtime pay and tips that expire in 2028. Opponents criticize Republicans for paying for those tax cuts by rolling back safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps.
But Moreno claimed there’s no cut.
“The facts are, over the next 10 years, we will spend 20% more on Medicaid nationally than we’re spending now,” Moreno said. “Medicaid spending will be increased by 20%, that’s a fact.”
VP Vance visits Ohio to tout the Trump/Republican One Big Beautiful Bill Act

Despite insisting throughout the event that “those are just facts” and encouraging people to “look it up,” Moreno’s math is fuzzy.
Nonpartisan researchers at the Kaiser Family Foundation note CBO forecasts predict a $911 billion cut to the program and an increase of 10 million uninsured Americans. Ohio Capital Journal asked Moreno’s office about the figure but got no response.
One possibility? He could be comparing apples and oranges.
In June, the GOP-controlled, U.S. House Budget Committee put out a press release claiming the Congressional Budget Office had “set the record straight.” But the committee argued Medicaid spending would climb more than 30% — not 20%.
They arrived at that figure by comparing projected Medicaid costs in 2034 with the current ones. That, of course, ignores the likely increase in program spending if Trump’s legislation hadn’t passed.
The CBO described that comparison in the very same paragraph, stating, “CBO estimates that enacting the Medicaid provisions of H.R. 1 would reduce Medicaid spending by $125.2 billion in 2034.”
Moreno also defended the Trump administration’s approach to tariffs: “We need to make more things here in America so that we have good, high paying middle class jobs — that’s just a fact.”
And he voiced support for the idea of taking an equity stake in Intel.
“If a company is going to ask for help, if a company is going to ask for money, the taxpayer should get equity so we have the upside,” Moreno said.
“As a company becomes successful, we can sell that equity and recoup the money for the taxpayer,” he added. “To me, that’s common sense.”
Ohio’s Intel plant has been stalled for years, now Trump, Moreno, Husted are getting involved

Question and answer
Moreno answers elicited jeers throughout the discussion with Gomez. When the event turned to audience questions, it didn’t get much friendlier.
One person asked what he was doing to protect NASA following major job cuts and another sought his help with changes to the 529 education savings plan making it easier to donate left over money.
Moreno assured the first that NASA is important for national security and the city of Cleveland.
“A lot of that technology and knowledge lives here in Cleveland,” Moreno said before predicting a “big increase in funding.” He promised the other attendee he’d investigate the 529 issue and work on fitting it into upcoming legislation.
Different speakers pressed him on his support for Israel’s war in Gaza and what he’s doing to protect Ukraine from Russia’s invasion.
“This is a total problem caused by Hamas that could be fixed by Hamas, and Israel is defending itself and I support them unequivocally,” Moreno said of the war in Gaza.
As for Ukraine, Moreno said, “We cannot allow 6,000, 7,000 innocent people to die every single week. It is a terrible, terrible situation what’s happening there, and I, for one, I’m on the side of peace.”
One attendee asked about Trump’s recent flirtation with prohibiting mail-in voting. The senator argued the last time Congress proposed federal election laws, Democrats were in charge.
“We’re on the side of states’ rights, and saying, hey, states should manage that,” Moreno said. “But at the same time, it is a federal obligation to make sure those states are doing a good job.”
Notably, the Trump administration is leaning on GOP-led states to redraw maps mid-cycle to advantage the party. Among other changes, the Democratic legislation Moreno referenced would have required states to establish independent redistricting commissions.

Another attendee asked Moreno about changing his tune about the 2020 election and Jan. 6.
“What’s the truth about the 2020 election? Was it stolen, Senator?” the man asked. “And what’s the truth about Jan. 6, Senator? Were they patriots or felons?”
Moreno pointed to Hunter Biden’s laptop.
“That story was supposedly Russian misinformation, which it was clearly not, and did that alter the election? Absolutely it did,” he said.
“I get the question,” Moreno added, “was Joe Biden the legitimate president of the United States for four years. He was legitimately the worst president of the United States for four years.”
Moreno did not address Jan. 6.
Pressing the flesh?
Cleveland’s event is far from the first time Moreno has come home, but his visits have generally relied on private tours and press conferences. Critics have lobbed abuse at Moreno for failing to meet with constituents.
When Ohio Capital Journal reached out to Moreno’s office about events with voters, a spokeswoman sent a press release describing a three-day, 18-county tour promoting the One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this month.
Those visits included a dairy, a restaurant, a steel plant, and a factory. But the events weren’t widely publicized, and most appear to be made up of invited guests. Although the press release notes Moreno visited Ohio’s three most populous counties, it doesn’t mention coverage from any of the numerous news outlets in those areas.
Frustrated with their lack of access, Moreno’s critics have have taken to hosting regular protests outside his Ohio offices. They showed up outside The City Club, as well. In a statement, organizer Ellen Brown said, “he doesn’t represent all of Ohio.”
“He refuses to do a town hall with constituents of different points of view, he’s allowing the executive branch to take power from the Senate as he votes with the president 100%, and the budget bill hurts Ohioans in favor of billionaires,” Brown continued. “He’s allowing illegal deportations against immigrants and he’s an immigrant himself.”

(Submitted by Jennifer Bacani McKenney)Ask Urban Dictionary what a “sausage fest” is, and you get this back: “a party of only guys (or at least 80% guys), where there is a substantial abundance of wiener.”
Given that ribald definition, my grandmother — in fact, both of them — would shudder to know that I asked a Kansan pastor this week what she thought about a sausage fest.
Specifically, Sausage Fest 2025, which starts Saturday in Fredonia.
“I think the part that brings the community together is just to have fun watching people overfill their bellies with hot dogs or running a race around the square carrying a sausage,” said Alice Purvis, who leads the congregation at First United Methodist Church in Fredonia, a town in the southeast quadrant of Kansas with about 2,000 people. “You know, there’s just a silliness in it that I think is awesome.”
Double meanings and dad jokes are at the core of Sausage Fest. Here’s a partial rundown for 2025.
In the morning, you could jog in the 5K — but why not do the Wiener Walk instead?
The Haute Dawg contest is not in fact just for dogs. You can dress up any animal in a costume for the competition. A few years ago at Sausage Fest, you would have seen a goat strutting the stage. Lady Baba was the goat’s stage name.
Next up: The Hot Dog Eating Contest. Each year, Purvis cheers on her son Michael, who joins others on the event’s stage, a repurposed flat-bed trailer. The gathered crowd watches to see who can eat the most hot dogs in seven minutes.
“Whoever the winner is, their stomach might be really full, but they’re also pretty happy because they won,” Purvis said. “And yeah, Michael usually has to take a little while to walk around and get back to normal orientation.”
The indigestion continues during Wiener Weway at 7 p.m. For that event, contestants chug a beer, eat a hot dog and then pass a baton — in this case, it’s kielbasa — in between their running.
Before the night wraps with the Chorizo Challenge Arm Wrestling Tournament, Fredonians will watch the Mr. Hotlink Pageant. The winner will showcase a talent and deliver a speech, which usually panders to the crowd by extolling the virtues of Fredonia.
If you win one of the events, you receive $100 — plus a medal. You might see some of the reigning champions wearing their medals from last year, an organizer said. 
Hosting an event that features such silly sausage names was the brainstorm of Jennifer Bacani McKenney, a local physician and community advocate. Bacani McKenney said she was flying back from Las Vegas and sat next to a Hollywood producer who gave her the idea of creating a signature hometown event for Fredonia.
Local folks, including Bacani McKenney’s partners at her medical clinic, help organize the one-day festival of naughtily named nonsense.
“I mean, honestly, we’re not shy about anything,” Bacani McKenney said about her fellow medical staff. “We deal with penises, vaginas, everything, all day long. So we’re not shy about any of that stuff. … In the end, it ends up being a really good thing, in a very sneaky way.”
When Bacani McKenney talks to students about rural medicine, she brings up the festival — and not because the hot dog eating contest bends typical dietary advice. 
“If you’re a doctor in a small town, the things you can do outside of the exam room for your patients and your community is pretty much limitless,” Bacani McKenney said. “Be creative. Have fun. Be part of the community. Don’t be the doctor that’s just stuffy in the exam room. Make a difference in the whole community.”
Sausage Fest no longer features a best-dressed pig contest (the pigs got too angry) or wiener dog races (dachshunds are too much in demand as rentals for events). However, you can still see Hurtin’ for a Squirtin’ this year, Bacani McKenney said. 
“Oh! That’s our dirtiest one,” she said. “But not just the title, but literally also.” 
Because Bacani McKenney serves as the county’s health officer, she has access to boxes of hazmat suits from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“So we let people put those on, and they have a facemask, gloves and little booties for their feet,” Bacani McKenney said. “And then they get a ketchup and mustard bottle that’s actually filled with fingerpaint. They spray each other and have a little spray fight.” 
When it’s all done, participants pose for a photo inside a frame that says, “I was hurtin’ for a squirtin’ at Fredonia Sausage Fest.”
Cultivate Fredonia organizes the festival, which often raises $10,000 to $15,000 through food and drink sales plus sponsorships, Bacani McKenney said. The festival’s programming starts at 8 a.m. and stretches until midnight.
“What you’ll see is a town square that’s kind of booming with community people that are talking and interacting, and maybe have a beer in their hand,” Bacani McKenney said. “I think just seeing people in a small town, interacting, talking, walking around in a safe space where everybody’s having fun.”

(Getty Images.)Before the data center boom, there was the natural gas boom. Between 2008 and 2023, the last year for which we have data: 
• The natural gas industry invested over $110 billion in Ohio.
• Eight counties in Eastern Ohio (Belmont, Carroll, Columbiana, Guernsey, Harrison, Jefferson, Monroe, and Noble) went from producing negligible amounts of gas to volumes that made Ohio the nation’s eighth largest producer. 
• During this period, the eight counties’ gross domestic product, the value of all goods and services, rose 26% faster than the nation’s GDP.
But, while the gas industry boomed, a new Ohio River Valley Institute report finds that . . . 
• The number of jobs in the eight counties plunged by 10,863 or almost 11%. 
• The counties’ population declined by nearly 28,000 people or 8%. 
• The combined incomes of people who live in the eight counties grew by only two-thirds the amount of income growth nationally.
Whatever changes the natural gas industry’s massive expansion brought to Ohio, it did not bring job growth and prosperity. 
In fact, the data suggest that the gas industry is structurally incapable of meaningfully raising jobs and income regardless of how much money the industry and the state invest. 
This is not an industry state policymakers should subsidize, nor is Ohio’s experience with natural gas one they should want to repeat, although they tried. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Do you remember the seemingly endless saga of the PTT ethane cracker plant proposed for Belmont County? 
JobsOhio squandered tens of millions of taxpayer dollars in a failed effort to launch the plant. Yet, because of the project’s failure, residents of Belmont County and Ohio may have gotten off easy. 
Another equally prized ethane cracker project was completed by Shell just sixty miles away, in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. 
That project, which ostensibly commanded $14 billion of investment, produced a roughly 18-month surge in construction employment, which was promptly followed by an even greater plunge in employment that has left Beaver County with fewer jobs now than it had before the cracker project began. 
None of the anticipated downstream plastics manufacturing development ever materialized. Meanwhile, amid a succession of technical problems, pollution violations, and losses, Shell has put the facility up for sale. 
So much for the $1.6 billion in subsidies that the state of Pennsylvania squandered in its pursuit of the cracker. 
Now, Ohio policymakers have dangling tantalizingly before them another similarly shiny object — a data center boom that state leaders tell us could make Ohio a major player in the AI-driven future.
In their eyes, the prospect is sweetened by the fact that many of the state’s new data centers could be powered by Ohio natural gas — kind of a “twofer” for the obtuse who still hold the deluded belief that natural gas development is a creator of jobs and prosperity. 
The problem is that, if data centers make Ohio a major player in the digital economy, they will do it in the worst possible way. 
That’s because data centers share an important characteristic with the natural gas industry and with ethane crackers. 
They are spectacularly capital-intensive and not very labor-intensive, which means that, of all the money invested to build and operate them, and, of all the revenue they generate by providing services, astonishingly little will find its way into the economies of host communities. 
For instance, if you ask, “Where did the $100+ billion supposedly invested in Ohio by the gas industry go?” the answer is that nearly all of it went and continues to go to investors, shareholders, and service providers, few of whom live in Ohio. 
Only a little goes to the small number of local employees. 
The same is true of gas-fired power plants. The nearly 2,000 MW Guernsey Power Station, for all its immensity and hundreds of millions of dollars in annual sales, employs only about 30 people — roughly as many as an Olive Garden. 
Data centers will merely add yet another highly capital-intensive, not very labor-intensive layer to this economically inert stack of enterprises that inject little money into local economies while imposing major quality of life and cost burdens. 
That starts with electric bills, which primarily because of the mere expectation of data centers, are going up by double digits. 
Ohio needs its policymakers to recognize these industries for what they are and, far from using public resources to attract them, they must tax and regulate them in ways that guarantee they will contribute to local economies and not consign them to the fate that has befallen the state’s eight natural gas counties.

B. said he left Cameroon nine years ago because he was scared for his life. Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.
“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.
New work rules could deny food stamps to thousands of veterans

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.
 ‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.
A dozen states win approval to restrict soda, candy for SNAP recipients

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”
 ‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.
GOP cuts to food assistance would hit rural America especially hard

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Nearly 40% of election officials administering the 2024 election weren’t around in 2020.
Election officials turned over at the highest rate in at least a quarter century during the last presidential election, according to new research from the Bipartisan Policy Center.
An analysis of shifts in election officials published Tuesday found nearly 41% of election officials administering the 2024 election were different than those in 2020. Turnover has accelerated over the past two decades, rising from about 28% in 2004 to 40.9% last year.
The growing percentage of departing election officials comes after years of challenges. They navigated the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, as well as harassment and false conspiracy theories surrounding stolen elections that persist today.
The analysis released by the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group that seeks to foster policy cooperation across party lines, represents an updated version of a report that previously examined turnover from 2004 to 2022. The new research, which extends the data through 2024, shows the turnover rate continued to climb.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The change means that, over time, election officials have less experience. The research found that the share of chief local election officials with six or more years in their role has dropped from 60% in 2006 to 47% in 2024.
But last year, 60% of election officials had previously overseen the administration of a presidential election in their jurisdiction.
“Despite increasing turnover and loss of experience, the majority of chief election officials still have experience running at least one presidential election cycle,” the analysis said. “This is important because presidential elections typically see the highest turnout and are the most visible elections administered.”
The analysis found that over the long term, election official turnover rates have been rising gradually in small jurisdictions, defined as areas with fewer than 100,000 voting-age residents. But large jurisdictions have experienced a more sudden jump in turnover.
Small jurisdictions had a 27% turnover rate in 2004 that had risen to 40% in 2024. But large jurisdictions enjoyed a turnover rate as low as 31% in 2018 before climbing rapidly to nearly 46% last year.

Malcolm Ruff (D-Baltimore City) announced his intention to run for the District 41 Senate seat currently held by Sen. Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City). (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Del. Malcolm P. Ruff (D-Baltimore City) said Thursday he will seek the District 41 Senate seat next year in a rematch, of sorts, against Sen. Dalya Attar (D-Baltimore City).
The two squared off in January when both were in the House and looking to fill the seat vacated by then-Sen. Jill P. Carter (D), who resigned after being nominated by Gov. Wes Moore (D) to serve on the State Board of Contract Appeals. The Baltimore City Democratic Central Committee ended up choosing Attar on a 5-3 vote.
With Moore’s confirmation of her nomination, Attar became the first Orthodox Jewish woman to serve in the Senate. Attar, who previously worked as an assistant state’s attorney in the city, was elected to the House in 2018 and reelected in 2022. Ruff, who is also an attorney, was tapped for his House seat in 2023 by Moore, after the central committee deadlocked 4-4 on candidates to fill another vacancy and sent two names for the governor to choose from.
But Ruff told a crowd of a couple hundred people at a rally-like event Thursday at Gwynn Falls/Leakin Park that he has proven himself since taking office as “a legislator who delivers for my district. I have the trust and support of the people who know me and who have seen my work and who believe in the future that we can build together.”
The crowd included Carter, the former senator, who introduced Ruff to speak,. Others who took the microphone included Dayvon Love, public policy director with Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, and a member of the central committee who supported Ruff in January; City Council Vice President Sharon Green Middleton; and Evan Serpick with Jews United for Justice.
It also included prominent Baltimore attorney William H. “Billy” Murphy Jr., whose firm employs Ruff as a trial attorney. “We only hire the best. We don’t hire punks. If you’re a punk, go someplace else,” Murphy said to several chuckles in the crowd.
Besides Attar and Ruff, the rest of the District 41 delegation includes the legislature’s longest-serving member in Del. Samuel I. “Sandy” Rosenberg, who was first elected in 1982, and the General Assembly’s newest member in Del. Sean Stinnett, who was sworn in to replace Attar in March. All are Democrats.


In a nearby part of the city…
At the same time as Ruff’s event, Crystal Jackson Parker announced to her supporters Thursday she plans to seek a House seat from neighboring District 40.

Jackson Parker, 58, served on the city’s Democratic Central Committee between 2018 to 2022. She ran unsuccessful for the House in 2022, finishing sixth among eight candidates who were seeking three nominations in the Democratic primary that year.
The current delegates representing that district, all Democrats, are Marlon Amprey, Frank Conaway Jr. and Melissa Wells.
Jackson Parker is the founder of the North Avenue and Hilton Street Business and Community Task Force. Last year, it was awarded a $250,000 grant as part of the Mayor’s Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement’s neighborhood policing plan. The native Baltimorean was the first person in her immediate family to graduate high school and went on to get an undergraduate degree from Cornell University and law degree from the University of Baltimore.
Part of her campaign platform includes investing in youth programs, expanding early childhood education and supporting small businesses and older adults. She summarized part of her life story on her website, as a 9-year-old diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease that attacks the kidneys.
“Doctors told me I wouldn’t live past the age of 25. They told me I’d face a lifetime of pain, kidney failure and experimental treatments,” she wrote. “My story isn’t just about survival; it’s about service. I’ve dedicated my life to Baltimore because I know what it’s like to struggle, and I know what it takes to overcome.”


Hale dismisses Hershey criticism: ‘I don’t even know him.’
Maryland’s newly minted Republican gubernatorial candidate may know business but he doesn’t know many of the players in his new party.
Ed Hale, who announced Wednesday he would switch parties and seek the GOP nomination for governor, dismissed criticism from Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr (R-Upper Shore), who characterized Hale as a political opportunist who is not anchored in Republican values.

Hale, who is only declared but not formally filed, pooh-poohed Hershey and his criticism, saying in an interview on WBAL radio he’s more of a Republican than Hershey.
“I don’t even know him,” said Hale.
The Baltimore businessman, who until Wednesday was a lifelong Democra,t said meeting payroll, hiring employees and adhering “with all the different things I built in my life” made him more of a Republican than Hershey.
Hale announced he would switch parties to run for governor citing his own campaign polling he said showed Moore would be difficult to beat in a primary. The announcement drew a swift critique from Hershey, who questioned Hale’s motives and characterized him as a political opportunist in a statement sent to reporters Wednesday. Hale on Thursday described the statement sent to reporters as “a nasty-gram.”
Hale, in the Thursday morning interview, dismissed Hershey and his criticism.
“And I don’t even care about that guy,” Hale said. “I really don’t. When asked about him, I don’t care.”
Coming together for Western Maryland
Who says bipartisanship is dead?
Well, pretty much everyone, to be honest, but there was a rare example of it out of Washington this week.
That’s when all 10 members of Maryland’s congressional delegation — the nine Democrats and the sole Republican member, 1st District Rep. Andy Harris — put their signatures on a letter to President Donald Trump (R), urging him to declare a federal disaster in Allegany and Washington counties in the wake of severe flooding there in May.
Cost of Western Maryland flood damage more than doubles; state to appeal FEMA aid denial

“Extreme rainfall” from May 12 to 14 in Western Maryland inundated parts of Allegany and Garrett counties, pushing George’s Creek surged to more than 12 feet above major flood stage, while Wills Creek in Cumberland rose 8 feet and the Potomac River also flooded. Midland, Lonaconing and Westernport were among the hardest-hit communities, with floodwaters inundating homes, schools and businesses, washing out roads and damaging pipelines.
The state identified $17.9 million in damages it said qualified for federal relief, but the Federal Emergency Management Agency last month denied the state’s request without explanation. Gov. Wes Moore (D) vowed an appeal which came this week, when he wrote Trump to say the eligible damages now stand at $33.7 million, “nearly triple” the threshhold that would typically qualify the state for federal assistance.
The congressional letter cited Moore’s latest letter, saying the damages “clearly met disaster assistance criteria” established by FEMA. Relief is “necessary and warranted” said the lawmakers, who urged the president to approve a declaration.
“As the new school year begins and winter approaches, we echo the Governor’s concerns that without the requested assistance, the most vulnerable in these communities will be directly impacted,” the lawmaker’s letter said. “These assessments support the need for the requested declaration and assistance…. We urge you to expeditiously review and approve Maryland’s appeal and grant a major disaster declaration for the flooding of May 13, 2025.”
New fiscal year, new faces for pension board
The Maryland State Retirement and Pension System Board of Trustees welcomed three new trustees last week along with a new public adviser to the Investment Committee, as part of what the board touted in a press release as “a refreshed governance structure as of the start of the fiscal year.”
Trustees Vernon A. Reid Jr. and Scott Nicewarner began their terms on July 1, along with Public Advisor Joanna Pratt. Trustee Vickrant Puri began his term on Aug. 1. All were formally welcomed at the Aug. 19 meeting of the board.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“With these appointments, the Board benefits from a rich blend of expertise spanning public service, education, finance and investment management,” System Executive Director Martin Noven said in a prepared statement. “Each new trustee and advisor brings valuable experience that will strengthen our stewardship of the retirement system on behalf of Maryland’s public employees and retirees.”
Puri, a Baltimore County Public Schools personal finance teacher, has prior banking industry expertise and was elected by active and retired members of the Teachers’ Systems. He joins the Investment Committee and the Corporate Governance and Securities Litigation Committee, and his term runs through July 31, 2029.
Reid and Nicewarner both gubernatorial appointees and both serve until June 30, 2029. Reid is retired after decades with T. Rowe Price and will serve on the Administrative Committee. Nicewarner is the Hagerstown city administrator,, and will join the Audit and Administrative committees.
Pratt’s appointment follows the departure of Michael K. Barry. She has more than 20 years of experience managing endowments and foundations, and will provide independent independent expertise managing large investment.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderWhen Georgia Congressman Mike Collins kicked off his 2026 campaign for U.S. Senate this week, many in the  crowd wore shirts emblazoned with stickers featuring his red, white and blue big rig-inspired logo.
More than a few at the rally on Tuesday also wore a rarer adornment: the glossy name tags worn by members of Georgia’s Legislature.
Now weeks into the Jackson Republican’s plan  to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, Collin’s campaign is touting endorsements from 40 GOP state senators and representatives.

That might not be surprising except for the presence of two other high-profile candidates in the Republican primary, including one with the backing of Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. The governor was in contact with President Donald Trump to discuss choosing a candidate they could both agree on, though Trump has yet to make an endorsement.
Former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, son of legendary University of Georgia football coach Vince Dooley, entered the race at the start of the month with Kemp’s backing, joining Collins and U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter.
Lawmakers at the Collins event expressed personal and political  reasons for their support. Many know him personally or knew his father, the late former U.S. Rep. Mac Collins, who served in Congress from 1993 to 2005.
“​​This is probably easiest for me because I live five minutes from Mike,” said state Rep. Clint Crowe, a Republican from Jackson. “This is my hometown. I’ve grown up here. I went to high school with his sister. I go to church with him and his parents. I’ve been friends with the family for most of my life, and so I know Mike and I know who he is and I know where he comes from, so it’s a very easy decision for me to make to support him.”
Others cited the Laken Riley Act, which Collins sponsored and Trump signed into federal law. It expands the government’s power to detain non-citizens, including for non-violent or property crimes. Riley was a 22-year-old student who was murdered last year at the University of Georgia campus in Collins’ district. A Venezuelan man who had entered the U.S. illegally was convicted of her killing and sentenced to life in prison without a chance for parole.
None of the legislators said they had faced pressure from Kemp’s office to support Dooley or not back Collins.
“I haven’t had anybody reach out from Mr. Dooley’s team or from the governor’s office, so I would hope that they would understand my position. If they don’t, my position is not going to change,” Crowe said.
Still a three-man race
Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson downplayed the significance of the legislator endorsements in the contest that is still more than eight months away.

Collins’ popularity under the Gold Dome speaks to his political skill and connections, but it’s still early, said Robinson, who is not working with any of the candidates in the race, and even popular politicians can find it difficult to transfer their political capital to another candidate.
Still, Collins is in a good spot, at least at the moment, he added.
“I think Mike Collins is certainly in the pole position, you would have to assume,” he said. “There was a poll out last week that showed him up slightly over Buddy and both about 20 points ahead of Derek Dooley.”
Carter has connections of his own and enough personal wealth to put up a fight, Robinson said, and he’s not counting Dooley out either, especially with the governor’s support — and his financial backing.
“They’re putting some resources into it and providing air cover while Derek builds out his operation, builds out his why for the campaign — why him — and as he fundraises and as he gets around the state to meet people. You can’t do everything at once, and having Kemp spend money on his behalf while he’s doing all that other stuff is hugely important.”
Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie said Dooley’s “legendary” last name could offer a leg up, and she drew parallels to another recent Republican candidate with ties to football.
  Supporters of Congressman Mike Collins gathered at the Rivers Ranch in Butts County for barbecue and stump speeches. The house was packed tight with a handful of people listening in from a covered patio. The venue website lists the maximum occupancy at 275, but organizers estimated more than 400 people attended. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder.
“I look at the Dooley candidacy as trying to do a better version of Herschel Walker, appeal to primary voters who might be drawn by the name and by their affinity for Georgia football – but hopefully somebody who, you know, has accounted for all of his children and doesn’t make weird comments on the campaign trail.”
Walker, a former UGA and NFL football legend, challenged Democratic U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock in 2022 but fell short in a runoff after a campaign plagued with scandals including acknowledging children he had previously not talked about and allegations of pressuring women he had been in relationships with to get abortions.
During that primary, Trump who was sore at the governor for not backing his false claims of election rigging in 2020. But with a few exceptions, Trump-backed candidates bombed in Georgia in the 2022 primaries.
The Trump effect
Trump’s endorsement may not have been enough for Walker to become a U.S. Senator, but the Republicans vying for Ossoff’s seat are working hard to get the POTUS tap.
Carter went so far as to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, but he’s not likely to get a senate nomination in return, Robinson said.
  President Donald Trump speaks at a rally in Zebulon Oct. 2024. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
“Obviously we can assume that Trump is not interested in endorsing Buddy Carter by the fact that Buddy was already in the race when Kemp and Trump were in conversations, and Trump could have said then, ‘I’ll be with Buddy,’ but he didn’t.”
Trump has endorsed Lt. Gov. Burt Jones in his bid for the governor’s mansion, but he’s stayed mum on which Republican he thinks should be  Georgia’s junior senator.
Gillespie said she expects Trump to keep quiet for the time being.
“What I suspect is Trump is going to sit this race out until it’s clear who Republicans want in the state, and then he will just ratify sort of like whoever the frontrunner is by endorsing them, because that’s how he tends to do it,” she said.
Robinson predicts Trump will eventually go with Collins, setting up a new “off again” phase in Trump and Kemp’s on-and-off again relationship.
“It would be my assumption that Trump will endorse Mike Collins at some juncture,” Robinson said. “And you’ll have this proxy war between Kemp and Trump to some degree, if that develops, because Kemp is openly supporting Derek Dooley. The Kemp people feel confident that the Kemp endorsement is influential just like the Trump endorsement is.”

Facing growing pressure from advocacy groups, lawsuits, and climate projections that show hotter days ahead, some state prison systems are moving to install air conditioning and expand cooling measures — although many facilities remain years away from significant upgrades.
But in other states, such efforts have stalled or failed. That may lead to more lawsuits in the future, experts say, even as judges may raise the bar for such cases.
An emphasis on being “tough on crime” and prioritizing other public safety measures may have contributed to less attention on prison conditions in some states. In others, slowing revenue growth and pressure to rein in corrections spending could be making new investments a harder sell.
At least two states this year, Virginia and Texas, considered legislation addressing excessive heat in prisons but neither measure became law. The Texas bill would have required the state Department of Criminal Justice to purchase and install climate control systems in all of its facilities by the end of 2032. About two-thirds of the state’s correctional facilities have only partial or no air conditioning.
The measure passed the House but did not advance in the Senate before the legislature adjourned in June.
In Virginia, lawmakers approved a bill that would have required the state corrections department to install heat and air conditioning in its prisons and to ensure cell temperatures not exceed 80 degrees. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, citing the cost of installation and operational burdens. Youngkin wrote that existing state corrections data “does not substantiate the claims of extreme temperatures or health risks.”
But in Delaware, the fiscal year 2026 capital budget approved last month includes $2 million in funding to install air conditioning at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center.
In Florida, legislation to require cooling in prisons over the years have gone nowhere. For example, an inmate bill of rights introduced ahead of the regular legislative session died in the House Criminal Justice Subcommittee without ever going to a vote. A 2023 consultant report estimated it would cost $582 million to install air conditioning in all of Florida’s correctional facilities.
These changes elsewhere mark the latest actions in a long-running debate over how correctional systems respond to rising summer temperatures — an issue that affects both incarcerated people and staff. Some of the policy debates and facility updates this year follow years of advocacy and litigation over the health, safety and operational challenges posed by heat in correctional settings.
Persistent problem
The problem of excessive heat in prisons has persisted for decades and has unfolded alongside other challenges, including chronic understaffing and overcrowding. In some cases, these problems have led to extended facility lockdowns, even during the summer months.
“There are people working in prisons and they have the right to work in climates that are comfortable,” said Nancy La Vigne, a criminal justice researcher and dean of the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University. “When they’re not, there’s retention issues, and it’s hard to replace staff. And when you don’t replace staff, then you have challenges in maintaining the safety and security of the facility.”
In New York, for example, correctional officers staged a three-week strike earlier this year and many didn’t return to work. Some facilities now are operating with 30%-60% fewer guards than needed, resulting in some incarcerated people getting only an hour or two outside of their cells each day.
A 2023 study published in the peer-reviewed PLOS One journal found that mortality in state and private prisons rose during periods of extreme heat, with deaths increasing 3.5% on extreme heat days and up to 7.4% during three-day heat waves. Between 2001 and 2019, nearly 13,000 people died in prison during the summer months, almost half of them in the South, although the study did not determine how many of those deaths were directly attributable to heat.
Climate change is fueling longer, more intense periods of extreme heat. Exposure to extreme heat can worsen conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and asthma, and has also been linked to worsening mental health and higher suicide rates among incarcerated people.
“Average temperatures are rising, and you’re going to have more and more states around the country where incarcerated people are held in conditions that are not livable because they’re too hot,” said Sharon Dolovich, a law professor and director of the Prison Law and Policy Program at the University of California, Los Angeles.
 Some upgrades

At least 44 states lack universal air conditioning within their prison facilities, even in regions known for sweltering summer temperatures, according to a 2022 USA Today analysis. A recent Reuters investigation found that nearly half of state prisons across 29 states have partial or no air conditioning in housing units.
But some states are investing millions to update their prison facilities.
In North Carolina, corrections officials are working toward their goal of installing air conditioning in all 54 state prisons by 2026. To date, 33 facilities are fully air-conditioned, 17 are partially air-conditioned, and four have no air conditioning, according to its dashboard.
In California, the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, which operates 31 adult prisons, has spent $246 million in the past five years on cooling improvements at five prisons, according to a department spokesperson.
Lawmakers this year also approved funding for the Air Cooling Pilot Program at three facilities, with $17.6 million allocated for fiscal years 2025-26 and $20 million for fiscal years 2026-27. It will evaluate the effectiveness of two alternatives prior to a statewide plan to address high indoor temperatures across the California prison system.
The Texas Department of Criminal Justice, as of Aug. 1, is building 12,827 “cool beds,” or prison cells in air-conditioned units, and is in the process of procuring an additional 7,162, according to its dashboard.
Texas is one of the states most closely associated with heat-related deaths in prison. A 2022 study estimated that, on average, 14 deaths per year in Texas prisons are associated with heat. And a Texas Tribune analysis found that at least 41 incarcerated people died during a record-breaking heat wave in 2023.
In March, a federal judge ruled the extreme heat in Texas prisons is “plainly unconstitutional,” but declined to order immediate air conditioning, saying the work could not be completed within the court order’s 90-day window and temporary systems might delay a permanent fix.
 ‘More miserable’

Sweltering summer heat can turn prisons into pressure cookers. People inside already may have health conditions, limited access to cooling, or take medications that make it harder for their bodies to handle the heat. And research suggests that high temperatures can heighten irritability and aggression, sometimes fueling more conflicts between incarcerated people or with staff.
“It makes you more miserable. … If you to the point of even thinking about suicide, that’s just going to add to it,” said Ronald McKeithen, who spent 37 years incarcerated in Alabama prisons and is now director of second chances at the Alabama Appleseed Center for Law and Justice. McKeithen recalls feeling “on edge” due to tension among other incarcerated people on hot days.
At the Oshkosh Correctional Institution in Wisconsin, Devin Skrzypchak said the heat worsens his bladder condition, and he often can’t get the incontinence briefs he needs. The heat forces him to drink more water, and on days when ice isn’t available, he’s left drenched in sweat.
“At times, it’s a living hell. … It can be very excruciating,” Skrzypchak wrote in a message to Stateline through the facility’s messaging platform.
D’Angelo Lee Komanekin — who has spent about 25 years in and out of different Wisconsin corrections facilities — said prison architecture plays a major role in why temperatures inside climb so high.
“The planet is getting hotter and hotter,” said Komanekin, who relies on a small plastic fan to stay cool. Komanekin also is incarcerated at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution. “They’re doing nothing about the architecture. Some institutions’ windows open, some don’t, but most of the doors have steel doors with trap doors.”
Older prison designs that rely heavily on steel and concrete building materials often trap heat, making it difficult to keep temperatures down in the summer. Aging facilities are less likely to be equipped for the installation of central air conditioning.
Some state prison systems, including Alabama’s and Wisconsin’s, are adding air-conditioning or air-tempering systems to new prison construction and major renovation projects.
 Future legal battles

Legal experts say the issue of excessive heat in prisons is likely to become more pressing as climate change drives longer and hotter summers.
Extreme heat in correctional facilities has already been the subject of litigation in dozens of states, with plaintiffs arguing that high temperatures constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. Court rulings in these cases have varied, but some experts say even more lawsuits are likely if facilities do not adapt.
“The conditions are going to worsen. [Incarcerated people are] going to be looking for every possible avenue for assistance they can,” Dolovich, the UCLA law professor, told Stateline.
One of the latest cases comes from Missouri, where the nonprofit law firm MacArthur Justice Center filed a class action in May on behalf of six incarcerated people at Algoa Correctional Center.
The lawsuit alleges the conditions violate their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. It seeks to require the Missouri Department of Corrections to work with experts to develop a heat mitigation plan that keeps housing unit temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees. If the department cannot meet that standard, the plaintiffs are asking for the release of three of the incarcerated people who have less than a year remaining on their sentences.
Lawsuits such as the Missouri case often focus on claims that extreme heat worsens existing medical problems. To proceed, they must meet two legal requirements: proving the heat poses a serious health or safety risk, and showing prison officials knew about the danger but failed to address it, according to Dolovich, whose work has focused on the Eighth Amendment and prison conditions.
Courts may also raise the bar for proving such claims if judges echo decisions in cases with similar Eight Amendment arguments related to the death penalty and homelessness, Dolovich said. Judges have shifted, she said, toward a “superadding terror, pain and disgrace” standard under the Eighth Amendment — a higher threshold requiring proof that conditions were created with the intent to cause unnecessary suffering.
Dolovich added that some recent court decisions have provided only narrow remedies, such as ordering ice and fans instead of installing air conditioning.
“Prison officials have a moral and a constitutional responsibility to respond to changing conditions. In this case, it means air conditioning. … Anything less than that, to me, is indefensible.” she said.

Salcedo,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/08/22/americas-dirty-war-just-say-no/,"The parallels between Argentina's ""Dirty War"" and the one ongoing in the United States could not be more clear.","I don’t know about you, but I believe our second American Civil War already started.  It’s a so-called soft, and to date, generally a bloodless war — only about 150 years since the truly bloody first American Civil War of 1861-1865 ended.
To win his second term, Donald Trump promised to end of the Ukraine War on Day One, to lower grocery and gas prices right away, to stop inflation and to carry out retribution.  Now, the picture is more clear, more cruel, more likely than not that we are racing towards a complete destruction of the rule of law and the U.S. Constitution.
Opposition political parties, the free press and vocal community leaders have not been rounded up under mass arrest — yet.  It may be around the corner. I’m hoping not.  But already, highly qualified and capable women and minority top military leaders were the first to go.  The retribution will keep ratcheting up.
Today I don’t want to expound on predictions about the downward spiral and probable end of the Great American experiment in democracy, one that has lasted almost 250 years as the global standard.  I see that we have almost completely lost the checks and balances of our form of government. It is barely limping toward its semi- quincentennial birthday unless that trajectory is stopped and reversed by a people power –People United Revolt (again, hopefully peaceful and bloodless) to restore an open and fair democracy once again by all, of all and for all.
Today I prefer to focus on the little guys like me and on my reaction to a news article I read recently. It was about ICE offering new recruits –projected to be about 80,000 strong — a $50,000 signing bonus and possible six-figure salary plus a college loan forgiveness package. These are things not offered to other Americans who do the most important work in our society for our collective safety and prosperity like first responders, nurses, teachers, caretakers of our sick and elderly, and many others.  These professions can expect salary cuts, layoffs and zero federal support as they toil daily for the common weal of our nation.
In 1989 I was a 33-year-old mid-grade U.S. Naval Reserve Intelligence Officer serving my obligatory “weekend warrior” two-weeks of active duty annual tour in Argentina’s major naval base in Puerto Belgrano.  One morning, as I rushed out of the officer’s club front door where I was billeted, I almost brushed elbows with an Argentine naval officer who the U.S. Embassy driver waiting for me outside identified as the “Blond Angel of Death.”
Who?
Alfredo Astiz is not a household name in the United States, but in Argentina he is the famed, handsome, blond Navy Special Forces officer who led heroically and gloriously the capture of the South Georgia Island from the British setting the stage for the Falklands/Malvinas War of 1982.

Former Argentina’s navy captain Alfredo Astiz, known as the “Blonde Angel of Death,”who was sentenced to life in prison for torture, murder and human rights abuses in October 2011, attends a new trial, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Nov. 28, 2012.  Credit: AP Photo/Eduardo Di Baia
Today his story is on the internet.  Astiz, now 74, has been languishing in jail for extra-judicial crimes he and his comrades-in-arms committed in their blind fervor to “save Argentina,” then under military rule.  It would take almost 35 years of Argentine national anguish and debate — and international judicial wrangling –to finally bring Astiz and his cohorts to justice for their illegal and criminal acts committed under the guise of “saving our country.”
The parallels today could not be clearer from across the United States of America. There are daily reports on audio and video recordings and victims’/witnesses’ statements about the extra-judicial abuses by unidentified, combat-ready armed, masked personnel who claim to have some vague legal authority from even more questionable government or para-governmental agencies. It will happen one day — maybe not next year, not in five, 10, 20 or 30 years — but it will happen that these horrific stories of human rights abuses and deliberate violations of current laws will be pieced together. They will unmask who the perpetrators are and what they did, what laws they violated in their blind belief in leaders who will not be there to support them for their careless, illegal and inhumane actions during this current, amorphous mission to  “keep America safe.”
Like Alfredo Astiz, they will be left to fend for themselves.  Like Argentina then, the United States now is struggling with itself.  Like Argentina in 1976, we may even lose our democracy, but it will be back — like Argentina did, fighting valiantly, for 35 years under great pain, to restore its democracy.  
If they are 22, 32 or 42 now, the potential new ICE recruits will be only 57, 67 or 77 in 2060.  Want an unprecedented, irresistible $50,000 signing bonus, potential six-figure salary, loan forgiveness plan just to fight America’s very open, clumsy, notorious, not-so-secret Dirty War? 
I would resist. And just say no.

Alaska’s current subsistence fishing program can continue without changes, according to a Wednesday opinion by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The ruling allows the federal government to continue offering preferential fishing rights to rural Alaskans — mostly Alaska Natives — who live a subsistence lifestyle. 
That preference exists only in public waters under federal control, not in state waters, because federal law requires the preference but the Alaska Constitution forbids state officials from implementing it. 
In their 40-page opinion, the judges said that recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings do not mandate a change in the way the state and federal governments split management of fish and game in Alaska.
Alaska Attorney General Treg Taylor said in an emailed statement that he was disappointed but not surprised by the appeals court’s decision and implied that the issue will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Attorneys representing the state of Alaska had argued that new Supreme Court precedents — in particular, a 2019 case involving an Alaska man and his hovercraft — mean that the state alone has the power to manage subsistence fishing in Alaska’s navigable waters.
In 2021, attempting to implement that belief, the state issued fishing orders on the Kuskokwim River that contradicted the instructions of federal managers. The federal government sued the state the following year, and Alaska Native groups, including the Alaska Federation of Natives, sided with the federal government. Last year, U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason ruled in the federal government’s favor, but the state appealed to the 9th Circuit.
A ruling in the state’s favor would have ended the so-called Katie John system, named after an Alaska Native woman who served as the lead plaintiff in three key court decisions that define how Alaska fish and game are managed today.
“Although Katie John, the Ahtna woman who advocated for subsistence fishing rights on behalf of Alaska Natives, has since passed away, the precedent that bears her name lives on,” wrote Judge Consuelo Callahan, a George W. Bush appointee, on behalf of the three-judge panel.
At the core of the issue is whether the federal government or the state of Alaska have authority to regulate fishing in navigable waters that flow through federal parks, preserves and reserves.
In 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could not prevent a man named John Sturgeon from using his hovercraft on the Nation River, located within the Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve, because the river didn’t count as “public land” under the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.
At the time, the court said in a footnote to that decision that the Katie John decisions, which settled subsistence management, were “not at issue in this case, and we therefore do not disturb the Ninth Circuit’s holdings that the Park Service may regulate subsistence fishing on navigable waters.” 
Sturgeon himself told the Anchorage Daily News that he was glad that his case didn’t touch on Katie John. 
But within two years, the state was preparing to take unilateral control over subsistence fishing on rural rivers within parks and preserves, and in particular the Kuskokwim River, where federal fisheries managers had restricted fishing due to low returns.
They imposed fishing limitations. The state didn’t. That mattered because under the state’s rules, anyone in Alaska has subsistence fishing rights. An Alaska resident who flies from Anchorage to Bethel to fish has the same right to fish as someone who lives in Bethel. Under the federal system, the person in Bethel has priority.
Alaska Native groups were alarmed. After the federal government filed suit, the Kuskokwim River Intertribal Fish Commission intervened on the side of the federal government, as did the Association of Village Council Presidents, which represents tribal governments throughout Southwest Alaska.
Ahtna Inc., the regional Native Corp. in the eastern Interior, also intervened even though it had no direct connection to the Kuskokwim River fishery. Instead, it feared broader implications across the state.
So too did the Alaska Federation of Natives, which joined the case later.
Nathaniel Amdur-Clark, who represented the intertribal fish commission, called Wednesday’s opinion “a really big win for tribes and for Alaska Native people” because the federal government can offer the rural subsistence preference and because the federal government has traditionally managed fisheries with extensive tribal input.
The Alaska Constitution requires “maximum sustained yield” for fisheries, and Amdur-Clark said that tends to favor commercial and recreational fishermen, not subsistence users.
“Continuing federal management is akin to — or also includes — continuing tribal management, and that’s a really good thing,” Amdur-Clark said.
While the lawsuit only involved navigable waters, Amdur-Clark said that’s where the majority of subsistence fishing takes place.  
Erin Dougherty Lynch, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, represented the Association of Village Council Presidents and some other plaintiffs.
She said it’s important to see the case as part of a broader trend with the state, which has also sought to curtail subsistence hunting management by the federal government. 
“This case is situated within their statehood defense project. It’s a series of cases they’ve intentionally brought to push back against the federal government,” she said.
Among the attorneys representing the state is John Michael Connolly of Consovoy McCarthy, a national firm hired by the state at high cost for its expertise at the U.S. Supreme Court.
Scott Kendall, an attorney representing the Alaska Federation of Natives, said that he hasn’t heard anything from the state directly, “but we have every reason to believe they intend to take this on (to the Supreme Court). I think the state should probably let it be, because it’s been this way for decades. People are relatively satisfied, and that’s been the law of the land, but we won’t be surprised if the state continues.”
Taylor, the attorney general, is resigning on Aug. 29 and is expected to announce a run for governor in the near future. 
About the case, he said by email, “Although the 9th Circuit clearly recognized that prior case law is inconsistent with the recent Supreme Court case, it was unwilling to do the hard work of actually overturning its own case law and properly reconciling the meaning of ‘public lands’ in ANILCA. This continues the unworkable dual management approach to our fisheries to the detriment of sustainable management of our fisheries for all rural subsistence users. The fish don’t adhere to borders, and our fisheries management shouldn’t either. I am disappointed but not surprised. We always knew this case would need to be decided at the highest level.”

The post Western Wyoming fire explodes to 600 acres, closing Green River Lakes Road and prompting evacuations appeared first on WyoFile .","A fast-moving wildfire along the Bridger-Teton National Forest road to Green River Lakes exploded to 600 acres in about four hours Thursday, closing the road and forcing the evacuation of campers in the area.
First reported at 2:16 p.m. Thursday, the Dollar Lake Fire quickly sent up a thick column of smoke. Sublette County emergency managers issued an emergency notice within an hour of the fire’s detection.
“If you are in the area please evacuate immediately,” the notice read.
“I just see a whole slew of vehicles coming down the road — campers with canoes, bicycles.” Mark Domek
Dollar Lake is about eight miles north of the community of Kendall. The evacuation notice appears aimed at campers.
Dollar Lake is at the northernmost end of the Wind River Mountains along a 25-mile dirt and gravel road that follows the Green River through the national forest. The road is a popular camping and recreation site. Officials placed restrictions on campfires in the area on Aug. 12.
Near Kendall, resident Mark Domek could see the smoke and a stream of traffic leaving the national forest.
“I just see a whole slew of vehicles coming down the road,” he said, “campers with canoes, bicycles.” Emergency responders at the road closure told him Green River Lakes campground was being evacuated, Domek said.
“It’s putting up quite a bit of black smoke,” he said. “When the smoke’s that black it’s definitely eating some timber up, from my experience of fighting fires years ago.”

Sublette County Emergency Management estimated the acreage just before 6 p.m. Thursday. “Resources are engaged on the Dollar Lake Fire,” fire managers said. They rate the fire danger for the region as “very high.”
Teton Interagency Fire defines that rating as an environment in which fires “start very easily and spread at a very fast rate.” The multi-agency group says fires can start from all causes, can spread rapidly and intensify quickly.
“Fires burning in heavy fuels may quickly develop high-intensity characteristics, such as long-distance spotting and fire whirlwinds,” according to the definition. “Direct attack at the head of such fires is rarely possible after they have been burning more than a few minutes.”
Restrictions on fires in the region prohibit lighting, building, maintaining, attending or using a fire, including charcoal fires. An exception allows fires in permanent metal or concrete fire pits or grates that the Forest Service has constructed and maintained at developed recreation sites. Camping stoves that can be turned off are allowed, with some restrictions.
Domek, a self-employed logger and sawmill operator, said he’s ready should the fire spread.
“I’ve got a pump all ready to go and a dozer to protect my neighbors,” he said.

Part One described the emergency effort to rescue Washington state’s last population of Snake River spring and summer Chinook salmon, in the Tucannon River. Part Two explored salmon and steelhead extinction threshold science, showing the Pacific Northwest is entering extinction momentum that will be very difficult to escape.
For Northwest salmon people, grim news and hope seem always intermingled. My previous article held grim news – extinction science, and extinction in motion in the Grande Ronde River. In Part Three, I wish to give the Grande Ronde’s hope its due.

Everyone I spoke with in northeast Oregon, native and non-, raised, and praised, the systematic river and watershed restoration underway in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha since the mid-1990s. More such work has been completed, and is underway, in the Grande Ronde/Imnaha than any other salmon landscape in the Snake River Basin.
The good done reaches well beyond healthier streams.
Tribal restoration projects are many and often large
“All of it is a big source of hope for me,” Bobby Fossek says. “My own project is what I’d call small scale, but I see the connections right up to the biggest ones. At Bird Track Springs, for example, the whole atmosphere of the place is charged now. I can see and feel it, and it’s just beginning.”
Bird Track Springs is the site of a completed project that is now completing itself in the river, restoring sinuosity, vital winter and summer habitat, and freer passage to a pinched and degraded 1.9 mile section of the Upper Grande Ronde River. The Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) sponsored and led the work, with nine co-sponsors, including the cooperating landowner, Jordan Creek Ranch. The cost was $2.5 million.
Bird Track Springs is on Highway 244, just a few miles off the freeway at the Hilgard exit above La Grande. It is signed. The Tribes’ scene-setting and description, on the short walk to the river and an overlook, is very good, with tribal, historical, and river/salmon context in map, image, art and word.
“I’ve seen the project; it looks good,” John Appleton told me. “It’s going to create cooler water and deeper pools.”
With so few salmon in the Upper Grande Ronde now, no hatchery nearby, and little fishing pressure, Appleton says the upper river could almost be called an informal salmon sanctuary for the few salmon that still manage to get there.
The Confederated Umatilla Tribes lead many other restoration projects in the Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek. Rick George calls the Tribes’ McCoy Creek project “a phenomenal success.”
The Tribes also acquired the Southern Cross Ranch, three miles southeast of Union, on ¾-mile of Catherine Creek with 68 acres of historic floodplain.  It is now being restored for channel function, sinuosity, riparian health, floodplain connectivity, and the benefit of Three First Foods – water, salmon and deer.

In Wallowa Country and the Imnaha, the Nez Perce Tribe leads on similar projects. Emmit Taylor Jr., director of the Nez Perce Tribe’s Department of Fisheries’ Resources’ Watershed Division, offered a quick list.
“There’s the Wallowa River work at Tamkaliks, where we put in side channels and revegetated,” he said. “There’s a half-mile project on the Lostine River, at the town of Lostine. It was straight and constrained, most of the habitat gone. We removed levees, re-meandered, and put in side channels. This year we’re planting thousands of trees. It is our goal to see salmon spawn there again.”

	“This is 11 to 15 miles of stream, and a very big deal for fish,” Taylor said. “The listed steelhead above it have never been supplemented. We’re working with many landowners, and the Forest Service, on many actions – cattle exclusions, riparian plantings, stream reconstruction, putting wood in the streams, and others. Design is underway, we hope to start work in a year or so. Joseph Creek is steep and largely inaccessible; that’s why it’s a steelhead stronghold. But where it is accessible this work will really improve stream conditions and fisheries habitat.”
Taylor and his team are also part of the Tribe’s long effort, with Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife and others, to secure fish passage at Wallowa Lake Dam. That is the only large dam in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha basins.
In addition to Tamkaliks, the Tribe has acquired or been gifted other properties – for example, 140 acres near Joseph, at what Mr. Taylor calls the Place of Boulders. From its Joseph office, Nez Perce Fisheries staff work across Wallowa Country to keep water in streams, repair habitats, restore fish passage and rebuild Nez Perce use of these homelands.
A restoration and a journey at Ascension School Camp and Conference Center
Bobby Fossek’s project at Ascension School is small in comparison, yet large on its terms.
Ascension School Camp and Conference Center, in Cove, Oregon, is the spiritual center of the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon. The diocese includes 19 churches in eastern, central and southern Oregon.

“Ascension’s mission is to be a place apart, to connect with God’s sacred mystery,” said Amy Jayne, a priest, who serves as the center’s director.  “Our principles are human dignity, creation care and spirituality. Our summer camp for children is 100 years old. We are a full-service outdoor facility, a retreat and conference center, and a community center to serve Cove.”
Three Catherine Creek tributaries – Duncan, Hulick and Mill creeks – roughly bound the School’s 100 acres. Eighty acres are being restored.
“Ascension sits on an old village site called Wiweeletitpe, Place of Many Streams,” Fossek said. “It has been farmed since the mid-1800s, much of the native flora and fauna removed, and the anadromous fish streams straightened and diverted into irrigation ditches. We are working to restore many of the First Foods, Medicines and Materials that historically grew here and that our people have a deep relationship with. Along with it, we are revitalizing skills and lifeways that are part of this landscape, with tribal cultural skills camps on the site.”

	Camas Camp, for example, immerses young native people in gathering, cooking, and sharing camas. A public nature trail also now ribbons the site.
Fossek attended Ascension Camp as a boy and was maintenance man when Amy Jayne became its director six years ago.
“Bobby led us to see we can’t heal the land without assisting the healing of its original caretakers,” Jayne said.
This led to a relationship with Caretakers of the Land, which Fossek and Brosnan Spencer founded “to steward and strengthen the lifeways, languages, habitats, and traditional ecological knowledge of the Blue Mountain bioregion …”

	“We provide Caretakers administrative support, but they have considerable autonomy,” Jayne says. “They have a deep relationship with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and those Tribes have events here. There’s a three-day CTUIR symposium this year. The Nez Perce have had an event here too, through Caretakers. I hope the elders and others visiting will recognize Ascension as a shared space. We want to help native people live again in their seasonal rounds.”
For the diocese, it is a journey. In 2022, at its annual convention, the Episcopal Diocese of Eastern Oregon formally repudiated the “doctrine of discovery,” the religious and legal basis upon which the Grande Ronde and Wallowa Country, including Ascension Camp’s 100 acres, were taken from tribal people by the United States and its citizens.
“There is wonderful support here,” Jayne says. “But there is also pushback.  Absolutely nothing is settled in this work. The past systems are massive and in place. It takes a lot of work so people understand what we’re doing, and so we understand them. We forge ahead, and go slowly.”
I asked Fossek if it is fair to see his work, including the Ascension restoration, in three parts: restoring health to ecosystems, building relations with neighbors and communities, and restoring tribal presence and use:  “Yes. They are branches from the same tree – the web of life in this valley.”
A small project gives young fish a place to ‘rest and grow’
David Baum’s little project on Catherine Creek is the first restoration I heard about. Mr. Baum is a retired lawyer, fisherman and kayaker.

	He vividly remembers salmon coming steadily through his grandmother’s place on Catherine Creek in the 1950s. A decade ago, he did a five-acre restoration on the creek, at a different property he owned.
“I worked with Grande Ronde Model Watershed to put in a side channel,” Baum says. “I wanted to build some habitat where overwintering juvenile salmon can rest and grow. It’s still there.”
Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers contributed $117,000 of the project cost, and Baum $3,000, says the project description on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website.

To get a feel for all the restoration work done and underway across 3.1 million acres of land and water over three decades, visit the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website: www.grmw.org.


In Catherine Creek alone, 38 separate projects, including Baum’s, are listed on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed website from 1995 through 2021. The Confederated Umatilla Tribes are a frequent lead and partner on Catherine Creek, as is the Union County Soil and Water District.
Projects include restored fish passage, restored seasonal flows, riparian habitat re-creation, re-meandered channels, restored pools, better irrigation systems, bridging/fencing/culverting and more.
Kyle Bratcher’s agency is active as well.
“In my Wallowa and Imnaha territory, the main restoration practitioners are Grande Ronde Model Watershed, the Nez Perce Tribe, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, and Trout Unlimited,” he said. “We were a lead on the McDaniel Ranch project, as of course was Doug McDaniel, who did so much for restoration in Wallowa Country.”
McDaniel helped begin Wallowa Resources, which is also active in land and water restoration; Joe McCormack serves on its board.
“Trout Unlimited has done a lot of work in the upper Grande Ronde,” says Noel March, who grew up in La Grande and now works for the group. “In Sheep Creek, for example, about an hour upstream of La Grande, we’ve reversed a lot of historical damage.

	“Among current projects, we’re in Chesnimnus Creek too, just above the Nez Perce project, working with the Wallowa-Whitman National Forest. In six miles of stream, we’re removing levees, returning those spawning gravels to the stream, and depositing large wood. It will give beaver a leg up.”
Together, says March, the Nez Perce and Trout Unlimited projects “will soon be a large, connected corridor of high-quality steelhead habitat.”  March gives particular credit to the many landowners working with the Nez Perce, and to Mr. Taylor’s field staff.
Land and canal owners are often, like Mr. Baum, project sponsors.
“It is real,” says Rick George, “how many landowners are now giving permission to restore waters on their lands, and are supportive of salmon.  They want to reconnect land and water. There are still gaping wounds on this landscape; nothing can turn around all the water conversion and draining in the valleys anytime soon. But there is also change.”
The Grande Ronde Model Watershed calls itself “the primary entity coordinating habitat restoration on private and public lands within the Grande Ronde Basin.” It was created in 1992-3, when the Northwest Power and Conservation Council chose the Grande Ronde as Oregon’s “model watershed” for spawning and rearing habitat restoration.
Bonneville Power Administration ratepayers were starting then to extensively finance such work. Grande Ronde Model Watershed has been a conduit for millions of Bonneville ratepayer dollars to repair Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds, while developing funding from other sources too.

	The CTUIR and Nez Perce Tribe each have seats on the Grande Ronde Model Watershed board. Joe McCormack represents the Nez Perce.
“In the early to mid-2000s, GRMW studied all the streams,” he said. “The Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek were in the worst shape, and needed habitat work the most then.”
Kyle Bratcher says: “ODFW helped develop the restoration atlases that prioritize watersheds and places. The Model Watershed holds monthly meetings of the implementors. It is a very big group and a very collaborative effort.”
The Model Watershed also engages students, volunteers and organizations in citizen science.
Ascension School students are in the program. It helps that one week of outdoor school is a fifth grade requirement in Oregon. Kyle Bratcher’s wife, Emily, organizes and teaches youth science education, separately but overlapping with the Model Watershed’s program.
“She takes kids to the projects,” he said. “It’s a great way to teach them about fish and rivers, and spark their interest. They see fish spawning.”
Altogether, an impressively broad local network – tribes and tribal people, agencies local state and federal, ranchers and other landowners, fishers and the conservation-minded, churches, schools, businesses and nonprofits – is restoring waters and lands, public and private, at scales small to large, in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds. (The Powder River Basin Watershed Council, does similar work with far less resources in the Snake River watershed adjacent on the south. The Powder is without salmon, thanks to impassable dams constructed in Hells Canyon 60 years ago.)
How to restore both salmon habitats, and salmon
Salmon have this quality: People come to them by many paths, and are hooked.
If, as seems likely, federal investments in northeast Oregon now shrivel for a time, it is plain the local restoration work will continue even if slowed. The tribal, community and economic investment is too rooted, and the local good being done too substantial.
But the extinction threshold analyses make a second plain fact plainer.  Watershed repair and renewal in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha will restore natal salmon habitats, but under current conditions in migratory habitats outside the Grande Ronde, it will not restore salmon.



It is real how many landowners are now giving permission to restore waters on their lands, and are supportive of salmon. They want to reconnect land and water. There are still gaping wounds on this landscape; nothing can turn around all the water conversion and draining in the valleys anytime soon. But there is also change.


– Rick George


The riches salmon once gave the Grande Ronde and its people, Rick George’s ocean nutrient freight train, are close to disappearing despite three decades of sustained local river restorations. If all this good work is to achieve its harvest, and community goals for salmon in the Grande Ronde, off-site restoration of equally vital habitat – in this case, over-dammed migratory habitat – must occur soon.
Here I believe the Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife have the right three-part response.
They are leading in extinction science and its applications for salmon and steelhead populations at extinction’s door.
They are leaders to responsibly restore 140 miles of the lower Snake River and its habitats, by removing the earthen sections of its four dams, within an inclusive and phased Columbia Basin-wide approach developed by the “Six Sovereigns”: the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Reservation, Nez Perce Tribe and Oregon, plus the Yakama Nation, Confederated Warm Springs Tribes, and Washington.
And they are active co-collaborators restoring health and habitats in the Grande Ronde and Imnaha watersheds.

(Pool photo by Bethany Baker/The Salt Lake Tribune) In what is being described as the “last big hurdle” before his Sept. 5 execution, attorneys for death row inmate Ralph Menzies argued before the Utah Supreme Court that the state should pause proceedings and give the 67-year-old convicted killer with dementia another review to see if he is competent.  
Menzies — sentenced to die by firing squad for the 1986 kidnapping and murder of 26-year-old Maurine Hunsaker — is running out of appeals. His death warrant has been signed, the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole recently denied him clemency and his execution is now almost two weeks away. 
But the state’s high court could still force the Utah Department of Corrections to pause proceedings and grant Menzies another evaluation to determine whether he’s competent. 
During a hearing on Thursday, Menzies’ attorneys made what could be their last case for sparing his life, while the Utah Attorney General’s Office argued they haven’t met the requirements for granting Menzies another competency review.

For much of the last year, Menzies’ attorneys have claimed his dementia makes him incompetent to be executed — per state and federal law, an inmate must understand the state’s reasoning for pursuing the death penalty. In June, 3rd District Court Judge Matthew Bates ruled that Menzies, despite having dementia, is competent. 
His attorneys then submitted a petition for another competency evaluation, claiming that Menzies’ mental condition had deteriorated, fueled by a hypoxic event, which is when the brain doesn’t get enough oxygen. For someone with dementia, like Menzies, his attorneys say a hypoxic event can worsen the symptoms. 
Bates denied the petition, writing there wasn’t enough compelling evidence to grant Menzies another review. On Thursday, Menzies’ attorneys said Bates’ ruling was wrong, and that because of the pending appeal, the court should pause proceedings. 
Central to their arguments was the legal principle “prima facie,” which essentially means there is enough evidence before the court for a case to move forward. During the roughly two-hour hearing, Lindsey Layer, one of Menzies’ attorneys, said they’ve shown through expert evaluations that there is ample evidence to suggest Menzies meets the threshold outlined in state code to grant him another review.
“He was unable to answer what he was charged with. That is new,” Layer said, referring to recent evaluations where experts asked Menzies if he understood the state’s reason for executing him. “He repeated the same thing, over and over again.” 
And, the nature of dementia means Menzies’ cognitive abilities will continue to decline. 
“He is only getting worse. That is the only trajectory of his illness, to get worse over time until it is ultimately fatal,” she said. 
Utah Board of Pardons and Parole denies death row inmate Ralph Menzies’ plea for clemency

Attorneys for the state, however, told the supreme court justices that there isn’t enough evidence to grant another competency evaluation. State code sets a high bar, requiring allegations of a substantial change in circumstances — and those allegations “must raise a significant question” about the inmate’s competency.
Daniel Boyer with the Utah Attorney General’s Office argued Menzies’ attorneys have not satisfied those requirements. 
“There needs to be a greater level of specificity” to Menzies’ claims, Boyer said, adding that some of the allegations of decline happened before Bates made his initial ruling in June — before the request for another evaluation. 
“Here, the alleged events that demonstrated a significant decline occurred months before we even had oral arguments on the first petition,” Boyer said.
The five members of the Utah Supreme Court — which on Thursday included 2nd District Judge Ronald Russel sitting in place of Justice John Pearce, who was recused — pressed attorneys on both sides during the hearing. 
The court took the matter under advisement. It’s unclear when they will rule, although prior rulings have been issued roughly a week after arguments. 
Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son who has been a spokesperson for the family, told reporters after the hearing that this is the “last big hurdle” in the decadeslong case. 
“If he’s not executed on Sept. 5, they’re not going to execute him,” said Hunsaker. “I’ll give up.”

Taylor, who became the state’s top attorney in 2021 after his two immediate predecessors resigned in disgrace, is expected by political observers to join a competitive field of candidates running for governor in the state’s 2026 general election.
Incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy is term-limited and unable to run for reelection, leaving the office open to challengers.
This week, former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum formally confirmed his plans to run for governor, and former state Sen. Tom Begich became the first Democrat to announce a run for the office. Bruce Walden of Palmer, who ran as a write-in candidate in 2022, filed for the office on Wednesday.
In addition to Crum and Walden, seven other Republicans have filed documents for a campaign: former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; and business owner Bernadette Wilson of Anchorage.
No independents have filed for the office, and Begich is the only Democrat who has filed.
While Taylor has not formally stated that he will run for governor, he has participated in a significant number of non-state events that appear to foreshadow a campaign.
Next Thursday, he was scheduled to join other Republican attorneys general in Anchorage at an event hosted by the Anchorage Republican Women’s Club. It wasn’t immediately clear whether that event would still take place.
In a written statement, Dunleavy thanked Taylor for his service and noted that he will end his career as the third-longest-serving attorney general in state history. In the same statement, Taylor thanked the employees of the Department of Law. 
During four and a half years as attorney general, Taylor has tended to favor Christian conservative and Republican causes, aligning the state legally with other Republican attorneys general.
In 2022, Taylor helped fundraising efforts for a Republican group that ran ads opposing more moderate members of the state House and Senate in that year’s elections. Taylor’s family has backed efforts that would allow state homeschool funding to be used for tuition at private and religious schools. 
Earlier this year, Taylor’s travel itinerary drew scrutiny after it was revealed that a corporate-funded group had paid at least $20,000 for a trip to France for Taylor and his wife.
Taylor’s time in office has corresponded with a drop in violent and sexual crime within the state.  Alaska ranks among the worst states in the nation for both categories of crimes.
Dunleavy is expected to appoint an acting attorney general on or before Aug. 29.

Democrats are searching for a leader to take on President Trump. Gov. Gavin Newsom embraced that role with new online trolling and a proposed gerrymander to counter a GOP power play in Texas.



As a partisan redistricting war ramps up across the country, Gov. Gavin Newsom has made himself the general of the Democratic insurgency.
The plan to redraw California’s congressional districts to favor Democrats originated as a farfetched retaliatory taunt to Texas on Newsom’s extracurricular podcast. By last week, the governor was headlining a campaign launch rally for the proposal.
Through flashy photo ops, social media trolling and an increasingly pugnacious posture against President Donald Trump, Newsom tied himself to the California redistricting so intrinsically that some are calling it the “Gavinmander.” He’s enjoying a newfound folk hero status among loyal Democrats that could boost a widely expected bid for the presidency in 2028.
“It’s the fearlessness, the fight. I can’t underscore that enough,” said Christale Spain, chair of the Democratic Party in South Carolina, a longtime early primary state. “In this time of Trump 2.0, folks are just looking for a fighter.”
Now, with the outcome of Newsom’s redistricting plan in the hands of the voters in a November special election, his fortunes could rise and fall with his ballot measure.
For Newsom, the goodwill would be punctured by a belly flop on the ballot. For the redistricting proposal, public sentiment about the governor may ultimately be more determinative than lofty arguments about fair elections or protecting democracy.
Opponents are already framing the plan as a power grab by Newsom that undermines the will of the voters — playing on a long-simmering suspicion among Californians that the governor has his eye on the national prize more than solving the state’s problems.
“He’s clearly decided to do this to further his presidential ambitions. He wants to be seen as the person fighting Trump and to galvanize the Democratic base behind him,” Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher of Chico said. “It’s not about some greater cause. It’s about him and his image and his ambitions.”
Newsom defends the California redistricting as an emergency measure to neutralize Trump’s attempts to rig the outcome of the 2026 midterms.
Earlier this summer, Trump pressured Texas Republicans to redraw the state’s congressional lines to shore up the narrow GOP majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. Their map, which is on track for final approval this week, creates five new Republican-leaning seats — an advantage that could be offset, if the voters approve, by five more Democratic-leaning districts in California.
“It’s not the rule of law, it’s the rule of Don. And we’re standing up to that,” Newsom said Thursday at a press conference where he signed the proclamation declaring the Nov. 4 special election.
“I’m concerned about what Donald Trump is doing,” he told reporters later, “and to the extent that we can provide a pathway to get support for this initiative, I’m going to continue doing everything in my power.”
Newsom’s redistricting risk
Critics, and even some supporters, warn that redistricting is a high-stakes gamble for Newsom. Independent redistricting is popular with California voters.
Newsom, meanwhile, has faced sluggish approval ratings throughout his governorship — though he often gets a lift when in direct confrontation with Trump. 
If the ballot measure becomes another referendum on Newsom and then fails in November, it would be a black eye for the governor. Gallagher said it would be “the death knell for his political career.”
But for now Newsom is reaping the rewards of jumping into the fray.
While national Democrats and other liberal states wavered about how to counter Trump, Newsom propelled California into an unprecedented special election in a matter of weeks. It once again made him the national face of the anti-Trump resistance, a position that Newsom has cultivated throughout his governorship but which he set aside earlier this year as he sought the president’s help responding to devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County.
Michael Kolenc, a Democratic political consultant based in Houston, said California’s response is now part of nearly every local story he reads about the Texas redistricting.
“People are appreciative that someone is out there having their back,” he said. “We want someone or something to fight, not fold, in the face of authoritarianism. And I think California and Newsom are filling that void.”
In South Carolina, which Newsom visited last month, Spain said the governor’s response is providing an education for Democrats, who worry Trump will also pressure their overwhelmingly Republican state into redrawing congressional lines.
“This is exactly what Democrats in South Carolina have been waiting for, someone to punch back,” Spain said. “They are inspired by it.”
Kolenc said the breakthrough beyond the state’s borders raises Newsom’s reputation not just with Democratic voters he would need in a presidential primary but also with the insider crowd — advisers, staff, donors, endorsers — who may want to be on his campaign team.
And even if voters ultimately reject the gambit, Kolence said he doesn’t see a downside for Newsom, who can still say he was on the frontlines defending the country against Trump.
“At the end of the day, he’s getting attention, which is what he needs and wants,” Kolenc said.
Trolling in President Trump’s style
In recent weeks, Newsom has taken the battle to the digital sphere in a new way. His social media accounts, and those of his press office, post a relentless stream of fiery rejoinders to the president: aping Trump’s quirky, all-caps style, mocking his looks and his masculinity, and accusing him of cheating to win.
The frankly ridiculous posts — have you seen the AI-generated painting of Kid Rock, Tucker Carlson and the late Hulk Hogan praying over Newsom? — are bringing even more focus to the governor. Fox News commentators have spent considerable time lately wringing their hands over the heavy-handed parody of Trump.

But delighted Democrats argue that it’s effectively making the case for redistricting by reminding voters of the stakes for California, which is frequently in Trump’s crosshairs, if Republicans retain unified control of the federal government.
“A lot of voters also think both parties are the same. And they’re not. The reality is we’re trying to stop what is happening,” state Sen. Aisha Wahab, a Fremont Democrat, said. “Honestly, this is probably what a lot of people think but don’t necessarily say.”
Wahab said the viral trolling is cutting through the apathy that typically surrounds special elections and allowing Newsom to connect with younger voters, as well as Democrats who have felt powerless as Trump swiftly reshaped the country during his first months back in the White House.
“We’ve taken a high road for many, many years as Democrats and as a party. And I think we’re watching that high road actively crumble in front of us and we’ve got to chart a better pathway,” Assemblymember Isaac Bryan, a Culver City Democrat, said. “Where I’m from, when somebody steps up, you step up.”
The question remains: what is Newsom stepping up to?
One way or another, the redistricting campaign ends in less than three months. Newsom will still be the governor of California for another year after that, until the beginning of 2027. It’s a long time to sustain this momentum, especially in an era where the political news cycle moves at lighting speed.
Gallagher, the Assembly Republican leader, predicted that “trying to out-Trump Trump” would not work out for Newsom in the long run.
“He’s obviously not talking about the real issues and the real policies and the things that affect everyday people’s life,” Gallagher said. “That’s been the problem with Gavin since day one. It’s been more about his next big shiny object instead of actually getting shit done.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125_Redistricting-Newsom_MG_CM_07.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-08-21 20:57:04.729793

John Sauer filed an application arguing “the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the government to pay out some $783 million in terminated grants.”Sauer wrote the case was similar to one the Supreme Court had ruled on earlier this year, determining that a district court erred when it blocked “the Department of Education from terminating DEI-related grants.”In that case, the Supreme Court ruled that “such claims likely belonged in the Court of Federal Claims, that the district court accordingly lacked jurisdiction.”Sauer wrote in his application to the Supreme Court that the lower courts in the NIH grants case choose to ignore the justices’ prior ruling.“The district court’s order directs the NIH to continue paying $783 million in federal grants that are undisputedly counter to the Administration’s priorities,” Sauer wrote. “This Court has already intervened to stay a materially identical order … and the same course is even more warranted here given the district court’s brazen refusal to follow controlling Supreme Court precedent.”Democratic AGs weigh inDemocratic attorneys general for Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin opposed the Trump administration’s request in a 49-page filing.“The federal government’s application spins a tale of lower courts disregarding established legal guardrails to block routine agency decisions,” they wrote. “That narrative bears little resemblance to reality; indeed, it gets things exactly backward.”The Trump administration’s decision to cancel the NIH grants, they wrote, came “without providing any meaningful explanation of their decisions.“Defendants then executed the directives by, among other things, canceling hundreds of research grants to the plaintiff states’ public universities for projects investigating heart disease, HIV/AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease, alcohol and substance abuse, mental-health issues, and countless other health conditions.”The American Public Health Association also opposed the Trump administration's efforts to get the Supreme Court to throw out the lower court’s rulings.The APHA wrote in its own filing that the Trump administration “failed to consider the reliance interests at stake—namely, the impact to researchers’ career progression, the risk to human life, and the damage to the overall scientific endeavor and the body of public health.”Siding with Trump administrationJustices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh disagreed, siding with the Trump administration and setting aside the lower court’s rulings in the case. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote a concurring opinion.Gorsuch sharply rebuked the district and appeals courts in his opinion, in which Kavanaugh joined in part and dissented in part.“Lower court judges may sometimes disagree with this Court’s decisions, but they are never free to defy them,” Gorsuch wrote. “In Department of Ed. v. California … this Court granted a stay because it found the government likely to prevail in showing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the government to pay grant obligations.”Barrett appeared to agree, writing in her concurring opinion that “the District Court likely lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges to the grant terminations, which belong in the Court of Federal Claims.”In a dissenting opinion, Jackson wrote that the justices did not take enough time to seriously consider the ramifications of their decision in the Education Department case when they spent “a mere nine days” deciding whether a federal district court or the Court of Federal Claims holds jurisdiction when the government terminates “federal grants en masse.”“I viewed the Court’s intervention then—in an emergency stay posture, while racing against a fast-expiring temporary restraining order—as ‘equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate,’” Jackson wrote. “As it turns out, the Court’s decision was an even bigger mistake than I realized.”Ariana Figueroa contributed to this report.",,,,2025-08-21 20:57:04.729793

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)President Donald Trump again called for the release of former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters in a social media post on Thursday, 
Peters is a prominent election denier serving a nine-year prison sentence for her role in a breach of Mesa County’s elections systems during a 2021 software update.
“Let Tina Peters out of jail, RIGHT NOW,” Trump said in the post. “She did nothing wrong, except catching the Democrats cheat in the Election. She is an old woman, and very sick. If she is not released, I am going to take harsh measures!!!”
Peters was convicted by a Mesa County jury in August 2024 on four felony counts related to the security breach, which was part of an effort to demonstrate that the 2020 election was untrustworthy, even though there is no credible evidence to support that position. She was prosecuted by the office of a Republican district attorney.
In May, Trump called for the U.S. Department of Justice to take “all necessary action” to secure her release. Trump cannot pardon Peters, because her conviction involves state crimes.
Peters has appealed the conviction, and while the Colorado Court of Appeals reviews the case, her legal team filed a federal habeas corpus petition. The petition, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado, argues that Peters should be released on bond pending the appeal decision.
Peters’ attorneys argue in the federal habeas corpus petition that her First Amendment rights have been violated because she has not been allowed bail pending her appeal.
“(Peters) has been made to stay in prison because people are afraid of what she would say,” her attorney Peter Ticktin said in an interview with Newsline earlier this month.
The Colorado attorney general’s office has asked for the dismissal of the habeas corpus petition, arguing that the federal court does not have jurisdiction in the case. In a recent filing, the attorney general’s office cited the 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case Younger v. Harris, in which the court recognized “longstanding public policy against federal court interference with state court proceedings.”

Wes Moore (D) speaks at a ceremony Thursday marking the demolition of the aging Pimlico Race Course to make room for a new facility, hopefully in time for the 2027 Preakness Stakes. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)An excavator tore open the walls of the Pimlico clubhouse Thursday as the governor and other dignitaries looked on — the official kick-off for a demolition already underway at the historic track in northwest Baltimore’s Park Heights.
The Maryland Board of Public Works signed off on the demolition and reconstruction project in May, starting a race to demolish and rebuild the aging track in time to bring the Preakness Stakes back to the Baltimore neighborhood by 2027.
But the storied old clubhouse wasn’t the only thing being ripped into Thursday.
After citing his administration’s gains in Baltimore — a massive decline in gun violence, a new lease for the Baltimore Orioles at Camden Yards and the ongoing effort to redevelop Harborplace — Gov. Wes Moore (D) seized the opportunity to lambaste President Donald Trump (R), who said Baltimore is “so far gone” when it comes to violent crime. Trump made the remarks earlier this month as he mobilized National Guard troops to patrol Washington, D.C.
“If you are not willing to be part of the solution, keep our names out of your mouth,” Moore said, eliciting cheers from the crowd. “Specifically, Donald Trump, if you are not willing to walk our communities, keep our name out of your mouth.”

But the next speaker to step to the microphone — a Park Heights clergyman leading the community advisory board for the redevelopment — had a sobering message, and a reminder that the city’s problems have not gone away.
Bishop Troy Randall, who grew up in the neighborhood abutting the racecourse, said he was caught in the crossfire of a shooting near the racetrack 5 p.m. Wednesday that left an 18-year-old man dead.
“My heart grieves, as well as its joy,” Randall said. “I am a product of the good, and I’m a product of the bad.”
Randall said he was sitting in his car, having just dropped off a neighbor at the barbershop, when shots rang out.
“They shot my car, and as I laid on the floor of my car crying, I said, ‘Lord, not this. Not this way. It can’t end like this,’” Randall said.
After the shots stopped, Randall emerged from his car to see the young victim lying on the ground.
“I got out of that car, and I stood there, and I looked at the gentleman gasping for air in his lungs, I prayed that God give him another day,” Randall said.

Randall said the harrowing incident inspired him to continue fighting for Park Heights to benefit from the redevelopment. He said Moore “kept his promise” to visit the neighborhood, by attending Thursday’s ceremony.
Thursday, Moore touted his administration’s plan to reinvest a share of the revenue from the new racing facility in neighborhood improvements.

“The community have to be shareholders,” Moore said. “They have to benefit from all the new revenue that we will see.”
Moore pointed to $75 million in state funding for affordable housing in the neighborhood and $5 million for a new Park Heights public library.
The Board of Public Works vote in May approved a $15.2 million contract with Clark Construction related to the demolition and reconstruction, kickstarting a long-discussed plan to raze the deteriorating racing facility.
The unanimous vote came even as State Treasurer Dereck Davis, one of the three members of the board, wondered if it should be a final handout to a struggling horseracing industry. He pondered aloud if building year-round appeal for the racetrack was a “pipe dream.”
The board also approved $4.5 million that day to buy a farm in Carroll County that is slated to host a new $110 million training center, capable of hosting some 800 horses.
With Pimlico razed, next year’s Preakness is scheduled to be run at Laurel Park. But the state, which owns Pimlico, plans to have the track reopened by May 2027, in time to once again host the second leg of the Triple Crown.
That gives project managers less than two years to complete the full demolition and rebuild. But Moore was optimistic Thursday.
“We are ensuring that the second leg of the Triple Crown will also be the Triple Crown’s crown jewel,” Moore said. “And that that crown jewel will be right here in Baltimore, right where it belongs.”

According to the FY26 General Fund Budget Monitor for August, “After accounting for updated revenue projections, the projected ending balance is negative $79.9 million.” 
Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. 
That means the state is only about six weeks into the current fiscal year, and the new report reflects the first month of revenue activity in fiscal year 2026.
House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said the budget situation is severe and was created by Republicans who control the Idaho Legislature and set the state budget.

“We’ve been shouting warnings from the mountaintops about this from the very beginning of the session about the extremely reckless, permanent revenue cuts and voucher schemes they passed and the wild overestimates of revenue they adopted that were not in any way in line with what (the Division of Financial Management) projected,” Rubel said. “There were warning signs flashing from miles away that unfortunately our Republican colleagues chose to ignore.”
Rep. Wendy Horman, an Idaho Falls Republican who serves as the co-chair of the Idaho Legislature’s Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee that sets the state budget, disagreed. Horman said Idaho’s economy is healthy and the state actually collected more in revenue last year than it did before.
“I appreciate you recognizing we are very early in the fiscal year,” Horman said Thursday afternoon. “In my opinion, this is not cause for panic at all. One month of revenue does not make a trend. I always watch actual revenues much more than I watch revenue compared to the forecast.”
 Since record surplus, Idaho lawmakers have reduced state revenue through tax cuts

A projected budget deficit is a major change for Idaho. 
Just over three years ago, Idaho ended the 2022 fiscal year with a record budget surplus approaching $2 billion. 
Since the record surplus, Idaho legislators reduced state revenue significantly.

During the 2025 legislative session alone, legislators and Idaho Gov. Brad Little reduced revenue that would have been available in the state budget by more than $450 million to pay for tax cuts and a new tax credit that reimburses families for education expenses, including tuition at private religious schools.
During a breakfast with the press corps in February, Little told reporters he was “not very happy about” the magnitude of revenue reductions the Idaho Legislature put forward this year. 
“If I would have thought we could do $450 (million), I would have proposed $450 (million),” Little told reporters in February. 
Although he didn’t propose as deep of tax cuts and revenue reductions, Rubel said Little did sign the state budget into law.
“He could have vetoed it; he did sign it,” Rubel said. 
In March, former legislators Fred Wood and Julie Yamamoto – who are both Republicans – and former superintendent of public instruction candidate Cindy Wilson wrote a joint opinion piece published in the Idaho Capital Sun warning that “Idaho’s tax cuts proposed by the Legislature are a risk to our children’s future.”
 Where did the new Idaho budget report come from?

Officials with the nonpartisan Idaho Legislative Services Office compiled the new report and released it Wednesday night. 
The report was released less than a week after the governor announced that all state agencies – other than public schools – must cut their current budgets by 3%.
Although Idaho is just about six weeks into the fiscal year 2026 budget, any projected budget deficit is significant.
One of the only requirements Idaho legislators have under the Idaho Constitution is to pass a balanced budget every year where expenses do not exceed available revenues. 
If the latest revenue projections hold and no other steps are taken, Idaho would fall short of that balanced-budget requirement, the state’s top budget official told the Idaho Capital Sun on Thursday.

“We cannot go through this year with the (budget) appropriation the Legislature set for us or we will exceed revenue,” Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said in an interview Thursday morning. “That is why the governor asked for at least 3% holdbacks.”
Idaho is so early in the current fiscal year that the projected budget deficit could increase, decrease or rebound into a surplus. 
The new budget projections do not include any supplemental funding requests for the fiscal year 2026 budget, Wolff said. That means if the wildfire season runs long and costs exceed state funding levels, or if Medicaid expenses come in higher than projected, the budget deficit could become even larger.
 How can Idaho prevent a budget deficit?

It is likely Idaho won’t actually have a budget deficit when the 2026 fiscal year ends June 30. Horman said there are “all kinds of budgetary levers the Legislature can pull” in response to any budget concerns once they reconvene in January. 
Additionally, Idaho law gives the governor the authority to issue an executive order to reduce spending for any department, office or institution of the state if the governor determines expenses will exceed available revenue. 
The Idaho Legislative Services Office estimated the 3% budget holdbacks Little announced Friday would reduce spending by $86.1 million if implemented by all state agencies this year. If everything else in the August budget projections hold up and there are $0 in fiscal year 2026 supplemental funding requests, the 3% holdbacks would give Idaho a narrow $6.2 million cushion between a budget surplus and a budget deficit at the end of the current fiscal year. 
 Does Idaho have any savings to guard against a budget shortfall?

Idaho has more than $1 billion in rainy day reserve funds in the bank. According to the Idaho Legislature’s 2025 Sine Die Report, the state’s primary rainy day account had a balance of over $880 million, while the Public Education Stabilization Fund had a balance of about $265 million.

Horman said it takes legislative action to use rainy day funds, which she does not support at this time.
“We want to save the rainy day funds for when it is actually raining,” Horman said. “It is not raining, in my opinion, on Aug. 21.”
Horman did say she supports the 3% holdbacks Little authorized and said the Idaho Legislature will reassess the budget situation and new revenue projections when the 2026 legislative session begins in January.
When they reconvene, legislators may discuss making the holdbacks permanent, Horman said. 
“As we always do, we will reassess where things are in January and make a determination if the 3% holdbacks need to be made permanent as we see where our revenues are then and what the economic situation is by then,” Horman said. 
On the other hand Rubel, the House minority leader, said that Idahoans will feel the forthcoming budget cuts, and they will hurt many people. 
Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

Rubel said that cutting all state agencies except public schools means the state is cutting funding for law enforcement through Idaho State Police, cutting funding for prisons through the Idaho Department of Correction and cutting funding for the Idaho Department of Lands, which fights wildfires on state land. 
“This was the most fiscally reckless legislative session by the majority party in modern history and maybe ever,” Rubel said. “They left us unable to cover our most basic needs because of enormous giveaways to the wealthiest people and corporations in the state.”

(Ryan Jones/CPW)Colorado lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a bill to redirect a small amount of state money from gray wolf restoration efforts to a health insurance affordability fund, but stopped short of requiring Colorado Parks and Wildlife to pause the capture and release of new wolves this winter.
With the Legislature convened for a special session to cope with a billion-dollar revenue shortfall triggered by changes to the federal tax code, Senate Bill 25B-5 would withhold $264,268 from the state’s general fund previously appropriated for wolf reintroduction. The money would instead be directed to the state’s Health Insurance Affordability Enterprise, which helps subsidize health coverage costs and faces an estimated shortfall of around $100 million after Congress failed to extend federal tax credits for insurance premiums.
Bill sponsor Sen. Dylan Roberts, a Democrat from Frisco, told his colleagues in a committee hearing Thursday that SB-5 “proposes to save a small amount of taxpayer dollars where we can to put them to something that can immediately help Coloradans.”

Amid opposition from Gov. Jared Polis, however, the bill was amended to remove language prohibiting CPW from taking “any action to acquire or reintroduce gray wolves during state fiscal year 2025-26.” The agency’s reintroduction plan calls for annual releases of 10 to 15 wolves in the program’s first three to five years, as wildlife managers target a stable initial population of at least 50 wolves in the state.
State Sen. Matt Ball, a Denver Democrat who introduced the amendment, said that in the absence of the general fund appropriation, the governor’s office and CPW would look to “other sources of funding,” and the reintroductions would “proceed as planned.”
After two years of releases, Colorado’s wolf population currently includes 21 collared adults and an unknown number of pups born to four established packs this spring.
Three new wolf packs established in Colorado in 2025

“I do believe it’s really important to put one more round of 15 animals out,” CPW director Jeff Davis told lawmakers.
Voters in 2020 narrowly approved a ballot measure requiring CPW to reintroduce gray wolves to Colorado in the name of restoring ecological balance. The state’s efforts have been bitterly opposed by livestock producers, who have persistently called for CPW to delay or pause the program since the agency first began to relocate wolves in December 2023.
A series of wolf attacks on livestock in Grand County in 2024 and in Pitkin County this year have inflamed the controversy — as have the deaths of a number of wolves, through both “lethal control” measures authorized by wildlife managers and at least one apparent act of illegal poaching. Speakers on both sides of the issue sparred yet again during more than three hours of testimony Thursday before the Senate State, Veterans and Military Affairs Committee.
Callie Scritchfield, a Rio Blanco County commissioner, called the prospect of another year of wolf releases “one more big threat to our agriculture community,” which she said would add to the “despair” ranchers in her county are feeling from the impact of the Lee and Elk fires. Samantha Miller of the Center for Biological Diversity, meanwhile, called the bill “unsupported by science” and “contrary to what the experts at CPW state is needed.”
“At this critical stage of reintroduction efforts, halting even one year would have dire consequences,” Miller said.
Lawmakers on the committee voted 4-1 to approve the amended bill and advance it to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

Authorities in the West African nation threw him in prison because of his sexual orientation, he said. After his release, he feared that if he stayed in the country, he would be killed.
B., who is now 39 and who asked that he be identified only by his initial because he still has family in Cameroon, arrived in the United States with practically nothing. Since he was granted asylum last year, he has been able to use the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps, to help him get by.
But now most refugees and asylees, who entered the country legally, including B., are no longer eligible for food stamps. The change is part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the giant federal domestic policy measure that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4.

“I think it’s unfair. I understand that there are some people who abuse the system,” B. told Stateline. “There are also people who are in need. And cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.”
SNAP, which is funded by the federal government but administered by the states, helps families and individuals with lower incomes supplement their grocery budgets. The program serves an average of 42 million people a month.

Supporters of the change note that refugees and asylees can get permits to work, and that they have other sources of support.
“It’s not like they have been dropped off in this country with no support system,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonprofit group that backs stricter immigration rules.
“They have sponsoring organizations that are helping them get settled and they have work authorization. So they really should be moving forward towards self-sufficiency with support right out of the starting gate. And they should be moving ahead to obtain green cards,” she added, referring to the cards that signify permanent residency.
Vaughan cited a federal grant program that reimburses states and nonprofit organizations for financial aid and health care coverage they provide to refugees.
But critics argue that asylees and refugees, who are extensively vetted and have a legitimate path to citizenship, can wait years for a green card, which entitles them to a wider array of benefits.
They also say community organizations that provide aid to asylees and refugees are stretched thin. Without food stamps, they say, many refugees and their families would not have enough to eat.










Cutting help for families like mine — not being able to get the help — it will be very difficult.


– B., a Cameroonian asylee


“SNAP is an incredibly fundamental program for this population that comes to the United States, really, with very little, if anything,” said Nicolas Palazzo, a policy counsel at the global humanitarian and refugee advocacy organization HIAS. “These are people who literally had to flee — many times overnight — with nothing, but, you know, a pair of clothes in a backpack.”
Palazzo also said SNAP is not a “handout” to refugees or asylees. Rather, he said, it’s a “smart and moral investment” that protects all communities and strengthens the economy, offering people a foundation for self-sufficiency.
“Stripping critical food assistance forces refugees and asylees into the shadows of informal work, labor exploitation and hunger that weakens our workforce and denigrates our moral obligations,” Palazzo said.

‘Nowhere else to go’

B. said he applied immediately for asylum when he arrived in the U.S. in 2016, but that he had to wait months for a work permit. He survived by doing odd jobs, such as cleaning homes and delivering food, and got by on very little. It wasn’t until late 2024, when he finally won his asylum case, that he was eligible to get any public benefits, including food stamps.
Eligibility for food stamps came at a critical time for B., as a car accident had prevented him from making food deliveries.
“While not having income, it was very helpful,” B. said. “I’m somebody who if I can work, I will work. The only reason I went over there to ask is because I had nowhere else to go.”
According to a November 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, a total of 60,050 people were newly admitted to the United States as refugees in 2023, many from unstable countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.
In 2023, the nation received at least 747,000 applications for people seeking asylum from countries including Venezuela, Cuba and Colombia, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration research group. It’s a tremendous increase from the 68,000 applications received in 2013.
The new domestic policy law specifies that food stamps are still available to Cubans and Haitians who might be refugees and asylees.

As of July 2025, more than 2.2 million immigrants in the U.S. are awaiting asylum hearings or decisions after formally applying for asylum, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, an organization at Syracuse University that tracks immigration cases.
“Getting through the system was difficult,” B. said. “I had to find money. I had to find an attorney who would help me apply for my asylum case. The asylum case itself took a long time.
“I still know people who have been here for more than 10 years and never had an interview.”

‘Already stretched’

According to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, half of all admitted refugees in 2023 were resettled across just 10 states: Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Arizona, Kentucky, Ohio, Michigan and Washington.
Barbara Guinn, commissioner of the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance, estimates that around 41,000 people in the state are getting SNAP benefits while not being lawful permanent residents. She says that group includes refugees and asylees.
“The concerning part there is that these are individuals who were … lawfully admitted to the country, have previously been eligible for SNAP when they need it, and now, simply because of their status, will no longer be able to receive SNAP benefits,” Guinn told Stateline. “There’s nothing we’re going to be able to do to make them eligible.”
Another change under the new law is that for the first time, states will have to pay for a portion of their food stamp programs. States will have to cover between 5% and 15% of their SNAP costs beginning in fiscal year 2028, depending on how accurately they dole out benefits to people eligible for the program.
Robert Rector, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, pointed out that states that want to continue to provide SNAP benefits to refugees and asylees are free to do so — as long as they pay for it.
“If New York state doesn’t want to cut these people off, they can continue to give them something like food stamps. They just have to do it with New York state money right now,” Rector said.

But Guinn said that will be difficult. New York does offer asylum-seekers cash assistance of $180 a month through its Safety Net Assistance Program, but typically recipients must be working.
In Texas, officials at the state’s health and human services agency said that as of last month, roughly 24,600 of the state’s 3.5 million SNAP recipients were refugees or asylees. A spokesperson for Maryland’s human services agency wrote in an email that the state’s SNAP program last year supported more than 10,000 refugees and asylees.
The California Department of Social Services could not provide the number of refugees and asylees receiving food stamps, but projected that a total of 74,000 noncitizens — including lawfully permanent residents, refugees and asylees — would lose eligibility under the new law.
Sherri Laigle, the director of social services at HIAS, said food banks will not be able to make up for refugees’ and asylees’ loss of SNAP benefits.
“They’re already stretched, and now we’re going to see tens of thousands of people also needing to continue to rely on these programs. Of course, there’s limited access to them. You have to have transportation. You have to be able to get there.”
B. said he would apply for food stamps again if he could, because he’s earning too little income to get by.
“There are people who are in need. I think ignoring that — it’s not human.”

Black babies have a significantly higher death rate than white babies.","The Mississippi State Department of Health on Thursday declared a public health emergency in response to a rising infant mortality rate in the state – most of which is occurring among Black babies. 
In 2024, Mississippi saw its highest rate of infant deaths in over a decade. 
Data shows the death rate for white infants in 2024 was one of the lowest of the last decade, while the rate for Black infants is the highest it’s been. Nearly twice as many Black infants as white ones died last year. 
Mississippi is one of the poorest states and has long led the nation in infant mortality, but the worsening numbers and the growing racial disparities call for extraordinary measures, said State Health Officer Dr. Daniel Edney.

“It hasn’t been this bad in a long time,” Edney told Mississippi Today. “And that’s with a lot of us pushing hard to make it better. In the face of us, and so many partners all over the state, really leaning into this space, the numbers show significant worsening.”
Honour McDaniel Hill, director of Infant and Maternal Health Initiatives for March of Dimes, said declaring a public health emergency is not something she’s seen other states do in response to infant mortality in recent years. She called it an “interesting tactic” to move time, energy and resources to an important cause. 
“What a public health emergency does is it allows a state entity – in this case the state Health Department – to put this on high alert, meaning funds can go here, personnel and people’s time and attention can go here,” McDaniel Hill said. “It really does kind of break this barrier.”
Edney said he hopes that with the emergency status, he’ll be able to develop a new system of care six months faster than he’d originally intended. 
That OB System of Care, which has  been in the works since 2023, involves designating birthing hospitals with different care levels – something called perinatal regionalization, which is used in many states. It also includes implementing transportation and tracking to make transfers of high-risk moms more efficient. 
Edney said he hopes to have hospitals designated as early as October, but full implementation of the system could still take a couple of years. 
This fall, Edney also hopes to have expanded perinatal services at county health departments in areas that are obstetric deserts, as part of a “multi-pronged strategy” response to the emergency.
Nearly half of Mississippi’s counties are maternity care deserts, McDaniel Hill said, and those counties make up nearly a quarter of the state’s births, making increased access a vital part of the solution.
Other strategies outlined in the State Health Department’s press release included allocating more staff to a home visitation program called Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies, and educating families on safe sleep practices to mitigate sudden infant death syndrome, one of the leading causes of infant mortality in the state. 
The most recent March of Dimes report card for Mississippi included several policy recommendations the Legislature would be responsible for enacting, including expanding Medicaid to working people with modest salaries, which Republican Gov. Tate Reeves opposes. The Health Department did not mention Medicaid expansion in its plan Thursday.
Monica Stinson, senior program director of the Mississippi Perinatal Quality Collaborative, said her organization will play a central role in the emergency response, particularly by collaborating with community-based groups and connecting families with resources. 
“The declaration is a powerful tool that helps centralize resources, align key partners, and remove barriers that have historically slowed progress,” Stinson said. “This formal recognition of the crisis allows us to move beyond fragmented efforts and toward a more coordinated, statewide strategy aimed at improving outcomes for all mothers and infants in Mississippi.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/06193428/aditya-romansa-5zp0jym2w9M-unsplash-scaled.jpg,,,2025-08-21 19:57:40.922543

(Photo courtesy of Tennessee Department of Transportation)A long-planned new Interstate 55 bridge connecting Arkansas and Tennessee will be known as Kings’ Crossing, officials from the two states announced this week.
The new name “honors three transformative figures known as ‘Kings'” — civil rights martyr Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., bluesman B.B. King and rock’n’roll star Elvis Presley, according to a press release from the Arkansas Department of Transportation. The project had been named “America’s River Crossing,” according to previous news releases. The Arkansas Highway Commission and Tennessee General Assembly officially adopted the new moniker.
The bridge will replace the existing 75-year-old Memphis-Arkansas Bridge that carries I-55 traffic between West Memphis and Memphis. The new bridge is being funded by $400 million from the federal Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity (RAISE) program and $200 million each from Arkansas and Tennessee, making it the single largest transportation investment in both states, according to the press release.
The narrow existing bridge will be replaced with a larger structure designed to meet modern seismic codes, as it sits on the New Madrid fault line, officials said.
“It’s only fitting to name this vital crossing after three historic figures from this region,” said ARDOT Director Jared Wiley. “It truly is the result of a regional effort that will benefit industry across this national corridor and the thousands of individuals who depend on this connection each day.”
Tennessee Department of Transportation Commissioner Will Reid said Kings’ Crossing is a “symbol of our collective history, heritage, and the enduring spirit of unity that defines this region. Naming this bridge in honor of these gentlemen pays tribute to their extraordinary legacies — individuals who transcended barriers, fostered cultural exchange, and used their talents to build bridges between people.”
The Federal Highway Administration has approved a draft environmental assessment for the project, and public hearings will be held in November, according to TDOT’s website.
Design is underway, and right-of-way coordination should begin later this year, according to ARDOT’s press release. Construction is estimated to start in fiscal year 2026.

It was formerly known as the Anderson Landfill. (Photo courtesy of Washington Department of Ecology)Multiple fires have been reported this summer at Rocky Top Environmental, the limited-purpose landfill west of Yakima owned by the Mill Creek-based recycling company DTG.
While the private landfill has had a history of continuously burning fires beneath the surface, the new fires have started as the company moves material from an unlined, temporary cell to a second cell that is lined.
“The fires are not related to operational practices and appear to be the result of oxidation of some degraded materials as they are removed,” said Mark Prentice, spokesperson for DTG. “We have a fire watch in place and suppression equipment onsite to manage these instances should they occur.”
The state Department of Ecology has been alerted to three or four instances of fires from July to mid-August, said Luke LeMond, a hydrogeologist for the agency. In one of the cases, mattresses were on fire, he said.
“This is something we are a little concerned about,” LeMond said.
The limited-purpose landfill is allowed to accept demolition waste, which is loosely defined in state law, he said.
Rocky Top hasn’t been permitted to take mattresses for a few years, and it is plausible that the mattresses were accepted when they were allowed, he said.
“We’re always wrestling with what is permitted and what isn’t. It’s not easy,” LeMond said.
Landfills are not allowed to intentionally burn waste, are required to have a fire response plan, and the facility is required to notify Ecology of fires. Rocky Top has been good about communicating and providing information to Ecology, LeMond said.
Landfill fires are relatively common and usually start from batteries, hot ash, and the exhaust of vehicles and machinery coming into contact with material.
At Rocky Top, these fires seem to be spontaneous, though LeMond doesn’t like the term.
“There’s something going on that causes the conditions for the fires,” LeMond said.
One recent incident prompted a response from local firefighters, he said. But Rocky Top employees usually fight the fire themselves with heavy machinery and water.
Ecology is reviewing information to try to understand what is going on and give the Yakima Health District advice on ways to prevent them in the future.
Prentice said that Rocky Top Environmental’s work moving the material into the new lined cell is nearly complete and that there should be no risk of these fires in the future.
 State pollution board ruling

In other updates, the state Pollution Control Hearings Board determined in August that the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency complied with state law and properly reviewed concerns about the Rocky Top landfill’s potential environmental impacts during permitting.
In April 2024, Nancy Lust, Carole DeGrave, and Friends of Rocky Top appealed a permit issued to DTG by the clean air agency.
The state pollution panel is a quasi-judicial hearings board that’s part of the state’s Environmental and Land Use Hearings Office. After a three-day hearing in May, board released its decision on Aug. 14.
Prentice said that DTG is “pleased the Pollution Control Hearings Board acknowledged the permitting was conducted correctly by the Yakima Regional Clean Air Agency.”
“We continue to work diligently with many regulators to confirm our operations are in compliance, and protect human health and the environment,” Prentice said.
Lust said FORT was disappointed by the decision.
“We will be looking closely at the PCHB findings and making our decision about whether to appeal or not,” Lust said. “Our mission is to prevent further degradation to the land, air and water resources around Rocky Top.”
 What’s next after landfill law passed

Though the Legislature passed a law last session that gave Ecology more of a say in the landfill permitting process and local health districts the ability to fine landfills for noncompliance, neither Ecology nor the Yakima Health District has made internal changes to be able to do so yet.
The law was championed by Lust and other members of FORT, who believed that local and state regulators lacked teeth in enforcing the rules.
“The Yakima Health District is researching what the Health District’s capabilities are with issuing and enforcing the fines described in House Bill 1154, specifically. However, there have been no changes made by the Health District’s bylaws on this topic at this time,” said Shawn Magee, Yakima Health District director of environmental health in a statement.
LeMond said changes have not yet been made at Ecology either, and that changes to the rules take time.
“Someone has to develop those new procedures so we can follow them in a consistent way,” LeMond said.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)The chair of the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education said Thursday that he will propose giving interim Chancellor Brent Sanford  the job on a long-term basis. 
Sanford, a former lieutenant governor, was named the interim leader of the North Dakota University System in April. Sanford replaced Mark Hagerott, who left the position at the end of  April.  
Black, who was named board chair in May, spoke to the Legislature’s Higher Education Institutions Committee that was meeting in Dickinson. Black said he favored skipping a nationwide search in favor of giving Sanford the job.

Black said a search would likely cost more than $100,000 and still lead the board back to Sanford. 
He praised Sanford’s work as interim chancellor and said a search “is going to lead us right back to the person we think we know would be the best for the job.”
The eight-member board would have to approve the proposal. 
Sanford is former mayor of Watford City and holds a bachelor’s degree in accounting from the University of North Dakota. He had been interim president of Bismarck State College before being named interim chancellor. Before that, he had been working for the BSC Office of Workforce and Economic Development. 
Sanford, a Republican, served as lieutenant governor under Gov. Doug Burgum for six years before resigning in January 2023. 
Black noted that the board is evaluating what the leadership position should be called. It has been called chancellor, but some states use commissioner and the state constitution refers to a commissioner and chief executive officer. 
“The commissioner, chancellor, whatever title you want to use, is not an academic post,” Black said. “It is very much an executive leadership post.” 
Hagerott, who had led the university system since 2015, had a doctorate degree. Other recent chancellors have had a master’s degree or other advanced degree.

Sen. Jonathan Sickler, R-Grand Forks, chair of the committee, said that one of the advantages of a search process is that it forces the board to undergo a kind of strategic planning process as it evaluates what they are looking for in a candidate. 
Black said the board would still plan to do an evaluation of the roles of responsibilities of University System leadership, including the board. 
“Brent understands that and he is fully on board with that process,” Black said. 
The State Board of Higher Education will meet Sept. 23 at Minot State University. 
Sanford did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Thursday.

The State Treasurer’s Office has already begun dipping into a $51 million appropriation of general revenue to award private-school scholarships under the MOScholars program, state attorneys said Thursday. Over 6,100 students have been promised scholarships, and any delay would be a “massive disruption to the MOScholars program,” William Seidleck, principal deputy solicitor general, told the judge.
But Loretta Haggard, attorney for the Missouri branch of the Missouri National Education Association, argued Thursday that MOScholars lacks authority to pull directly from general revenue, and taxpayers would be harmed by the illegal use of funds. 
MNEA filed requests at the end of June for a temporary restraining order to block the flow of funds until trial and a permanent injunction. But the attorney general’s office asked the judge to reject MNEA’s request for an expedited timeline, citing the recent departure of two top attorneys. 
The delay pushed the hearing on the injunction past the start of the school year. 
“You can’t just turn on a hose of $51 million in general revenue and force it through the tax credit framework,” Haggard said. “There are gaps in that framework.”
MOScholars was created in a 2021 law which set up the program to work through educational nonprofits approved by the state treasurer. Funding is initiated by donations, which taxpayers are able to receive back as a tax credit equal to 100% of their contribution.
The law set up a fund, the Missouri Empowerment Scholarship Accounts fund, “to be used by the state treasurer for marketing and administrative expenses or the costs incurred in administering the scholarship program, whichever is less.”
But last month, that account received a $48 million infusion, which the treasurer’s office is using to pay for student scholarships.
Haggard argues that using the fund this way is “inconsistent” with the 2021 law, telling the judge to block the outflow of funds before it is too late.
“The money will be gone (if the court doesn’t pause payments),” she said. “Nobody seriously thinks that this court will be able to order the families or the schools to discard the money. That will be gone.”
Seidleck argued that although state law doesn’t explicitly allow for the direct spending of general revenue, there are no provisions that directly forbid it. “Statutory silence,” he said, is not enough.
When deciding whether to issue a temporary restraining order, Circuit Court Judge Brian Stumpe must consider the potential harm to affected parties against the public interest. This piece was a large part of the state’s and intervenor EdChoice’s arguments.
EdChoice Legal Advocates joined the case earlier this month, representing three parents who say the influx of state funding will expand their access to scholarships.
Prior to the $51 million appropriation, MOScholars had a growing waitlist, said EdChoice attorney Bryan Cleveland. With the added funding, the program is now more reliable for those who were previously awarded scholarships, and parents are hopeful to get their other children access as well.
“The plaintiffs have asserted taxpayer standing but they haven’t stated any personal harm,” he said. “In contrast, the families have demonstrated irreparable harm because they need the scholarships to pay not just for tuition but also to pay for reading tutors.”
Seidleck emphasized that the program prioritizes students with an individualized education plan, which serves students with learning and physical disabilities.
MNEA, which is a union of public-school teachers, won’t be harmed by the vouchers, he argued, saying it might help public schools by “facilitating smaller class sizes.” MNEA President Rebeka McIntosh, who was watching the arguments, chuckled at his argument.
Stumpe had few questions Thursday, apart from asking Cleveland how the intervening families would be harmed. He told attorneys he plans on ruling by the end of the day Friday.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/082125_colecountycircuitcourt-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

CHELSEA —- On Thursday morning, the state moved James Perry, a man found not guilty by reason of insanity for killing his daughter, to a non-hospital mental health facility. 
An Orange County Superior Court judge decided at a hearing on Thursday morning that Perry, who had been detained in prison for four years, will now live in a residential setting while remaining under 24-hour care and supervision. He was taken immediately afterwards to a residential program run by the Clara Martin Center and Health Care and Rehabilitation Services of Southeastern Vermont, according to the court order. 
Prosecutors and Perry’s defense discussed the alternatives of putting him in a hospital setting, which would offer more intensive supervision, or releasing him with no direct oversight. Both sides agreed that it was appropriate to place Perry in a non-hospitalization level of care, an in-between to those possibilities. 
In the hearing, Judge Daniel Richardson grappled with where to place the 74-year-old man who shot and killed his daughter, Karina Rheaume, when she came to bring him cookies and check on him in May 2021. 
Perry was charged with second degree murder, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and reckless endangerment. But in April of this year, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity. 
At that point, with that finding, Perry couldn’t be sentenced to prison, so the case became a matter of managing Perry’s health. Thursday’s proceeding was a hospitalization hearing only, Richardson reminded members of the public, who filled over half the court room. 
“The court doesn’t have a free hand. The court is obligated to follow the law,” Richardson said. Because Perry is no longer considered a criminal, the court has to weigh his personal liberties against concerns that he could pose a risk to himself and others, he added. 
The violence of the crime leaves some to worry that Perry needs a more secure level of oversight. Calista Diane, a close friend of Rheaume’s daughter, stood outside the old courthouse and hugged the family after the hearing. 
“I’ve seen way too many people fall through the cracks,” Diane said as tears welled in her eyes. The court ruling devastated her. She thinks Perry belongs locked up in prison, she said. 
“His daughter brought him cookies and he slaughtered her,” Diane said. 
Rheaume’s family declined to comment after Thursday’s hearing. 
After the mental health treatment he got in prison, Perry appeared to be a changed man, Richardson said. But the judge still had a message for him. 
“I want to address you directly,” Richardson said, pausing to look at Perry from his bench. 
“You have to participate,” Richardson said — emphasizing Perry’s responsibility to keep himself and the public safe. 
Rheaume’s family asked the court earlier this month to keep him under more intensive supervision, citing concerns for their safety, according to reporting from Valley News. 
Diane said that she understands the family’s pain. “They’re terrified,” she said. 
Richardson explained that the court is charged with operating within the law no matter the pressures of public opinion. He asked people in the courtroom to remain respectful, reminding them it was not a town meeting. 
While everyone was silent, benches creaked as onlookers shifted their weight. Some took notes as the hearing went on. 
Crystal Barry, a mental health professional with Burlington’s Therapeutic Works Incorporated, testified before the court. Barry had personally spoken with Perry over a dozen times to discuss his mental state and placement options, she said. 
Barry considers the move to supervised residential care a “good step down for future observation,” she said. 
In the facility, Perry will live among six other patients, be monitored by staff around the clock and be accompanied by staff if he leaves the program’s facilities, Barry said. Perry hasn’t shown signs of delusional thinking for over a year. That’s partly due to the fact that he’s been in a social and regulated environment — something they want to continue, she explained. 
The court order stands for 90 days. After that, it must be revisited in family court, now that the case is no longer criminal. 
“I’m sure we’ll all be here in 90 days,” said Diane, the friend of the victim’s family, gesturing to the small crowd that lingered in front of the courthouse.

Aug. 21, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceMichigan schools facing uncertainty over the state budget are beginning to issue layoff notices to staff, adding another layer of disarray over the Legislature’s strained and stagnant funding plans for the coming fiscal year.
On Thursday, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) eschewed schools’ claims that new layoffs were related to the current budget fight. Hall also doubled down on his assertion that his chamber’s budget would provide them with more money than in years past.
In a regularly hosted news conference, the speaker told schools to hold the line and wait it out, promising that the House’s full budget would be presented soon, and that negotiations on a consensus plan with the Senate would emerge swiftly.
Those who represent and advocate for Michigan’s K-12 schools, however, said Thursday that districts can’t wait for the Legislature’s fight to continue, and the longer they do, tough decisions would need to be made.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At present, the Legislature is now many weeks past its statutory July 1 deadline to complete and present to the governor an appropriations bill to fund state departments, public schools and higher education. Although the deadline has been missed before, this year’s budget fight is novel in the fact that partisan gridlock has stalled movement on negotiations.
A full budget has been passed by the Michigan Senate, but the chamber lacks a clear roads funding plan, which the Republican-controlled House has blamed for the current impasse.
The House has yet to present its full budget funding state operations, but it has crafted a roads plan and passed K-12 and higher education budgets. The Democrats who control the Senate say it’s the House that’s holding up the process.
Either way, the two competing school funding plans are diametrically different in their approaches to funding. That’s given K-12 districts no insight into how to best plan for the year to come. To give themselves some cushion, some districts are already either talking about laying off staff or have already done so.
In his press conference to address the ongoing stalemate held Thursday, Hall was asked if he had comment on those schools who are directly tying the budget crisis to their decisions on layoffs.
The question from a reporter focused mainly on school safety and mental health staff that were allegedly getting the ax. 
To that, Hall said that the previous Democratic trifecta, which held power for the last two years, slashed funding for mental health and school safety, and that his chamber’s schools budget this year was a restoration of those areas.

Some have criticized the House budget because it rolled up all the categorical spending line items for funding areas into the total per-pupil allowance, which gave schools no clear direction on how to spend that money. Critics have also said that schools would remove free meals and other key programs if the House budget was adopted into law because the Legislature no longer mandated that they fund them.
Hall said boilerplate language in the House education budget mandates money to be used for mental health and schools.
“Right before the [2024] election, they tried to fix that and put a little bit in, but it’s still way down,” Hall said. “One of the main things we’re trying to achieve in our budget, we … put a rule in place that you must fund school safety and mental health with this money.”
In response to the talk of layoffs in the face of potentially more school funding from the House this year, Hall said he believed those layoffs were more performance based than anything else.
Another reporter noted that despite whatever the House put in its version of the education budget, the lower chamber and its big brother in the Senate still needed to work out a consensus conference budget. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer would also have considerable influence in those negotiations. That could take time even after the House presents its full plan and the Senate finally moves forward on road funding.
Schools would be left in the lurch despite promises of increased funding because they don’t have that money now.
Again, Hall asked schools to hold the line and not make any rash personnel decisions because the money was coming.
“If I was a school superintendent, and I was watching this and I saw that all parties want to increase my funding, I wouldn’t be making all of these crazy decisions, because I see that all parties are trying to fund me more,” Hall said. “I would assume they’ll work it out. … All three budgets [the House, the Senate and the governor’s recommendations] increase funding for schools, it’s just the House Republicans who are increasing it the most.”
Hall chalked up the disconnect to the new House budgeting process, adding that the chamber was doing it “in a way that is a little different than the establishment is used to.”
Robert McCann, executive director of the K-12 Alliance of Michigan, said schools have a reason to be worried as the budget battle rages on.
“The reason for these layoffs is directly tied to the fact that they haven’t passed a budget,” McCann told Michigan Advance. “The budget is more than the per pupil [amount]. The budget is more than the total amount you’re getting. It’s pieces that create an entire budget for a school year, and those individual pieces fund specific programs and specific personnel.”
McCann said schools typically build their budgets in June, even though, as in years past, a final consensus budget might not be completed.
“But we were pretty far along in the process [in previous years] where they can take some reasonable guesses as to where their final budget is and what it’s going to look like,” McCann said. “They might have had to come back and tweak it a little bit at the end of the summer, but it’s close, and they could make enough informed decisions to keep personnel or to bring on new ones.”
In the current saga, McCann said schools have nothing to go on.
“With all due respect to the speaker, I couldn’t disagree more. Yes, they had two budgets that have been passed, but they were radically different from one another,” he added. “That’s where I say, it’s not just the fact that there were two budgets passed that would give them some amount of money, it’s that there were two budgets that contained very different funding and ways of distributing that funding.”
Hall gives clearer look at ‘waste cutting’ calculus
Aside from the dilemma facing schools, the roads issue continues to take precedence in the budget talks for Hall, as does the new Republican ethos to target funding areas that they consider “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
The speaker has said that the full budget hasn’t come out yet, despite an optimistic view from his appropriations chair, state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton) that it could be delivered as soon as next week, because his team keeps finding wasteful spending areas that it says it can cut safely and responsibly.

Although that concept has been a national GOP talking point, Hall has only given a few examples of where waste was located in previous spending plans and where cuts might come from.
On Thursday, he shared more, targeting the Department of Attorney General, the Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, the Department of Civil Rights and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.
Hall showed slides comparing the budgets of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder to the last two budget cycles when Democrats held all levers of power in state government.
By his caucus’ math, the attorney general’s office budget grew by 22%; management and budget by 36%; civil rights by 80%; labor by 92%; and EGLE by 107%.
For Hall, that was evidence enough for Republicans to take the ax to those ballooning departments and label that all as waste.
Budget no closer as talk continues
The numerous press conferences and tough talk in Lansing, on both sides of the aisle, have brought the budget no closer to completion.
Hall previously said it was his estimation that the full budget proposal would land by Sept. 30, the constitutional drop deadline for the fiscal year before the government lands in a shutdown. The last government shutdown in Michigan lasted only a few hours, with a consensus reached soon afterward.
The Advance asked Hall what that might look like if both budgets are delivered and passed by each chamber on Sept. 30 or Oct. 1, and how swiftly he believed the two sides could come to agreement to stave off a potential shut down.
Hall has said his team was putting together “the perfect budget,” and therefore, any shut down might only last a few hours in this round, if it happens at all.
“In that scenario, we would only need a couple of hours at that point,” Hall said. “But I think we’ll try to give them a little more time, a few more days than that, to work through this.”
In the face of sneering political mistrust between Democrats and Republicans, Hall’s assumption appears highly optimistic.
The speaker, however, blamed any infighting on two opposing factions within the Democratic Party, and not on House Republicans.
“If the Democrats can unify and empower their leader, Governor Whitmer, we’ll get a deal done in about two weeks, probably less,” Hall said. “I think when I show this to her, she will see a lot of this waste, fraud and abuse, and will help us eliminate it. And then I think we share a common goal of getting the roads fixed.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/1000068653-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

Tony Evers over administrative rulemaking. (Wisconsin Examiner photo)Republican leaders of the Legislature moved Thursday to block the Evers administration from bypassing legislative committees in implementing administrative rules.
Republican leaders of the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization (JCLO), with members from both the Assembly and the Senate, sent committee members a motion Thursday instructing the Legislative Reference Bureau not to finalize or publish any rules unless they have gone through a review by the Legislature in accordance with Wisconsin law.
The motion came two days after a published report that Gov. Tony Evers  instructed cabinet heads to skip the Legislature in the final steps of the rulemaking process.
It is the latest development in an ongoing feud between the Democratic governor and Republican leaders in the Legislature over the power of the executive branch to write rules in order to carry out state laws.
In a memo Aug. 12, Evers told department secretaries, “There no longer remains any statutory requirement to wait for legislative committee review before promulgating a rule once I have approved it.”
The governor’s memo cited the July 8 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling in the case Evers v. Marklein that curtailed the power of the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules (JCRAR) to block executive branch rulemaking.
In the 4-3 decision, which has become known as Evers v. Marklein II, the Court majority ruled that state laws giving JCRAR broad powers to block administrative rules indefinitely were unconstitutional.
“This is good and important news as it means we can — and must — continue the people’s work in earnest,” Evers wrote in the memo, first reported by WisPolitics.com. “Accordingly, I am directing agencies to submit rules that have made it through that relevant part of the process to the Legislative Reference Bureau for finalization and publication.”
The motion distributed to JCLO members Thursday takes direct aim at the assertion in Evers’ memo.
The motion states that “the Legislative Reference Bureau (LRB) shall neither finalize nor publish any rules or proposed rules that failed to comply with the standing committee statutory requirements of s. 227.19 (2) to (4), Stats., including rules or proposed rules that have already been submitted to the LRB.”
Those statutes require that when administrative rules are in final draft form, the Legislature must be notified, a detailed report on the rule must be submitted, and the rule must be reviewed by a standing committee of the Legislature.
There are 27 administrative rules submitted to the Legislative Reference Bureau currently awaiting publication in the Administrative Register.
The bureau director, Rick Champagne, told the Wisconsin Examiner on Thursday that 13 of those rules have not yet completed standing committee review. Those have been classified as not to be published.
“Evers v. Marklein II did not address the constitutionality of standing committee review of proposed administrative rules,” Champagne wrote in an email message.
Among the rules held up pending review are one addressing the state’s policy on gray wolf management and one on surface water degradation. 
The remaining 14 rules have completed the standing committee review and are before the Joint Committee for the Review of Administrative Rules or have completed that process, according to Champagne.  
“I believe these are ready for publication under Evers v. Marklein II,” Champagne told the Examiner.
“JCLO has the authority to direct the manner in which the LRB will carry out its statutory duties,” Champagne added.  “The Wisconsin Supreme Court, in Evers v. Marklein II, did not eliminate standing committee review of proposed administrative rules.  If JCLO so directs, the LRB will not finalize or publish any proposed administrative rules that have not completed standing committee review.”
The paper ballot votes on the motion are due Friday and results are expected to be posted by the end of the day. The motion is expected to pass given the committee’s GOP majority.
The committee’s Republican co-chairs, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate President Mary Felzkowski, issued a press release Thursday calling Evers’ action to sidestep submitting rules to the Legislature for committee review a “direct contradiction” of the Court’s ruling.
“In Evers v. Marklein, the Wisconsin Supreme Court clearly stated that the Legislature ‘alone maintains the ability to amend, expand, or limit the breadth of administrative rulemaking in other branches” of government, the press release said. “Governor Tony Evers is attempting to circumvent statutory requirements that are part of the rule-making process and that no court has held to be invalid in any respect.”
“We are following the law and maintaining the fundamental checks and balances of lawmaking,” Vos and Felzkowski said in a joint statement. “The governor is flagrantly disregarding the rule of law and egregiously abusing the power of his office.”
Evers’ communications director, Britt Cudaback, countered with a charge that the Republican lawmakers were defying the law. 
“Republicans are reaching new levels of lawlessness, whether it’s President Trump trying to take over Washington DC, Republicans in Texas trying to rig maps and elections in their favor, or Republicans in Wisconsin who appear poised to disobey decisions made by our state’s highest court,” Cudaback wrote in an email message. “Republicans are not above the law — they should follow the law like everyone else is expected to.”

Employees allege perpetual turnover, unscheduled work hours and safety concerns in decision to unionize.
The post Laramie cement plant workers buck Wyoming’s anti-union politics, vote to organize appeared first on WyoFile .","Citing alleged tensions with management, perpetual turnover, safety concerns and unpredictable schedules, hourly employees at a Laramie cement plant voted to organize Wednesday.
Nearly 80 workers at the Mountain Cement Company plant will join the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers after a 40-26 vote and years of indecision about organizing amid a staunchly anti-union cultural and political environment in Wyoming. Only 5.6% of wage and salary employees in Wyoming last year were union members, down from a high of 13.4% in 1990, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2024 rate was well below the national average of 9.9%.
Persistent demands to work unscheduled overtime and alleged intimidation by management pushed workers to seek union protections, some employees told WyoFile.
“Just to talk about [the successful vote to organize] makes me teary eyed,” said Alex Hicks, who works in maintenance as a mechanic and welder. “I was threatened with my job, so now that this is here, I feel like it’s a big weight off my shoulders. Now I don’t have to worry about looking over my shoulder everyday wondering, ‘Is this going to be my day or not?'”

For nearly a century, the cement plant has been considered a blue-collar staple of the college town’s economy, and a place where workers could earn a comfortable living without an advanced degree. But sentiments among employees began to change over the past decade as management seemed to incrementally adopt a “corporate” attitude toward workers, said Robert Hodges, a former lead electrician and automation technician at the plant.
“The younger guys that come out as laborers, they have bad working conditions,” Hodges said. “They’re treated like garbage, and the turnover is tremendous. I can’t think of one laborer that’s been out there for longer than, like, two years.
“In our community,” Hodges continued, “you can go talk to anybody on the street and find somebody who has worked out there, been fired from out there, somebody who is a disgruntled, former employee.”
Hodges worked at the plant for 13 years before being fired in June. He alleges it was for his role in trying to organize a union vote. He’s asking the National Labor Relations Board to hear his case. 
“Now that we are unionized out there, I would be willing to return — absolutely,” Hodges said.
WyoFile’s inquiries to Mountain Cement Company and its parent company, Eagle Materials, were not returned by press time.
Driven to organize
The cement plant taps multiple quarries in the region that supply rock and aggregate. The material is crushed and then baked inside long boilers heated by coal. The slurry is processed into high-quality “portland” cement, according to the company. Cement is in high-demand for things like road construction and buildings, and wind turbine developers in the region use the product to build solid bases for wind towers.

The nature of the operation — high temperatures, heavy equipment, moving parts and dusty operations that require continual maintenance — demands special attention to safety, according to workers.
“They [management] preach safety 24/7,” Hodges said. “You know, ‘That’s the most important thing,’ until it affects production. Then, all of the sudden, it’s like, ‘Nope. Now we have to get it done no matter what it takes.’”
Frequently, an employee will point out a piece of equipment that’s about to fail, Hodges said. But the fix is put off until it actually breaks down, usually requiring workers to come in during their time off. “Seems like it’s always at 2 a.m. on a Saturday,” he quipped. Management seems to routinely spring unscheduled maintenance tasks, “always on a Friday afternoon,” he added.
Hodges grew up in an anti-union family who worked in the trona patch in southwest Wyoming. For most of his adulthood, he thought he was anti-union, he said, or didn’t think about it much. That was the prevailing attitude at the plant for a long time, but working conditions and relations with management seemed to continually decline, making workers desperate, he explained.

There’s been talk about organizing at the plant for years, Hodges said, and workers gradually began to warm up to the idea. He also attributes this week’s vote to unionize to a growing number of younger workers who “aren’t so set in their ways,” he said.
Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred, who helped advise the cement plant workers, along with the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, said she was worried sick for the workers ahead of the vote. She alleged the company used typical anti-union tactics in recent months, like mandatory meetings to learn about the pitfalls of working in a union.
In general, management can be particularly retaliatory towards employees after a failed vote to organize, she said. “It can be really just devastating.” 
She was on an adrenaline high, though, after she learned about the successful vote.
“This means so much to Wyoming workers who feel voiceless, like there’s nowhere to turn,” Kindred said. “We’re the reddest right-to-work state in the nation, and they just proved that, even in Wyoming, you can fight and freaking win.”
Hicks said his teenage son frequently begged him to quit working at the plant, because he’d continually get called into work when he was scheduled to be off duty. “There was just no work/life balance,” he said.
The mood among workers was exuberant after Wednesday’s vote, which was tallied in the evening. Hicks said a co-worker sent him a text: “I’ve never been ready to go into work at MCC [Mountain Cement Company] except for tomorrow.”
“This is the first time I’ve seen everybody come together,” Hicks said. “I’ve never seen more hugs and high fives and handshakes and just smiling faces. It was awesome, like the birth of a child, you know. The whole family is just excited that it happened.”

Credit: Justin Taylor/The Current GA/CatchLight Local/Report for AmericaThis story has been republished through a partnership with The Current, an independent, in-depth and investigative journalism website for Coastal Georgia.
International Paper, a longtime pillar of Coastal Georgia’s economy, announced Thursday that it will permanently close its Savannah and Riceboro plants by the end of September and cut some 1,100 hourly and salaried jobs.

The closures of the company’s containerboard and packaging facilities in Savannah and its containerboard mill and timber and lumber operation in Riceboro are part of “actions to enhance its ability to serve and grow with customers while improving its manufacturing footprint,” the firm said in a news release.
While eliminating its operations in Savannah and Riceboro, the firm said it will invest $250 million for renovations at its Riverdale mill in Selma, Alabama, to produce container board and sell its global cellulose.
In its press release, the firm, the world’s largest pulp and paper company, said it will shutter its operations in Savannah and Riceboro “in phases by the end of September 2025.”
IP director of communications, Amy Simpson, said there are approximately 700 workers at the Savannah Mill and 100 at the box plant. The Riceboro plant employs about 300.
“We understand how deeply these decisions affect our employees, their loved ones, and the surrounding communities,” said Tom Hamic, executive vice president and president of the company’s North America Packaging Solutions business.
“We are committed to supporting both our employees and customers as we navigate this transition.”
Reactions
The firm’s operations in Savannah and the surrounding area stretch back nearly 88 years. It has employed generations of mill workers, boosting their families and the region’s economy.

In a statement, Savannah Mayor Van Johnson expressed disappointment about the closure and concern for the 650 Savannah-based employees. 
“Through seasons of change and challenge, International Paper has emerged to be a great corporate partner to our community,” he said. “As Savannah has always done, we will rise together. By combining our collective talent, wisdom, and resources, we will work to ensure that our neighbors have new opportunities to provide for themselves and their families.”
In Liberty County, county commission chair Donald Lovette was still processing the news on Thursday morning. “”All of a sudden, your life is kind of in limbo. So my heart goes out to all of them, especially those who are near retirement. It’s going to be quite an adjustment for them,” he said.
Savannah Area Chamber of Commerce President and CEO Bert Brantley echoed the emphasis on IP contributions to the city and willingness to work to place workers.
“Our Chamber is devastated to hear the news of International Paper’s decision to close its Savannah and Riceboro mills. IP has long been a terrific employer, engaged corporate citizen, and strong partner of the Chamber. In particular, the local leaders at IP have contributed immensely to the betterment of our community in more ways than we can count. We stand ready to work with our state partners at the Georgia Department of Labor, and our local teams at SEDA and RISE to support the employees as they navigate this next step in their lives.”
The corporate news release omits any mention of the company’s Port Wentworth biomass energy plant. The company operates more than a dozen large paper mills in the U.S.
IP’s Simpson confirmed the Port Wentworth pulp mill will not close but had been sold. “The Port Wentworth pulp mill is not affected by today’s closure announcements but is part of our Global Cellulose Fibers business and is included in the sale of that business to AIP, which was also announced today.”
Liberty County impact

The history of the plant goes back nearly 6 decades in Riceboro. The Interstate Paper Corporation established the Riceboro Paper Mill in 1966, the largest privately owned industry Liberty County had ever had, was established near the North Newport River at Riceboro in 1967. It was the site of the old Montevideo Plantation rice farm.
The plant grew to represent $300 million in economic impact for the county, according to Riceboro Mayor Chris Stacy, a 29-year IP employee. He heard the news after he woke up around noon after working last night’s overnight shift.
State Rep. Al Williams, who is chairman of the Liberty County Development Authority, described news of the closures as “difficult for our community, for our region.”
“My first concern is for the people whose livelihoods are affected, men and women who have given years of hard work and loyalty to these operations,” he said. The mill The mill specialized in producing Kraft linerboard, which contains 25%-30% recycled fiber.
Williams, who also serves as chairman of the Liberty County Development Authority, said the agency had offered “strong incentives for International Paper to stay and invest here. I know the company has not made this decision lightly though we had been working and hoping for a different outcome.
The authority, he said, would “do its best” to coordinate with company leadership to understand the timeline and transition plan and would join with local, regional and state agencies to “stand up support services and programs.”
The authority’s CEO, Brynn Grant, said the agency was moving immediately “to support impacted workers and local businesses in every way we can.”
She said she planned to coordinate with SNF, another Riceboro employer, to help find opportunities for IP workers.  “They certainly need people, and these will be people that have a great skill set who can blend into what they do, so we’re looking forward to working with them. She said Workforce Coastal, too, we’re going to work with them, of course Savannah Tech, we’re going to coordinate with them — all the players when it comes to gainful employment.”
Lovette said the county would try to make the process smooth for employees. “About 40% of the employees are from the Liberty County area. The rest of them would be from other areas,” he said. IP was Riceboro’s oldest and second largest employer; SNF is the largest.
A midday check of the Riceboro complex showed operations as usual, with a steady stream of timber trucks entering and leaving the plant. A security officer referred questions to Simpson.
Cars and trucks in the employee parking lot bore license plates not only from Liberty County but also from several surrounding counties: Long, Wayne, McIntosh, Brantley, and Glynn — indicating families throughout Coastal Georgia will be directly impacted by the closures.
“It’s even going to affect your loggers because the Savannah one is closed, Riceboro’s closed … gotta go to I guess Rayonier or either Brunswick, because there’s no more logging in this area,” Stacy said. “It’s going to affect everybody.”
“How do we recover truck drivers, logging company, all those people are affected in that area, you know? I’m really concerned about that,” Stacy said.
Georgia Speaker of the House Jon Burns (R-Newington), a fifth-generation timber farmer, also cited the longer tail of the closures. “I understand firsthand the challenges of facing changing markets and economic instability. These mill closures will undoubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,” Burns said.
Stacy said that the timeline is tight for workers: “Sept. 8 is going to be the last operational [day] of making product, and the gate’s supposed to be locked on Oct. 20.” He said that the company is “doing some negotiation for service pay for some of the people out there” regarding severance. He also said he’d contacted IP with “just some concerns about making sure they get some help out there for the guys to cope with whatever’s going on. Just kind of saying that, in times like that, you’ve just really got to be careful because you don’t know where people’s minds’ (are) at.”
Corporate decision
International Paper employs more than 65,000 people and has operations in more than 30 countries. Its net sales in 2024 were $18.6 billion. In its press release, it said the moves announced Thursday were “part of a series of strategic changes to achieve an advantaged cost position, deliver a superior customer experience and maintain a high relative supply position as part of its ongoing transformation journey.”

Hamic said while “difficult,” the cutbacks in Georgia and investments in Alabama that were announced Thursday were “essential to positioning International Paper for long-term success, enabling us to focus on the geographies, customers, and products where we can create the most value.”
Leaving history
In Liberty County, commission chair Lovette said the county had been working to help IP stay in the county. He said the move would leave a cultural and emotional void.
“I remember people who were able to leave the timbering process, you know? Because Liberty County was primarily agricultural, of course, and timber,” he said. “And when that company came, they gave people a hand up, if you will. People were able to make a good living and provide for their families right from that company.”
In Riceboro, IP’s plant was previously known as Interstate Paper.
“They’ve been there the longest of anybody. Interstate Paper, I still go back to that name, they were the bread and butter for Liberty County for many, many years,” Lovette said. “A lot of our employees have been gainfully employed there. They were able to build homes and send their children to college, and all those kinds of things that made them a major and respected employee here in Liberty County. It’s been Interstate Paper, International Paper … we owe them a debt of gratitude.”

He notified the House clerk on Thursday afternoon. House Republicans announced it shortly after.
“Please accept this letter as formal notice of my resignation from the Colorado House of Representatives, effective immediately,” the Berthoud Republican wrote.
He did not provide a reason for the immediate resignation, but House Democratic leadership announced earlier in the day that they planned to censure Armagost for taking a photo of a Democratic representative and sending it to an internal Republican group chat in April, as reported by Colorado Public Radio. In that group chat, Republican members compared the Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Yara Zokaie of Fort Collins to a prostitute because of her clothing. The photo became the center of social media harassment against Zokaie.
House GOP spokesperson Laurel Boyle gave no further comment on Armagost’s resignation.
Armagost had already planned to leave the Legislature in September to take a job in Arizona. He was excused from the chamber on Thursday.

“If you’re working hard every single day right here in the United States, or if you’re building a business right here in the United States, you ought to have a tax code that rewards you instead of punishes you,” Vance said, claiming that OBBBA would increase take-home pay for working class A Americans by over $10,000 over several years, primarily through tax cuts, specifically pointing to a deduction in overtime tax and tips, as well as an increased child tax credit.

He contrasted these policies with what he said was Sen. Ossoff’s opposition to the bill, alleging that Ossoff voted against it “because he is allegedly worried about people getting paid while they’re healthy.”
Ossoff, who is up for reelection in 2026, said in a statement that Vance’s visit to Georgia was to defend the “hugely unpopular budget law.” According to a press release from Ossoff’s campaign, Vance’s visit came during a week when multiple news outlets reported how Trump’s budget law was creating a crisis for rural health care in Georgia.
“I think it is embarrassing for the Vice President to be coming to Georgia to sell a policy that is already resulting in harm to hospitals in the state of Georgia, that’s projected to throw more than 100,000 people off of health care in the state of Georgia,” Ossoff said in a statement.
Vance repeatedly linked immigration to the strain on public resources, particularly health care, and repeatedly used strong language regarding immigration, framing it as a threat to American workers and public services. He claimed in his speech that cuts to Medicaid would only impact “illegal aliens,” claiming that cuts are “not about kicking people off the health care.”
“It’s about people kicking illegal aliens the hell out of this country so we can preserve health care,” Vance said.
He said that government-provided benefits like Medicare and Medicaid should be reserved for American citizens, not “illegal aliens” who he claimed have no legal right to be in the country.
Derek Dooley, a former football coach and candidate for U.S. Senate, also took aim at Ossoff, accusing Ossoff of supporting policies that led to high inflation and borders that were “wide open.”
“And now, he resists any type of progress we’re making, especially all the common-sense provisions of the big, beautiful bill,” Dooley said.
U.S. Rep Mike Collins from the 10th Congressional District, who is also running for U.S. Senate, also used his time to criticize Ossoff, saying that Ossoff “doesn’t reflect Georgia’s values” and called him a “trust fund kid” who comes to Georgia to pay “lip service” who goes to Washington to vote with “the woke.”
“He never had to work hard in his life. He doesn’t know how to build a business, make decisions and have results,” Collins said.
Congressman Buddy Carter, another Republican seeking to run for Ossoff’s seat, also praised OBBBA, blamed immigrants for endangering Medicaid and called for work requirements for the program.
Less than two miles from where Vance spoke, people gathered to protest his appearance. Phyllis Williamson, a 77-year-old resident from Fayetteville, said this was her 21st protest in five months due to deep concern over the budget cuts. She said she was concerned that budget cuts would lead to more hospital closures, as well as cuts to food assistance programs.
“All these cuts are going to hurt us. They’re taking money from poor people,” Williamson said. “Stop hurting the middle class. Stop hurting seniors and children and poor people. Do something for somebody besides the rich.”
Another demonstrator, Loretta Keith, a 65-year-old resident of Fayetteville, said she was protesting the “fascism going on.” She said that as a retired school teacher, she was “doing OK,” but pointed to the children at the protest, saying she was worried about their future.
“I’m 65, but look at these babies out here,” she said. “I’m worried about it going further than it’s gone, and we can’t bring it back, that people are just going to die, just like Nazi Germany, and it breaks my heart.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSC06216-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LENEXA — Leon Patton, a retired assistant U.S. attorney who once prosecuted immigrants for violent crimes, is tired of feeling shamed for supporting immigration enforcement efforts and referring to people as “aliens.”
The 74-year-old traversed the Kansas City metro, from his home in Prairie Village to the Lenexa City Council chambers, to grouse about the community’s backlash to federal raids at local restaurants. The Lenexa police investigation of council member Melanie Arroyo’s citizenship also had been a flashpoint for controversy, but Patton wasn’t concerned with that.
He told the council at Tuesday’s meeting that he wanted to share his “specialized knowledge,” gleaned from 30 years of experience as a federal prosecutor before retiring in 2020. Mainly, he wanted them to know that some immigrants are criminals.
“Please,” he implored, “don’t be misled by things you might read in the newspaper or hear on the news.”
He referenced a Kansas City Star report on the July 30 raids at El Toro Loco restaurants in Lenexa and Kansas City, Kansas. The agents brandished a search warrant that authorized them to seize documents relating to the exploitation of workers — but arrested workers instead.
The raids were typical of how federal agents nationwide are carrying out President Donald Trump’s anti-immigration agenda — ignoring civil rights and indiscriminatingly targeting people who have committed no crime, have legal standing to be in the country, or are in fact U.S. citizens.
But the way Patton sees it, that’s not a complete narrative.
He talked about prosecuting Jorge Carrillo-Hernandez, an immigrant from Mexico who had been deported multiple times and repeatedly committed violent crimes after returning to the U.S. A federal judge in 2018 sentenced Carrillo-Hernandez to six years in prison. Patton said a criminal conviction in Johnson County was related to Carrillo-Hernandez “selling his bride of 19 days, who was three months pregnant.”
“You wonder why there are people in the middle of the political spectrum who vote for someone like Donald Trump? Well, part of it is there are haters out there who think that people like me, who are simply enforcing the laws, are evil,” Patton said.
He lamented how “people on the left,” in his mind, “want to scold and shame and silence the people who disagree with them. They call you racist.”
For example, he asserted, there is nothing wrong with referring to an immigrant as an “alien,” because federal law uses the term to refer to someone who is not a U.S. citizen.
“If you think that it’s somehow racist to use the word ‘alien,’ then I presume you got your education by sitting in movie theaters and watching movies about extraterrestrials,” Patton said. “Meanwhile, some of us get our education by sitting in courtrooms and by reading federal statutes.”

‘Progress and respect’
Arroyo — the council member who was forced to prove her citizenship to police because a local resident complained about something he misread — said in an interview that it was “absolutely reasonable” to arrest the kind of violent criminals Patton talked about.
But, she said, Patton failed to mention that federal authorities are targeting immigrants who aren’t criminals.
“A lot of them have never even committed crimes in their own countries of origin,” Arroyo said. “I think it’s OK to have a conversation about immigration enforcement when it comes to violent offenders, absolutely, but we also need to be considerate of the fact that it’s not the reality today.”
Arroyo, a clinical counselor and art therapist, said she felt “a little bit conflicted” about Patton’s point on the use of shame.
On one hand, she said, “shaming others is counterproductive.” Ideally, she said, she could gently point out “certain language or ways or belief systems that are unacceptable.”
“At the same time, most people don’t feel the need to change unless there is some level of shame. So that’s why I’m saying I’m a little bit conflicted,” Arroyo said. “Because the thing is, we have tried to tell them nicely. Like, ‘Please don’t call us that.’ And they still won’t listen. So think the shaming is just a response to the fact that we’re frustrated, that we feel like we’re not being heard or just completely being dismissed.”
She said he understood why people would use the word “alien” to refer to immigrants, since the term has been used to describe foreigners since the country’s founding. But the argument that is merely a legal term “is an attempt to intellectualize your way out of change,” she said.
“Given today’s use of the word ‘alien’ in sci-fi, and the discriminatory context in which the word is used to dehumanize immigrants, it has become insensitive and outdated,” Arroyo said. “This is similar to the same way the mental health profession discontinued using offensive language to diagnose people with disabilities. Language changes over time, and it’s OK to abandon certain terms for the sake of progress and respect.”

‘Quit alienating people’
In an interview after the meeting, Patton said he had never heard anyone use the word “alien” with the intent to dehumanize someone. He clarified that he believes it’s wrong to call someone an “illegal alien” or “an illegal.” And, he said, he is “not a Trump person by any means.”
He noted that his copy of a Bible printed in 1984 uses the word “alien” but that a newer edition changed the word to “foreigner.”
“OK, I sort of get it,” he said, but added, “I don’t think it’s fair to say you’re being racist” by using the word “alien” to refer to a person.
During his comments to the council, he said people might want to think about how they could “actually effect change in our society.”
“Putting signs on your car — ‘Trump lies.’ Yes, he does. ‘Abolish ICE.’ Not going to happen,” Patton said. “You need to quit alienating people in the middle of the political spectrum by calling them racist and evil simply for applying the laws that are in effect. We’re tired of being bullied. We’re tired of people trying to shame us.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/P8190884-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

Spencer Cox speaks with members of the media during the governor's news conference broadcast by PBS Utah at the Eccles Broadcast Center in Salt Lake City on Thursday, August 21, 2025. (Pool photo by Rick Egan/The Salt Lake Tribune) An at times heated Utah Gov. Cox sparred with reporters Thursday over the fallout from reports that Utah Senate President Stuart Adams initiated passage of a law that later helped his 18-year-old granddaughter reach a plea deal in a criminal case involving sex with a 13-year-old. 
Cox said he didn’t think an ethics investigation or a third-party review is warranted, saying “there’s nothing to investigate.” 
“The facts are abundantly clear. It’s been reported. I don’t think anybody’s denied that what happened, happened,” Cox said, adding he learned about the situation when The Salt Lake Tribune first reported it earlier this month. 
Cox argued the most pertinent question is whether Adams “should have told me about it” or “should he have leaned on me.” 
“I can only imagine how people would have reacted if he had done that,” the governor said. 
“Look, there have been times in my term as governor, when I’ve been so mad at Stuart Adams that I couldn’t see straight on certain bills,” Cox said, without naming those instances. “That has happened a couple of times. I can tell you this is not one of those times.” 



Cox said he believed Adams acted appropriately by not publicly weighing in on the bill or disclosing his relatives’ involvement to other legislators other than his right-hand man, Senate Majority Leader Kirk Cullimore, R-Sandy. 
“I think it was appropriate for the top person in the Senate not to weigh in on this bill, which is exactly what happened,” Cox said. 
In fact, Cox — who signed the bill after it passed last year — said he’s “very grateful that I had no idea that this was impacting someone in his family, in his granddaughter’s family, because it may have changed the way I reacted to the bill.” Instead, he said he was able to focus only on the policy.
The governor added that there’s “no controversy about whether people knew this was in the bill or not.” 
“The only question I have is this is the right policy? And this is a really tough one, guys,” Cox said. “This is a hard one. You have kids in high school being treated differently, depending on where their birthday falls during the year. And if their birthday falls in May instead of June, then they get treated the same as a 50-year-old who had a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old. And that’s the question. Is that fair?”
The Tribune reported that Adams, “surprised by the severity of the charges” that were first filed against his relative, confided with Cullimore and asked him to look into the issue. The original charges included two counts of child rape and two counts of child sodomy, all first-degree felonies, with the possibility of 25 years to life in prison and requirements to register as a sex offender, the Tribune reported. 
Cullimore also said he consulted Cara Tangaro, the defense attorney representing Adams’ granddaughter, for more information on the case and to help draft language that was later put into a sweeping criminal justice bill, SB213, during the Utah Legislature’s 2024 session. 
That provision allowed lower-level charges to be filed against 18-year-olds still enrolled in high school, allowing them to be treated the same as 17-year-olds in similar cases. The bill was not retroactive, and Adams’ relative was not charged with the lower penalties it created, but the new law was referenced in court hearings before the case was resolved with a plea deal.

“You saw the legislative change,” Tangaro told Judge Rita Cornish at sentencing, the Tribune reported. “We all agree that’s not retroactive, but the government did change their offer based on that.”
Ultimately, Adams’ 18-year-old relative took a plea deal that meant she would not serve additional time in jail, would serve four years on probation, and would not register as a sex offender, the Tribune reported. 
In the interview with KSL.com and Deseret News, Adams said his granddaughter made a mistake, but he also argued she received appropriate penalties, saying she was arrested at her high school, spent eight days in jail, and spent more than 500 days under house arrest with an ankle monitor. 
“What a humiliating event,” Adams told the outlets. “Now we’re heaping on her a scarlet letter on her forehead. It’s wrong. The stories are wrong. … She’s been convicted and tried, and now we’re doing it again in the media and it’s wrong.”
The 13-year-old victim’s mother, however, told the Tribune she felt like she was “punched in the gut” after she learned about the law change, and she felt as though her child was an afterthought both in the policy debate and the criminal case. 
“I feel like a law is the law, regardless of who you are, but that wasn’t what was going on here,” the mother told the Tribune. “I feel like [the 18-year-old] just got special treatment …and nobody was going to say anything about it.”
In wake of the Tribune story, calls for Adams’ resignation have come from some Democrats, including Sen. Nate Blouin, D-Millcreek, and Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King. They’ve also come from some corners of the right, with roughly 100 mostly conservative people rallying at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City over the weekend to call for Adams to resign.

Adams has rejected those calls and has denied any wrongdoing, telling KSL.com and Deseret News that he didn’t tell legislators about the case involving his granddaughter in an effort to keep the process fair. In an interview with the outlets, Adams and Cullimore also argued that the bill’s process was proper and not unusual.
“There’s nothing unusual about how this bill came about,” Adams told the outlets. “Every bill that we run has some type of connection to a constituent, to a lobbyist, to an industry leader, to a personal experience a legislator has.”
Other Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, have defended Adams and the process that led to the bill’s passage. He told KSL.com and Deseret News that he didn’t know about the connection to Adams’ granddaughter when the bill was debated, and that’s how it should be. 
At least one Republican legislator, however — the House sponsor of the bill, then-House Majority Whip Karianne Lisonbee, R-Syracuse — has expressed concerns that that section of the omnibus criminal justice bill didn’t go through the same vetting process as the rest of the bill.
In a statement issued last week, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said due to “heightened attention on SB213, I believe it’s important to reconvene stakeholders for further discussion to ensure we have arrived at the right policy.”
“I have spoken with President Adams, and he agrees,” Schultz said. “We will convene a working group to conduct a comprehensive review of state policy in this area to ensure our laws protect public safety, uphold accountability, and serve the best interests of all Utahns.”
Cox on Thursday left the door open to changes to the law, saying when he signed the bill it was a “close call.” 
“Maybe it’s not the right policy. Maybe now that we have an opportunity to reflect on it, maybe it doesn’t go far enough or it goes too far, and that’s what we do. That’s the process,” Cox said.
The governor again defended Adams’ role in the bill. While he brought it to Cullimore to address, he didn’t publicly debate it or tell legislators about his connection to the issue. 
“Every single legislator has experiences in their life where they see something that they feel may be unjust, and that influences the way they bring legislation to the table,” Cox said. “Again, I have lots of reasons to get upset with Stuart Adams. This was not one of them. I’m really grateful he never talked to me about it.”

(Photo by Shayla Blatchford / Courtesy New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Violence Programs)Community organizations from across New Mexico received a boost of public funding this week that they will use over the next year to prevent violence.
The nonprofit New Mexico Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs distributed $1.5 million in one-time state grant funding to 18 different nonprofit organizations practicing evidence-based solutions to violence, according to a news release on Wednesday. The recipients received between $30,000 to $200,000 each, according to the release.
Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs Executive Director Alexandria Taylor told Source NM on Thursday that the grant recipients use public health approaches to preventing people’s harmful behavior in the first place rather than policing it after the fact.
“It’s investing in longer hours at a community center, people who are holding dance lessons for young people, or giving young people and their peers something to be proud of in their communities and in their daily lives,” Taylor said in an interview. “The antidote to violence is joy and connection.”
Director of Prevention Jess Clark told Source the grant recipients are trying to address the root causes of sexual, intimate partner and gun violence; and they already have deep trusted relationships in their communities.
“These are the programs that our communities who are most impacted by violence are already turning to,” he said in an interview. “One incredible thing about doing prevention work that’s rooted in a public health framework is that when you’re focusing on one area, you end up impacting many other areas of violence. So it ends up being money that is very, very well spent.”
Organizations applied for the grants in July, Taylor said. Recipients had to be nonprofits and were chosen based on their proven histories of culturally reflective violence prevention programming and their abilities to complete the work within the next year, Clark said.
For example, Casa Fortaleza offers prevention presentations and educational workshops for survivors of sexual violence in Spanish-speaking communities. The funding will allow them to expand their services, Director of Education and Community Engagement Marian Méndez-Cera said in a statement.
“We focus on proactive solutions rooted in prevention — educating communities, challenging harmful norms, and fostering a culture of respect and consent,” Méndez-Cera said. “As a trauma-informed agency, we provide strength-based, community-driven, linguistically specific services that honor survivors’ dignity and draw from the values, traditions, and collective strength of the communities we serve.”
More than half of all New Mexicans have been sexually assaulted or raped at some point in their life, and 40% have been the victim of some kind of sexual violence while in New Mexico in the previous year, according to a report the coalition commissioned earlier this year.
Unlock Civics New Mexico received another grant for its work empowering young people impacted by incarceration, poverty and trauma to become civic leaders through project-based learning, peer mentorship and advocacy for systemic change.
“Guided by the truth that our liberation is bound together, we are weaving networks of safety and belonging that resist disposability and affirm life,” Unlock Civics NM Program Director Justin Allen said in a statement. “Together, we are building the conditions for safer, more connected communities, not only for today, but as an inheritance of justice and possibility for generations to come.”
Other grant recipients include the Albuquerque-based Keshet Dance Company, Arise Sexual Assault Services in Portales, Tewa Women United in Española and the Chavez County CASA Program in Roswell.
The money comes from the Violence Intervention Program Fund created in 2022 by the New Mexico Legislature and overseen by the New Mexico Department of Health, which hired the Coalition of Sexual Assault Programs to distribute the funds, Taylor said.
The coalition itself received $200,000 to pay for training the grant recipients and evaluating their work based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards, she said.
“We are excited to have this opportunity to expand support for community organizations working on holistic public health approaches to violence intervention,” DOH Office of Injury and Violence Prevention Manager Kathleen Maese told Source on Thursday. “These organizations implement evidence-based, community-centered, and culturally appropriate programs covering upstream prevention and intervention to address violence.”

(Photo courtesy of Rawpixel)Federal Communications Commission documents show internet service providers struggling to bring high-speed connectivity to Montanans, including one provider with contracts from the state through ConnectMT, the state’s organization for building out broadband infrastructure.
Blackfoot Communications told the FCC in May it was not going to be able to finish a project to bring broadband to certain areas, including those that have been targeted for federal funding. 
Blackfoot serves Western Montana and parts of Idaho and specifically has looked to complete projects in rural areas including Plains, Drummond, and Darby. 
Meanwhile, NorthWestern Energy sent the FCC a letter in late February calling into question the construction practices of a multi-state internet service provider, Ziply Fiber, which is attempting to connect as many as 55,000 Montanans with high-speed internet. Ziply has focused on larger cities in Montana, including Missoula, Great Falls, Billings and Butte.
Ziply recently finished a merger process, which prompted the letter, though NorthWestern officially took no position on that acquisition by BCE, Inc. The acquisition was finalized earlier this month.
In another example, Intermountain Infrastructure Group’s legal battle with Burlington Northern Santa Fe centers on easements on railroad property. Court documents in that case stated BNSF had halted permits for all IIG fiber optic projects on the railroad company’s land.
Multiple internet service providers and fiber optic companies appear to be having issues in Montana, though what those impacts are on communities looking for high-speed access is unclear. According to the state’s broadband map, vast swaths of central and eastern Montana are considered “underserved.”
Some of these companies have contracts or are involved with the state’s ConnectMT project in some way. Blackfoot directly has contracts with the nearly billion-dollar program, while IIG is creating the fiber-optic infrastructure some companies with ConnectMT contracts are connecting into. Ziply, meanwhile, is attempting to jump into the fray.
ConnectMT and the state’s broadband buildout was created with two pieces of legislation from 2021 — Senate Bill 297 and House Bill 632. It’s a huge project, not only in cost, but in scale, too. It is estimated nearly a quarter of Montanans do not have an internet subscription of any kind, according to the state.
“The Governor approved 61 projects recommended for funding … covering 61,887 serviceable locations across Montana,” the ConnectMT website reads. “Of these locations, 38,631 are unserved communities, 21,956 are underserved communities, and 1,300 are frontier communities.”
  ‘Alternative funding’

In 2022, Blackfoot Communications applied for and was awarded funding through ConnectMT.
State project recommendation documents show Blackfoot was likely to receive around $60 million dollars for seven projects around the state. 
“Blackfoot will use these grants together with its own capital to build fiber broadband to more locations than ever before,” Blackfoot CEO Jason Williams wrote on the company’s website. “One way or another, Blackfoot plans to bring fiber-based broadband to all of its Cooperative members in the coming years.”
The company was at the top of the state’s priority list, which is shown in the ConnectMT planning documents — project applications are ranked, and Blackfoot Communications is at the top. While not all projects were recommended to be fully funded, every Blackfoot project was. Those documents do not include the number of new high-speed internet connections per project.
Blackfoot Communications did not respond to a request for comment. Locations impacted appeared to be in Missoula and Lake Counties, according to FCC documents.
The letter to the FCC states Blackfoot notified the Montana Broadband Office it wasn’t going to fulfill its obligations, in part “so they can become eligible for alternative funding, particularly Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (“BEAD”) funding.”
Montana qualifies for about $629 million in BEAD funding from that pot which is coming from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. The state Legislature has also squirrelled away money for infrastructure upgrades.
ConnectMT reopened BEAD applications on July 7 of this year.
“The Montana Broadband Office is ready to move the BEAD process forward to finish the drill and connect Montanans,” said Department of Administration Director Misty Ann Giles said in a media release announcing the reopening. “We continue to be grateful for the new guidelines and know that broadband availability for unserved and underserved areas of our state is within reach.”
When asked if there were any long-term concerns with fiber optic providers in Montana in relation to ConnectMT, the Daily Montanan was asked by the program to file a records request.
It’s unclear how much money has been spent in the program since its 2021 inception, how many connections have actually been made and who, exactly, has contracts with the state. The Daily Montanan has filed a records request for every ConnectMT contract to date.
In Blackfoot’s case, costs and money apparently are at the heart of the problems, according to documents filed with FCC.  The company was awarded Rural Digital Opportunity Funding to complete fiber optic upgrades to its system. The letter said the company was “relinquishing” 688 of 2,687 total locations awarded to Blackfoot through the grant in a May, 13, 2025 letter to the FCC. 
It’s unclear if each of the locations represent one business, home, or Community Anchor Institution, which are places like libraries and medical centers. The Flathead Valley, a place where Blackfoot is active, is among the most underserved areas in Montana, according to a five-year BEAD plan document.
“Blackfoot has experienced extraordinary cost increases to build fiber-to-the-premises (“FTTP”). While Blackfoot has made significant progress in building gigabit speed broadband Internet to hundreds of Rural Digital Opportunity Funding (RDOF) locations, it has already spent significantly more capital than it had planned to spend on its entire RDOF project area making it unfeasible to deploy FTTP gigabit speed broadband to the three Census Block Groups (CBGs) that Blackfoot is returning,” the letter reads.
In a response letter, the FCC said it was stopping financial support to Blackfoot for those areas, but would still hold the company responsible for its contractual obligations, according to FCC documents. It said that if Blackfoot doesn’t meet the terms of its contract that it would be placed on a “non-compliance” list.
The FCC said the grant does not provide for partial withdrawals from the program. It was unclear how much money Blackfoot is going to lose and neither FCC document mentions that number.
The FCC also said the census block areas Blackfoot is relinquishing are now available for “alternative funding.”

  ‘Unsafe actions’

Ziply’s problems are different from Blackfoot’s, but could impact thousands of Montanans.
NorthWestern, which owns vast amounts of infrastructure in the state, is concerned with how Ziply is attaching its fiber optic cables to its power poles.
In August 2024, NorthWestern filed a complaint for injunctive relief in Yellowstone County District Court against Ziply.
“In May of 2024, NorthWestern learned that Ziply Pacific, either directly or through Ziply Montana or Ziply Wireless, began attaching infrastructure, to NorthWestern’s poles without waiting for the make-ready work to be approved and completed,” court documents said, which went on to state it was in violation of established agreements.
NorthWestern was represented by Crist, Krough, Alke, & Nord, PLLC. Ziply, meanwhile, was represented by Monica Tranel and Moulton Bellingham P.C.
NorthWestern did not hold back in its letter to the FCC, which included a copy of the complaint and even a sworn statement from a separate investigation the Idaho Public Service Commission is conducting into Ziply.
“The concern we want the FCC to consider is that Ziply has not conducted itself for the good of its employees, customers, or the public,” the letter reads, which is signed by Shannon Heim, a vice president in NorthWestern’s legal department. “Its unsafe actions have negatively impacted, and continue to negatively impact, the communities it purports to serve – which are also our communities.”
The letter also includes agreements between Ziply and NorthWestern, which include specific stipulations for how the internet company could utilize the energy company’s powerlines.
In a 2023 letter from NorthWestern, it stated Ziply was looking to attach lines to approximately 19,500 poles. 
They wanted it to happen quickly, too.
“Ziply desires to expedite and facilitate the application, survey, engineering and make-ready construction process, including the process of replacing poles, which will benefit Ziply in furtherance of its effort to expand its footprint in Montana,” A NorthWestern email to Ziply said. “NorthWestern is willing to expedite and facilitate Ziply’s attachment requests pursuant to the following enumerated process.”
Ziply was expected to pay between $19.75 and $25.50 per pole for the attachments. NorthWestern and Ziply negotiated several agreements, court documents said, but those apparently soured. NorthWestern went so far as to say Ziply was putting its employees at risk, Charter employees utilizing NorthWestern poles at risk and homeowners at risk, too.
In one example, NorthWestern employees observed Ziply cables too close to one of their power lines.
“This creates the risk of the two touching, thereby energizing the Ziply line,” court documents stated. “This does not merely create a hazard for communications workers, it creates a hazard for homeowners or tree-trimmers who maintain trees and shrubs on their property.”
Ziply does not have contacts with the state, Ziply spokesperson Ryan Luckin wrote in an email. He added that Ziply is pursuing BEAD funding.
According to reporting from Fierce, a trade publication, the company was looking to add 55,000 new internet connections in 2024. It wasn’t immediately clear how many connections the company has in Montana, though it is still looking to expand. 
NorthWestern also took aim at where Ziply has targeted its operations.
“Ziply does not appear to be extending broadband services to Montana’s smaller communities or rural areas,” the NorthWestern letter to the FCC stated. “It is difficult to imagine the benefit of bringing an additional broadband service provider to the largest communities in Montana outweighs the risk of Ziply’s unsafe operation around NorthWestern’s electric facilities.”
In a response to the Daily Montanan, Ziply said it’s hoping to work with the energy company moving forward.
“The letter from NWE was submitted as part of the process the FCC runs when they review M&A transactions,” Luckin wrote in an email. “We’re excited to have that transaction closed and are working with NW Energy as we continue to bring our fiber network to communities across Montana, including Great Falls, Butte, Helena, and Billings.”

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)With Washington state’s primary in the books, the focus shifts to the November general election for nine Democratic state lawmakers seeking to keep seats to which they were appointed.
Each of them won Aug. 5, some more easily than others, in results certified Wednesday by the secretary of state’s office.
In the closest primary contest, Democratic state Sen. Deb Krishnadasan beat Republican state Rep. Michelle Caldier by 1,158 votes in the 26th Legislative District that spans parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties. It is expected to be tight when they face off again this fall.
Krishnadasan trailed Caldier on election night. She moved in front on the second day of ballot counting and stayed there. Republicans view this race as their best opportunity to gain a seat in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 30-19 edge.
In another high-profile match-up, Democratic Sen. Victoria Hunt finished comfortably ahead of Republican Chad Magendanz, a former state lawmaker, in the 5th District in east King County. As the only two candidates, they will line up against each other again in a few weeks.
In the 48th District, two Democratic candidates — Sen. Vandana Slatter and Rep. Amy Walen — are advancing. Slatter sent a strong message by garnering nearly 60% of the vote in the district encompassing Redmond, Bellevue and Kirkland.
Democratic Rep. Edwin Obras and fellow Democrat Kevin Schilling, the mayor of Burien, advanced in the 33rd District in south King County. Obras won with 47% followed by Schilling with 31%. Republican Darryl Jones finished with nearly 22%.
Walen and Schilling are each considered the more moderate candidates in those two contests.
In the 41st District, Democratic Rep. Janice Zahn and Republican John Whitney will square off in November. Zahn is heavily favored after capturing 64% of the vote to Whitney’s 28%. This district includes Mercer Island and Newcastle, along with parts of Bellevue, Renton, Issaquah, and Sammamish.
In the 48th District, Democratic Rep. Osman Salahuddin garnered 63% to finish ahead of Republican Dennis Ellis, who had nearly 29%. Democrat Ranga Bondada was a distant third.
Three appointed legislators — state Sens. Tina Orwall of Des Moines and Emily Alvarado of Seattle, and Rep. Brianna Thomas of West Seattle — were unopposed but will still appear on ballots in November. Orwall serves in the 33rd District. Alvarado and Thomas represent the 34th District in Seattle.
Ballots for the Nov. 4 general election will be mailed to voters by Oct. 17.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/primary-2025-krishnadasan-caldier-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota Public Broadcasting Executive Director Julie Overgaard announced Thursday that the organization plans to lay off 15 employees and eliminate two locally produced shows due to a loss of federal funding. 
SDPB depended on $2.2 million in annual funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which was about 20% of SDPB’s budget. Congress and President Donald Trump rescinded $1.1 billion in previously approved nationwide funding for the corporation earlier this summer, causing the corporation to announce it will cease operations.
State funds account for a little more than half of SDPB’s budget, while fundraising, private donations and other sources make up the rest.
Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

The cuts will eliminate two in-depth public affairs journalism programs, “South Dakota Focus” on television and “In The Moment” on the radio. The cuts will also eliminate education resources provided by SDPB and reduce the output of the magazine-style TV program “Dakota Life.”
“South Dakota Focus” Producer and Host Jackie Hendry will be repositioned, Overgaard confirmed in response to a South Dakota Searchlight question. “In The Moment” Host Lori Walsh’s position is on the chopping block along with her show. 
Overgaard has been in contact with U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson’s office as well as U.S. Sens. Mike Rounds and John Thune, who are all Republicans and all voted in favor of rescinding the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s funding.
“They’re sorry,” Overgaard said. “But they’re not going to be our champions on the Hill.”
Johnson, who said he donates to the Friends of South Dakota Public Broadcasting, told South Dakota reporters Wednesday at Dakotafest in Mitchell that SDPB “does a really impressive job.”
He supported the recission because he doesn’t believe taxpayers should pay for some of the public broadcasting content he doesn’t agree with in other states, he said. He also spoke of federal budgetary concerns, saying “at some point, when you’re $2 trillion upside down, you do actually have to start tightening the belt.”
SDPB provides non-commercial public radio and television across South Dakota. In addition to news coverage, the organization provides live video and audio feeds of legislative and state government meetings, educational content, cultural programming, high school activities broadcasts, and emergency alerts.
SDPB will continue to deliver content from National Public Radio and the national Public Broadcasting Service. Broadcasts of high school sports and activities, which are among SDPB’s most popular offerings, will also continue.

Overgaard said the layoffs and cuts weren’t based on analytics.
“It was based on not endangering our state funding right now,” she said.
Last winter, the organization fought off a reduction in state funding proposed by then-Gov. Kristi Noem. State Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, invoked that effort Thursday in a news release while also saying South Dakota’s members of Congress “have forgotten who they serve.”
“This past session, state legislators on both sides of the aisle agreed: SDPB is necessary for the good of our state,” Muckey said. “These cuts were 100% preventable, and if there is any reduction of SDPB programming that South Dakotans know and love, you know who to blame: Sen. Thune, Sen. Rounds, and Rep. Johnson.”
In addition to the 15 layoffs, four open positions will remain unfilled. The layoffs represent about a 25% decrease in SDPB’s current workforce. Overgaard warned of the reduction last month, saying she would make the details public after they were finalized.
The affected employees will remain in their positions until the end of October. Overgaard said some positions could be retained if more funding is secured.
Friends of SDPB, the nonprofit that raises money for the organization, has raised $1.1 million since the potential layoffs were announced. The organization will continue to fundraise through October for the effort to avoid cuts.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_7138-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

(Photo: Anna Liz Nichols)State Rep. Donni Steele (R-Orion Township) is looking to shift to the state Senate in 2026, filing paperwork earlier this week to run in the newly redrawn 23rd Senate District. 
Steele is serving her second term in the House after eking out single-digit victories in both the 2022 and 2024 elections. She represents the 54th House District, which includes Bloomfield Hills, Orion Township, a portion of Auburn Hills and portions of Bloomfield Township and Oakland Township.
Steele was considered a rising star for House Republicans heading into 2024, but has broken from her party on some occasions. She was one of the only legislative Republicans to condemn state Rep. Josh Schriver (R-Oxford) for his social media posts supporting the white supremacist “Great Replacement” conspiracy theory. She also voted in favor of legislation instituting safe storage requirements for firearms, prompting a recall effort which was ultimately rejected.

Steele told the Michigan Advance that the Senate offers more autonomy and an opportunity to serve a larger group of people than the House, and she’s ready for that challenge. 
While the current 23rd Senate District is held by Sen. Jim Runestad (D-White Lake), Steele said she views the new 23rd District as Sen. Ruth Johnson’s (R-Holly) district with Runestad’s number, as the new district encompasses parts of northern Oakland County and Lapeer County, although Johnson’s 24th Senate District also included parts of Macomb County. 
“I used to be a realtor and the area in which I mostly sold was North Oakland County. And so for me, that is just like my backyard,” Steele said.
With both Runestad and Johnson at the end of their 12-year legislative term limits, Steele said she thought she would leap while the opportunity is there. 
In making the move to the Senate, Steele said she would like to focus on funding for neighborhood roads in northern Oakland County, which she said have been neglected. She also mentioned advocating for an expansion to the Poly Ann Trail as a smaller project.
With Steele aiming to make the leap to the state Senate, the 54th House District will likely serve as a key target for Michigan Democrats, continuing a trend from the previous cycle.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-25-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

The increasingly digital world -- in which people and businesses are constantly searching the Internet, turning to AI for help, or storing information in the cloud -- has led to a growing need for data centers to support online activity.
The post Tax change lifts plans for “hyperscale” data center campus in Westfield appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","Developers in the coming months could break ground on a western Massachusetts data center campus where investments could total $4 billion, a project buoyed by a new state tax incentive.
But as officials iron out regulatory frameworks, some advocates urged the state on Thursday to strengthen environmental protections surrounding the facilities.
A 2024 economic development law included a sales and use tax exemption for qualified data centers, which applies to equipment, software, electricity usage, and construction costs tied to the building, renovation or refurbishment of the facilities.
That financial relief was critical to advancing Servistar Realties’ vision to establish a data center campus in Westfield, said Jeff Daley, CEO of Westmass Area Development Corporation. Servistar is currently courting hyperscale developers, companies like Microsoft and Google, interested in setting up shop on the campus.
The increasingly digital world — in which people and businesses are constantly searching the Internet, turning to AI for help, or storing information in the cloud — has led to a growing need for data centers to support online activity.
Daley, who estimates pre-development work could start in the “next six months or so,” said the 2024 law “really put a new focus on the realization that a hyperscale center could come to Massachusetts, particularly the Westfield site.” Daley said pre-development work involves “finishing permitting, putting together bids, power agreements etc.”
“Once a tenant is identified then we start finishing pre development work which will position for construction to begin, likely in the next 12 months,” Daley said.
Local officials approved the data center campus proposal in 2021. Project leaders were drawn to Westfield due to an Eversource transmission interconnect and a new substation improving reliability in the region, fiber infrastructure, airport location access and “very attractive” energy costs through ISO New England, according to minutes from a joint public hearing of the Westfield City Council and Planning Board.
“The final leg of the stool was to get this sales tax exemption passed, number one, to be competitive with the rest of the country, but also really to encourage these end-users and these developers to come in and take this development seriously,” Daley said.
Thirty-two states offer subsidies for data centers, according to Pluribus News. Connecticut passed a law in 2021 to offer incentives for data centers, though the Middletown Press reported last year that only Cigna so far had taken advantage of the tax exemption.
Massachusetts is currently home to 44 data centers, according to The Boston Globe.
In Westfield, 10 to 14 buildings could be built on the roughly 120-acre property, which is expected to generate 400 full-time jobs with average salaries topping $100,000, Daley said. The project will also support 1,800 to 2,000 construction jobs over an eight- to 10-year period, he said.
Rep. Mike Finn, who sponsored the tax exemption in the economic development law, said the measure was designed to deliver a new opportunity for western Massachusetts. Invoking the loss of jobs from regional powerhouses like Smith & Wesson, Lego and MassMutual, Finn said his district is “economically challenged.”
Finn said he worked with Daley to “think outside the box” and seize on the potential of emerging technology and AI. Battery storage companies are likely to follow the launch of data centers, the West Springfield Democrat said.
“We’re doing our best to get this initial player to come to western Mass.,” Finn said. “That would be a really big boon for our area.”
The Executive Office of Economic Development held a public hearing Thursday on proposed regulations for data center owners and operators to apply for certification in order to secure the sales tax exemption.
Data centers must be at least 100,000 square feet; incur at least $50 million in costs for construction, refurbishment, renovation or improvement within a 10-year period from the certification taking effect; maintain a minimum of 100 jobs; and be “used to house computer information technology equipment, networking, data processing or data storage,” including servers and routers, according to the regulations. 
In certification applications, owners and operators may be asked to share estimates of peak electric demand, written confirmation from utilities that the existing grid infrastructure can accommodate the data center, and any commitments to use clean energy or offset greenhouse gas emissions. Certification would last 20 years.
The Westfield site involves a $2.5 billion to $4 billion investment, including $500 million to $750 million in computer costs, Daley said.
“With a sales tax of six and a quarter, that number gets pretty large every year, and these data centers refurbish this equipment every three to five years,” Daley said. “This certainly helps offset that additional cost.”
Building a data center is “cost-intensive,” as Finn put it. 
Only two advocates spoke at the hearing, warning the proposals lack sufficient environmental safeguards.
Dominique Agnew, an attorney at the Conservation Law Foundation, asked the state to consider additional provisions that “prioritize energy efficiency, public protection, decreased resource usage and workforce development.”
“This proposed regulation makes no mention of efficiency measures or climate-related disclosures like energy and water usage. Regulations should require robust disclosures and reporting of these and other environmental protection metrics,” Agnew said. “Regulations should also address how the executive office will monitor the data centers’ environmental impacts, such as its water usage, air quality and natural habitat impacts, and electric grid system impacts, as data centers are known for intense energy usage from grid electricity, as well as back-up gas or diesel generators.”
Tristan Thomas, director of policy for the nonprofit Alternatives for Community and Environment, said the proposed regulations should be rejected since they “lack basic safeguards for our environment, public health and our economy.”
“Absent new provisions around renewable energy requirements, demand response, environmental assessments and reporting, water use, air pollution and more, our economic strategies will directly contradict our climate goals and harm public health,” Thomas said.
Highlighting the health risks, Thomas pointed to a 2024 study from Caltech and UC Riverside that found air pollution from AI data centers could cause up to 1,300 premature deaths annually by 2030. Meanwhile, a Good Jobs First study released in April found that at least 10 states had lost more than $100 million annually in tax revenues from data centers.
Thomas urged a “transparent economic analysis” of the total cost of data centers.

You, as I, might wonder how it feels to win a world championship at age 17. That’s what Mississippian Rachel McAlpin did Wednesday winning the 50-meter breaststroke gold medal at the World Junior Swimming Championships in Otopeni, Romania, nearly 6,000 miles from hometown of Brandon.

Rick Cleveland
“It feels really cool, honestly,” young McAlpin replied in a phone call Thursday afternoon. “It truly is a blessing.”
And then McAlpin apologized for sounding hoarse, not because she is sick, but because, as she put it, “I’ve been cheering so hard all day and night for all my Team USA teammates.”
One of those teammates is Charlotte Crush of Louisville, Kentucky, the 17-year-old daughter of Mimi Bowen, formerly a highly competitive swimmer for the Jackson Sunkist swim program. Crush Thursday won the 100-meter backstroke gold medal. Said McAlpin, “We’ve become really good friends. Charlotte is an incredible swimmer and person.”
McAlpin is fairly incredible herself. You, as I, might want to know more about Mississippi’s new swimming world champion. Here’s a short dossier: Rachel McAlpin, who is home-schooled, has swam competitively since the age of 5 and regularly swims for the Flowood-based Mississippi Makos. She has committed to swim collegiately for the University of Arkansas, beginning in the fall of 2026. She is the middle of Chris and Christie McAlpin’s three daughters. Rachel is deeply religious, soft-spoken and exceedingly polite, which belies a fierce competitiveness. As a swimmer, she is known as a strong finisher.

Rachel McAlpin
McAlpin fell behind early in her championship race Wednesday but then rallied as she typically does and touched .34 seconds ahead of 18-year-old Smilte Plytnykaite of the Republic of Lithuainia. In winning, McAlpin equalled her personal best time of 30.78 seconds.
“I knew I was in pretty good shape in the last 10 meters when I couldn’t see anybody ahead of me,” McAlpin said. “I knew I just needed to hold on and I did.”
No telling how many hours McAlpin has spent training the past decade-plus to prepare for that 30.78 seconds of glory. Competitive swimming can be almost like a full-time job, requiring hours upon hours of rigorous pool time, plus weight room workouts.
“I guess it really is kind of like a job, and you really have to love it, which I do,” she said. “You also have to have great coaching and a strong support group at home, and I have definitely had that.”
McAlpin is probably finished swimming – but not cheering, she says – in the Romania meet, and will now point toward 2026 competition for both the Makos and Team USA. Yes, she says, her dream is to represent the U.S. in the 2028 Summer Olympics at Los Angeles. 
“The Olympics are a goal, but I have a whole lot of swimming and so much work to do before that,” she said.
If nothing else, her victory in Romania establishes her as as a solid threat, if not favorite, to make the U.S. Olympic team.
Meanwhile, her parents have watched, via streaming, at home in Brandon while their middle daugher swam the preliminary heat, the semifinals and, finally, the championship race half a globe away in a country that shares a 384-mile border with Ukraine. With the time difference, they stayed up until 2 a.m. Tuesday to watch the prelims. Said Chris McAlpin, her father, “We were like any parents would be, nervously pacing beforehand and then cheering like crazy during the races. Obviously, we are extremely proud and blessed. It took a minute to sink in but it has: Our daughter is a world champion.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/21141636/Rachel-McAlpin-1.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188
,Mississippi Today,2025-08-21 22:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Percentage of Mississippi students scoring ‘advanced’ or ‘proficient’ falls for first time since pandemic,Devna Bose,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/08/21/mississippi-test-scores-drop-public-schools/,"Mississippi public schools, with the exception of the start of the pandemic, had seen steady increases in student proficiency.","The percentage of Mississippi students making high scores on state tests declined in all four content areas, the latest results reveal. 
It’s the first time those numbers have seen a meaningful drop in years, aside from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Paula Vanderford, chief accountability officer for the state education department, conceded the downturn was “unusual for Mississippi” at Thursday’s state board of education meeting.
“With the exception of COVID, we’ve seen steady increases in our overall proficiency,” she said. “So the results this year have given us the need to take a deeper dive into what the results really mean.”
All four end-of-course assessments — Algebra I, English II, U.S. history and biology — saw similar or slightly higher pass rates compared to last year. 
Results were less straightforward for the four subject areas overall. Passing scores went up slightly overall for English-Language Arts and U.S. history, and they fell slightly for mathematics and science. 
However, the percentage of students scoring proficient and advanced during the 2024-2025 school year across the four subject areas fell a couple of points across the board. 
The smallest decline was in English — students fell just a fraction, from 47.8% last year to 47.4% — while the largest drop was in science, going from 63.4% to 60.9%.
“The data is not a warning yet,” said board chair Matt Miller. “It’s a reminder. If it happens next year, we’re sliding into a warning situation.”

Vanderford also cautioned board members from becoming too concerned just yet.
She encouraged them to wait to see the results of the National Assessment of Education Progress tests, which reveals how Mississippi ranks against other states, and compare those results to these statewide assessments, the Mississippi Academic Assessment Program. 
Results from the third-grade literacy test were a little more promising. Those scores went up marginally, from a 75.7% pass rate to 77.3%. 
The Literacy-Based Promotion Act, passed by the state Legislature in 2013, made passing the test a requirement to graduate to the fourth grade. The act has led to higher standards in literacy education in Mississippi, which experts say has largely contributed to the state’s big reading gains, coined “The Mississippi Miracle” by national media. 
Still, Miller acknowledged that the state department of education could be in a precarious situation if it loses momentum.
“The Mississippi Miracle, that’s now in the past,” he said at the meeting. “It’s now the marathon. What can we do to move it to the next level? We can’t rest.”
Board members and top education officials stressed that the agency must turn its focus to pushing students to perform at a “proficient” level on the assessments, instead of just “passing.” 
The state’s new accountability model, which is still being finalized, puts a “greater emphasis on proficiency,” State Superintendent Lance Evans said in a statement. MAAP results are a big part of the state’s accountability grades, which will be released at next month’s board meeting. 
In order to improve scores moving forward, the agency is implementing a number of initiatives. These include increasing the number of literacy and math coaches at schools across the state, encouraging districts to use “high-quality instructional materials,” ensuring administrators know how important it is to implement curriculum based on science of reading research and training teachers in the science of reading. 
Additionally, the agency will be seeking funds from the Legislature this session for literacy and math initiatives, which Evans has already discussed with House Speaker Jason White. 
But none of these programs will make a difference if districts don’t accept the support offered by the state education department, Evans said at the meeting.
“There are some districts that refused literacy coaches last year and some of them fell tremendously,” he said. “I called them and asked, ‘Are you sure this is what you want to do?’ And they said, ‘Yes.’ You see what happened.”
Several public school districts were recognized for their high scores in three to four subject areas, including Long Beach, Ocean Springs, Clinton, Enterprise, Oxford, Pass Christian and Union County.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/28110337/3X0A9506.jpg,,,2025-08-21 18:56:43.674188

“Our kids have needs that we have to meet, and every dollar we can save on our taxes means another dollar we can invest in our family to help our children,” she said in the ad.
Nunn said he met Curry when she testified before the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee in 2024, when the GOP-led panel held a hearing at the Iowa State Fair with Iowans who spoke largely in favor of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The ad was filmed at the 2025 Iowa State Fair, where Nunn said he reconnected with the Curry family.
“When the Curry family received their tax cut back in 2017, they invested it in their family and community,” Nunn said in a statement. “For them, it meant a new water heater on the family farm and vital speech therapy for their son, Isaac, who has autism. That’s what real investment looks like — supporting an Iowa family while strengthening Main Street businesses right here in our communities.”
But Democratic organizers say the ad does not disclose crucial information about Curry. Curry works as the research director for Iowans for Tax Relief, an organization that advocates for tax cuts. The organization has an affiliated Political Action Committee that contributed $14,000 to Nunn’s state legislative campaigns between 2014 and 2020, according to data from the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board.
Curry also lives in Glenwood — a city in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, represented by U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra — and is not a direct constituent of Nunn.
“Zach Nunn couldn’t find anyone in Iowa’s 3rd district to defend the Big, Ugly Law, so he found a paid political operative from an organization that’s given Nunn’s campaigns thousands of dollars to lie about his bill,” Katie Smith, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said in a news release. “Iowans see through Nunn’s lies and will hold him accountable for voting to raise Iowans’ costs so he can give tax breaks to billionaires.”
The ad featuring Curry is the first in a series that will run on digital and social media platforms featuring Iowans talking about benefits they will see through the budget reconciliation law. In addition to discussing the Child Tax Credit, future ads will feature Iowans discussing the removal federal tax on tips and overtime pay, small business tax relief and investments for farmers and rural communities, according to a news release.
The ad campaign comes as Democrats have organized around the GOP-led budget reconciliation law ahead of the 2026 election cycle, highlighting the cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. Three Democrats, former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst, state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-Des Moines, and Xavier Carrigan of Waukee have announced campaigns to run against Nunn in the upcoming midterm election.
Ads target Nunn, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks
As Nunn launches a campaign touting the “big, beautiful” law, the nonprofit “Unrig Our Economy” highlighted their ad campaigns targeting Nunn and U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks for voting to support the law.
Nunn and Miller-Meeks both represent districts political forecasters say will likely be among the nation’s most competitive in 2026.
The organization released an ad in July criticizing Nunn for voting to cut programs such as Medicaid and SNAP to “give billionaires a giant new tax break.” In August, the group published an ad featuring a social worker who said the 1st District representative has “chosen to take care of the billionaires at the expense of the kids I work with.”
Unrig Our Economy Campaign Director Leor Tal said in a statement Thursday that although Nunn and Miller-Meeks have both stated they support preserving Medicaid, the budget reconciliation law will result in cuts. The work requirements and restrictions on state-levied taxes on health care providers are expected to result in cuts of more than $1 trillion from Medicaid, according to a report from the Congressional Budget Office.
“Iowa Republicans’ move to fast track these Medicaid cuts reveals the truth – their tax law was never about ‘preserving Medicaid’ but all about giving handouts to their billionaire buddies by leaving millions without the health care they rely on,” Tal said.
The organization is also targeting Miller-Meeks in a billboard campaign ad, calling for the Iowa Republican to vote in favor of releasing files related to the late financier and sexual predator Jeffrey Epstein. The billboard features a picture of Epstein and President Donald Trump.
The billboard campaigns call for Miller-Meeks, as well as Republican Reps. Rob Bresnahan and Tom Kean Jr. of New Jersey, to support legislation related to the public release of government files on Epstein.
“Congressman Bresnahan, Congresswoman Miller-Meeks, and Congressman Kean Jr. have already sold out working-class families by voting to leave millions of Americans without health care to help billionaires,” Tal said in a statement earlier in August. “Now they are refusing to go after billionaires and predators that endangered American children. It is another example of Republicans in Congress always putting the rich and well connected over the working-class people that power our country.”

(Arielle Zionts | KFF Health NewsEKALAKA — There was no doctor on-site when a patient arrived in early June at the emergency room in the small hospital at the intersection of two dirt roads in this town of 400 residents.
There never is.
Dahl Memorial’s three-bed emergency department — a two-hour drive from the closest hospital with more advanced services — instead depends on physician assistants and nurse practitioners.
Physician assistant Carla Dowdy realized the patient needed treatment beyond what the ER could provide, even if it had had a doctor. So, she made a call for a medical plane to fly the patient to treatment at Montana’s most advanced hospital. Dowdy also called out medications and doses needed to stabilize the patient as a paramedic and nurses administered the drugs, inserted IV lines, and measured vital signs.
Emergency medicine researchers and providers believe ERs, especially in rural areas, increasingly operate with few or no physicians amid a nationwide shortage of doctors.
A recent study found that in 2022, at least 7.4% of emergency departments across the U.S. did not have an attending physician on-site 24/7. Like Dahl Memorial, more than 90% were in low-volume or critical access hospitals — a federal designation for small, rural hospitals.
The results come from the 82% of hospitals that responded to a survey sent to all emergency departments in the country, except those operated by the federal government. The study is the first of its kind so there isn’t proof that such staffing arrangements are increasing, said Carlos Camargo, the lead author and a professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School. But Camargo and other experts suspect ERs running without doctors present are becoming more common.

Placing ERs in the hands of nondoctors isn’t without controversy. Some doctors and their professional associations say physicians’ extensive training leads to better care, and that some hospitals are just trying to save money by not employing them.
The American Medical Association, open to all medical students and physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians both support state and federal laws or regulations that would require ERs to staff a doctor around the clock. Indiana, Virginia, and South Carolina recently passed such legislation.
Rural ERs may see fewer patients, but they still treat serious cases, said Alison Haddock, president of ACEP.
“It’s important that folks in those areas have equal access to high-quality emergency care to the greatest extent possible,” Haddock said.
Other health care providers and organizations say advanced-practice providers with the right experience and support are capable of overseeing ERs. And they say mandating that a physician be on-site could drive some rural hospitals to close because they can’t afford or recruit enough — or any — doctors.
“In an environment, especially a rural environment, if you have an experienced PA who knows what they know, and knows the boundaries of their knowledge and when to involve consultants, it works well,” said Paul Amiott, a board member of the Society of Emergency Medicine PAs.
“I’m not practicing independently” despite working 12-hour night shifts without physicians on-site at critical access hospitals in three states, he said.
Amiott said he calls specialists for consultation often and about once a month asks the physician covering the day shift at his hospital to come help him with more challenging cases such as emergency childbirth and complicated trauma. Amiott said this isn’t unique to PAs — ER doctors seek similar consultations and backup.
The proportion of ERs without an attending physician always on-site varies wildly by state. The 2022 survey found that 15 states — including substantially rural ones, such as New Mexico, Nevada, and West Virginia — had no such emergency departments.
But in the Dakotas, more than half of emergency departments were running without 24/7 attending physician staffing. In Montana it was 46%, the third-highest rate.
None of those three states have a program to train physicians as ER specialists. Neither does Wyoming or Idaho.
But Sanford Health, which bills itself as “the largest rural health system in the United States,” is launching an emergency medicine residency in the region. The Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based program is intended to boost the ranks of rural emergency doctors in those states, the residency director said in a news release.
Leon Adelman is an emergency medicine physician in Gillette, Wyoming, which, at around 33,800 residents, is the largest city in the state’s northeast. Working in such a rural area has given him nuanced views on whether states should require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs.
Adelman said he supports such laws only where it’s feasible, like in Virginia. He said the state’s emergency physicians’ organization pushed for the law only after doing research that made it confident that the requirement wouldn’t shutter any rural hospitals.
Camargo said some doctors say that if lawmakers are going to require 24/7 on-site physician coverage in ERs, they need to pay to help hospitals implement it.
Adelman said when instituting staffing requirements isn’t possible, states should create other regulations. For example, he said, lawmakers should make sure hospitals not hiring physicians aren’t refraining just to save money.
He pointed to Vermont, where a report recommended that several of the state’s hospitals cut physicians from their ERs. The report was part of a mandated process to improve the state’s troubled health care system.
Adelman said states should also require PAs and NPs without on-site physician supervision to have extensive emergency experience and the ability to consult with remote physicians.
Some doctors have pointed to a case in which a 19-year-old woman died after being misdiagnosed by an NP who was certified in family medicine, not emergency care, and working alone at an Oklahoma ER. Few NPs have emergency certification, an analysis found.
 
The Society of Emergency Medicine PAs outlines training and experience PAs should have before practicing in rural areas or without on-site doctors.
Haddock said emergency physicians have seen cases of hospitals hiring inexperienced advanced-practice providers. She said ACEP is asking the federal government to require critical access and rural emergency hospitals to have physicians on-site or on call day and night.
Haddock said ACEP wouldn’t want such a requirement to close any hospital and noted that the organization has various efforts to keep rural hospitals staffed and funded.
Dahl Memorial Hospital has strict hiring requirements and robust oversight, said Dowdy, who previously worked for 14 years in high-volume, urban emergency rooms.
She said ER staffers can call physicians when they have questions and that a doctor who lives on the other side of Montana reviews all their patient treatment notes. The ER is working on getting virtual reality glasses that will let remote physicians help by seeing what the providers in Ekalaka see, Dowdy said.
She said patient numbers in the Ekalaka ER vary but average one or two a day, which isn’t enough for staff to maintain their knowledge and skills. To supplement those real-life cases, providers visit simulation labs, do monthly mock scenarios, and review advanced skills, such as using an ultrasound to help guide breathing tubes into patient airways.
Dowdy said Dahl Memorial hasn’t had a physician in at least 30 years, but CEO Darrell Messersmith said he would hire one if a doctor lived in the area. Messersmith said there’s a benefit to having advanced-practice providers with connections to the region and who stay at the hospital for several years. Other rural hospitals, he noted, may have physicians either as permanent staff who leave after a few years or contract workers who fly in for a few weeks at a time.
People eating at Ekalaka’s sole breakfast spot and attending appointments at the hospital’s clinic all told KFF Health News that they’ve been happy with the care they have received from Dowdy and her co-workers.
Ben Bruski had to visit the ER after a cow on his family ranch kicked a gate, smashing it against his hand. And he knows other people who’ve been treated for more serious problems.
“We’ve got to have this facility here because this facility saves a lot of lives,” Bruski said.
